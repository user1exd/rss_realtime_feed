        "content": "WhatsApp , the globally recognized messaging app, is reportedly working on a new facility that will enable users to personalize their chat themes and accent colors. This feature is currently being fine-tuned in the WhatsApp beta for iOS 24.11.10.70 version. It will provide users with the option to customize their chat bubble colors as well as wallpapers, moving away from the company's traditional green theme that has been a constant since its inception. Four additional chat themes coming to WhatsApp According to a report from WABetaInfo , WhatsApp plans to introduce four additional chat theme options in an upcoming update. This new feature was discovered during the TestFlight beta program and is currently under development. Users will be able to choose from five themes - the default green, as well as blue, gray, red, and purple. The selection of a new chat theme will automatically adjust the user's wallpaper and bubble color, to align with the chosen theme's color palette. WhatsApp to enable accent color customization In addition to chat themes, WhatsApp is also developing a facility that will allow iOS users to modify the app's accent color. This customization will impact the look of in-app buttons and will be restricted to the same color choices as the chat themes. Another feature spotted in a recent beta update for Android version 2.24.11.17 is an AI image generator for profile pictures, which creates personalized images based on user-provided text prompts.",

        "content": "Astronomers have made a groundbreaking discovery, finding strong evidence of a vast ocean of liquid water hidden beneath the icy surface of Pluto. The research, published in the scientific journal Icarus , offers new insights into the composition of this distant celestial body. The study was led by Alex Nguyen, a graduate student in Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. Unraveling Pluto's subsurface ocean using NASA's images Nguyen's team employed mathematical models and images from NASA 's New Horizons spacecraft to investigate Pluto's subsurface ocean. The study, co-authored by Patrick McGovern of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, sheds light on a long-standing debate about the existence of liquid water on Pluto. This research marks a significant step forward in understanding the dwarf planet's composition. Pluto's hidden ocean: A closer look Nguyen and McGovern further explored the properties of Pluto's hidden ocean. They created mathematical models to explain the cracks and bulges in the ice covering the Sputnik Platina Basin. This massive basin, formed by a meteor impact billions of years ago, suggests an ocean below. Their models indicate this ocean is shielded by a 40-to-80-kilometer-thick shell of water ice. Estimating the density of Pluto's hidden ocean By analyzing surface fractures, the researchers were able to estimate the ocean's potential density or salinity. According to Nguyen, they determined a zone similar to Goldilocks, where the density and shell thickness find an optimal equilibrium. The findings suggest that Pluto's ocean is about 8% denser than Earth's seawater, comparable to Utah's Great Salt Lake. If humans could somehow reach Pluto's ocean, they would effortlessly float. Facts about Pluto Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was initially hailed as the ninth planet in our solar system. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified it as a dwarf planet. Pluto traverses its orbit around the Sun at an average distance of 5.9 billion kilometers, requiring roughly 248 Earth years to complete a single revolution. Measuring approximately 2,372 kilometers in diameter, it is smaller than Earth's moon.",

        "content": "West Indies and USA will co-host the 2024 edition of the ICC T20 World Cup . The ninth edition of the global tournament will get underway on June 1. 20 teams will feature in the competition. Meanwhile, England will enter as defending champions, having tasted glory in 2022. Here we present the notable records from the 2022 edition, which took place in Australia. Kohli becomes the highest run-getter in T20 WC history Indian ace Virat Kohli displaced Mahela Jayawardene (1,016) as the highest run-scorer in T20 WC history. The former now has 1,141 runs in 27 games at an average of 81.50. Kohli also became the first batter to score 250+ runs in a T20 WC edition thrice (2014, 2016, and 2022). The tournament also saw Kohli become the first player to complete 4,000 T20I runs. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan's stellar partnership record During the New Zealand vs Pakistan semi-final, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan became the first pair to record three century partnerships in T20 WCs. While the duo added 105 runs against the Black Caps, they recorded scores of 152* and 113 against India and Namibia in 2021, respectively. Their tally of 636 runs is also the highest for any pair in the tournament's history. Two hat-tricks in the tournament UAE's Karthik Meiyappan became the first associate-team bowler to scalp a hat-trick in T20 WC, against Sri Lanka. Ireland pacer Joshua Little was the other bowler with a hat-trick in the tournament, against NZ. Little's feat made Ireland the only team to have two bowlers with T20 WC hat-tricks. Curtis Campher took four wickets off as many balls against Netherlands in 2021. Player of the Tournament - Sam Curran England's Sam Curran was named both the Player of the Match in the final and the Player of the Tournament. He recorded 3/12 against Pakistan in the summit clash. Overall, the left-arm pacer finished as the joint-second-highest wicket-taker with 13 wickets in six games. Curran, who conceded runs at 6.41, was the only bowler to claim a five-fer in the tournament, 5/10 vs Afghanistan﻿. Most runs - Virat Kohli Kohli finished the tournament as the highest run-scorer, having scored 296 runs. While his average was just under 100, he struck at 136.41 in the competition. Kohli's tally of four fifties was also the highest in the competition. Netherlands' Max O'Dowd (242), India's Suryakumar Yadav (239), England's Jos Buttler (225), and Sri Lanka 's Kusal Mendis (223) were the others with 220-plus runs. Most wickets - Wanindu Hasaranga Wanindu Hasaranga once again finished the tournament as the highest wicket-taker, having scalped 15 wickets in eight games. While the Sri Lankan leg-spinner conceded runs at a paltry rate of 6.41, his strike rate was 12.4. Curran and Netherlands's Bas de Leede were the joint-second-highest wicket-takers with 13 scalps apiece. Zimbabwe's Blessing Muzarabani is next on the list with 12 scalps. Here are the other notable records Kohli became the first player to score 300 runs against a team in T20 WC, 308 vs Pakistan. Rohit Sharma became the most capped player in T20 WC, having played 39 games. Ireland's Campher became the first all-rounder with a fifty and hat-trick in T20 WCs. Scotaland's Michael Jones recorded the highest score by an Associate player in T20 WCs, 86 versus Ireland. Two centurions in the competition SA's Rilee Rossouw was the first centurion of the competition. He mustered 109 off 56 balls against Bangladesh. The only other century that year came from NZ's Glenn Phillips 's blade. He made 104 off 64 balls against SL. Meanwhile, SA's 205/5 against Bangladesh was the highest team total that year. NZ were the only other side to touch the 200-run mark, 200/3 versus Australia.",

He stated that if users wish to backup their messages, they can use their cloud provider and even apply end-to-end encryption for the same. The ongoing public feud between Musk and Meta (WhatsApp's parent company) has been a topic of discussion since Musk took over X in 2022. Musk reignites cage fight challenge amid Meta rivalry The rivalry between Musk and Meta has been escalating, especially after the launch of Meta's Threads app, which directly competes with X. The tension heightened when Musk challenged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight, a proposition that Zuckerberg dismissed as not serious. Recently, however, Musk reignited the cage fight talks on X by stating, \"I'm ready to fight Zuck anywhere, anytime with any rules. LFG!!!\"",

        "content": "The film Hamare Baarah , starring Annu Kapoor , Ashwini Kalsekar, Manoj Joshi , and Parth Samthaan among others, has stirred controversy due to its provocative teasers. The movie's depiction of a specific religion has been met with disapproval from a section of society, allegedly resulting in death threats against the team. In response to these threats, veteran actor Kapoor released a video message urging viewers to watch the film before forming their opinions. Why does this story matter? Initially titled Hum Do Humare Baraah , the film was renamed following a directive from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The drama was first announced in 2022, and since then, it has created an uproar online for its alleged Islamophobia. Makers, including director Kamal Chandra, have claimed that the movie doesn't target any one community but highlights \"the most important and crucial problem of our country,\" population explosion. 'The film advocates women's empowerment...' Kapoor addressed the threats in a video message, emphasizing their seriousness and calling for police protection for the film team. He urged viewers to watch the film before lambasting it, stating, \"The film advocates women's empowerment and talks about the rights of women. First, watch the film and then give your verdict.\" Kapoor clarified that the movie's intention was not to offend any caste or community but to discuss women's empowerment and population boom. Kapoor urges audiences to reserve judgment, engage with story Kapoor revealed people were giving death threats on social media and via calls. \"Please don't abuse, don't give us threats because we are not afraid. I request Maharashtra Police and the Home Ministry to perform their duty and provide protection to every member of the team who's getting death threats. The seasoned actor concluded his message by saying, \"If you try to disrupt the peace, then we will also not sit silently.\" Hamare Baarah will be released on June 7.

        "content": "Fashion and art have long been intertwined, reflecting the cultural zeitgeist and individual creativity. This article explores how to translate iconic art movements into everyday wear, offering a fresh perspective on personal style. By understanding the essence of each movement, you can curate outfits that are not only stylish but also carry a deeper artistic significance. Impressionism in apparel To embody the essence of Impressionism in your wardrobe, choose garments in soft pastels and incorporate lightweight fabrics that feature dappled prints. Envision wearing a chiffon scarf adorned with Monet's water lilies or selecting a dress that showcases an impressionist-inspired floral pattern. Aim to replicate the movement's delicate brushstrokes and nuanced play of light through your clothing selections, embracing the artistry in everyday fashion. Cubist couture To channel Cubism's essence in your wardrobe, select structured garments that feature bold, angular patterns. A jacket with pronounced shoulders or accessories adorned with cube or pyramid motifs can reflect Cubist influences. Additionally, combining different textures in your outfit can mimic the collage techniques prominent in Cubism, offering a modern twist on this art movement's distinctive style. Surrealist statements Surrealism's dream-like quality translates into whimsical accessories and unexpected combinations in fashion. Incorporate Salvador Dali-inspired elements, like melting clocks on a handbag or shoes adorned with optical illusions. This approach adds a surprising element to your outfit, sparking conversations. It's about embracing the surrealists' vision by integrating the extraordinary into everyday wear, making each piece a statement of artistic expression and individuality. Pop art popularity Embrace Pop Art's essence with vibrant colors and bold graphics. Opt for attire featuring comic prints or iconic pop culture imagery, like a Warhol-esque T-shirt. When paired with solid-colored pants, this combination becomes an eye-catching ensemble that pays homage to Pop Art's explosive movement. This approach brings the dynamic visual style of Pop Art into everyday fashion, celebrating this iconic art movement. Minimalist mode For those drawn to Minimalism, focus on monochromatic outfits, clean lines, and simple silhouettes. Quality over quantity is crucial; invest in well-crafted basics that last. This approach reflects the minimalist art movement's emphasis on simplicity and longevity. By choosing pieces that embody these principles, you create a wardrobe that mirrors the timeless elegance of minimalist art.",

        "content": "The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart, Tasmania , is set to publicly debut the \"only\" physical copy of Wu-Tang Clan's album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin . This rare album was secretly recorded between 2006 and 2013 and was previously owned by pharmaceutical entrepreneur Martin Shkreli. It is now on loan from digital art collective Pleasr for Mona's upcoming exhibition Namedropping , which explores status, celebrity, and notoriety. Know more about the group Established in 1992, Wu-Tang Clan stands as a legendary American hip-hop collective. Comprising iconic figures like RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa, alongside the late Ol' Dirty Bastard until 2004, they reshaped the landscape of East Coast hip-hop. Renowned for their influence and innovation, Wu-Tang Clan is hailed as one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time. What makes the album unique? Often referred to as the \"most valuable ever made due to its rarity,\" the album features contributions from all surviving members of the Wu-Tang Clan group and includes two appearances from songstress Cher. It is housed in an ornate silver box and was intended as a statement about the impact of streaming and piracy on the value of music. Producers Cilvaringz and RZA described it as \"400-year-old Renaissance-style approach to music\"—aiming to inspire urgent debates about the future of music. Album cannot be used for commercial purposes until 2103 A single two-CD copy of the album was pressed in 2015, with all digital master files subsequently \"deleted.\" A unique legal agreement stipulates that the album cannot be used for any commercial purpose until 2103 or 88 years after its creation. RZA explained that this number was chosen because there were eight original Wu-Tang Clan members—the numbers of the year 2015 added up to eight, and a rotated eight is the symbol for infinity. Album's journey from Shkreli to Pleasr and Mona Museum In 2015, a 13-minute medley of the album was played at New York's MoMa to about 150 art experts, rap fans, and prospective buyers. Shkreli later attempted to sell the album on eBay where bidding reached $1.2M—but failed to complete a sale. After his conviction for securities fraud in 2018, Shkreli was forced to surrender the album along with other assets totaling $7.4M. In 2021, Pleasr acquired it from the US Department of Justice for $4M to cover Shkreli's debts. Public debut of Wu-Tang Clan's album at Mona Museum Mona will hold free ticketed listening sessions from June 15-24 where attendees can hear a curated 30-minute mix of the album played from a personalized Wu-Tang PlayStation 1 inside Mona's recording studio, Frying Pan. This marks the first time that this unique album has been loaned to a museum since its original sale. \" Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is more than just an album, so... I knew I had to get it into this exhibition,\" said Mona director.",

        "content": "Kaftans, celebrated for their flowing elegance and comfort, have crossed borders to become a global fashion staple. Originating from ancient Mesopotamia, these garments have been embraced by various cultures and continue to evolve in contemporary fashion. This article aims to explore accessorizing kaftans for a chic and personalized look, highlighting their versatility and enduring appeal across different fashion landscapes. The art of accessorizing Accessorizing is crucial for elevating the simple elegance of a kaftan into a statement outfit. The correct selection of accessories can highlight the kaftan's unique features, enhancing its design while adding sophistication. From selecting the right belts to choosing complementary jewelry, each accessory plays an essential role in crafting an ensemble that reflects personal style and elegance. Choose complementary jewelry Jewelry must enhance the kaftan without dominating it. For patterned kaftans, select simple jewelry like delicate chains or stud earrings. Solid-colored kaftans invite bolder choices, such as chunky necklaces or layered bracelets, adding texture and interest. Always consider the kaftan's neckline when selecting neckpieces to ensure the jewelry complements the outfit appropriately, maintaining a balanced and elegant look. Define your waistline Belts can be transformative when paired with kaftans, as they define your waistline and add structure to the garment. Opt for a thin belt in a matching color for a subtle approach. For a bolder statement, choose a wide belt or one adorned with embellishments. It's crucial to balance proportions to maintain an elegant silhouette, ensuring the belt complements rather than overwhelms the kaftan. Footwear matters The choice of footwear significantly influences your outfit's overall vibe. Sandals bring a casual ease, perfect for a laid-back look, while heels can elevate the ensemble, making it suitable for more formal occasions. For those donning longer kaftans, opting for strappy sandals or peep-toe heels is advisable. This choice helps to avoid a cumbersome appearance and maintains an airy, elegant feel throughout. Finishing touches with bags Complete your accessorized kaftan look with the right bag choice. A clutch is perfect for evening affairs, adding elegance, while tote bags fit daytime outings, offering practicality. Consider the texture and color—woven bags introduce rustic charm, and metallic clutches inject glamour. It's vital to ensure your bag complements other accessories for a cohesive and stylish ensemble, maintaining the outfit's overall elegance and personal flair.",

Fortunately, no injuries were reported as everyone present was safely evacuated from the premises. An official from Delhi Fire Services stated that six fire tenders have been pressed into service to douse the flames. 2 days after fire at children's hospital This comes just two days after the fire at a private children's hospital in east Delhi's Vivek Vihar, which led to the death of seven newborns.

        "content": "The Mexican elote bowl is a vibrant, vegetarian dish inspired by traditional elote—grilled corn slathered in mayonnaise, cheese, and spices. This bowl adaptation offers these classic flavors in a hearty, healthy meal for vegetarians. It's an ideal choice for anyone looking to experience the essence of Mexican culture at their dining table. Let's begin cooking this colorful and nutritious meal. Gather the following ingredients For this dish, gather two cups cooked quinoa, four ears fresh corn, one cup rinsed and drained black beans, one sliced large avocado, one cup halved cherry tomatoes, half a cup finely chopped red onion, and a quarter cup chopped fresh cilantro. Dressing requires three tablespoons vegan mayonnaise, two tablespoons lime juice, one teaspoon paprika, and salt to taste. Prepare your ingredients Start by cooking your quinoa according to package instructions; this usually involves rinsing it thoroughly before boiling in water for about 15 minutes until it becomes fluffy. While the quinoa cooks, grill or broil your corn until slightly charred on all sides. Once cool enough to handle, cut the kernels off the cob and set aside. Assemble your elote bowl Begin assembling your elote bowl by placing a base layer of quinoa in individual bowls or a large serving dish. Next, evenly distribute the grilled corn kernels on top of the quinoa. Continue with the black beans, then add slices of avocado and halves of cherry tomatoes on top. Finish by sprinkling finely chopped red onion and fresh cilantro over the entire assembly. Prepare the dressing In a small bowl, whisk vegan mayonnaise and lime juice until smooth. Add paprika, blending for color and flavor, then season with salt to taste. This dressing combines all elements with its creamy, tangy, and spicy profile, perfectly complementing the elote bowl's ingredients. It's designed to bring a harmonious flavor to every bite, making the dish both vibrant and delicious. Final touches Before serving, lavishly drizzle the prepared dressing over each bowl to infuse every bite with flavor. For an extra dimension of taste and texture, adding crumbled vegan cheese or a dash of chili powder as optional garnishes is recommended. These additions not only elevate the dish's flavor but also its visual appeal, ensuring a delightful and comprehensive eating experience with every spoonful.",

        "content": "Milos, a volcanic island in the Cyclades, offers an array of stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters. Unlike its more famous neighbors, Milos retains a laid-back charm and unspoiled landscapes. It's the perfect destination for travelers seeking tranquility and natural beauty. The island's unique geological formations create breathtaking coastal scenery, making it an ideal spot for beach lovers. Sarakiniko Beach: Moon on Earth Sarakiniko Beach is famed for its moon-like landscape, with white volcanic rocks curving around a turquoise bay. This otherworldly scene provides not just a beach day but an experience unlike any other. The smooth, bone-white rocks are perfect for sunbathing or exploring small coves. Early morning or late afternoon visits offer softer light for photography and cooler temperatures for exploring. Kleftiko Caves: Nature's artwork Accessible only by boat, the Kleftiko Caves are a must-visit in Milos. Once a hideout for pirates, these sea caves and rock formations rise majestically from the emerald waters. Swimming or kayaking through the caves reveals hidden beaches and snorkeling spots teeming with marine life. Boat tours often include stories of pirate lore, adding a layer of intrigue to the natural beauty. Firiplaka Beach: A colorful retreat Firiplaka is one of Milos' most picturesque beaches, characterized by its towering cliffs and vibrant turquoise waters contrasted against soft white sands. The beach is partly organized with sunbeds and umbrellas but retains much of its natural charm with unspoiled sections ideal for relaxation. Its shallow waters make it perfect for families or those looking to wade into the Aegean without venturing too deep. Tsigrado Beach: An adventurous escape Tsigrado Beach offers an adventure before you even touch the sand—access involves descending a ladder and rope through a narrow cliff opening. This secluded cove rewards your efforts with crystal-clear waters surrounded by dramatic cliffs. Its remote nature means fewer crowds, providing a peaceful haven for swimming and soaking up the sun in relative solitude, making it a unique escape.",

        "content": "Rome , a city deeply rooted in history, is renowned not only for its ancient ruins and art masterpieces but also as a sanctuary for food enthusiasts. Many travelers, however, arrive with misconceptions regarding what constitutes authentic Roman cuisine. This guide is dedicated to dispelling prevalent culinary myths and directing you toward the true delicacies of Roman culinary tradition. Espresso etiquette in Rome Visitors often think that Italians drink their espresso any time of day. While it's true that coffee is a beloved beverage here, ordering a cappuccino after 11 a.m. might earn you some raised eyebrows. Romans typically enjoy milky coffees in the morning and stick to espresso or caffe normale post-lunch or dinner for its digestive properties. Pizza perceptions The myth that all Italian pizza resembles the thick-crusted American variety couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to Rome. Roman pizza is thin-crust and crispy, almost cracker-like in texture. It's baked quickly at high temperatures, resulting in a light base perfect for simple yet flavorful toppings like tomato, mozzarella, basil (pizza Margherita), or just olive oil and rosemary (pizza bianca). Gelato guidelines Many believe brighter gelato means better flavor. However, in Rome, the reality is different. Authentic gelato prioritizes natural ingredients over artificial colors or flavors. Seek out gelaterias where the gelato has muted colors. This usually means they're made with real fruits and natural ingredients, signaling quality. In Rome, this authenticity in gelato is a true sign of excellence.",

        "content": "Utility wear has evolved beyond gender-specific boundaries, heralding the rise of unisex fashion . This movement signifies a shift toward clothing that emphasizes both function and comfort for everyone, regardless of gender. Through this article, we delve into the emergence of unisex utility wear, highlighting its primary features and offering insights on seamlessly integrating it into your daily routine for improved efficiency. The rise of unisex fashion Unisex clothing has been around for decades, but its mainstream acceptance is recent. This shift, driven by desires for equality and practicality, has led designers to create garments that challenge traditional gender norms. This movement aligns with societal trends toward inclusivity and versatility in fashion, reflecting a significant change in how apparel is viewed and designed. Defining utility wear Utility wear is clothing designed for practicality, featuring multiple pockets, durable fabrics, and adjustable features. It marries form with function, creating garments that serve the wearer's needs without sacrificing style. This fashion is for those who value both efficiency and elegance, proving that clothes can be both functional and fashionable, working as hard as the wearer does. How to style utility pieces Styling unisex utility wear focuses on balance. Combine robust items like cargo pants or a utility vest with simple, basic garments such as plain tees or sweaters. For footwear, choose sneakers or boots that enhance the functional aesthetic. The aim is to achieve effortless efficiency, allowing the utility elements to stand out as the main feature of your outfit. Sustainability meets function Unisex utility wear transcends mere practicality, emerging as a sustainable fashion choice. By prioritizing durable quality over fleeting quantity and versatile design over momentary trends, these garments foster reduced consumption and encourage the cultivation of more deliberate, thoughtful wardrobes. This approach not only benefits your daily efficiency but also significantly contributes to environmental sustainability—a dual victory for personal convenience and global health. Cross-cultural appeal Utility wear's global appeal crosses cultural boundaries with its adaptability and practicality. From Tokyo 's streets to Toronto 's urban landscapes, utility pieces integrate into local styles while maintaining core functionality. This universal appeal shows practical fashion knows no limits, resonating across cultures worldwide. It proves utility wear's versatility and ease of use, making it a truly borderless fashion choice.",

        "content": "Saag paneer is a celebrated vegetarian dish from the Indian subcontinent, known for its creamy texture and rich flavors. It features paneer , fresh cheese, and saag , usually mustard leaves or spinach. This dish is significant in Indian culture, often served during festivals and special occasions. Deeply rooted in tradition, saag paneer is favored for its taste and nutritional benefits. Let's get cooking! Gather the following ingredients To prepare this delightful dish, you will need 250 grams of paneer (cubed), 500 grams of spinach (washed and chopped), two tablespoons of vegetable oil, one large onion (finely chopped), one tablespoon ginger-garlic paste, two green chilies (chopped), one teaspoon cumin seeds, half a teaspoon turmeric powder, one teaspoon coriander powder, half a teaspoon garam masala powder, salt to taste, and one cup water. Preparing the spinach puree Begin by blanching the spinach in boiling water for two minutes to preserve its vibrant green color. Immediately after, transfer it to ice-cold water to stop the cooking process, ensuring nutrients and color are retained. After cooling in cold water for about five minutes, thoroughly drain the spinach. Then, use a blender or food processor to blend it into a smooth puree. Cooking the base gravy Heat oil in a pan over medium flame. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding chopped onions. Saute until golden brown, then mix in ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Cook until the raw smell fades, about three minutes. Finally, stir in turmeric and coriander powder, blending them well into the mixture. Adding spinach puree and paneer Add the spinach puree to the pan with your base gravy and season with salt to taste. Allow this mix to simmer on low heat for 10 minutes, enabling the flavors to blend well. If necessary, incorporate up to one cup of water to adjust the consistency as preferred, ensuring the mixture achieves a smooth and desirable texture. Final touches and serving suggestions Gently add the cubed paneer to the simmering saag mixture, cooking for five minutes. Avoid a vigorous boil to prevent the paneer from hardening. Sprinkle garam masala over the dish before turning off the heat. Carefully mix, ensuring not to break the paneer cubes too much. This step ensures flavors meld without compromising the paneer 's texture.",

        "content": "The 2024 ICC T20 World Cup is set to begin on June 1. Like the recently-concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) season, batters will be looking to cash in during the mega ICC tournament. However, slow and dry pitches in the Caribbean might give them a run for the money. Here are the batters with most fifty-plus scores in a T20 WC edition. Virat Kohli: 14 Virat Kohli holds the record for scoring the most runs in T20 World Cup history. He owns 1,141 runs from 27 games at an incredible average of 81.50. Notably, Kohli remains the only player with more than 10 fifty-plus scores in the tournament. He has recorded 14 such scores as of now. Notably, three of those half-centuries have come in the semi-finals. Chris Gayle: 9 West Indies veteran batter Chris Gayle has nine 50+ scores in the T20 World Cup. Universe Boss Gayle is the only player to have scored multiplte centuries in the tournament (2). His tally also includes seven fifties. Gayle has slammed 965 runs from 33 T20 World Cup games at 34.46. He has a strike-rate of 142.75 in the tournament. Rohit Sharma: 9 Like Gayle, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma owns nine fifty-plus scores in the T20 World Cup. However, he is yet to score a century in this regard. Rohit has scored 963 runs from 39 T20 WC encounters at an average of 34.39. However, his strike-rate of 127.88 is on the lower side. His highest score of 79* came against Australia at Bridgetown in 2010. Mahela Jayawardene: 7 Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene remains the only other batter with more than six fifty-plus scores in the T20 World Cup. He owns seven such scores. The former batter guided Sri Lanka to 21 wins, also tallying a ton. Notably, Jayawardene also starred in Sri Lanka's title-winning run in 2014. Overall, he owns 1,016 runs at 39.07 in the T20 World Cup.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday criticized the opposition's handling of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir . In an interview with news agency ANI , PM Modi claimed that the article was not an issue for the people of Jammu and Kashmir or India, but was manipulated for the benefit of a select few. \"Article 370 was the agenda of only 4-5 families,\" Modi stated, taking a veiled jibe at the opposition. Modi highlights unity post Article 370 abrogation Modi further stated that the removal of Article 370 has fostered a greater sense of unity and belonging among the people of Kashmir. Article 370...was neither the agenda of the people of Kashmir nor the agenda of the people of the country...Today it has become true that after the removal of 370, there is a feeling of more unity. The feeling of belongingness is increasing among the people of Kashmir...its direct result is also visible in elections, tourism,\" he said. Record voter turnouts post Article 370 abrogation According to reports, following the abrogation of Article 370 by Modi's government in August 2019, record voter turnouts were observed in several parliamentary constituencies during the Lok Sabha polls held earlier this month. Srinagar , Baramulla , and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded polling percentages of 38.49%, 59.1%, and 51.35% respectively—the highest rates since 1989. \"When the common man votes there, it is not just to make someone win, voting means that the voter accepts the Constitution of India,\" he said. Modi's statement on voter turnout in Kashmir \"As a result, voting records of 40 years have been broken. It is a matter of greatest satisfaction for me that my brothers and sisters from Kashmir came forward to vote with great enthusiasm,\" PM Modi said. \"By voting, they have given a message to the world and to those who used to have doubts,\" he further said. 'Decision of government always for good cause' The PM added that the decisions of his government were always for a good cause. I would like to pray to the justice system of our country that if...government wants to do any work, they have a...strategy to do that work...Sometimes I had to shut down the internet...Some NGO went to court and it became a big issue in the court...but today the children there proudly say...we have been getting all the facilities for the last 5 years,\" he said.",

        "content": "Edinburgh , the picturesque capital of Scotland , is steeped in history and charm. It's also famously known as the birthplace of the Harry Potter series, where J.K. Rowling penned much of her early work. For fans of the series or those curious about its origins, a tour around Edinburgh's historic Harry Potter landmarks offers a unique and enchanting experience. The birthplace of Harry Potter The Elephant House Cafe claims fame as the spot where J.K. Rowling spent many hours writing over cups of coffee. With views overlooking Edinburgh Castle, it's easy to see where she might have found some of her inspiration for Hogwarts. Visitors can enjoy a warm beverage and soak in the atmosphere that helped birth one of the most beloved book series in history. A real-life Diagon Alley Just a short walk from the cafe is Victoria Street, widely believed to be the inspiration for Diagon Alley. This colorful and winding street is lined with independent shops that could easily belong in the wizarding world. From boutiques selling quirky items to specialty food stores, it's a must-visit for anyone wanting to step into a real-life magical shopping street. Where Tom Riddle rests Greyfairs Kirkyard is not just any cemetery; it serves as the resting place for Thomas Riddell's grave. Fans widely speculate that this inspired the name of Rowling's character, Tom Riddle. A walk through this historic graveyard does more than connect visitors with Edinburgh's ancient past; it also provides a tangible link to one of Harry Potter's most notorious characters, enriching the experience. Hogwarts' inspiration George Heriot's School, with its four distinctive towers and central courtyard, strikingly resembles Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is not open for public tours on a daily basis as it remains an operational school. However, the exterior view still captivates fans and onlookers from a distance, igniting imaginations about the mysteries that lie within its walls, much like the fictional Hogwarts.",

        "content": "Under Rohit Sharma 's leadership, India will fight for their second title in the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup . The Men in Blue have been placed in Group A alongside arch-rivals Pakistan, hosts USA, Ireland, and Canada. Notably, India have been away from the glory since lifting the trophy in the inaugural edition in 2007. Here we decode India's worst T20 WC campaigns. Super 8 ouster in 2009 Defending champions India endured a forgettable campaign in the 2009 edition in England. They comfortably advanced to the Super 8 stage after defeating Ireland and Bangladesh in the league round. However, MS Dhoni's were eliminated after losing all their three Super 8 matches, against South Africa, West Indies, and England. The team would have been gutted as all three games were pretty close. Another terrible show in 2010 India's campaign in the 2010 competition was no better. They again won both their league matches, against South Africa and Afghanistan. The SA game saw Suresh Raina score a stunning hundred. However, Dhoni's men yet again lost all their three Super 8 fixtures. While they couldn't compete much against Australia and hosts West Indies, Sri Lanka beat them in a last-ball thriller. Missed semi-final berth in 2012 India's 2012 T20 WC campaign was an interesting one. The Men in Blue thrashed England and Afghanistan in the league round. They even defeated Pakistan and SA in the Super 8 stage. However, India's only defeat in the competition cost them. Australia severely dented their NRR by chasing down 141 against them in 14.5 overs. India hence missed the semi-final berth. Forgettable campaign in 2021 Virat Kohli 's only T20 WC campaign as a captain was a forgettable one. India's tournament opener saw Pakistan beat them for the first time in a WC match. They further lost their next fixture against New Zealand. The two successive defeats virtually knocked India out as they missed out on a semi-final berth despite beating Afghanistan, Namibia, and Scotland in their remaining league games.",

        "description": "A three-year collaborative research project between US scientists and the University of Cape Town in South Africa has revealed that the rate of plastic degradation is color-dependent.",
        "content": "A three-year collaborative research project between US scientists and the University of Cape Town in South Africa has revealed that the rate of plastic degradation is color-dependent. The study, spearheaded by the University of Leicester , discovered that red, blue, and green plastics become \"very brittle and fragmented\" over time. Conversely, black, white, and silver plastics were found to remain \"largely unaffected.\" Retailers are advised against using brightly colored plastics In light of these findings, retailers are now being encouraged to avoid using brightly colored plastics for everyday items such as drinks bottles, outdoor furniture, and toys. This advice stems from the research conclusion that colored plastics break down into microplastics faster than their less vibrant counterparts. Microplastics have been found in various environments, including human testicles, where they have been potentially linked to declining sperm counts. Research methodology and findings across continents The study involved US researchers placing bottle lids of various colors on a university rooftop for three years to expose them to sun and weather. Simultaneously, scientists in South Africa examined plastic items found on a remote beach. Both studies revealed significant differences in microplastic formation based on the color of the plastic. Dr. Sarah Key, who led the project, found it amazing that samples from a Leicester rooftop and a windy beach in Africa showed similar results. Brightly colored plastics: A concern for short-lived products Key added that even in a relatively cool and cloudy environment for only three years, significant differences can be seen in microplastic formation. This pioneering field study suggests that retailers and manufacturers should reconsider using brightly colored plastics, particularly for short-lived products. The results have been published in the journal Environmental Pollution . Co-author of the study, Professor Sarah Gabbott, shared her curiosity about why microplastics in beach sand frequently exhibit a rainbow of colors. Colored plastics: A barrier to recycling Initially, Gabbott believed she was noticing more colorful microplastics due to their visibility, but she later discovered that brightly colored microplastics are genuinely more common. This is due to red, green, and blue pigmented plastic items being more susceptible to fragmentation into millions of tiny yet colorful microplastic particles. Adam Herriott from Wrap, an anti-waste charity organization explained that colored plastics have traditionally been used to make products stand out. However, Wrap now advises manufacturers to avoid using pigments. Why do colored plastics degrade more quickly? The study unveiled that black, white, and silver pigments provide protection to plastics against detrimental ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV exposure induces structural alterations in plastics, resulting in brittleness and susceptibility to fragmentation. However, these particular pigments serve as effective shields, safeguarding the plastic polymers from UV-induced damage. Consequently, they maintain the structural integrity of plastics, mitigating the adverse effects of UV exposure on their composition and durability.",

        "content": "The Indian government is planning a significant skill upgrade for its professional workforce. This initiative aims to meet the anticipated demand for jobs in developed economies over the next five years. The official projections suggest that 3.58 million job vacancies will be available in 16 countries, including the US, Saudi Arabia , UAE, Canada , and others. These estimates are based on a study done by the National Skill Development Corporation International (NSDCI), under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). Strategy to boost international mobility for Indian workers The NSDCI study, titled 'International Workforce Mobility,' is designed to develop a strategy that enhances international mobility for Indian employees in the target countries. It is estimated that 68% of India's total population is between 15-64 years of age. This large working-age population presents India with a chance to create a high-quality skilled workforce for the world. Professionals are encouraged to register on the MSDE portal, where they will be scrutinized and provided with essential skill upgrade training by NSDC. Government coordination for deployment of skilled professionals Following the skill upgrade, the Indian government will coordinate with various partner countries to facilitate the deployment of the candidates. The skill upgrading process is tailored to refine professionals' skills to meet certain standards and practices of respective countries. For instance, a path lab attendant or an electrician, would need to know about the latest requirements of their prospective country. This strategic approach will ensure that Indian professionals are well-equipped and ready for their roles in foreign job markets. Experts' views on projected job opportunities Despite the government's projections, some experts have expressed reservations. The Vice-Chancellor of Dr B.R. Ambedkar School of Economics University in Bengaluru , N.R. Bhanumurthy, stated, \"These numbers are slightly lower than our expectations.\" He added that Indians are highly sought after in many countries where skilled labor is required, and that demand for the Indian workforce has grown significantly. Projected job openings in various sectors and countries The NSDCI study indicates demand for workforce in healthcare, manufacturing, and IT sectors across Europe , Asia, and Australia . In Gulf nations, job openings are projected in construction, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing. The highest vacancies are projected at one million each in UAE, Saudi Arabia, followed by 390,000 in the US and 320,000 each in Canada and Qatar. Australia should have 54,000 job openings, while Germany is anticipated to have 37,000 openings for Indian workers over next five years.",

        "content": "Lima , the capital of Peru , is a vibrant city that boasts a rich history and a dynamic culinary scene. Known as the gastronomic capital of South America , Lima offers an array of dishes that reflect its diverse culture and heritage. From street food to fine dining, the city's food landscape is as varied as it is delicious. Ceviche: Peru's national dish Ceviche is arguably the most iconic dish in Peru. This refreshing dish consists of fresh ingredients marinated in citrus juices, typically lime, and spiced with chili peppers. It's often accompanied by sides of sweet potato and corn. The acidity from the lime juice \"cooks\" the ingredients without heat, resulting in a light and flavorful dish that perfectly captures the essence of Peruvian cuisine. Lomo saltado: A fusion favorite Lomo Saltado represents the fusion of Peruvian and Chinese culinary traditions. This stir-fry combines marinated strips of soy sauce-seasoned tofu (a vegetarian twist on the traditional beef), onions, tomatoes and peppers served with rice and crispy potatoes. The result is a savory dish that showcases Peru's ability to blend different culinary influences into something uniquely its own. Quinoa salad: Andean superfood Quinoa has been cultivated in the Andes for thousands of years and has gained international recognition for its health benefits. In Lima, you'll find quinoa salad made with this nutritious grain mixed with fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, avocados seasoned with lime juice and herbs. It's not only healthy but also incredibly tasty—a testament to Lima's ability to make even simple ingredients shine. Picarones: Sweet finish Picarones are Peru's answer to doughnuts but made from sweet potato flour mixed with squash flour, which gives them their unique taste. These rings are deep-fried until golden brown then drizzled with chancaca syrup—a sweet concoction made from unrefined sugar cane juice spiced with cinnamon and cloves. Enjoying picarones under Lima's sky makes for an unforgettable dessert experience.",

        "content": "India 's IT sector has been hit by a wave of 'silent' layoffs between 2023 and 2024. The All India IT & ITeS Employees's Union (AIITEU) reports that approximately 20,000 tech professionals lost their jobs in this period. The AIITEU suggests the actual number could be higher but remains unreported. These layoffs have occurred across IT services firms of all sizes. Silent layoff practices and their impact in 2024 Silent layoffs are a common practice among firms, discreetly letting go of employees. The most prevalent method involves giving a worker 30 days to secure a new role within the same firm. If unsuccessful, the employee is asked to leave. In 2024 alone, between 2,000-3,000 employees lost their jobs at top Indian IT services companies, according to Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). Major companies implementing silent layoffs US-based Teradata, a cloud analytics and data platform company, axed around 35-40 employees from its Hyderabad campus at the end of 2023. This followed a global layoff of approximately 1,100 employees in 2022. Boston-based financial services firm State Street took over Atos Syntel's operations here last year, and reportedly let go of around 400-500 employees in March 2024, as part of streamlining operations. Layoffs continue across major IT firms Reports indicate that similar layoffs are occurring across Accenture , Infosys , and Cognizant. In 2024, Infosys reportedly asked nearly 200-500 employees to voluntarily resign. However, both Infosys and Atos Group have denied these allegations of layoffs. Industry experts have labeled this period as one of the highest layoff years post the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Expert insight on the current layoff scenario Yugal Joshi, leader of technology services research at Everest Group, attributes challenging macroeconomic scenarios as a contributing factor to the layoffs . He stated, \"All of them promised to maintain or increase operating margin and for a service company beyond people reduction there are not many credible levers.\" Joshi expressed concern about service providers trimming their smaller-sized clients, as lost clients are rarely regained.",

        "content": "Holland & Barrett, a leading health food chain in the United Kingdom , has come under fire for its new product—a dark chocolate bar that claims to alleviate menopause symptoms. The 75g bar, retailing at £3.79, is marketed as a soothing aid contributing to \"the regulation of hormonal activity.\" It contains vitamin B6, typically found in almonds. However, this product has been met with strong disapproval from menopause campaigner Kate Muir who called it a \"ridiculous money-making product.\" Accusations of exploitation, insensitivity Muir accused Holland & Barrett of exploiting vulnerable women, emphasizing the need for proper medical help from the NHS. She highlighted the alarming increase in suicide rates among perimenopausal women. This sentiment was mirrored on social media , where users dismissed the product as \"insulting\" and \"patronizing profiteering tosh.\" The controversy escalated when it was revealed that these chocolate bars contain a woman's entire daily allowance of saturated fat. Holland & Barrett defends their product In response to the backlash, a spokesperson for Holland & Barrett defended the product—stating that their food range aims to offer functional alternatives to popular snacks. The company emphasized that the chocolate bar and its contents contribute to a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. They described it as a small indulgence with added benefits compared to other bars. They assured customers of guidance from trained advisors in their stores on how vitamins or herbal supplements may aid with menopause symptoms.",

        "content": "Greensboro and Guilford County elected officials are considering whether to approve performance-based incentive packages for what is known as “Project Mercury” for an industrial property in east Greensboro. The county Board of Commissioners appears to be the first to consider the economic-development project with a public hearing set for 5:30 p.m. June 6 in the Old County Courthouse at 301 W. Market St. in Greensboro. The unidentified company behind Project Mercury is requesting up to $373,855 in incentives from the county. It also is making incentive requests from Greensboro City Council and the N.C. Commerce Department, the latter involved because the company is considering locations out of North Carolina. In exchange, the company would commit to a $26.94 million capital investment and 80 jobs, both by Dec. 31, 2028, at 3617 McConnell Road. People are also reading... The prospective Class A industrial building is in McConnell Business Park and is being marketed for lease, along with 3655 McConnell Road, by the Triad office of CBRE. The 3617 McConnell building contains 104,629 square feet. The 3655 McConnell property features 120,368 square feet, while there is a proposed third building under consideration at 140,273 square feet. The site became available as an industrial site in June 2022 when a Cincinnati industrial real-estate firm paid $2.33 million to purchase a combined 35.88 acres. The properties were a 29.8-acre tract at 3635 McConnell Road and a 6.02-acre tract at 3617 McConnell Road. The buyer was McConnell Road Industrial I LLC, an affiliate of Al. Neyer of Cincinnati, which entered the North Carolina market in 2019 with an office in Raleigh. Al. Neyer’s listing of the McConnell property touts neighboring Coca-Cola, Vistar and Walmart facilities. “Central North Carolina has been the epicenter of a string of recent job announcements from major manufacturers, such as Toyota, Boom Supersonic, VinFast and Wolfspeed,” according to the listing. “The companies have unveiled plans to construct advanced manufacturing facilities that will employ more than 13,000 people. “The projects are expected to drive significant ancillary activity among suppliers and support industries, fueling future demand for industrial space across central North Carolina, including Greensboro.” Al. Neyer also lists Buckhorn Industrial Park in Mebane and Haw River Industrial Park in Graham among its other eight N.C. developments. rcraver@wsjournal.com 336-727-7376 @rcraverWSJ Get the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly. {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.",

        "content": "The Jacksonville City Council adopted its Fiscal Year 2025 budget last Tuesday evening, and here’s everything you need to know. The FY25 budget goes from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. Some of the highlights in this year’s budget include no change in the tax rate, remaining at $.60, a 2.25% water and sewer rate increase and a $4 recycling and residential sanitation rate increase. The total proposed budget is $119,436,756, which breaks down as follows: This proposed budget is roughly $8,000,000 less than last year’s amended budget which totaled $127,345,478. During the Jacksonville City Council’s budget retreat, they came up with several goals or initiatives to be the focus of this year’s budget. These included pay plan integrity, fee schedule review, recreation land development, citizen/cultural engagement efforts, economic impact — housing and development, street improvements, cultural competency and awareness, downtown development and Unified Development Ordinance review. In the City of Jacksonville Proposed Budget Fiscal Year 2024-2025 that can be found in full on the city of Jacksonville’s website, the foundation of the budget is built on maintaining the integrity of the employee compensation and pay plan. Therefore, the proposed budget includes a market and merit pay increase of 5%. The Capital Improvement Plan was another important piece, critical for how the city makes improvements to city systems, budget documents explain. City systems include things like parks, facilities, water, sewer and other capital-defined items. This year’s budget has also been developed with the intention of preparing for major investments in city facilities over the next five years, through 2030 or so. Budget documents say these capital investments will be a focal point during FY25. This year, the city also developed a new strategy for evaluating requests for new employees. According to budget documents, this process was developed through discussions with each department regarding their mission, their ability to effectively accomplish that mission, and their ability to do more within their existing resources. The proposed budget also includes a number of Capital Improvement projects that are currently underway or will begin in the new fiscal year. The FY25 projects actually represent $10,262,500 of Capital Improvements, and include street rehabilitation, water and sewer improvements, recreation development and building improvements. One concept also taking affect in this year’s budget is the aforementioned increase in sanitation fees. According to the budget documents, the fee increases will help the city’s sanitation fund move closer to operating as a true enterprise fund, also further decreasing the demand on the general fund, effectively freeing up that money to provide for other needs and services. As previously stated, Capital Improvement Plan projects are a major part of the FY25 budget. At this time, however, the Capital Improvement Plan does not specifically list the Recreation and Sports Complex as a funded capital project because city council is awaiting an update to the Recreation and Parks Master Plan. Some of the notable projects being funded in FY25 include the Northwoods Community Center expansion, Jacksonville Station Phase 2, an upfit to the Center for Public Safety, improvements to Court Street, an upgrade to the Commons Pump Station, the Commons Challenge Courts & Trail, the Downtown Transit Transfer Station and more. The city also used a Five-Year Consolidated Plan to assess affordable housing and community development needs. The Annual Action Plan is the process by which the consolidated plan is then implemented into the fabric of the community. Requests from the community this year included in the FY25 budget include $200,000 to Carolina Statewide Development LLC for a 72-unit low-income housing project, $180,000 to ECCDI for a 44-unit homeless housing project, $5,000 to Williams Outreach for rapid re-housing services, $15,000 to Onslow Women’s Outreach for a women’s shelter, $20,000 to Onslow Community Outreach for a women’s shelter and $10,000 to Philippians Place for a homeless coaching program. In addition, requests were made for $10,000 to Pretrial Resource Center for Judicial System Support programs, $5,000 to United Way of Onslow for local nonprofit support, $10,000 to Onslow County PEERS for family development programs, $10,000 to the WARM Program for a home repair program and $30,000 to Boys & Girls Club for youth development programs. There is also community support funding outside of the Annual Action Plan. This year, this includes things like the $1.5 million contribution to the YMCA pool project, $333,333 to One Place for their new facility, $100,000 to the Dix Crisis Intervention Center and a total of $50,000 in opioid support funds.

        "content": "Israel's foreign minister accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” on Tuesday, after the country moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Ireland and Norway were set to follow suit the same day in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza , but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people , according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say. — Iran’s acting president addresses its new parliament . A watchdog says Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war . Here's the latest: COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999.

        "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Three players quit Argentina's women's squad on Monday in a dispute over not being paid and conditions at a camp ahead of two friendlies. Goalkeeper Laurina Oliveiros, defender Julieta Cruz and midfielder Lorena Benítez, all regular starters, walked out. “We reached a point in which we are tired of the injustices, of not being valued, not being heard and, even worse, being humiliated,” Cruz posted on Instagram . “We need improvements for Argentina’s women’s soccer national team, and I am not only talking about finances. I speak about training, having lunch, breakfast.” Cruz and Benítez said during national squad training sessions they received a ham and cheese sandwich and a banana, which they consider inadequate for high-performance athletes. They said the Argentine Football Association told them they won't be paid for the friendlies against Costa Rica on Friday and Monday because the games are at home in Buenos Aires. Benitez added their family members were being charged 5,000 pesos ($5) for match tickets. “And there there are millions of things we have gone through,\" the midfielder added. Oliveros wrote on Instagram , “With a broken heart and thousands of dreams disappearing little by little. May the next generations enjoy and be happy running after the football, as we were sometime ago.\" AFA did not comment on the players' decision. Estefanía Banini, considered the country's best female player ever, supported her three former teammates. Last year, she also decided to stop playing for the national team. “A matter of time. Thanks for being willing to speak about it,” the Atletico Madrid midfielder said on her social media channels. AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "content": "Drew Barrymore wants to bring back the magic of The Wizard of Oz back on the silver screens. While speaking with US Weekly , the 49-year-old actress said that she has been wanting to make a prequel film on the franchise for more than 20 years now. “'Surrender Dorothy' is the script I’ve been trying to get made for, I kid you not, 28 years. When we first started Flower Films, it was one of the first scripts I fell in love with and we developed it. So it feels very personal to me,” she said. Drew, who launched her Flower Films production company in 1995, further noted that the script is “lying in a vault somewhere.” “As a director, I would give anything to do [make] that. And then as an actor, it was sort of not really available to me for many years. And I did try, but [it] wasn’t feeling right for me,” she continued. Drew also admitted that now that her kids are getting older, she wants to get more acting projects. “I think the girls are like, ‘Yeah, mom, we’re doing great. If you want to go do that, go back and do things.’ Getting that permission from them was really huge and sort of opened up my mind, so we’ll see,” the mother-of-two continued.",

        "content": "What would it take to convince you that Hyderabad is India’s capital? Would a cumulative order of ‘13 million in a span of 12 months’ do it? In March this year, when food delivery platform Swiggy declared these statistics, the internet had a gala time. Afterall, everyone harbours a fondness for a good Hyderabadi . Since time immemorial — the 18th century to be precise — the city’s love affair with the royal dish has been a well-celebrated one. Legend says it was Nizam-Ul-Mulk, the newly-appointed city ruler elected following Emperor Aurangzeb’s demise, who inspired the . The chef is said to have created almost 50 different versions of the dish, transcending the obvious chicken, mutton and fish versions to experiment with quail, deer, and hare meat. Through time, Hyderabadi’s fascination with has grown. And not just the locals, but even Michelin-star chefs, famed food bloggers, celebrities and sportspersons love themselves a good from... 1. Cafe Bahar The scrumptious menu at Cafe Bahar left celebrity chef Saransh Goila in awe. The eatery has been serving authentic Hyderabadi since 1973 and a defining factor has been the long queue of patrons eagerly waiting outside the entrance. Started by a Persian settler who moved to the city, Cafe Bahar is hailed as one of the most iconic spots in the city for a meaty fiesta. Along with their the chicken (meat roasted on skewers) and mutton are said to draw guests from across the world. So, when chef Saransh Goila had to decide his next meal whilst in the city, it was a no-brainer which place to head to. In a post on Instagram, he writes, “I still remember Cafe Bahar family teaching me that the secret lies in sourcing good quality meat and A1 (rice). They layer the rice in the (earthen pot) step by step; the bottom is filled with pre-boiled rice (the top half from the boiler) and the top of the has pre-boiled rice (that was at the bottom of the boiler) This ensures every grain cooks evenly and finds its true potential.” 2. Hotel Shadab Perfect and inimitable. This is how many describe the at Hotel Shadab, one of the best spots to feast on the dish. As the hotel mentions, “Shadab was established with only one dream — a dream to have people from different communities enjoy , as a collective family. Shadab’s long-standing legacy and success are truly due to the vision and hard work of its founder Mr. Khaja Pasha.” True to its name which translates to ‘evergreen’ and ‘joyous’ in Urdu, the 71-year-old eatery serves a plethora of dishes; each an ode to the cultural legacy of Hyderabad. You’ll be amused to know that the now multi-cuisine restaurant was once a spot where locals gathered over and Osmania biscuits (flaky, buttery tea biscuits popular in the city). The combination continues to be a popular draw. 3. Paradise “ (They say if you visit Hyderabad and do not eat the at Paradise, your visit was in vain),” this is what chef Sanjeev Kapoor emphasises in a video featuring him breezing through the city of Nizams, chronicling the best hubs. The secret lies in a good formula, Dr Khazim Hemati, the owner of Paradise Restaurant explains to Kapoor. Over the sound of spices sizzling in hot oil in the background, Hemati shares the journey that the place has witnessed. What started as a in a cinema ‘Paradise’ in Secunderabad in 1953, turned into an eatery where residents of the city flocked for their fill of in the early sixties. Since 1978, Hemati has been at the helm of things, and Paradise has expanded its operations to cities across India. The guest list has been coloured with visits from Dr Alexander Evans (OBE), British Deputy High Commissioner to India; Andrew McAllister, British Deputy High Commissioner to Hyderabad and badminton marvel, PV Sindhu. 4. Bawarchi Politicians, food bloggers, journalists and celebs, all find their common admiration for at this spot in Hyderabad. here and the proof lies in the pudding — in 2019, food delivery platform Zomato released a report claiming that the joint receives over 2,000 orders a day, setting a world record. One of the most popular dishes is the chicken with mutton and vegetable versions leading in tow. The eatery was paid a visit by food journalist and author Kunal Vijaykar who got chatting with Chef Salman Mansoori. The latter divulged, “We started with a bakery at first in 1994 but within the first 15 days, our became very popular and we had to focus on that.” Mansoori emphasised that timing is of the essence in making a delicious . “My staff can tell if the is ready or not judging by the smell.” 5. Hotel Nayaab Finding the best spot in Hyderabad is akin to embarking on a treasure hunt. But if at Hotel Nayaab is the prize, we’re all for it. While it is the breakfast that got Hotel Nayaab to the top of the food charts of the city, the lunch too is phenomenal. Located in the Ghansi Bazaar area, a 10-minute walk from the Charminar, Hotel Nayaab necessitates you be there on time. The food is wiped off pretty quickly. Some must-haves are the (a slow-cooked meat stew), (trotters of a cow, goat or buffalo cooked in spices), (kidneys of lamb in a spinach-based masala), (mutton mince cooked in a vessel) and the (a masala laden lamb trotter dish topped with cream). Started in 1986, the outlet soon rose to fame as the first to offer Deccani (a stew composed of meat, lentils, and pounded wheat made into a thick paste) commercially. 6. Adaa As food blogger Pallab De shares in an interview with , “For the moments when you want to splurge, there’s no better place than Taj Falaknuma Palace. The painstakingly restored 130-year-old palace hotel is magnificent yet warm and welcoming.” The blogger goes on to add that Adaa sees luxury blended with good taste. “The velvety (a dish prepared by heating lamb on a wide stone and serving it with spices) and the Hyderabadi (a dish where partially cooked rice is layered on top of raw marinated meat and the duo is then cooked together in an earthen vessel) are reasons enough to justify the expense,” he notes. “The at Adaa is impeccable. The impressive technique is a given, but it’s the restraint and the balance of flavours that makes it one of the finest renditions of a culinary gem,” he adds. 7. Shah Ghouse The recipes at Shah Ghouse are a closely guarded secret. and mutton curries here are sprinkled with a drizzle of their traditional special , which render it their unique taste. Founded by Mohammad Rabbani, Mohammad Ghouse Pasha and Mohammad Irfan, the eatery organised a food-eating competition in 2008, which, according to an article in witnessed 14 teams, each comprising two people, feeding one another three boxes of within five minutes for a cash prize of Rs 3000. But these stories and the great food are not the only feathers in Shah Ghouse’s cap. The eatery was also featured in a list of ‘ ’ put out by the Wall Street Journal, USA. 8. Biryaniwalla and Co Food is a shared language over which guests at this historic eatery bond. Also known as BWCO, the eatery began as a modest café in 1980 led by a gentleman Ashtarian. One of the most popular dishes here since day one has been the Hyderabadi made using premium (long slender-grained aromatic rice) and specially blended spices. Even against the landscape of cost-cutting, the eatery prides itself on its gratis saffron content. And one of the guests who thoroughly enjoyed the feast was MasterChef Australia’s Gary Mehigan. On his rendezvous through the city in April 2023, Mehigan stopped by and later took to Instagram to write, “Time to leave the ‘city of pearls’ Hyderabad but the memory of mountains of and remains. or white biryani is still my favourite but I figure one last post of our mutton & chicken biryanis @b.w.c.o is worth it. Can’t beat a mountain of chicken and fluffy rice with a big spoonful of lip-numbing chicken 65 on the top.”",

        "description": "Crypto.com is everywhere: the Lakers arena, Formula 1, UFC fights, commercials with Matt Damon and Eminem. But no one actually knows much about it.",
        "content": "Crypto.com is everywhere. Its name is plastered on the home of arguably the most famous NBA franchise, the Los Angeles Lakers. It's sponsoring Formula 1 races and UFC matches. It's ads are back on the airwaves , with Eminem declaring during the NBA playoffs that \"fortune favors the brave.\" Crypto.com is also nowhere. It doesn't have a flashy CEO like FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried ( who is currently in prison ) or Binance's CZ ( who is headed to prison ). Unlike with Coinbase , regulators don't seem to be sniffing around. Sure, the company has high-profile marketing efforts, but day to day, Crypto.com doesn't really come up much at all. Crypto.com is one of those things I've long placed in my \"I wonder what the deal is\" column, along with Jojo Siwa , bird flu , and the difference between F1 and NASCAR . It seems impossible to watch a sporting event without seeing its name somewhere, and yet I rarely chat with someone who uses it or come across its name in headlines. Part of the issue is that I live in New York, where its services aren't allowed . (That's not a knock on the company — for a lot of crypto exchanges, the Empire State is a tough nut to crack.) But it's also a rather nebulous entity in the American market. It says it's got 100 million users globally, but it still seems to fly a little under the radar. Often, when I mention Crypto.com to someone who works in the crypto industry, they tell me they know about it, of course. When I ask exactly what they know about it, they come up pretty empty. Maybe it's mainly popular abroad, they speculate, or only for novices. Google data indicates that while a good chunk of the search interest does come from America, more comes from outside the US, notably from Singapore, Nigeria, and Bulgaria. \"Huh, I guess bigger than I thought,\" one crypto evangelist remarked after looking up its trading volume. \"They own the Lakers' arena? I've always been so confused on how they did that,\" another crypto entrepreneur said. (To be fair, the company doesn't own the arena; it just bought the naming rights.) He'd set up a Crypto.com account during the 2021-2022 market cycle to do a specific maneuver not allowed on Coinbase at the time, but he hasn't really used it since then. When I asked Nic Carter, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, about the company, he replied in an email, \"It's kind of a mystery, yes.\"He added that, like me, he doesn't know anyone who uses it. \"But I think that reflects the user base — it's not necessarily crypto-natives but rather retail that wants a casual and accessible experience (is my understanding),\" he said. Crypto.com is positioning itself as the new face of crypto, even as it remains rather faceless itself. It might prove to be a smart move — it's boosting its brand and, in turn, its consumer base while avoiding much of the scrutiny other exchanges have faced. For the time being, Crypto.com is balancing between notability and infamy. It's walking softly but carrying a big ad budget. While Crypto.com only really burst onto the American scene over the past four years or so, it's been around for a while. Originally named Monaco, the exchange was founded in 2016 in Hong Kong by Kris Marszalek, a Polish-born entrepreneur with a colorful past , and a handful of others. Amid the 2017 crypto run, it raised money from the public via an initial coin offering — creating and selling a digital token of its own, similar to a stock-market IPO. In 2018, the company landed the coveted Crypto.com domain name , purchasing it for an undisclosed amount from an academic who had long refused to sell it. (Even more confusingly, Crypto.com is technically operated by Foris DAX Asia, which, according to a scan of Reddit , can befuddle many users when their tax paperwork comes in. It's also the name Crypto.com lobbies under.) Crypto.com's primary business is its cryptocurrency exchange, which works as a middleman for people buying and selling crypto, but it also offers other products, including crypto Visa cards. The 2021-22 market cycle is when Crypto.com, now headquartered in Singapore, made its big splash. In late 2021, it bought the naming rights to what was then the Staples Center in Los Angeles as part of a 20-year, $700 million deal. It signed sponsorship deals with UFC and F1 while also rolling its \"fortune favors the brave\" ad campaign, which originally featured Matt Damon. Crypto.com was seeking brand awareness, and it was willing to spend millions upon millions for it. \"This is one brick in a bigger wall of introducing Crypto.com as a brand to the world and communicating what our core values are,\" Steven Kalifowitz, Crypto.com's chief marketing officer, told Business Insider at the time. In the moment, it all sort of made sense. FTX was flying high and had paid $135 million to slap its name on the Miami Heat's stadium. Its founder, SBF, was running around with Bill Clinton and Tony Blair in the Bahamas and suggesting he'd spend $1 billion on the 2024 election. Binance's CZ was talking about investing $200 million in Forbes , saying it would push media companies toward adopting crypto and lead to the decentralization of the industry. But we know how the story ends: FTX imploded, along with some other high-profile crypto projects, and crypto winter set in. A lot of crypto's mini-emperors turned out to have no clothes. Crypto.com, however, managed to weather the storm, though not perfectly. The company accidentally sent some $400 million to the wrong account in November 2022, prompting some users to pull their money out of the platform. At the start of 2023, it laid off 20% of its workforce, blaming economic headwinds and FTX's collapse. The Financial Times reported last June that Crypto.com was operating internal proprietary trading teams , which US regulators had dinged Binance for, even though Crypto.com insisted it was fine. The regulatory environment in the US appears to have made the company a little nervous — it shut down its American institutional exchange in the middle of last year. In the US, Crypto.com has managed to avoid much of the blowback its competitors have faced. (This isn't the case in other countries — in the Netherlands, for example, it was fined for operating without registration.) While the Securities and Exchange Commission has gone after Coinbase and Kraken for operating unregistered securities exchanges, it hasn't made a peep about Crypto.com. Crypto.com has so far ducked notice, even though it's running a lot of the same playbook. In April, the company's chief operating officer acknowledged in an interview with Decrypt that its big-budget marketing efforts could put a target on its back but said the trade-off was worth it. Crypto.com's determination to push ahead, both loudly and quietly, has set it up to try to capitalize on the market's recent run. Bitcoin is once again on the up and up, and so too is Crypto.com. The company is hiring again, it's advertising aggressively again, and it's talking a big game about its business prospects — its CEO, Marszalek, told Bloomberg in April that it was looking to triple its number of registered users. Data from the marketing-intelligence firm Sensor Tower indicates crypto advertisers' digital spending in the US increased by 185% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. Crypto.com spent eight times as much as Coinbase on digital advertising during that period. (It's worth noting that back in the first quarter of 2022, Crypto.com actually outspent FTX on digital ads by a bit.) But the thing about all Crypto.com's advertising dollars is that they seem to be only effective-ish. Data compiled by CCData shows that Crypto.com has a 2.3% market share by trading volumes on the spot market globally, which is about half of Coinbase, which has 4%, and only slightly above Kraken, which has 1.4%. (Globally, Binance is still dominant.) According to Sensor Tower, Crypto.com saw a 140% increase in downloads in March from the prior month, though it fell slightly behind Coinbase, which had a 160% increase. Crypto.com didn't respond to multiple requests for interviews or comments for this story. Most of the people I did speak to gave the verbal equivalent of a shrug when I asked what they thought of the company. One crypto executive said part of the issue was that Crypto.com, being an upstart from Asia, is a little outside Silicon Valley's mainstream crypto circles. Similar to the clubby \"PayPal Mafia\" that dominated software in the 2010s, a sort of Coinbase crew has its hold on the crypto industry of the 2020s. The exec wasn't too keen on Crypto.com's flashy advertising either, describing it as \"decadent\" and irresponsible. \"All that buying of stadiums and renaming stuff, it's just kind of viewed as lame by most people in crypto,\" they said. \"I think the tackiest thing and frankly irresponsible thing to do is to roll out FOMO ads. 'Buy crypto or get left behind' is a really irresponsible message. JPMorgan doesn't do that.\" And despite the company's ability to dodge serious regulatory scrutiny, it hasn't engendered a lot of goodwill among some crypto evangelists. \"I'm supportive of bitcoin, but I think Crypto.com is overall a big negative for the American public. It's very confusing. It's a casino,\" said Alex Gladstein, who as the chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation has argued that bitcoin is important for advancing human rights and freedom. \"When you go to the website, they encourage you to try and bet on these coins that go to zero. I don't think it's anything to do with financial empowerment for people or any sort of alternative wealth building.\" To be sure, the casino thing could be said about most crypto exchanges — and sports-betting apps, and many regular trading apps. Crypto.com seems to be careful about coloring within the regulatory lines. The head of its legal department in the Americas just put out a \" crypto legal handbook ,\" which, OK. Crypto.com is embedded in our culture, and it isn't. It's sort of taken on the FTX mantle but with a more anonymous bent. For the company, it's a pretty savvy space in which to operate: ubiquitous but relatively anonymous. For everyone else, mileage may vary on how you feel about the whole thing. It's a good reminder that, whatever the company, it's better to use exchanges only for trading your crypto assets, not for storing them. Maybe Eminem won't come to regret voicing those ads like Matt Damon did. Or maybe in five years we'll be looking back at this moment and saying: \"Remember that one crypto company? Is it still where the Lakers play? Or is it now something else?\" Emily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

        "content": "Ballots can be cast in person, with a postal vote or by a proxy - and there is a deadline for you to be registered to have your say this year. Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters The next general election has been called for Thursday, July 4, as the nation prepare for its first polling day since 2019. To have your say on who should become your local Member of Parliament in the general election, you must first register to vote . Everyone who is on the official electoral register then has the choice of three voting methods : In person, by post, or by appointing a proxy to vote on their behalf. Here's everything you need to know about how to vote at the next general election. You must be 18 years old or older to vote in a UK general election, although the age limit is younger for local and devolved parliament elections in Scotland and Wales. There is no upper age limit. You can register to vote up to 12 working days before polling day - which for the upcoming General Election is Tuesday June 18 - by either going to this link or by following the instructions on how to apply using a paper form via this link . You do not have to re-register ahead of each election, although you should register again if you have moved house. If you register to vote your name is put on the electoral register , which is a list of names and addresses of everyone who is eligible to vote. You can be fined if you have been asked to register to vote but do not do so, unless you give a valid reason. However, in the UK it is not compulsory to the cast a vote. There is both an “open” and a “full” version of the register. Anyone can view the open register, but you can opt out of having your name on this register. The full electoral register is used for administering elections and campaigning activities by political parties, but can also be used to summon people to serve on juries in England, Wales and Scotland, and for preventing and detecting crime. According to a 2023 report from the Electoral Commission – the independent body which oversees elections and regulates political finance in the UK – potentially up to eight million people across the UK are not correctly registered at their current address. You can vote by post , you can vote by proxy where someone else casts your ballot on your behalf, or you can vote in person. To vote in person you must go to a polling place and fill out the ballot you are given and place it in a ballot box. Ahead of the election you will be sent a poll card which tells you where your polling station is. You cannot vote at a different polling place to the one you are assigned. You won't need to bring your poll card with you unless you have an anonymous entry in the electoral register to protect you from harm. If you have lost your poll card and do not know your polling station you can find it on the Electoral Commission’s website here . Inside the polling station, staff will guide you on how to cast your vote. You will need to tell them your name and address – and show a valid form of photo ID – so they can check you against the electoral register. You will be handed one or more ballot papers with a list of candidates or options, and shown to a private polling booth where you put a cross next to your preferred candidate. You then fold your ballot paper in half and drop it into the ballot box. If you make a mistake you can get a new ballot paper from the staff, but only if you have not put your ballot in the box yet. You can apply for a postal vote ahead of the election. You do not need to give a reason, unless you live in Northern Ireland . Around three weeks before polling day, after the deadline to become a candidate has passed and once the ballot papers are printed, you will be sent a postal vote pack in the post. You should follow the instructions provided and post your ballot back as soon as possible. If you forget to post your ballot before election day you can hand it in to your local polling station before 10pm on election day. If you do this you will need to complete a form . You can apply for a postal vote by following the instructions via this link . You have until 5pm, 11 working days before polling day to apply for a postal vote. In the 2024 general election that means 5pm on Wednesday June 19. You can apply to allow someone else to vote on your behalf , which is known as a proxy vote. Unlike with postal votes there are some criteria which you must meet to be allowed to apply for a proxy vote. These include you being away on polling day, being registered as an overseas voter, having a medical issue or disability, or not being able to vote because of work or military service. You can apply for a proxy vote by following the instructions via this link . You can do so until 5pm on the day which is six working days before the election in England, Scotland or Wales – that means Wednesday, June 26 2024 , for the General Election – or 14 days before election day in Northern Ireland. You can also apply for an emergency proxy vote until 5pm on election day in certain circumstances. Your proxy voter must be someone who is both registered to vote and allowed to vote in that type of election. If you are a British or eligible Irish citizen you are allowed to vote in UK parliamentary elections even if you live abroad. You need to have previously lived in the UK or been registered to vote in the UK. You can register to vote in the UK no matter how long ago you left. You can apply by following the instructions at this link . Once you are registered you can either vote by post or by proxy – or in person if you are due to be in the UK on polling day. Unlike some countries, Britons abroad cannot vote at the British embassy in the country where they now live. The application system is slightly different for people whose last address was in Northern Ireland. You can read more about that by following this link . Since April 2022 you have needed to show a valid form of photo ID when you are voting in person in some elections, including UK parliamentary elections . These include UK and EU passports and driving licences. A full list of valid IDs can be found at this link . If you do not have any of these forms of IDs you can apply for a Voter Authority Certificate by following this link . You can still use your ID if it has expired but the photo on it must still look like you. When you are in a polling station you will be asked to briefly remove any face coverings so that staff can check you resemble the photo on your ID. This includes face coverings worn for religious or medical reasons. You can ask for this check to be made in private and by a female member of staff. If you feel uncomfortable showing your face, the Electoral Commission suggests you can appoint a proxy voter on your behalf or apply for a postal vote. Polling stations open at 7am on election day and close at 10pm. However, the Electoral Commission says if you are in a queue at your polling place at 10pm you will still be allowed to vote, even if you have not been issued with a ballot paper yet.

Khan reveals his deep connection with Wali’s sense of fairness, highlighting the character’s respect for women despite societal norms. “What struck me about Wali Mohammad was his genuine belief in love and his respect for women. Even in a time where power often overshadowed kindness, he stood out as someone who valued fairness and dignity above all else,” Khan reflects. “Playing him made me think about the importance of love and treating everyone with respect, regardless of their status or background. It’s a lesson that sticks with me, reminding me to always cherish love and uphold dignity in everything I do.” Intriguingly, Khan identifies with Wali’s romantic inclinations, finding resonance with the character’s values and emotional depth. As for the most Nawab thing about him, Khan reflects on his tendency to take life a little easy at times, a trait that aligns with the dignified demeanor of a Nawab. “I guess sometimes I could take it a little easy. Sometimes. But life has taught me not to,” Khan muses, embodying the essence of his character’s graceful disposition amidst the challenges and complexities of the series. Amidst its global success, Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar has captivated audiences worldwide, earning its place in Netflix’s Top 10 non-English TV chart.

        "content": "International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revealed that 56 percent of central banks or supervisory authorities do not have a national cyber strategy for their financial sectors. The Washington-based institution said this after surveying 51 countries and putting its findings in a report titled, ‘Mounting cyber threats mean financial firms urgently need better safeguards.’ It said 42 percent of these financial institutions lack dedicated cybersecurity or technology risk-management regulations, and 68 percent do not have a specialised risk unit within their supervision department. “64 percent do not mandate testing and exercising cyber security measures or providing further guidance. 54 percent lack a dedicated cyber incident reporting regime, and 48 percent do not have cybercrime regulations,” it explained. The IMF highlighted that cyber attackers persistently target the financial sector. The institution stated, “Due to the tight financial and technological interconnections within the sector, attacks can rapidly spread throughout the system, potentially leading to widespread disruption and loss of confidence. Cybersecurity is, therefore, a significant threat to financial stability.” In its April 2024 Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF revealed that $12 billion has been lost to cyberattacks in the last twenty years. The Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System recently disclosed that financial institutions lost about N17.67 billion to fraud in 2023. According to the NIBSS, while the fraud count decreased by six percent to 95,620, the actual loss from fraud increased by 23 percent in 2023 compared to 2022. In its recommendations to central banks, the IMF added, “The fund’s recommendations include the development of robust national cyber strategies, the implementation of dedicated cybersecurity regulations, and the establishment of specialised risk units within supervisory authorities.”",

        "description": "A survey suggests that most US Google Pixel owners are likely to switch to another brand.",
        "content": "Despite making increasingly excellent phones, Google has struggled to build much market share in the smartphone sector, and the latest data suggests that Pixel phones might be getting even less popular. According to a recent Stocklytics report (via Phone Arena ), 57% of surveyed Pixel owners say it’s very likely that they’ll switch to another brand next time they upgrade, with only 25% saying that they’re very unlikely to do so. The survey included almost 10,000 smartphone users in the US, and for comparison, just 34% of surveyed Samsung phone owners said that they’re very likely to switch, with 44% saying they’re very unlikely. In the case of iPhone owners, 34% again said that they’re very likely to make a move, while 50% said they’re very unlikely to. This isn’t the only sign that Google's Pixel line could be in trouble, either, as earlier in the month, Counterpoint Research (also via Phone Arena ) found that Google's share of the US market share had declined from an already low 2% in the first quarter of 2023, to a lower but unnamed percentage in the first quarter of 2024. So, all of this is a bad sign for the Google Pixel 9 line, which – despite rumors of a new design, a third model (possibly dubbed the Pixel 9 Pro XL), and ever more AI features – could struggle to sell. These results are slightly surprising, too, since Google makes excellent phones, with the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro both getting 4-star reviews from us. So, what’s going on here? Well, Pixel phones have had more than their fair share of bugs and other issues over the years, including overheating and connectivity problems. The latest models seem more stable, though, and Google has for the most part resolved any issues that arose in earlier phones. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It could also be that the Pixel line isn’t in as much trouble as these reports suggest. That aforementioned Statista survey, for example, might sound significant with its almost 10,000 respondents, but given that Google’s US market share is likely under 2%, that would mean that only around 200 of those surveyed actually even have a Pixel phone. When you consider that the smartphone-owning population of the US sits at around 310 million people ( according to Statista ), that’s an almost meaninglessly small sample size. On top of which, the US is just one market, and while it is one of Google’s biggest, the Pixel line had a 12% market share in Japan in the second quarter of 2023 according to Counterpoint Research (via Bloomberg ), and that was up from just 2% in the same quarter of 2021. So, if nothing else, Google’s phones are making an impact and growing their market share elsewhere. Hopefully, then, things aren’t as dire for the Pixel line as some of the data above suggests, and with any luck, Google can further improve the reliability of its phones, to hopefully boost customer loyalty in future.",

        "content": "A terrifying incident unfolded at Chicago O’Hare Airport this week when a plane engine caught fire on the runway moments before takeoff. A United Airlines Airbus 320 had careened onto the runway at around 2pm on Monday for a flight from Chicago to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport when smoke and flames suddenly started to billow from one of the aircraft ’s wings, United said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration told various outlets that the engine had caught fire, prompting takeoff to be cancelled and the airport to temporarily stop operations, leaving incoming planes to circle overhead, ABC7 reported. Shocking cellphone video taken by a passenger at a window seat on the aircraft captured the dark smoke coming out from inside and under the wing. “I felt the impact on my window,” Ivan Paloalto, who witnessed the nerve-wracking moment inside the aircraft, told Storyful. “As I looked, the engine was on fire, and smoke was coming out.” The plane was towed back to the airport gate, where passengers deplaned. Around 45 minutes later, airport operations resumed, allowing arrivals on other planes to land in Chicago safely, United said. No injuries were reported however the fire department and medical personnel met passengers coming off the aircraft out of an abundance of caution. United Airlines said that all 148 passengers were then put onto a different plane to continue their journey to Seattle with minimal delays. By 5.30pm that day, there were no major delays reported at Chicago O’Hare, CBS News said. The Independent has contacted United Airlines and the FAA for further comment. Memorial Day weekend saw record air travel, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screening 2.95 million airline passengers on Friday, the highest number ever on a single day, Reuters reported. However, the busy period also saw weather disruptions across parts of the country, with severe storms and tornadoes pummeling the central US states on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday evening, JFK International Airport issued a brief ground stop due to the risk of thunderstorms . The incident on board the Airbus plane comes as the company has seen a clear sales lead this month over Boeing , outpacing its main competitor for five years straight in terms of plane orders and deliveries, the Associated Press reported. Boeing has faced a string of controversies in recent months, with safety concerns ramping up after a door panel blew off mid-flight on a 737 Max 9 jet back in early January. The company has also faced complaints from ten whistleblowers , with two men who publicly spoke out against Boeing dying in recent months.",

        "description": "In the viral video, Punjab minister and AAP leader Balkar Singh is seen flashing his private parts before a 21-year-old woman, who allegedly contacted him regarding a job opportunity",
        "content": "After the Swati Maliwal case, the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has now embroiled itself in another controversy and this time it is Punjab. An AAP MLA and minister in the Punjab government, Balkar Singh, has been facing an accusation from the BJP of asking sexual favours from a woman on the pretext of giving her a job. It all started on Monday (May 28), when several leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shared a purported video of Balkar Singh in which he is seen flashing his private parts and “masturbating” before a 21-year-old woman, who allegedly contacted him regarding a job opportunity. The allegations were brought to fore by BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, who shared the alleged clip on X, and said: “A 21-year-old woman comes to AAP’s Punjab minister Balkar Singh and says she is in much need of a job. Balkar asks her to do video call and then forces her to take off her clothes and then he masturbates.” Bagga also asked Kejriwal and Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann to sack Balkar Singh immediately. Balkar Singh is in-charge of local government and Parliamentary Affairs in the Bhagwant Mann-led Cabinet. AAP = Anti Aurat Party Another BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla took a swipe at Kejriwal’s AAP and said it is “Anti Aurat Party”. He even linked the incident to the alleged assault against Swati Maliwal in Delhi. “After Lal Chand Kataruchak now Balkar Singh, AAP MLA whose video of masturbating with a 21-year girl is viral. Even Congress is attacking AAP but remains silent on Swati Maliwal. Will Kejriwal and Mann sack Balkar Singh? Will Kejriwal open his mouth on Swati Maliwal?” Poonwalla asked. ‘No comments’ After the video went viral and created a massive uproar, Balkar Singh seemed unaffected and said: “I have no comments, and it is not known to me.” #WATCH | Jalandhar: On his alleged viral obscene video, Punjab Minister Balkar Singh says, \"... I have no comments and not in my knowledge...\" pic.twitter.com/ooHTxbRaLc NCW demands action The National Women’s Commission (NCW) said “it is gravely disturbed by a Twitter post allegations against Punjab MLA Mr. Balkar Singh”. The NCW further said Rekha Sharma, chairperson of NCW, “vehemently condemn such behaviour and call for urgent intervention DGP Punjab Police (Gaurav Yadav) to ensure a prompt and impartial investigation.” The National Commission for Women is gravely disturbed by a Twitter post allegations against Punjab MLA Mr. Balkar Singh. The reported acts, if substantiated, constitute serious violations under IPC sections 354 and 354B, directly affronting a woman's dignity. @sharmarekha ... The NCW has sought for a comprehensive report on the incident to be submitted within three days. According to a report by The Tribune, the video of Balkar Singh is said to be at least five months old and was in possession of former minister of Akali Dal, Bikram S Majithia. The report said Majithia had handed the video over to Punjab Governor Banwarilal Purohit for his intervention.",

        "content": "Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory recalled conversations with his grandfather who served in World War I as part of his remarks at the 10th Anniversary Memorial Day Ceremony at the Carolina Field of Honor in Kernersville on Monday. The holiday is a day to mourn and honor people who died while serving in the U.S. military. Leaders with the North Carolina War Memorial Foundation estimated that more than 3,000 people attended the event. McCrory said his grandfather was stationed at Camp Greene in Charlotte in 1918 amid the Spanish Influenza epidemic that killed many people at the base. McCrory said his grandfather and others who survived were then sent to France to the fighting there, where so many combatants lost their lives to gain mere yards on the battleground. His grandfather, McCrory said, was in charge of horses because his pre-war occupation was incorrectly recorded as “farmer” rather than “pharmacist.” People are also reading... “One night of a terrible German shelling all of his horses got killed,” he said. “So they made him a medic, which made more sense.” McCrory said he remembers his grandfather saying soldiers in the first wave of an attack were certain to die, with about a 50% chance in the second wave, and maybe 25% in the third wave, if a third wave happened. So many service members who lost their lives, back then and more recently, knew before their deaths there was a good chance they would be killed, McCrory said. “Can you imagine?” he said. “The people that we are honoring today, yes, even going back to 1918, knew that they were going to die when that whistle blew and they stuck their head up over a filthy, filthy trench and they maybe wouldn’t even make it several yards before they were shot down.” The Carolina Field of Honor, now 10 years old, is located in Triad Park in Kernersville. It was created by the North Carolina War Memorial Foundation, which was founded by Korean-war veteran Bill Moss. The memorial includes a tall central obelisk surrounded by smaller monuments recognizing different branches of the U.S. armed service. Other parts of the memorial include paving stones to honor individual veterans and a piece of a steel beam from the south tower of the World Trade Center, which was hit during a terrorist attack against the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The Carolina Field of honor is dedicated to “the service and sacrifice of the United States Armed Forces men and women who have paid our freedom forward,” according to the program for the event. Next to the memorial, volunteers with an area organization called “The Tree of Valor” set up a bunch of artificial Christmas trees decorated with pictures of past and present members of the U.S. military, donated by families. The group has an indoor museum in Burlington and also exhibits trees at events such as the one on Monday. Caitie Mason, a volunteer with the group, was helping exhibit the trees. Mason said her father and brother served and she grew up showing respect “for those who put their lives on the line for our country.” There are so many who served who are forgotten in the struggles they face on a daily basis, Mason said, so she feels it is important to give back. She thought Monday’s event was wonderful.

        "content": "As it stands the record sale in Scotland is £25million – which have received twice; for from in 2019 and last summer when Al-Ittihad paid the same amount for . The player in question who could be on the move this summer is Celtic’s superb midfielder , who had yet another brilliant season for the Scottish Premiership champions. In the league this season, the Danish midfielder scored an outstanding 18 league goals and provided a further 13 assists. He also provided three assists in the , too. This has naturally led to interest from elsewhere. European clubs circling In January, that were one of the sides pushing hard for the Danish midfielder and Diego Simeone’s side are understood to still remain interested. Celtic would ideally like to keep O’Riley but they recognise the interest in him is strong. HITC understands that a plethora of English clubs have enquired about his availability this summer, too. French side and Bundesliga side are also understood to have declared their interest. This has been O’Riley’s breakthrough season for the Scottish side and losing the Danish midfielder would represent a huge blow for boss Brendan Rodgers, who won the league and cup double this campaign. Premier League sides interest As mentioned, it is not only some of Europe’s elite who are keen on the Danish midfielder but Premier League clubs are also understood to be keen on the 23-year-old. There are three clubs, in particular, who are understood to be showing the most interest and these are , and Thomas Frank’s . Eddie Howe’s and Unai Emery’s have watched the midfielder in the past but, as it stands, both of these sides have different priorities heading into the summer window. O’Riley’s sale would generate a large fee for the Scottish side and they will need to invest these funds into adequate replacements for the 23-year-old.",

        "description": "Plans announced in recent days include mandatory national service and a ‘triple lock plus’ for pensioners",
        "content": "The general election campaign is in full swing with party leaders travelling up and down the country announcing planned policies if they win. Prime minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Leader Sir Kier Starmer have already announced a number of manifesto pledges after a snap summer election was announced for 4 July. Mr Sunak faces the task of preventing the Tories from suffering an electoral wipeout , with Labour consistently 20 points ahead in the opinion polls. Britain ’s leading election expert Professor Sir John Curtice said the Conservatives face a “major challenge” to hold on to power and that the election is “for Labour to win”. The Independent has been tracking every policy announcement from the prime minister in his 2024 campaign, including ones he has already pledged. In his first major policy announcement on 25 May, the prime minister unveiled plans for mandatory national service for young adults. Plans are currently being drawn up for 18-year-olds to either join the military full-time or volunteer one weekend every month carrying out community service . Aimed for the first teenagers to take part in September 2025, Rishi Sunak is said to believe compulsory service would help foster the “national spirit” that emerged during the pandemic. Around 30,000 full-time military placements will be on offer, with the vast majority of 18-year-olds expected to do the compulsory community roles instead, working with organisations such as charities, the NHS, police or fire services. The programme will cost an estimated £2.5 billion a year by the end of the decade and plans to fund £1 billion through plans to “crack down on tax avoidance and evasion”. The remaining £1.5 billion will be paid for with money previously used for the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF), which is a package to support charities and community groups, the Tories said. Labour have attacked the policy with Kier Starmer calling it a “teenage Dad’s Army”. On 28 May, Mr Sunak pledged to increase the income tax personal allowance for pensioners . The £2.4 billion plan would give pensioners a tax cut worth around £95 in 2025-26, rising to £275 in 2029-30. Mr Sunak’s new tax policy would see the age-related allowance rise in line with the increase to the state pension under a “triple lock plus” guarantee. That would mean that both the state pension and the allowance – the amount that can be earned before being liable to income tax – rising by inflation, average wages or 2.5%, whichever is highest. The announcement will guarantee in legislation that the pensioners’ personal allowance will always be higher than the level of the new state pension. The policy will cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30 and will be funded through the clamping down on tax dodgers – the same pot of money which will help pay for Mr Sunak’s plan for new mandatory national service for 18-year-olds. Labour said it was a “desperate move” from a party, and said it would not match the “triple lock plus”. Mr Sunak set out a plan in April to spend 2.5% of GDP on defence by 2030. The announcement included an additional £500m in military support for Ukraine on top of the £2.5bn allocated for this financial year. In a speech earlier this month, the prime minister warned giving Sir Keir Starmer the keys to No 10 would leave the country less safe and embolden Russia’s Vladimir Putin. The funding for this policy would largely come from slashing the size of the Civil Service, the government said. Labour has said it wants to raise defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, but has not set a date for achieving that target and would carry out a defence review if it wins the election. In October last year, the prime minister announced his plan to scrap A-levels and replace it with a new qualification called the Advanced British Standard (ABS). At the annual Conservative Party Conference, Mr Sunak said he would merge A levels and technical T-levels into the brand new ABS to create “parity of esteem” between academic and technical subjects. Teachers in “key subjects” will receive special bonuses of up to £30,000, tax free, over the first five years of their careers to “attract and retain” more people. Sixth formers will now be required to study five subjects rather than three under the new ABS qualification, said the PM – explaining that he wanted students to spend at least 195 hours more with a teacher. No 10 emphasised that it was a long-term reform project, and could take at least 10 years to bring in. It means pupils starting primary school in September 2023 could be the first to take the new ABS.",

The UAV was a Chinese WL-10 drone and did not intrude into Japanese territorial airspace, according to the ministry. The ministry has been aware of four types of Chinese UAVs making flights but this is the first time a WL-10 has been confirmed. “China’s military operations are becoming more active, and this is believed to be part of that trend,” said a ministry official.",

        "content": "After a seven year gap, the Stilton Cheese Rolling Festival returned with a bang – with scores of people enjoying the sunshine in the village. Teams raced to send down the ‘cheese’ (actually a lump of wood shaped to look like a wheel of Stilton) down the track in the fastest time possible. The Stilton Cheese Rolling Festival was last held in 2017, when teams donned fancy dress to chase the block of ‘cheese’ down the village high street. This year it was held at the Stilton Community Centre. Some of the teams donned fancy dress to take part, and there were mens, womens and childrens races throughout the afternoon. The women’s event was won by Twinkletoes Dunleavy and Lisa Vickers while the men’s title was claimed by Gary Beavers and Philip Wells. Crowds lined the course throughout the afternoon to catch a glimpse of the action – and to watch the entertainment on offer, which included a number of music acts and a procession including event Queen and Princess Amelia Vickers and Keira Dunleavy.

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at the JMM-Congress alliance on Tuesday over ‘flourishing’ corruption in Jharkhand under their watch and also accused them of looting the state from all sides. Addressing a rally in Jharkhand’s Dumka, PM Modi mocked at the ‘misrule’ of JMM-Congress and said that the state was drawing attention more for its ‘mountains of cash’ rather than its picturesque and beautiful mountains. “JMM and Congress are looting Jharkhand from every side. There are so many beautiful mountains here, but Jharkhand is being discussed for the mountain of notes,” he told the gathering. Dumka, Jharkhand: \"This is Modi's resolve: your electricity bill will be zero, and the government will buy electricity from the people, which will also increase people's earnings. Now, tell me, would anyone want this service for the poor to stop?\" says PM Narendra Modi — IANS (@ians_india) Jharkhand, Dumka: PM Modi halts his speech to receive a gift from a child attending his rally — IANS (@ians_india) | Jharkhand: Addressing a public rally in Dumka, PM Narendra Modi says, \"...A new government will be formed after June 4. After forming the government, I will build 3 crore more houses for the poor...\" — ANI (@ANI) PM Modi’s caustic jibe comes in the backdrop of the recovery of Rs 35 crore cash from the aide of the personal secretary of Jharkhand minister Alamgir Alam. The PM further accused the INDI Alliance of pursuing a dangerous formula for anti-national politics. “Their formula is simple, engage in extreme communal politics, appeasement politics, patronise separatists, defend terrorists and accuse anyone who opposes them of creating a Hindu-Muslim divide,” he said. He further said that INDI Alliance wants to give religion-based reservations to the Muslim community and added that he won’t allow the rights of OBCs, SCs and STs to be looted. “My firm stance on religion-based reservation has left the INDI Alliance unsettled,” he added. PM Modi further said that INDI Alliance wants to ‘scare’ him by tarnishing his image but they don’t understand that “I won’t let their hateful propaganda succeed”. He also said that prior to 2014, corruption and scams were the order of the day but all that changed after the BJP government came to power. “You blessed Modi in 2014. Then the whole country was fed up with the misrule of Congress, scams used to happen every day, Congress was busy 24X7 in looting money in the name of the poor. Modi came and stopped all that. Today, public money is used in public interest,” he told the gathering. Underscoring his commitment to uplifting marginalised communities, PM Modi said that since he comes from a humble background, he understands the needs of deprived classes including Dalits and tribal population, who have been facing state apathy for years and explained how his aspirational districts scheme was centred on transforming such regions. “In Jharkhand, Santhal Pargana is witnessing unprecedented progress and new dimensions of growth,” he told the crowd. He also underlined his vision for Viksit Bharat and sought people’s support for continuing the country’s transformative journey.",

        "content": "The National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training (NIBRT) has officially launched a new advanced therapies facility. This expansion will increase NIBRT’s capacity and capability to conduct manufacturing-focused research and training in advanced therapeutics. Advanced therapeutics is a broad category of innovative biological medicines that includes cell therapies, gene therapies, mRNA and DNA-based therapies and other novel biologic-based medicines and vaccines. The new facility will accommodate around twenty-five new researchers and training staff and will serve new and existing NIBRT clients by providing research solutions to manufacturing challenges and training in the production of these highly innovative and complex medicines. This €21 million project is supported by the Irish Government through IDA Ireland and incorporates 1,800 m2 of new space, including seven research laboratories and state of the art training suites, into the existing NIBRT facility that will be dedicated to advanced therapeutics. The facility also houses a €6.5 million SFI/IDA co-funded research facility called CONCEPT, which is dedicated to the early-stage development of biologic therapies. Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Defence, Micheál Martin TD said: “This new Advanced Therapeutics manufacturing research and training facility, funded by the Irish Government, will further Ireland’s reputation as a global leader in biopharma manufacturing. It is important to continuously invest in this evolving area so that Ireland’s biopharma sector, with its highly skilled workforce, remains attractive to investors in this complex and innovative area of life saving medicines.” NIBRT CEO Darrin Morrissey commented: “The role of NIBRT is to help the growth and development of the biopharma manufacturing sector in Ireland by providing cutting edge training and research solutions. NIBRT intends to further enhance our current capability by becoming a leader in the pioneering and fast-evolving area of advanced therapies and vaccines. It is an immensely exciting time for NIBRT. With this expansion, we expect to deliver training for many more potential and newly-hired biopharma staff, as well as considerable growth in our research activities. This has the potential to rapidly enhance Ireland’s standing as a location of choice for advanced therapy and vaccine manufacturing.” The Irish biopharma industry continues to go from strength-to-strength, with over twenty new biologics manufacturing facilities developed across Ireland over the last decade and in excess of €12 billion in capital investment over that time. More than 45,000 people are now employed directly in the biopharma industry, and this represents a doubling of employment in high-expertise and high-value biopharma roles since 2014. Advanced therapeutics, also known as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), treat diseases at molecular level and represent a potential step-change in the personalisation of treatment and in the treatment outcomes. For example, cell therapy is a medical approach that aims to introduce new, healthy cells into a patient’s body to replace diseased or missing ones. While gene therapy treats or prevents disease by correcting the underlying genetic problem that causes the disease. Delivering these treatments to patients has the potential to offer tremendous therapeutic benefits, in some cases even a cure, in previously intractable illnesses like cancer, diabetes and neurological conditions. However, the manufacture of these highly sophisticated therapies is highly complex and producing them in a cost-effective and safe way presents unique challenges. More information on NIBRT’s advanced therapeutic-related services and programmes can be located here.

        "content": "Dragon Quest's creator hopes the upcoming Dragon Quest 12 will hopefully be a fitting posthumous work for two developers who passed away during development. Yuji Horii has delivered an update on the upcoming Dragon Quest 12, revealing he'd just been in a meeting about the forthcoming RPG. Horii reveals he can't say too much right now, but he hopes that Dragon Quest 12 will be a fitting tribute to two developers who passed away while the game was still in production. \"Everyone, thank you for all the congratulations,\" Horii's tweet begins, speaking on the recent anniversary of Dragon Quest - May 27, 2024, marked 38 years since the first Dragon Quest was released. \"I'm hoping it will be a fitting posthumous work for the two people who have passed away,\" Horii's tweet further reads, speaking on Dragon Quest 12 itself. It's widely assumed that one of the developers Horii is referring to here is legendary manga artist Akira Toriyama, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 68. It's never been confirmed that Toriyama was actually working on Dragon Quest 12 before he passed away, but it's been widely assumed since the Dragon Ball artist has worked on every numbered entry in the RPG series so far. There's nothing in Horii's actual tweet to indicate that Toriyama is one of the two people he's referring to. All we know is that Dragon Quest 12 will hopefully be a fitting posthumous work for two unnamed developers who passed away at some point since 2021 when the RPG was first announced. Last month, in April, by removing one key, long-time producer, and potentially replacing them with a veteran Nier producer. This was allegedly due in part to Dragon Quest 12, which has been delayed several times internally, and while the RPG apparently remains far off, on the series' anniversary, and it looks like it's not too far off at all.",

        "description": "Jonathan Edwards says he is 'moving forward, not looking back'",
        "content": "A former Plaid Cymru MP has said he will not stand for re-election in the coming general election with a scathing letter to his former party. Jonathan Edwards was first elected as Plaid Cymru MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr since 2010. He has served as an independent MP since being suspended by the party after being arrested at his Carmarthenshire home in May 2020 after assaulting his then-wife. He received a police caution for common assault and said in a statement in June 2020, that he was deeply sorry and that it was the biggest regret of his life by far. \"Nothing can excuse that I lost my temper in my home,\" he said. \"It was completely out of character.\" Mr Edwards received a 12-month ban from the party with his suspension was to end in July 2021. He was subsequently allowed to rejoin the party, but remained sitting as an independent MP. In a later statement from his now former wife, she said she did not feel her ex-husband had \"accepted responsibility\" for the incident. READ MORE: Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan announces decision to stand down ahead of election READ MORE: 'A last minute gimmick by a desperate Tory party': What you said about Rishi Sunak's plans for compulsory national service He was expected to stand in the newly-configured seat of Caerfryddin, and could have caused an electoral headache for his former party. However, he says he has decided to stand down from Westminster. His statement, released on his Facebook page, reads: “I have dedicated my adult life to public service, and politics is the very essence of my soul. Serving my home communities has been the most incredible honour and privilege. I hope the people of Carmarthen East and Dinefwr will feel that I have done the job to the best of my ability, with integrity and for the right reasons. “My priority was always Carmarthenshire and my energies were always directed towards serving the needs of our communities and not grandstanding in Westminster. I would like to thank my staff who have been loyal to me over the years for their hard work,\" he said. He also laid into his former party. \"I don’t think I will ever accept the manner in which Plaid Cymru exploited an incident in my personal life to try and destroy me. I acted in good faith and trusted the party’s processes, only for them to be corrupted by those who misused their power in order to settle old scores. That is a matter for them and their conscience. They will undoubtedly rejoice at this statement, but any victory they may feel is a pyrrhic one. “It has taken me a long time to recover, and to be perfectly frank I am amazed I am still alive and breathing after the depths I fell to. I am, however, now at peace. At the end of last week, I attended the funeral of the wife of a friend who tragically died young from cancer. I reflected on what’s important in life and that means moving forward, not looking back. “This week marks the second anniversary of my own father’s death – a man who gave his whole life to Plaid Cymru. It still haunts me that when he was gasping for his final breaths on his deathbed he witnessed his party turning against his son. That sort of torment is beyond comprehension. My father was a Christian and he would not condone a major decision to stand at this election on the basis of revenge and would instead encourage forgiveness.\" He thanked his children and partner, Fflur, for their support. “Politics is a tough and all-encompassing occupation and I genuinely wish my successor well. For myself, I can’t wait to be home where I belong,\" his statement ended. In response to his statement, a Plaid Cymru spokesperson did not respond to Mr Edwards' comments but backed their candidate for the Caerfryddin seat, Ann Davies. The statement reads said: \"Plaid Cymru's Ann Davies is receiving overwhelming support in this election as the local voice for the people of Carmarthen, with growing support across the constituency. This area has a proud history of electing dedicated and independent-minded representatives who always put their constituency first \"The people of Carmarthen’s best hope of kicking out the Tories and stopping Labour taking Wales for granted is to vote for Plaid Cymru on July 4th.\"",

        "content": "Former Super Eagles player, Dimeji Lawal, has blamed the Nigeria Football Federation for the failure of the Golden Eaglets at the 2024 under-17 WAFU B Championship in Ghana. The Golden Eaglets went into the tournament as the defending champions but weren’t able to withstand Ivory Coast in the semi-final stage of the competition. Coach Manu Garba and his boys suffered a 1-0 defeat against Ivory Coast in the semi-finals of the tournament on Saturday. Before then, they drew against Burkina Faso, beat Niger Republic 1-0, and defeated Togo 3-0 to scale through to the last four where they failed to get to the final. Now, they risk not qualifying for the Under-17 AFCON which serves as an Under-17 FIFA World Cup qualifier for African countries. In his post on Facebook, Dimeji Lawal insisted that it is not the fault of coach Manu Garba that the Golden Eaglets didn’t make it to the final of the 2024 Under-17 WAFU championship. Lawal who represented Nigeria at the 1987 Under-17 World Cup in Canada and the 1989 Under-20 World Cup in Saudi Arabia, said the fire brigade approach of the NFF affected the performance of the team. ”Major blame should go to the football house; the fire brigade approach in football doesn’t work again; timely and proper preparation is the key,” Dimeji Lawal said. “In my Eaglets, it took us almost two years to get the best from all nooks and corners of Nigeria. We were thoroughly screened and tutored for the competition proper. You have to be the best to make the team. Every time we lose a major tournament, we quickly condemn and castigate our coaches, as if there is perfection in coaching or other jobs. “Patients do die in the best hospitals, under the guidance of the best surgeons and experts. A game of football must come with three results: win, draw or lose; sometimes the best doesn’t even get the best results. That’s why it’s a game. Arteta had nothing to show for the season, but Ten Hag won a major trophy. ”Garba is not a novice; he had done brilliantly well in this competition not once but twice. Losing now should not make him a bad coach. This coach also needs some respect and respite. ”Nigerians with the attitude of pride, as if we own every cup, your father’s farm can only be the biggest because you have not seen other people’s farms. In a game of football, you will always be better on the stage. “Oyinbo will make sure you remain where you are a specialist. A youth coach provides talents every year; it’s not supposed to be about results or trophies, but about discovering and building. U-17 is not a win-win affair. It’s about building for the future of the Super Eagles.” Note that the Golden Eaglets will play Ghana in the losers’ final at 5 p.m. later today, May 28.",

Baillie Billy Buchanan says he is very upset the plan won't be taken further \"after years of support and pressure\". Falkirk Council' s director of Place Services, Malcolm Bennie, confirmed that Transport Scotland was not willing to back the project which has been talked about for more than a decade. Read more: Alarms handed out to Falkirk flats residents as they demand action on anti-social behaviour In 2019, it had seemed that the plans were on track as campaigners celebrated the news that Falkirk Council would support plans for a new train station to be looked in a Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidelines (STAG) report. At the time, the campaign group Reinstate Bonnybridge Train Station - whose convener Bryan Deakin went on to become a councillor - said it was \"a massive step in the right direction\". But following the review, the Scottish Government, through Transport Scotland, decided it would not support the business case to reopen the station. Having asked Mr Bennie for a report that would \"update the community\", Baillie Buchanan was dismayed by a reply that made clear it will not be taken forward. Baillie Buchanan said: \"For some time I have been asking for a report on the bonnybridge railway station proposal a full report to come to council to ensure the whole community knows its not forthcoming. \"The contents of the reply clearly shows this present council has binned the project. \"I am really upset that after years of support and pressure there is no support from the Scottish government and now this council has finally admitted no more money or officers' time is to be wasted. \"The dream has gone - for now!\" A spokesperson for Falkirk Council said: “Falkirk Council undertook a comprehensive review into the potential to re-open a rail station at Bonnybridge. \"Following consultation, Transport Scotland confirmed that there was no compelling business case for this project to go ahead and it would be highly unlikely to gain their support. \"As a result of this, it would be difficult for the council to justify using already limited resources to progress any part of this scheme and we have no plans to bring forward any further reports at this time.\" For more Falkirk stories, sign up to our newsletter here.",

        "content": "A former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus, has kicked against clamours for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to conduct local government elections. Secondus who spoke at the first South-South Leadership Conference of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) held in Port Harcourt, argued that the commission is already overburdened. He said it was wrong for anyone to think of ceding more powers to the Federal Government at a time when citizens are advocating for decentralisation of power, and are bordered about the conduct of national elections by the same INEC. Speaking from his experience as a long-standing politician, Secondus alleged that the national elections conducted by INEC are yet to be credible. He also advocated for the writing of a new constitution to reflect the desires of the citizens of the country, criticising the current constitution as being fundamentally flawed and inconsistent with the aspirations of Nigerians. The IPAC conference was chaired by an Ijaw Elderstatesman, Anabs Sara-Igbe who called for a more active role for traditional rulers in the region. He criticised the lack of constitutional provisions for traditional rulers in the governance of the country. He advocated for the region’s industrialisation, and urged a united front to voice regional demands amid Nigeria’s economic shift from oil to gas. Sara-Igbe also emphasised the potential for enhancing food security through agriculture, noting the region’s capacity to supply fish to Africa. The event, themed “Good Governance and Security As Panacea to Grassroots Development,” is attended by the National leadership of IPAC, as well as Chairmen of Political Parties in the six States of the region. Other notable attendees included former Minister of Transport, Abiye Sekibo, former Governor, Celestine Omehia, Niger Delta activist, Ann Kio-Briggs, and other personalities.",

        "content": "Committee of Chief Information Security Officers of Nigerian Financial Institutions (CCISONFI) has canvassed more proactive cybersecurity strategies and innovations to address evolving cyber attacks in the financial sector. Festus Amede, chairman of CCISONFI, who made this call at the 2024 Annual Conference of the Committee held recently in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, noted that genuine technological advancement was escalating cyber attacks on businesses and organisations, disrupting and compromising sensitive customer data. Amede, according to a statement by his media team, however called for more collaboration among relevant stakeholders including research institutions to partner, develop and implement robust and innovative cybersecurity solutions to check cyber criminals. He appreciated the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for consistently supporting the fight against cybercrime and the risks it poses on the financial sector. Amede said harnessing and integrating cutting edge technologies such as generative artificial intelligence, machine learning, Quantum Scale cryptography, zero trust security, biometrics, behavioural analytics and cloud security, would help build a safer financial ecosystem and adapt to unforeseen threats of the future. He said CCISONFI was an annual engagement with seasoned experts in the cybersecurity space to guide members on how to drive cyber resilience in the age of emerging technologies. In one of the presentations at the conference entitled ; “Insider Threats; Persistence of Hackers and Fraudsters; Michael Crouse, who is the director, User and Data Protection at Everfox (a Cybersecurity Solution Provider) said organisations must strive to understand the behaviour of their employees as a way of safeguarding any cyber threats from the inside. He noted that Everfox has been defending the world’s most critical data and networks against complex cyber threats for more than 25 years. Crouse urged businesses and organisations to inculcate in their employees their values and why they must be part of the solutions and on the other hand, the company must appreciate the value of the employee suggestions and solutions to the problem. He advised companies to put in place processes aimed at improving a seamless communication from top to bottom highlighting the effects of insider threats to the company and how their actions can curb such threats. The Insider Threat Expert also called on organisations to support troubled and frustrated employees to avoid being threats to the company by divulging critical information to hackers and fraudsters. He disclosed that their suite of cross domain, threat protection and insider risk solutions empower governments and enterprise organisations to use data safely where and however their people need it.",

        "content": "Google may have developed or is working on a groundbreaking technology that can transform how we diagnose and manage skin conditions, including skin cancer. A newly spotted patent application from the tech titan describes a skin condition diagnostics system using advanced AI. This system analyzes skin images to determine skin conditions and provides insights and potential diagnoses. Google patent describes an AI system for determining skin cancer Titled “Early skin condition diagnostics using sonic sensors,” Google’s patent revolves around an AI system designed to analyze images of the skin and diagnose various skin cancer conditions. It uses a smartphone camera to capture the image of the skin. Additionally, the system can employ three-dimensional (3D) sonic sensors to gather volumetric data about skin lesions , including the depth of the cancer. The obtained data is analyzed using advanced AI and machine learning to determine the skin condition. The system is trained on a vast dataset of skin images and volumetric data. It examines the available information and identifies the potential condition based on factors such as texture, color, shape, and patterns of the skin lesions. It then provides a detailed report for further clinical evaluation. The report includes the confidence levels of the determined condition as well as likely diagnosis, severity, and suggested next steps. Instead of relying on surface imaging, this system analyzes the depth of skin lesions, giving you more accurate results. Google has designed it all to be transparent, so clinicians can review and evaluate the data for informed decision-making for further diagnosis and treatment. This system can revolutionize dermatology This innovative AI solution from Google has the potential to revolutionize dermatology. It can make skin condition assessments more accessible, efficient, and affordable. People can monitor and manage their skin health from the comfort of their homes, just with the help of a smartphone. The system can serve as an early detection tool for skin cancer, so people can visit a dermatologist and seek better treatment.

        "content": "The management of the , has finally reacted to the sudden demise of Miss Favour Ugwuka, a student at the university, who committed suicide. New Telegraph had earlier reported that Ugwuka, an EBSU final year student in the Department of English Language and Literature, allegedly commited suicide in her dormitory residence on Wednesday, May 23, 2024. Addressing journalists on Monday in the institution’s conference room, Vice Chancellor of the university, Chigozie Ogbu denied the deceased’s accusations that the accused lecturer was responsible for her failure. The statement reads in part: “When a student is confident that a lecturer has deliberately marked them down, and they are sure that they passed the exam, what the student does is to complain to the HOD or Dean and request re-marking, which will be sent to the Vice Chancellor’s office. “It is usually sent to another university to re-mark and let us know. Some of them, on very rare occasions, have returned positive, and whatever the student gets here is usually what they get from the other university after re-marking, and that is the process. “If at the last exam, the late student felt that she was marked down by the lecturer, she would have complained to the Dean and asked for re-marking, and the paper would have been sent to another place for re-marking. “But from what is seen, it’s not that the student deserves to pass, and she didn’t pass. And from the record, you will find out that this is not the only course that she didn’t pass.” Professor Ogbu went on to say that, according to a confirmed accurate copy of Ugwuka Favour Chinonye’s results, with the registration number EBSU/2018/89726 for the Department of English Language and Literature, she registered in 2018/2019 and is in her first year. In her first year, she took 9 courses and failed three out of them, with a CGP of 1.78. In the second semester of her first year, she took 8 courses, of which she failed two and had a CGP of 1.75, resulting in a sessional CGP of 1.76. Professor Ogbu continued, “In 2019/2020, which is her 2nd year, she registered a total of 10 courses. Out of the courses, she was absent in 2 courses: Intermediate English Composition (ENG 215) and Philosophy and Logic (GST 102). She was absent in the 2 courses out of the 8 she wrote, she failed 2. She had a GP of 1.41 in that 1st semester. In her 2nd semester, she registered 10 courses. Out of the 10 courses, she failed 4 and had a CGP of 1.82. Total CGP in her 2nd year is 1.62.” The Vice Chancellor went on to describe Ugwuka’s academic performance in succeeding years, finding that she had excellent courses, including ENG 416, which she failed twice.",

        "description": "The Britpop icon is set to play the album in its entirety next monthThe post Liam Gallagher “blown away” by ‘Definitely Maybe’ live production: “It’s like they’ve taken a photo of what’s in my mind” appeared first on NME.",
        "content": "The Britpop icon is set to play the album in its entirety next month Liam Gallagher has revealed that he is “blown away” by the live production of his upcoming ‘Definitely Maybe’ tour , and described the stage as being almost identical to the image he had envisioned. The former Oasis frontman is due to play the Britpop band’s 1994 debut album in full across the UK and Ireland next month to mark its 30th anniversary. The dates will include four gigs at The O2 in London and the new Co-Op Live arena in Manchester, as well as further stops in Sheffield, Cardiff, Glasgow and Dublin. Now, with just days to go before the opening night, the singer has shared insight on the live production for the tour, and described it as being like “a photo of what’s in my mind”. “Production rehearsals tday for DM shenanigans CMON,” Gallagher wrote on X/Twitter yesterday (May 27). In a follow-up tweet, he added: “Absolutely blown away by the set it’s full on Psychedelic it’s like they’ve taken a photo of what’s in my mind”. In response to the first update, a fan got in touch with Gallagher, and asked how the track ‘Up In The Sky’ was sounding during the rehearsals – to which the singer responded with one word: “crucial”. Production rehearsals tday for DM shenanigans CMON — Liam Gallagher (@liamgallagher) May 27, 2024 Absolutely blown away by the set it’s full on Psychedelic it’s like they’ve taken a photo of what’s in my mind LG x — Liam Gallagher (@liamgallagher) May 28, 2024 Crucial — Liam Gallagher (@liamgallagher) May 27, 2024 The hints about the production of the forthcoming shows arrive following Liam confirming to fans that he was “gonna go for it visually” back in October. “It’s gonna be mega trust me,” he shared at the time, also sharing that he wants to “bring the cover alive on stage”. “Flamingos, bowls of lasagna that I’m gonna dive head first in naked cmon,” he added, presumably referring to the plastic flamingo placed atop the fireplace on the album cover. Since then, the Britpop star has also revealed that he doesn’t plan to play the tracklist from ‘Definitely Maybe’ in chronological order , as it wouldn’t make sense to have some of the biggest hits from the LP arriving midway through the setlist. “Mixed up,” he told a fan who put the question forward to him on X. “Can’t be singing ‘Live Forever’ [four] songs into the set.” The aforementioned single is actually third on the LP’s tracklist, which begins with ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Star’ – a past opener at Gallagher’s solo concerts. Other songs on the album include ‘Shakermaker’, ‘Cigarettes & Alcohol’ and ‘Slide Away’. When pressed on whether he’d be airing any of his solo material on the tour, Gallagher said: “Not a drop”. He also named ‘I Will Believe’ – the B-side to Oasis’ debut single ‘Supersonic’ – as the track he’s most excited to perform live. As well as the aforementioned shows across the UK, Gallagher is also scheduled to showcase the record in its entirety when he headlines Reading & Leeds 2024 in August. Previously, he said that brother and former-bandmate Noel Gallagher turned down the offer to take part in the upcoming dates . However, ex-Oasis guitarist Bonehead will be joining him on the tour following his solo projects and previous cancer scare. He’s since been given the all-clear . Although not taking part in the tour, Noel did announce a 30th anniversary reissue of their classic debut album , featuring previously unheard recordings and outtakes. A teaser for the collection led to speculation about a potential reunion earlier this month. During an interview with NME in April , Gallagher said an Oasis return was “not happening” around the ‘Definitely Maybe’ anniversary. He was asked if fans could expect a comeback to mark the three-decade milestone of ‘(What’s The Story) Morning Glory’ in 2025. “I don’t know – I don’t think that’s happening either,” he responded. ‘It’s not happening at this moment in time.” Meanwhile, Oasis recently shared an early live recording of ‘Supersonic’ to celebrate the single’s 30th anniversary.

        "description": "Originally from Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur, Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta moved to South Africa in 1993. The brothers formed the conglomerate Sahara Group and grew extremely close to then-South African president Jacob Zuma. The brothers fled for Dubai after a series of damning reports about how they influenced the government and secured sweetheart deals from state companies came to light and Zuma was ousted",
        "content": "The ‘Gupta brothers’ have been arrested in India – and South Africa said it will follow up with New Delhi. The businessmen have been arrested on charges of abetting the suicide of a builder in Dehradun. Anil Gupta and Ajay Gupta were arrested by the police after builder Satinder Singh alias Baba Sahni named them in his suicide note. Sahni jumped off the eighth floor of his daughter’s building on 24 May and succumbed to his injuries in the hospital. The police arrested the ‘Gupta brothers’ on the basis of a note purportedly written by Sahni and on a complaint registered by his son Ranveer Singh. The Gupta brothers were arrested on Friday on charges of abetting Sahni’s suicide. They were arrested under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code at the Rajpur police station. The Guptas have been sent to judicial remand for 14 days. But who are they? And what is the influence they wield on South African politics? Let’s take a closer look: Who are the Guptas? There are three Gupta brothers – Ajay, Atul and Rajesh. Anil Gupta is thought to be married to their sister Achala and is thus their brother-in-law. As per CNBC, the three brothers are originally from Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur. They moved to South Africa in 1993. It was their father Shiv Kumar Gupta who gave Atul the idea of moving to South Africa. Shiv believed the country would become the “America of the world.” Atul settled in South Africa first, while Ajay and Rajesh followed. The Guptas initially sold shoes from their car in South Africa. They then set up Sahara computers – named after their hometown of Saharanpur. Together, the three brothers formed the Sahara Group – a business that would include computers, air travel, mining, energy, media and technology. The Sahara Group by 2018 had an annual turnover of $22 million. It employed around 10,000 people. Speaking on condition of anonymity, A former neighbour of theirs in Saharanpur said: “When the brothers went to South Africa, no one knew they would strike gold there. It was only after the 2013 wedding that we realised how big they had become. They were cautious enough not to flaunt their wealth in Saharanpur or ruffle any feathers.\" What influence do they wield on South African politics? The brothers in 2015 grew extremely close to Jacob Zuma – the then president of South Africa. As per BBC , they first met Zuma when he was a guest at a Sahara Group function. One of Zuma’s wives, Bongi Ngema-Zuma, was a communications officer at the Gupta-controlled JIC Mining Services Company. The Guptas are thought to have given her a Pretoria mansion valued at $200,000. The Guptas denied this. Zuma’s son Duduzane was a director in Sahara Computers as well as involved with several other companies. A wedding in the Gupta family in 2013 created ripples when a plane carrying the guests for their daughter’s wedding was allowed to land at a military airbase reserved only for the head of state – Waterkloof Air Force base, outside Pretoria. It appeared that Zuma had tacitly approved the decision, which breached air force, customs and immigration rules. The guests were also accorded a police ‘blue light’ escort. In 2016, South Africa saw a major political controversy over allegations that the Gupta brothers had promised the then deputy finance minister an elevation to the post of the finance minister if he advanced their business interests. The brothers allegedly also promised to pay $3 million. According to CNBC, ex-ANC MP MP Vytjie Mentor also claimed she was offered the position of public enterprise minister at a 2010 meeting at their Saxonworld mansion. She claimed Zuma was present when the offer was made. Around the same time, former finance minister Pravin Gordhan alleged that it was the Gupta brothers who had got him fired from the Jacob Zuma government. The Gupta business empire was repeatedly accused of securing deals with South Africa’s giant state-owned companies on wildly favourable terms. As per Financial Times , Ajay Gupta is thought to be the mastermind behind the family’s schemes. South Africa’s ethics watchdog, the Public Protector, published a damning report in October 2016, finding that the state-owned electricity monopoly had awarded a massive coal order to a Gupta-linked business at well above market prices. On the watchdog’s recommendation, a judicial inquiry was opened, gathered testimonies for four years and released serialised reports containing damning details. In 2017, about 1 lakh emails were leaked, establishing how deeply the Gupta brothers influenced the Jacob Zuma government and this marked the beginning of the downfall of their empire. Protests were also taking place in the aftermath of the electoral setbacks that the African National Congress (ANC) suffered in the local body polls in 2016. The ANC feared that it would suffer in the next national polls. Chief Justice Raymond Zondo compiled a report, revealing how the wealthy brothers became enmeshed with the highest levels of government and the ruling African National Congress (ANC). In a series of reports, the investigators said procurement contracts at the proprietor of all rail, ports and pipelines amounted to “planned offences of racketeering activity conducted by a racketeering enterprise” linked to the Guptas. The investigators also concluded that Zuma “would do anything that the Guptas wanted him to do for them”. In February 2018, the Opposition brought a no-confidence motion against Zuma. The ANC had suffered enough humiliation. So, it forced Jacob Zuma to step down as South Africa’s president. The Gupta brothers then fled to Dubai. Meanwhile, Zuma was jailed for 15 months for refusing to testify before the investigators. He was released on parole, having served just two months of the term. Pretoria then penned treaties to enable the two countries to help each other in the investigation and prosecution of crimes and the extradition of fugitives. The extradition treaty was concluded in June 2021. The following month Interpol issued a red notice alert enabling law enforcement to arrest a person sought for prosecution or to serve a custodial sentence and hold them pending extradition. In July 2021, Interpol said the Gupta brothers were being sought for fraud and money laundering in connection with a $1.6-millioncontract paid to a Gupta-linked company, Nulane Investment, to conduct an agricultural feasibility study. Paul Holden, an investigator who runs an NGO alongside a former ANC MP, estimated that the cost of the Guptas’ alleged illicit activities in South Africa could be as much as $3.2 billion. Atul and Rajesh were detained in Dubai in 2022, as per Financial Express. However, in 2023, the UAE refused the South Africa’s demand to extradite them Pretoria then declared the brothers as fugitives. What about this case? Sahni in the purported note addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttarakhand Chief Minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami claimed that he had been under severe depression due to ongoing threats and financial disputes with several businessmen, including the Gupta brothers from Africa. Sahni purportedly claimed this severe harassment worsened his depression. Police arrived at spot at 11:30 am after being informed of an injured and unconscious man near the Pacific Golf State building in Rajpur, as per a PTI report. The injured man was identified as Sahni, a builder residing in the upscale Race Course area. Sahni was rushed to Max Hospital after his fall but succumbed to his injuries. “The deceased builder’s son filed an FIR regarding the suicide. After that, the ‘Gupta brothers’, Ajay Gupta and Anil Gupta, were detained based on the evidence. It was found that the deceased was put under unnecessary pressure in his business partnership. He was threatened,” Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dehradun, Ajay Singh, had told ANI. As per Livemint, Sahni’s son Ranveer has claiemd the Gupta brothers of ‘intimidated, threatened and blackmailed’his father. He previously filed a police complaint alleging that the Gupta brothers were exerting undue pressure on him regarding a project. The complaint also states that the Guptas lodged a false complaint against Sahni in Saharanpur. They allegedly pressured Sahni to transfer his companies to them and threatened to jail him and his son-in-law on false charges. South Africa to follow up The assets of the Gupta brothers in South Africa have been frozen amid legal challenges by them to have these released. There is uncertainty about whether this is the same Ajay Gupta who fled South Africa alongside his brothers Atul and Rajesh, the third one also on South Africa’s wanted list. “Justice and Correctional Services has noted reports of the arrest of two Gupta brothers, Ajay and Anil, in India. Our arrest warrants were for Rajesh and Atul Gupta. Nevertheless, formal processes are underway through the High Commissioner in India to verify and for possible engagement,” Department of Justice spokesperson Chrispin Phiri told News24. At an African National Congress rally in Johannesburg on Saturday, ahead of general elections in South Africa, justice minister Ronald Lamola confirmed that the government was aware of members of the Gupta family being arrested in India. But he said there was uncertainty about whether any of them were the members for whom South Africa had issued warrants of arrest. With inputs from agencies",

Two unarmed men stormed into the store in Richmond, West London, assaulting an employee before making off with a collection of high-end watches last Saturday afternoon. The victim, a Surrey resident, has since passed away, with his next of kin being notified. He has been identified on social media as Oli, with heartfelt tributes pouring in: \"Rest in peace Oli. Always had a smile that would brighten the room.\" A spokesperson for the Met Police stated: \"We are aware of the death of a man in Surrey on Sunday, 26 May. This is being investigated by officers from Surrey Police and is not being treated as suspicious at this time. The man who died was the victim of a robbery at a jewellers in Richmond on Saturday, 25 May.\" \"We ask that the privacy of his family is respected at this difficult time and moving CCTV footage of the incident involving the victim is not shared on social media.\", reports the Mirror . The culprits were seen fleeing the scene after the theft around 2.50pm last Saturday. During the attack, the assailants were first spotted sitting across a table from the victim, who appeared to be repairing a watch. One of the men was clad in blue jeans and a grey hoodie, while the other sported blue jeans, a blue and white t-shirt, and sunglasses perched atop his head. In an audacious daytime robbery, one of the men was seen accosting the dealer, manhandling him across room on his a office chair before forcefully applying a headlock. Simultaneously, his accomplice swiftly grabbed a number of watches and stuffed them into a rucksack. The assailant in sunglasses kept the terrified dealer under duress and appeared to be threatening him throughout this frightening episode. His companion continued to pillage the contents of the store, sifting through the table, opening drawers and plundering shelves before both culprits fled the scene. The Metropolitan Police are now desperate to apprehend these two perpetrators and have urged anyone who can identify these men to come forward. Adding in their appeal: \"The incident happened at around 14:50hrs on Saturday, 25 May in Kew Road.

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ -- InsightAce Analytic Pvt. Ltd. announces the release of a market assessment report on the Sulfur pastilles find applications beyond agriculture and sulphuric acid production, including in chemical manufacturing, mining, and oil refining industries. The expansion of these industrial sectors drives additional demand for sulfur pastilles. Ongoing research and development efforts to improve sulfur pastille formulations, production processes, and application methods contribute to market growth. Innovations in technology lead to more efficient and effective use of sulfur pastilles across various industries. The sulfur pastilles serve as essential soil amendments to improve soil health and crop productivity. The market is fueled by the increasing demand for sulphuric acid production, as sulfur pastilles are a crucial feedstock. However, challenges such as limited solubility may hinder their effectiveness in specific applications. These changes may include incentives for using sulfur-based fertilizers and stricter regulations on chemical usage, further driving demand for sulfur pastilles in various industries. Factors such as agricultural practices, industrial demand, sulfur availability, and regulatory policies influence market growth and trends in sulfur pastilles. The agricultural sector is a major driver of the sulfur pastilles market, with sulfur being an essential nutrient for crop growth and soil health.

Sulphur pastilles serve as a key raw material in the production of sulphuric acid, which is widely used in chemical manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and other industrial processes. The demand for sulphuric acid drives the demand for sulfur pastilles as a feedstock. Regulatory policies promoting sulphur use in agriculture, such as sulphur fertilization programs and sulphur emission regulations, influence market demand for sulphur pastilles and sulphur-containing products to meet environmental standards.

Competition from alternative sulphur sources, such as liquid sulphur fertilizers, sulphur granules, and micronized sulphur formulations, poses challenges for sulphur pastilles manufacturers in meeting diverse customer preferences and application requirements. Compliance with environmental regulations, safety standards, and quality specifications for sulfur pastilles production, storage, transportation, and handling requires adherence to regulatory requirements and industry best practices. The North American sulphur pastilles market is expected to register a major market share in terms of revenue and is projected to grow at a high CAGR in the near future.

THISDAY checks revealed that every rainy season, for more than five years now, three major spots on the road use to be cut off due to heavy rainfall thereby forcing the road users to divert to other routes to get to their various locations. In one of its intervention services, the North-East Development Commission (NEDC) has taken over the construction of bridges on the three spots located in Kalajanga, Bara and Tashan Turmi which have remained prone to flooding over the years. Already, work at the first spot in Kalajanga village has reached above 50 percent of completion as workers are on site all day round to ensure that the construction was completed on schedule as disclosed by the Supervisor of the project, Jacob Joseph, who spoke to journalists at the site. Joseph revealed that the contract was awarded to Triacta Nigeria Plc, which immediately mobilised to site and commenced work in order to complete and deliver it before the rainy season will set in. According to him, “As you can see, work is progressing steadily, and I can tell you that we have done more than 50 percent of the work. In the next three weeks, we will deliver this one and move to the next spot. Our men are already there to create a diversion to enable us begin the work.” The supervisor assured the people that the bridge, which is a three-span will provide smooth traffic flow on the spot against what used to happen every rainy season as flood used to wash away the culvert there before. He commended the villagers for their cooperation and support for the company, saying that most of them work as casuals in the security department because, according to him, “It is their terrain and they know it very well.” He also said that some of the skilled youths in the village were engaged in order to be well trained and master their trades, stressing that the atmosphere has been made convenient for them by the community.

        "content": "Senator Abubakar Kyari, the Minister of Agriculture, has stated that the scarcity and high pricing of the country’s key products are due to a major infestation of the tomato crop. Using his official X (formerly Twitter) account, Kyari made a statement on Monday in which he called the infestation that is creating tomato scarcity “Tomato Ebola” or “Tomato Leaf Miner.” Recall that a market survey carried out by The News Chronicles revealed on Sunday that a basket of tomatoes was selling for as much as N150,000 in some regions of the nation. The minister announced that to contain and get rid of the infestation, the Federal Government has dispatched specialists to the impacted areas. The Minister explained: “A serious infection known as Tomato Ebola or Tomato Leaf Miner has impacted a considerable portion of our tomato farms. This has led to a significant decrease in tomato availability and an increase in prices.” “We are addressing this issue head-on in our ministry. To contain and get rid of the infestation, we are sending agricultural specialists to the impacted areas.” “In addition, just as we established the Ginger Blight Control Taskforce, we are providing our farmers with the tools and direction they need to recover their crops as soon as possible.” “We are aware of the disruption this causes to your everyday lives and are making every effort to find a solution and bring back reasonably priced tomatoes.” Backstory The News Chronicles said earlier on Sunday that vendors in Lagos, Abuja, and other Nigerian marketplaces were charging as much as N140,000 and N150,000 for a basket of tomatoes, a price that had surged in the country’s markets in May. The article stated that dealers ascribed the increase to normal seasonal variations in the amount of tomatoes produced. They claimed that with the arrival of the nation’s wet season, the harvest season for the varieties of tomatoes currently on sale has practically ended. According to TNC, as of April 2024, comparable food products were offered for between N50,000 and N100,000, showing a 100% increase in less than a month. Things To Note Tomato prices have increased significantly over the past year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) most recent Food Price Watch report for April. According to the data, there was a 131.58% increase in the price of 1 kg of tomatoes between April 2023 and April 2024. This is a significant annual cost increase. Furthermore, the analysis emphasizes a notable surge in tomato prices shortly. In April 2024, the average cost of one kilogram of tomatoes increased by 17.06%. This increase indicates that the price of this necessary good is still trending upward. In a similar vein, SBM Intelligence recently conducted a study known as the Jollof Rice Index, which tracked the price of cooking Jollof rice in Nigeria’s major cities. The index indicates a significant increase in the average cost of making this well-liked dish. In particular, the price of cooking one regular serving of Jollof rice increased from N13,106 in October 2023 to N17,000 in March 2024. Households throughout the country will be impacted by this increase in the price of components that are crucial to this traditional dish.

        "content": "Northern Ireland Economy Minister Conor Murphy (Image: Liam McBurney/PA Wire) Sinn Féin have reappointed Conor Murphy as Economy Minister after he stepped down just 20 days ago on medical grounds. Earlier this month the party announced that Mr Murphy would be stepping down from the role on the advice of his doctors days before he was due to give evidence to the Covid Inquiry. During the pandemic, while Mr Murphy was serving as Finance Minister, he denied misleading Stormont over a joint order of PPE with the Irish Government which never materialised due to market pressures at the time. Former Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey was appointed to the Economy ministry on an interim basis until Mr Murphy was deemed fit to return to work.

Michelle O’Neill said: “I am really delighted to welcome back Conor Murphy as he takes up the reins again as Economy Minister today, and I know he is looking forward to getting back to his desk. “Conor is one of the most experienced ministers in the Executive and it’s great to have him back after a break on the advice of his doctors. “He is focussed on getting back to creating jobs and promoting the benefits of our all-island economy and our unique dual market access to the European and British economies.\" Ms O'Neill recalled how Minister Murphy had set out his economic vision for the department when he took up office in February. “He will continue the work of reforming Invest NI, the expansion of Magee, and the promotion of news skills initiatives and the Tourism Action Plan,\" she added. “I also want to say a huge thank you to Deirdre Hargey who stepped up without a moment’s hesitation into the role of Economy Minister when Conor was forced to step aside. “Deirdre once again proved to be an able minister who did a great job and I’m really grateful for the work she has done for all over the last number of weeks. “There is much work to do, and I wish Conor all the very best as he gets down to working with others to deliver on the Executive’s economic priorities to build a better future for all.” For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.

        "description": "Despite the presidential election’s domination of the headlines, economic and inflation trends have consistently outweighed electoral outcomes in the past.",
        "content": "In the heart of a political showdown, as the nation edges closer to the 2024 presidential face-off between Democratic incumbent Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, former President Donald Trump, a different kind of battleground is quietly brewing — the financial markets. Investors are aligning their sights not just on the political horizon, but on the ripples the election might send through the economic landscape. As the election season unfolds and begins to dominate headlines and newscasts, investors may be tempted to adjust their portfolios to keep pace with the heated clashes and escalated rhetoric. But before taking any meaningful action, it’s important to view things through a historical lens to uncover layers of financial resilience that challenge the notion of election-year market volatility . Historical stock market trends during presidential election years The historical stock market trends during U.S. presidential election years reveal a fascinating interplay between politics and market performance, shedding light on strategic investment decisions and long-term financial planning . Since 1952, the S&P 500 has experienced an average gain of 7% during presidential election years, as reported in U.S. News & World Report , with this figure rising to 12.2% in years when a president is seeking re-election.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Market predictions tied to election outcomes have shown a remarkable accuracy rate, with the stock market correctly predicting the presidential winner in 87% of cases since 1928, as highlighted by Forbes . A declining market prior to the election has often been an indicator of the incumbent party's defeat. A report from BlackRock found that despite the political party in power, the stock market has maintained an average return of 11.6% during election years since 1926, slightly outperforming its overall average annual return . Interestingly, a T. Rowe Price report found that the year following a Democratic win sees an average market gain of 11.3% , compared to 6.6% after a Republican victory. Election year volatility and investor behavior Election years bring their own brand of market volatility, which tends to be lower on average, except in the immediate months before and after the election. Notably, the T. Rowe Price report found that market turbulence spikes if the incumbent party is expected to lose but usually stabilizes post-election. The government's composition, whether under single-party control or a divided government, has varied impacts on market performance. While single-party dominance shows no significant correlation with market trends, according to a U.S. Bank report, a divided government has been statistically linked to market performance, providing evidence that the balance of power influences market dynamics more than the controlling party itself. Long-term investment perspective during election cycles Beyond the electoral cycle, economic indicators such as growth rates, interest rates , inflation and corporate earnings hold more sway over market returns than election outcomes. Therefore, while the election may cause more buzz and excitement, it is important for investors to focus on broader economic trends rather than short-term election-related noise, aligning with long-term strategic investment goals. Historical data highlights the minimal long-term effects of elections on market performance, with the S&P 500 showing resilience and positive returns regardless of the electoral cycle. Economic and inflation trends consistently outweigh electoral outcomes, so it is wise to maintain a steady investment approach based on market fundamentals. Investors should consider maintaining diversified strategies and avoid making hasty decisions based on short-term volatility, with long-term data reinforcing the value of adhering to a well-considered investment plan. This strategic focus on economic growth, interest rates, inflation and corporate earnings is critical to navigating the uncertainties of election cycles while pursuing long-term financial objectives. Despite the speculative fears and heightened discussions around the immediate impacts of election outcomes, the long-term influence on market performance remains marginal.

        "content": "Every week for the past several months, I’ve been writing about Donald Trump’s legal troubles, and I’ve gotten to see, time and time again, how he has fought tooth and nail to delay and derail his criminal hush money case. Last week, I finally got to see Trump in the flesh as he strode into the Manhattan courtroom, a scowl on his face, frowning at just about every person there, including the 12 jurors who are about to decide his fate. Trump sat sandwiched between his attorneys and flanked by his son Don Jr. and adviser Boris Epshteyn. As his defense team rested its case, each member of the jury sat upright and watched the day’s proceedings intently. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury is expected to begin its deliberations the following day. Its members have to consider. Over the past six weeks, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has presented his case for why Trump should be convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, bringing in witnesses who described how badly Trump wanted to protect his image ahead of the 2016 election: , the former CEO of American Media Inc., and Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney and personal fixer. Pecker confirmed he used his tabloid empire to kill negative stories about Trump, while Cohen, the prosecution’s star witness, testified that Trump instructed him to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 election to protect his presidential campaign and prevent Daniels from going public about her affair with Trump. In order to find Trump guilty of felony record-keeping fraud, the jury must unanimously agree that the prosecution has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Trump falsified records when making payments to Cohen that he did so with the intent to conceal another crime, like the violation of election laws. Trump’s attorneys have argued that the payments to Cohen were simply legal fees, while the prosecutors have spent the entire trial trying to prove they were actually reimbursements for the payment Cohen made to Daniels to preserve Trump’s standing with the voting public before Election Day. Even one deflection will lead to a hung jury—meaning no verdict is reached and Trump is neither convicted nor acquitted. “If they’re responsible jurors, they’re going to take some time, regardless of whether they have strong feelings about the case, to go through the instructions and walk through what the different witnesses proved in their minds and debate with each other,” , a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Lonergan expects jury members to take at least a few days, if not a couple of weeks, to come to a decision. And if they ask New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan for readbacks—transcripts of trial testimony to refresh their memory about what certain witnesses said on the stand—that will only add time to the deliberation process. A major factor in the jury’s deliberations will be how reliable the group believes Cohen to be. He has been convicted of lying to Congress once before—even serving prison time—and has admitted to having a vendetta against Trump. However, during the hush money trial, he has maintained to the jury that he told his past lies “in order to protect” his former boss. Currently, the jury is being asked to decide whether to convict Trump on felony charges alone. However, Merchan could introduce “ ,” allowing the jury to convict Trump on misdemeanor charges instead. This would require the defense to waive its statute of limitations, since misdemeanor charges can be pursued only within a two-year window of the crime, according to New York law. However, if Trump’s attorneys want to limit a more damaging verdict, it might be in their favor to offer the jury lesser charges to consider. “A misdemeanor charge just requires proof that the former president intentionally falsified business records, but to convict on a felony, the jury would have to believe that the former president did so with the intent to conceal another crime,” , senior director at the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, explained to Slate. It’s not yet clear whether misdemeanor charges will be thrown into the mix. Nonetheless, the type of white-collar felony that Trump faces typically brings a prison sentence of one to four years. All the experts Slate spoke to believe that Trump won’t actually spend time behind bars. “First-time offender in New York City? Zero prison time,” said Adam Pollock, a former New York assistant attorney general. He thinks Trump, if convicted, will likely have to serve just probation, since his case deals with a nonviolent crime and a relatively small amount of money—Daniels was paid $130,000 in her hush money deal. Probation allows a defendant to remain out of prison with some restrictions on their liberty. In Trump’s case, the exact terms of his probation would be determined by Merchan, and they could include having to wear an ankle monitor, attending regular check-ins with an assigned probation officer, and completing community service. He might also be required to get permission anytime he travels, and his probation officer would have the legal right to make unannounced visits to his home. If the jury cannot come to a unanimous decision, then Merchan would be forced to declare a mistrial, and though not acquitted of the charges, Trump would be free to walk. Bragg would need to decide whether he wants to retry Trump all over again. An important piece of that calculus will be finding out why the jury couldn’t reach a verdict. “ ” said Eisen. “ There will be a lot of things that the office will want to consider before retrying.” And if the jury finds Trump guilty, he will most likely appeal the verdict. Similar to Trump’s civil fraud case, he would need to while the appeal plays out, which would take months, at a",

        "description": "Fans played down McGregor’s chances against Michael Chandler on 29 June, after seeing him party one month before the fight",
        "content": "Conor McGregor has seemingly moved to dispel doubts about his chances against Michael Chandler , after a video of the Irishman partying went viral. A clip surfaced over the weekend of McGregor dancing at what appeared to be a festival, alongside his wife Dee Devlin. The video emerged just one month before McGregor’s scheduled fight with Chandler . Many fans have expressed doubt that the former dual-weight champion can beat Chandler on 29 June , suggesting that McGregor’s preparation has not been up to scratch. But McGregor, 35, took to Instagram on Monday (27 May) to share photos of himself sparring, showing bloody gloves and writing: “Fighting, competing, it’s in my blood. #FightingIrish.” Meanwhile, Chandler has continued to post regular photos and videos of himself training, as he prepares to headline UFC 303 with McGregor in Las Vegas . On Monday, the 38-year-old American wrote on Instagram: “Life’s battles are not always won by the bigger and stronger man, but he who believes he can win. Walk On. See you at the top!” McGregor and Chandler are due to face off at a press conference in Dublin on 3 June, in a rare move by the UFC, which last staged an international press tour in 2015 – ahead of McGregor’s win over Jose Aldo. McGregor has not fought since breaking his leg in July 2021, in a second straight loss to Dustin Poirier, who knocked him out six months earlier. The Irishman has not won a fight since January 2020. Chandler last fought in November 2022, also losing to Poirier, who submitted his fellow American.",

        "content": "Lashing out at the Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for seeking an extension of interim bail by giving a health excuse amid the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, Bhartiya Janata Party leader Ajay Alok on Tuesday said that the Delhi CM should open the “Kaptiwal school of Drama”. “We are very worried about Kejriwal. It seems he has got a very serious disease. It is such a serious disease that he can do roadshows in Delhi’s 46 degree temperature and is even campaigning in Punjab, but he wants a bail extension for a week,” BJP leader Ajay Alok remarked sarcastically about the Chief Minister. “Why is his health deteriorating? He should open the Kaptiwal School of Drama. From where did he learn so much drama? Kejriwal is an inspiration for emerging politicians like us. If you want to learn drama, then learn from him,” he added Further taking a jibe at Congress leader Priyanka and Rahul’s duo, Alok said, “I want to tell this “brother and sister, that their farewell is gauranteed. They won’t be seen after June 4 because those who are the real Congress supporters by heart, won’t support them”. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has requested a seven-day extension of his interim bail to undergo several medical tests, including a PET-CT scan, due to “sudden and unexplained weight loss and elevated ketone levels,” which suggest potential kidney issues, severe cardiac conditions, or even cancer. Expressing concerns over his weight loss, Kejriwal on Monday said that he filed a petition in the Supreme Court for the extension of his interim bail for seven more days as he might be facing some serious medical condition for which he needs time to get the medical tests done. The Supreme Court has granted interim bail to Arvind Kejriwal until June 1. Addressing a press conference in Bathinda, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “My weight has fallen a lot. If a person’s weight falls by 7 kg in a month without any reason, then it is a very serious problem. So the doctors have prescribed several tests. I have asked for 7 days so that I can get all my tests done within a week. There could be some serious disease going on inside. The doctors said that if all the tests are done, then at least we will know whether some serious disease is going on inside or not.” However, the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to allow an urgent hearing of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s plea, stating that the Chief Justice of India would take a call on Kejriwal’s application",

        "description": "Following Wednesday's election, the real heroes will not be the politicians or the party leaders, but the IEC vote counters.",
        "content": "For voters, the 2024 elections process promises to be simple enough: Arrive at a polling station, out your ‘X’ in the box, and then enjoy the rest of the public holiday as we wait to see who will be in parliament by the end of the week. Bookmark The South African website’s Elections 2024 hub for the latest news you need to know But for those in charge of counting up the actual votes, it’s not as simple. On Wednesday night, the real heroes will not be the politicians or the party leaders. No, that honour will belong to the Electoral Commission (IEC) officials and volunteers who make voting days possible. A large chunk of them will be tallying up the votes throughout the night. So, just how does the commission decide how many seats each party gets in our National Assembly? We’ve put together a brief explainer on the subject, to help you understand how the democratic process works. Calculators at the ready... HOW THE IEC DECIDE THE NUMBER OF SEATS EACH PARTY GETS IN PARLIAMENT There are 400 seats to play for in total. That’s how many MPs serve in parliament during a five-year term. Official IEC data suggests that there are 27.7 million registered voters ready to go this campaign, but they are expecting a voter turnout of between 65% to 70%. That suggests around 18.7 million South Africans will cast their vote. So, let’s say the election turns out something like this on Wednesday, in terms of how many votes each party receives. If we assume the majority of the votes go to five established parties, it could look something like this: HOW DOES THE ‘QUOTA’ AFFECT THE VOTE? Now, to translate those numbers into Parliamentary seats: IEC officials will have to divide the total number of votes (18.7 million) by the number of parliamentary seats (400), in order to generate a “quota”. On the face of it, things seem simple: You simply divide the number of votes for each party by the quota, and you get the total number of seats they should win. However, there’s another devil in the detail. In order to make sure the votes are more fairly reflected, +1 is added to the total number of seats, meaning the official calculation is as follows: The quota is the benchmark for how many votes each party needs to gain one seat in parliament. By doing the aforementioned sum, that gives us 46 634 . So Party D, for example, would just be able to scrape one MP into the house with their total of 47 000. Sjoe, we know it’s a little complicated. But basically, adding the +1 to 400 means that an extra seat is actually left open after doing the division. With 399 seats decided, the last one goes to the party with the “highest remainder”, once their total votes from across the nation has been divided by the quota. REMEMBER THE REMAINDER As you can see, Party E has the biggest remainder of 0.951. Rather than letting all those votes go to waste, they actually end up counting as an extra seat in parliament. Clever that, isn’t it? And, as we’ve practically given away while trying to explain the remainder, our “proportional representation” system of voting means that a party which gets 52.5% of the votes will get 52.5% of the seats in parliament. For every 0.25% of the vote each party receives, that’s worth one MP getting elected to parliament. You can now consider yourself up to speed, even if you did have to have two or three reads of how everything works. We’re going to take a lie down, and thank our lucky stars we aren’t the ones doing long division in the early hours of Thursday morning!",

        "content": "Latest News Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company (MOAMC) has launched a new fund offer (NFO), the \"Motilal Oswal Multi Cap Fund.\" This open-ended equity scheme is designed to seize investment opportunities across the spectrum of large, mid, and small cap companies. The NFO period for this fund runs until June 11, offering investors a limited window to subscribe. The primary objective of the Motilal Oswal Multi Cap Fund is to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in a diverse range of equity and equity related instruments. By maintaining a balanced portfolio, the fund aims to ensure a minimum of 25% allocation in each of the small, mid, and large cap stocks. This balanced approach is complemented by a maximum of 75% exposure to equity, with the remainder invested in debt instruments, providing a buffer against market volatility. The fund is benchmarked against the Nifty 500 Multicap 50:25:25 Index TR, a standard that shows a diversified investment strategy. The portfolio strategy focuses on high-conviction, concentrated investments in up to approximately 35 stocks, targeting growth opportunities in sectors projected to lead the market. These sectors include industrials, chemicals, hospitals, electronics manufacturing services (EMS), capital goods, telecom, fintech, and defence. Prateek Agrawal, Managing Director and CEO of MOAMC underscored the favourable economic conditions in India, describing the current period as a \"mini-Goldilocks moment.\" He highlighted strong economic indicators, healthy corporate earnings, peaking interest rates, moderate inflation, and sustained policy momentum as key factors driving growth in the equity markets. Agrawal expressed confidence in India's medium-term economic trajectory, particularly in domestic cyclical themes that the fund aims to capitalize on. Niket Shah, Chief Investment Officer at Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund, elaborated on the fund's strategy of combining high-growth investing with high-conviction allocations. Shah emphasized that the multi-cap fund is designed to capture segments expected to spearhead growth in India's equity markets over the next decade. The fund's focus includes participation in the high-growth small and midcap segments, which are seen as critical drivers of future market performance. Historical data supports the effectiveness of a multi-cap strategy. The Multi Cap Index has outperformed the Nifty 500 over 3- and 5-year rolling periods, with an average outperformance of 1.18% over three years and 1.00% over five years, according to Motilal Oswal Mutual Fund. This outperformance highlights the potential benefits of an investment approach that spans various market capitalizations. The Motilal Oswal Multi Cap Fund presents a compelling investment opportunity for those with a medium to long-term investment horizon of 3-7 years. Its focus on high-growth themes and a diversified portfolio across market caps aims to provide robust returns. By capitalizing on India's economic growth, the fund offers investors an attractive option to diversify their portfolio and benefit from emerging businesses. However, potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals. While the Indian economy shows promising growth prospects, it is not immune to global economic fluctuations. As with any investment, it is advisable to consult with a financial advisor to ensure that this investment aligns with one's overall financial strategy and risk profile. The launch of the Motilal Oswal Multi Cap Fund comes at a time when India's economic space is poised for significant growth. With a focus on high-growth sectors and a balanced portfolio approach, the fund aims to deliver long-term capital appreciation. Investors looking to capitalize on India's growth story and diversify their investments may find this multi-cap fund an attractive option. As the NFO period runs until June 11, interested investors have a limited time to take advantage of this opportunity.",

        "content": "The Rivers State Police Command has arrested a 13-member gang in the Elimgbu area of Port Harcourt, the state capital. According to a statement signed by the Command’s spokesperson, Grace Iringe-Koko, the police were alerted by a distress call regarding suspected burglars who were trying to gain unauthorised access into a warehouse owned by two private individuals. The statement revealed that a total of five persons, who had already been severely beaten by a mob, were arrested initially and taken to a medical facility where they were treated. The statement further revealed that among the suspects are Corporal West Isaac, a serving soldier in the Nigerian Army with Force number 08NA/61/2653 and posted to Warri, while another suspect identified as Jabila Kammangar is an officer with the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) posted to Kabba in Kogi State. The police said upon further investigation, it was discovered that the suspects were part of a larger 13-man gang specialised in armed robbery, kidnapping, and theft. This investigation, the police said, led to the arrest of some other soldiers namely Lance Corporal Abdul Musa (13NA/70/10545), Lance Corporal Mgbe Jeoffrey (16NA/75/6896), and Corporal Innocent Okwoli (12NA/68/6552), all personnel of the Nigerian Army. Find the full statement of the police below: Rivers State Police Arrest 13-Member Gang Specializing in Hijacking, Diverting Trailer Loads of Goods Investigations by the Rivers State Police Command, following arrests for attempted burglary, have revealed a wide range of criminal activities. On March 4, 2024, at approximately 11 pm, the Rivers State Police Command received a distress call about burglars who were attempting to vandalize warehouses in Elimgbu owned by Mr. Emmanuel Nwangwu and Mrs. Ndifreke Ekanem. The police promptly mobilized to the scene and arrested five suspects who had been severely beaten by a mob. The wounded suspects were taken to the police hospital as investigations began. During the investigation, it was discovered that one of the suspects, West Isaac (08NA/61/2653), was a corporal in the Nigerian Army serving in Delta State. Another suspect, Jabila Kammangar, also known as ‘Kaka,’ was an officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps serving in Kabba, Kogi State. They confessed to abandoning their posts to engage in criminal activities in Rivers State due to its lucrativeness. Corporal West, a 36-year-old father of four from Buguma, Rivers State, joined the Army in 2008 and was assigned to the 3rd Battalion in Warri. He left his base on a sick pass and failed to return even after it expired, remaining absent for over a month until his arrest. West disclosed to the police that he met Kaka while serving in the Army’s Anti-Bunkering Unit, and together, they engaged in several illegal activities. He further revealed that he came to Port Harcourt after receiving a call from Kaka about raiding warehouses, which led to their capture. Further investigations revealed that they were part of a larger criminal ring specializing in armed robbery, hijacking, and goods diversion. Corporal West disclosed to the police that he and other Army personnel had been key players in the group. Besides ransacking warehouses, they had a network of informants who provided information about the schedules of goods-bearing trailers. They would then dress in full military gear, lay in wait for the trailers, and accost them with a white Hilux van as they approached. They would intimidate the drivers, assault them, and hand their keys to designated drivers, who would then divert the trailers to waiting receivers. Based on his confessional statement, the police were able to track down and arrest Lance Corporal Abdul Musa (13NA/70/10545), Lance Corporal Mgbe Jeoffrey (16NA/75/6896), and Corporal Innocent Okwoli (12NA/68/6552), all personnel of the Nigerian Army. Additionally, eight civilian collaborators in the syndicate were arrested: Olisa Emeka, George Obilor, Sampson Wilson, Alfred Abeke, Barry John, Auwalu Aliyu, Uchenna Nwali, and Alhaji Sofinu Haruna. The group’s key coordinator was Corporal Innocent Okwoli, a native of Otakpo in Benue State and a soldier stationed at Intels in Onne. Okwoli stated that he started leading hijacking operations after being introduced to the activity by an individual named Abbas and two unnamed Naval officers. Following a successful operation, he formed his team. Their numerous crimes include: • The hijacking of a trailer loaded with fertiliser valued at N25 million, owned by Alhaji Sadiq Adams, occurred on February 17, 2024. • On March 4, 2024, the group attempted to burgle warehouses owned by Emmanuel Nwagwu and Ndifreke Ekanem. • In February 2024, a 40-foot container filled with imported clothing from China was hijacked and diverted. • In February 2024, a trailer carrying POP cement was hijacked and diverted. The police have since recovered the stolen POP cement and are working to retrieve a trailer load of fertiliser from its receiver. Additionally, a white Toyota Hilux used in the gang’s operations has been recovered from the NSCDC officer. Three of the affected soldiers have been dismissed by the Nigerian Army after being handed over by the police. Rivers State Commissioner of Police, CP Olatunji Disu, expressed his profound appreciation for the swift and decisive cooperation of the military authorities. He lauded their prompt actions in addressing the involved officers’ misconduct and subsequent handover to the police for prosecution. CP Disu emphasised that this collaborative effort underscores a strong commitment to upholding justice and maintaining public trust in law enforcement institutions. He praised the police officers involved in the arrest and urged them to remain vigilant. SP.

By Adenike Kaffi The Chairman, Board Of Trustees, Al- Habibiyyah Islamic Society, Dr Kola Adeyemi, has charged Muslim clerics and imams on the need for self development as a means to avert eating ‘from the dustbin’. He explained that Imams and Islamic scholars are teachers who should lead from the front and show good leadership examples in the fight against corruption and any ills of the society. Adeyemi added that this would only be achievable when the Imams sustain themselves from halal means and sources and not from questionable sources. Adeyemi gave the advice on Saturday, during the opening of a two- day workshop themed: “Creating a Resilient Faith-Based Community For Sustained Accountability Messaging”. The workshop supported by MacArthur Foundation and held in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, was to ensure that Imams and Islamic scholars, are enlightened on the different ways they can contribute to societal growth and fight corruption and societal ills. Speaking further, Adeyemi stressed that the government should partner with religious leaders who will not divert whatever attention given to them towards negativity or mislead the society. “Those who will appreciate the enormous influence that they have and use it towards the advancement of the course of governance.The government should be able to identify what they want without mincing word and not to play politics with religion”, he said. Adeyemi, who is also the Executive Director, The Just Foundation, also hinted that the society also trains Islamic clerics in agricultural activities and its value chain. Also speaking, a member of the society, Imam Fuad Adeyemi, said the Al-Habibiyya society has been embarking on feeding programmes for refugees in collaboration with the United Nations Commission for Refugees. In their feedbacks, the Imam, Al-Habibiyya Society, Imam Idris Adisa and Mrs Wasilat Abiola urged Muslim clerics to be at the forefront in the fight against corruption and emulate good habits as that is what the society stands for.

        "content": "Fire1 is currently studying the effectiveness of its remote monitoring device, which aims to help those living with heart failure. Dublin-based medtech Fire1 has implanted its remote heart failure monitoring device into an Irish patient for the first time. The device is designed to help clinicians remotely monitor patients suffering from heart failure. Fire1 says the device could help thousands of people in Ireland living with heart failure and reduce the burden on hospital emergency rooms. The device is undergoing clinical trials to test its safety and effectiveness. The Irish patient was successfully implanted with the device at University Hospital Galway as part of the company’s first in-human clinical investigation of the FIRE1 system in heart failure patients. The sensor device works by monitoring the size of the inferior vena cava, the body’s largest vein. By monitoring the size of this vein, Fire1 says the device can give a marker of the amount of fluid in the body. High levels of fluid can increase the risk of breathing difficulties and a build-up of fluid in the lungs can lead to an emergency hospital admission. A belt reader lets the patient take a daily reading of the sensor and automatically sends data to a clinical team. The system is designed to send an alert whenever the patient’s condition deteriorates. Fire1 CEO and president Conor Hanley said the latest development is a “true clinical research success for Ireland”, as the device was “developed, manufactured and now to be in a clinical trial in Ireland”. “It showcases Ireland’s capability for groundbreaking medical innovation with the potential to change healthcare delivery globally,” Hanley said. “The Fire1 team is steadfast in our mission to help millions of people around the world living with heart failure to get their normal lives back, but it is very special to be able to give access to people here at home.” Last year, became the first person to be implanted with the Fire1 sensor. Fire1 followed this success with a to increase the pace of development of its heart monitoring device.",

        "content": "Featuring a massive A-list star, it won two Oscars. Our TV movie pick for tonight (Tuesday, 28 May) is Born on the Fourth of July , the 1989 biographical anti-war drama starring Tom Cruise. Earning his first Oscar nomination for his performance in the film, Cruise plays the real-life Ron Kovic – a young patriotic American who enlists to serve in the Vietnam War where he becomes permanently paralysed in battle. Struggling with his paralysis and an uncaring, bureaucratic United States upon returning home, he becomes an anti-war and pro-human rights political activist. Part of co-writer and director Oliver Stone’s Vietnam War trilogy – which also includes Platoon and Heaven & Earth – Born on the Fourth of July’s powerful real life story, its visceral filmmaking and Cruise’s intense and transformational performance made the movie a massive critical and commercial success. It was even nominated for eight Oscars and won two – with Stone taking home the Best Director trophy. Born on the Fourth of July is airing on TV tonight on Film4 at 9pm . It is also available to rent on Apple TV, Google Play, Rakuten TV and the Sky Store. Check out its trailer right here: Here are the other movies airing on TV tonight: This is the End – Comedy Central – 9pm In this hilarious comedy horror, the apocalypse kicks off while a bunch of celebrities (all playing themselves) are at a gaff party in LA.

        "description": "Belgium commits USD 1 billion to Ukraine as Zelenskyy continues his whistlestop European tour",
        "content": "BRUSSELS: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday picked up a second USD 1 billion promise of military aid in as many days for his war with Russia during a whirlwind tour through the European Union. The pledge came from Belgium, which topped up the money with a commitment to give 30 F-16 fighter jets over the next four years. The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defence system, which Zelenskyy sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. A day earlier, Zelenskyy signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates 1 billion euros (USD 1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros (USD 5.4 billion) by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the 27-nation bloc is again struggling to overcome Hungary's objections to the bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros (USD 7 billion) are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia's staunchest ally in the 27-nation bloc. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine's defence efforts. Zelenskyy met with Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the Nato alliance. Since Russia launched a spring offensive around eastern Kharkiv, Zelenskyy has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more US-made Patriot air defence systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting with her EU colleagues, said that such a system will be built \"in a short time frame.\" The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. \"Ukraine is also fighting Europe's fight,\" she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose swift distribution of centralised EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. \"We need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,\" Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur told reporters ahead of the meeting. \"The urgency is very, very acute.\" Zelenskyy was to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia's response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine's biggest military test since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia's bigger army and air force.",

        "content": "Barely three days to the ultimatum issued to the Federal Government on the proposed minimum wage, the President of the (NLC), Comrade Joe Ajaero, has advocated for better pay, insurance cover and pension for journalists across the country. Ajaero made the call on Monday during a courtesy visit to the President of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, in Abuja. He pointed out that journalists played significant roles in the fight for independence and current democracy Nigerians are enjoying today, adding that it is unfortunate some of them are begging for their salaries to be paid. According to the NLC boss, journalism is getting worse by the day, though technology has enhanced the practice. “The welfare of journalists is being underplayed. While journalists are a group of professionals fighting for everyone, nobody is for them, they are not even for themselves. “Journalists do not have weekends, public holidays or festive seasons. They work and report activities of people that are enjoying weekends, public holidays and festivities. “Even when a journalist is sacked or not paid for one year, other journalists will not write a story on such injustice. “I am advocating for a consultative machinery that we should hold every two years, to have a negotiation with all media employers in the county to fix minimum wage for journalists. “Also, there should be a pension that all journalists should enjoy after retiring from the job. Insurance cover is another thing that Journalists should enjoy to make them work better,” he added. The labour leader stressed that non-payment of journalists’ salary should not be encouraged and should be treated as a criminal offence. Ajaero acknowledged that, though it has not been easy for publishers, he said that should not warrant them not to do the needful for their employees, particularly payment of their salaries.",

Despite the one receiving the serve, it is Rybakina who is making her opponent move all across the court with strong forehands and dropshots. Once again, it is break point and Rybakina deals with the second serve quickly. Share 5m ago 05.57 EDT Minnen 2-6 0-3 Rybakina* (denotes server) The games in which Rybakina serve end much more quickly with a few aces to wrap things up. Nine games in a row with wins for Rybakina in this match. Minnen is not able to get a sniff. We get a quick shot of the other courts in Paris and they’re all drenched because of the rain. Games have been pushed back to 12.15pm local time. Share 8m ago 05.53 EDT *Minnen 2-6 0-2 Rybakina (denotes server) Rybakina is, of course, known as a big hitter and accurate server. But she has recently been adding these precise drop shots to her game that have made her much more well rounded. Minnen just can’t keep up. Share 11m ago 05.51 EDT Minnen 2-6 0-1 Rybakina* (denotes server) Wow! Great effort from Minnen. Rybakina hits her shots all over the court but the Belgian twists her body and manages to return every single ball, her last backhand flying over Rybakina to the baseline. But Rybakina is keeping her at bay and only allows her opponent to briefly get her hopes up before a few flying aces to take the first game of the second set. Share 16m ago 05.46 EDT Rybakina takes the first set 6-2 Minnen isn’t down and out yet as her varied shots finally get the better of Rybakina. The crowd cheers her on as the underdog but the latter brings out a beautiful drop shot and after a couple of powerful forehands, she wraps up the set in dominant fashion. Think the world No 4 just needed a couple of extra minutes to warm up after those six unforced errors in a row. View image in fullscreen Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan hits a backhand.

She then hits back with a great slice to try to move Rybakina around but the world No 4 is better at that game and Minnen can only watch as the ball flies past her. Minnen is playing better as she tries to vary her shots. At 40-30 she plays a nice drop shot, but again Rybakina is able to anticipate it and win the point. She then wins the advantage and wraps up the game with ease. Share 29m ago 05.33 EDT *Minnen 2-4 Rybakina (*denotes server) After getting some advice from her coach, Minnen tries to longer serves but annoyingly for her, Rybakina’s strike zone is so large given her stature. It takes real precision to hit her weak areas. The world No 4 wins that game without her opponent winning a singe point. Share Updated at 05.33 EDT 32m ago 05.30 EDT Minnen 2-3 Rybakina* (*denotes server) A couple of quick aces wrap up this game incredibly quickly. Rybakina is known for her incredible serve that is extremely difficult to defend, a lesson that Minnen is learning in real time. Share 35m ago 05.27 EDT *Minnen 2-2 Rybakina (*denotes server) Minnen’s second serve lets her down early on but some good play from both players gets us at 40-40. A short rally ends in Rybakina netting a volley, but she gains the advantage after taking advantage of Minnen’s poor positioning. It is a break back and we’re all tied.

        "content": "The police in Gujarat’s Bharuch caught a mentally unstable man on Monday evening after he allegedly attacked a group of Jain women monks earlier in the day. The man is currently undergoing treatment at the Bharuch civil hospital and the police said the monks are stable. As per details, six Jain monks left their religious place at Shrimali pole and were walking towards their Upashray (a place for monks to stay) at Dharol when an unknown man started following them. A police officer said, “When the monks asked him not to follow them, the man came closer and an argument ensued. Soon, he removed his belt and started attacking the monks.” Advertisement Satish Rathod, a vegetable merchant by profession who was passing by, tried to stop the man. When two others known to Satish intervened, the attacker escaped, the officer said. Rathod then escorted the monks to the Dharol Upashray and subsequently, Hemant Shah, a resident of Vidhya Vihar society, lodged a complaint against an unknown person at the Bharuch taluka police station on Monday afternoon. The police registered an offence under IPC Act Sections, 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506(2) (If threat be to cause death or grievous hurt), 341 (Punishment for wrongful confinement), 354 (Assault of criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 (d) (Stalking) and 295(a) (deliberate and malicious act, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious feelings). Later, the police caught the suspect and identified him as Altaf Hussain Shaikh, 44, a resident of Kabootar Khana area in Bharuch and a native of Khambhat. Sensing him to be mentally unstable, the police took him to the Bharuch civil hospital. Advertisement Talking to The Indian Express , Bharuch taluka police inspector P D Jhankat said, “The accused is mentally unstable and undergoing treatment at the hospital. Once he is fine and the doctor gives a declaration about the same, we will arrest him.” Jhankat added, “The accused has been living with his elder brother in Bharuch for the last six months. His brother told us that he is mentally unstable and also showed us a file to prove his medical treatment history. We have also come to know that after his wife left him, he started creating troubles for his mother at his native place so his elder brother brought him to Bharuch.”",

        "description": "Donald Trump has overtly taken the side of dictators including Putin, Xi, Orbán, and Kim over the past eight years, most likely because he admires the way each has crushed efforts toward democracy and ruled their respective nations with an iron fist.Now US intelligence agencies say their big worry is that one or more of these nations will reciprocate Trump’s love by launching some sort of October Surprise to push voters closer to Trump in time for this fall’s election. Such an action could swing our election toward Trump, but also risks provoking a third world war.The phrase October Surprise, of course, refers to the successful deal that the Reagan campaign cut with Iran’s Ayatollah’s government to hold the American hostages in the US Embassy in Tehran until after the 1980 election to destroy President Jimmy Carter’s chances. Both Iran’s then-president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, and the former Lt. Governor of Texas, Ben Barnes, have verified the plot, the latter last year in The New York Times.An earlier (unknown until the past two decades) plot by the campaign of candidate Richard Nixon to blow up the 1968 Paris peace talks and thus sabotage President Johnson’s deal with the Vietnamese was the first known successful Republican effort to use treason to steal an election. It qualified for the October Surprise label, but wasn’t known until well after Reagan’s efforts had earned the title.READ: 19 fabulously worthless things Trump will give you for your money And, of course, there was the October Surprise in Florida in 2000 when Florida Governor Jeb Bush’s administration got the 68% Black and Hispanic list of Texas felons from his brother, Texas Governor George W. Bush, and used them to purge tens of thousands of Black and Hispanic Florida voters with similar names from the Florida voter rolls in the months immediately before that year’s election.George “won” the 2000 election by 537 votes (he lost the national popular vote by a half-million), although the Florida Supreme Court-ordered recount that was blocked by five corrupt Republicans on the US Supreme Court would have revealed that setup and several other ways Jeb had rigged the election that year for his brother, and put Al Gore into the White House.Two of the three October Surprise events employed by Republican candidates for president involved colluding with foreign governments to harm a Democratic candidate; Reagan’s hit on Carter was particularly treasonous and effective. Nixon’s — appropriate to remember on Memorial Day — caused the death of an additional 20,000+ American GIs in Vietnam.So, it’s entirely reasonable to assume that Trump — still in touch with Putin, Kim, and Xi, even if only through media proclamations — is either planning or expecting help this fall from his autocratic pals.Putin, desperate for more weapons to crush democracy in Ukraine, has formed a strong alliance over the past year with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, trading battlefield weapons for submarine and other technology that Kim can use along with nuclear weapons to threaten the US.In an NBC News article from May 24th titled “Are Russia and North Korea planning an ‘October surprise’ that aids Trump?” reporters Cortney Kube and Carol E. Lee note that there could be serious consequences arising from the fact that North Korea is today giving Russia more weaponry to use against Ukraine than all of Europe has been able to provide to President Zelenskyy:“U.S. officials are also bracing for North Korea to potentially take its most provocative military actions in a decade close to the U.S. presidential election, possibly at Putin’s urging...“The increasingly close relationship between Putin and Kim represents a major shift from when Russia worked with the U.S. in the past to try to rein in North Korea. Now, Moscow is using its veto power on the U.N. Security Council to give Pyongyang cover to evade sanctions enforcement measures intended to constrain its nuclear program.” North Korea firing missiles into the demilitarized zone between it and South Korea to help Trump could represent a major escalation of tensions in the region, as would an October nuclear test or attack on South Korea’s border islands. It could also precipitate a major war in the region with the potential to spread worldwide. While China has, in the past, counseled Kim to refrain from overly bombastic or provocative behavior to keep tensions in the region low, their increasingly bellicose actions and rhetoric toward Taiwan suggest they may welcome regional chaos which Xi could then use as a pretext to attack that island nation.As Michael Schuman wrote for an article titled “Why Xi Wants Trump to Win” in The Atlantic:“By weakening U.S. standing abroad and democracy at home, Trump would offer Xi more opportunities than Biden to extend Chinese influence and win hearts and minds within the developing world.”Our government has noticed: Three months ago, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) published their Annual Threat Assessment. It was unambiguous about what they’re already seeing in the works for this election year:“The PRC [People’s Republic of China] may attempt to influence the U.S. elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire to sideline critics of China and magnify U.S. societal divisions. PRC actors’ have increased their capabilities to conduct covert influence operations and disseminate disinformation. ... The PRC aims to sow doubts about U.S. leadership, undermine democracy, and extend Beijing’s influence.”Similarly, The New York Times reported last month that China — in a move reminiscent of Putin’s millions of Internet Research Agency troll posts promoting Trump on Facebook leading up to the 2016 election — is all in on using social media, including, apparently, TikTok, to crush Biden and lift Trump into the White House:“Some of the Chinese accounts impersonate fervent Trump fans, including one on X that purported to be ‘a father, husband and son’ who was ‘MAGA all the way!!’ The accounts mocked Mr. Biden’s age and shared fake images of him in a prison jumpsuit, or claimed that Mr. Biden was a Satanist pedophile while promoting Mr. Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan.”Any of these actions by China could be a trigger for an international conflagration pitting America and Asian democracies against an axis of China, North Korea, and Russia. If Europe jumped in to help, we’d be in the middle of World War III faster than most imagine possible.Another hostile dictatorship that believes a Trump presidency would work to its advantage is Iran, which has worked with Republican presidential candidates before. It’s today run by the heirs to the regime that successfully handed the 1980 election to Reagan, and tried to help Trump get elected in 2020. As the DNI’s Annual Threat Assessment noted:“Ahead of the U.S. election in 2024, Iran may attempt to conduct influence operations aimed at U.S. interests, including targeting U.S. elections, having demonstrated a willingness and capability to do so in the past. During the U.S. election cycle in 2020, Iranian cyber actors obtained or attempted to obtain U.S. voter information, sent threatening emails to voters, and disseminated disinformation about the election.“The same Iranian actors have evolved their activities and developed a new set of techniques, combining cyber and influence capabilities, that Iran could deploy during the U.S. election cycle in 2024.”Given Iran’s role in supporting Hamas’ brutal raid on Israel last October and the increased pressure the Biden administration is putting them under, disrupting our election to put Trump — no fan of democracy — into office apparently makes a lot of sense to the violent mullahs clinging to power in that country. At the very least, Trump may dial back (as he did when president before) the efforts of Voice of America and other US propaganda and outreach efforts aimed at destabilizing the Iranian regime.Combine Iran’s efforts with those of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu — who is both openly hostile to President Biden (as he was to President Obama) and fond of Trump — and an expansion of conflict in the Middle East also has the potential to both influence the US election and lead to a larger international war.Netanyahu, under indictment for bribery and corruption with the cases against him paused until he’s no longer in office, has a powerful personal incentive to drag out the war (and the deaths of Gazans) just to stay out of prison. An alliance with a second Trump presidency would be political gold for him.Every time Netanyahu commits another war crime or gives America and the international community the middle finger over his use of famine as an instrument of war, more young Americans peel away from Biden in frustration. While they probably won’t vote for Trump, polling from 2020 shows that if they hadn’t shown up for Biden in that election, Trump would have held onto the presidency. And Netanyahu knows it.This past week, Trump told a group of wealthy Jewish donors that if student protests of Netanyahu’s policies in Gaza happened during his presidency, he would not only arrest them but he would strip them American citizenship and deport them from the country. It’s his most explicit shout out so far to Netanyahu, and will certainly encourage the Prime Minister to continue to ignore President Biden and enrage the Democratic base.Finally, Russia’s President Putin knows that a second Trump term will be like a gift from the gods. He’s lost over a half-million soldiers and a massive amounts of equipment in his brutal war against Ukraine, and is facing rising anger at home. Trump, who has essentially promised to cut off US support for that besieged nation, could literally save Putin’s life if his generals are thinking of taking him out the way Hitler’s tried to do.To that end, Russia and Saudi Arabia recently collaborated to cut oil production by 1.4 million barrels a day in an effort to drive up gas prices here in the US, just like they did in October/November of 2022. Since Trump let the Saudis buy the largest refinery in America (at Port Arthur, Texas), expect gas prices to be over $5/gallon this fall.The stakes are incredibly high for Putin; he may well think an attack against a NATO country, if not answered with a swift, massive response, would reveal weakness in the Biden administration that could help Trump this fall. And if NATO does respond vigorously, that could toss us into WWIII.Most recently, Trump shouted out to Putin in an echo of Reagan’s traitorous embrace of Iran, essentially asking him to humiliate Biden by holding onto imprisoned Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich until after the election. This has to encourage Russia’s truculence in the face of international pressure to stop killing Ukrainian civilians.Both the American Civil War and World War II came about when explicitly authoritarian leaders used military force to try to violently destroy democratic nations’ way of life. A predatory new axis has formed including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China that is every bit as opposed to representative government as was Hitler’s Third Reich. And Trump empowered them by killing the Iran nuclear deal President Obama had negotiated, allowing them to resume making nukes; embracing Kim and Xi; and giving top secret information to Putin. Meanwhile, three of those nations are actively involved in propaganda operations — principally exploiting social media and Republican politicians like Marjorie Taylor Greene and JD Vance — to denigrate democracy and majority rule and elevate oligarchy and strongman rule. Will one of these “help Trump get elected while advancing our own interests” scenarios by one or more of these axis nations lead to the end of democracy in America or a third world war? At this point it’s too early to tell, but EU and Asian democracies are increasingly worried about that exact scenario.In war, things can change suddenly in ways nobody anticipated; events frequently spiral out of control (as did the events leading to WWI). We all need to stay alert and remain outspoken about the dangers Trump represents, and do what we can to support democracy worldwide.Forewarned is forearmed: pass it along.NOW READ: Why the media doesn't talk to Biden's supporters",

The PRC aims to sow doubts about U.S. leadership, undermine democracy, and extend Beijing’s influence.” Similarly, The New York Times reported last month that China — in a move reminiscent of Putin’s millions of Internet Research Agency troll posts promoting Trump on Facebook leading up to the 2016 election — is all in on using social media, including, apparently, TikTok, to crush Biden and lift Trump into the White House: “Some of the Chinese accounts impersonate fervent Trump fans, including one on X that purported to be ‘a father, husband and son’ who was ‘MAGA all the way!!’ The accounts mocked Mr. Biden’s age and shared fake images of him in a prison jumpsuit, or claimed that Mr. Biden was a Satanist pedophile while promoting Mr. Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ slogan.” Any of these actions by China could be a trigger for an international conflagration pitting America and Asian democracies against an axis of China, North Korea, and Russia. If Europe jumped in to help, we’d be in the middle of World War III faster than most imagine possible. Another hostile dictatorship that believes a Trump presidency would work to its advantage is Iran, which has worked with Republican presidential candidates before. It’s today run by the heirs to the regime that successfully handed the 1980 election to Reagan, and tried to help Trump get elected in 2020. As the DNI’s Annual Threat Assessment noted : “Ahead of the U.S. election in 2024, Iran may attempt to conduct influence operations aimed at U.S. interests, including targeting U.S. elections, having demonstrated a willingness and capability to do so in the past. During the U.S. election cycle in 2020, Iranian cyber actors obtained or attempted to obtain U.S. voter information, sent threatening emails to voters, and disseminated disinformation about the election. “The same Iranian actors have evolved their activities and developed a new set of techniques, combining cyber and influence capabilities, that Iran could deploy during the U.S. election cycle in 2024.” Given Iran’s role in supporting Hamas’ brutal raid on Israel last October and the increased pressure the Biden administration is putting them under, disrupting our election to put Trump — no fan of democracy — into office apparently makes a lot of sense to the violent mullahs clinging to power in that country. At the very least, Trump may dial back (as he did when president before) the efforts of Voice of America and other US propaganda and outreach efforts aimed at destabilizing the Iranian regime. Combine Iran’s efforts with those of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu — who is both openly hostile to President Biden (as he was to President Obama) and fond of Trump — and an expansion of conflict in the Middle East also has the potential to both influence the US election and lead to a larger international war. Netanyahu, under indictment for bribery and corruption with the cases against him paused until he’s no longer in office, has a powerful personal incentive to drag out the war (and the deaths of Gazans) just to stay out of prison. An alliance with a second Trump presidency would be political gold for him. Every time Netanyahu commits another war crime or gives America and the international community the middle finger over his use of famine as an instrument of war, more young Americans peel away from Biden in frustration. While they probably won’t vote for Trump, polling from 2020 shows that if they hadn’t shown up for Biden in that election, Trump would have held onto the presidency. And Netanyahu knows it. This past week, Trump told a group of wealthy Jewish donors that if student protests of Netanyahu’s policies in Gaza happened during his presidency, he would not only arrest them but he would strip them American citizenship and deport them from the country. It’s his most explicit shout out so far to Netanyahu, and will certainly encourage the Prime Minister to continue to ignore President Biden and enrage the Democratic base. Finally, Russia’s President Putin knows that a second Trump term will be like a gift from the gods. He’s lost over a half-million soldiers and a massive amounts of equipment in his brutal war against Ukraine, and is facing rising anger at home. Trump, who has essentially promised to cut off US support for that besieged nation, could literally save Putin’s life if his generals are thinking of taking him out the way Hitler’s tried to do. To that end, Russia and Saudi Arabia recently collaborated to cut oil production by 1.4 million barrels a day in an effort to drive up gas prices here in the US, just like they did in October/November of 2022. Since Trump let the Saudis buy the largest refinery in America (at Port Arthur, Texas), expect gas prices to be over $5/gallon this fall. The stakes are incredibly high for Putin; he may well think an attack against a NATO country, if not answered with a swift, massive response, would reveal weakness in the Biden administration that could help Trump this fall. And if NATO does respond vigorously, that could toss us into WWIII. Most recently, Trump shouted out to Putin in an echo of Reagan’s traitorous embrace of Iran, essentially asking him to humiliate Biden by holding onto imprisoned Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich until after the election. This has to encourage Russia’s truculence in the face of international pressure to stop killing Ukrainian civilians. Both the American Civil War and World War II came about when explicitly authoritarian leaders used military force to try to violently destroy democratic nations’ way of life. A predatory new axis has formed including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China that is every bit as opposed to representative government as was Hitler’s Third Reich. And Trump empowered them by killing the Iran nuclear deal President Obama had negotiated, allowing them to resume making nukes; embracing Kim and Xi; and giving top secret information to Putin. Meanwhile, three of those nations are actively involved in propaganda operations — principally exploiting social media and Republican politicians like Marjorie Taylor Greene and JD Vance — to denigrate democracy and majority rule and elevate oligarchy and strongman rule. Will one of these “help Trump get elected while advancing our own interests” scenarios by one or more of these axis nations lead to the end of democracy in America or a third world war? At this point it’s too early to tell, but EU and Asian democracies are increasingly worried about that exact scenario. In war, things can change suddenly in ways nobody anticipated; events frequently spiral out of control (as did the events leading to WWI). We all need to stay alert and remain outspoken about the dangers Trump represents, and do what we can to support democracy worldwide. Forewarned is forearmed: pass it along. NOW READ: Why the media doesn't talk to Biden's supporters There has been a lot of speculation about what would have happened if Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Donald Trump for the Espionage Act case in another venue, as opposed to Florida, but that's a \"false premise,\" according to a former attorney with the CIA. Brian D. Greer, an attorney at the CIA's Office of General Counsel from 2010 to 2018, addressed recent claims that Smith should have brought the classified documents case in Washington, D.C., perhaps avoiding Judge Aileen Cannon, who has been accused of bias in favor of the ex-president who appointed her to her spot on the federal bench. \"Since the 'Smith should have just brought the documents case in DC' chorus is picking up again, it's time for a reminder as to why that's not true,\" Greer said Monday. \"Please read before continuing to propagate this false premise.\" ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy Greer goes on to say that \"Smith is bound by the Constitution, federal law, and case law -- which collectively requires that, at minimum, a 'conduct element' of the offense be committed in the district where it's charged.\" \"Let's look at the offenses,\" the lawyer added. \"For the Espionage Act charges, Trump is charged with unlawfully retaining the docs. The issue with charging him in DC is that he was still POTUS when he removed the docs from the White House down to Florida. He arguably was within his rights to do so, even if it's egregious.\" He continued: \"Simply put: it was not a crime while POTUS, even though that's hard to swallow. No conduct element in DC. For the Espionage Act charges, that might still leave a conspiracy charge. Was an 'overt act' committed in DC? Maybe, but Trump would have been POTUS when that act occurred.\" Greer goes on to say, \"Charging that 'overt act' would have run straight into a presidential immunity assertion, as handling classified records is likely to be seen as an official act while President.\" \"Everything that's happened w the J6 case would have happened here... except Trump would have had a better immunity argument, one that SCOTUS likely would have sided with, before trial,\" he added. \"So that leaves the various obstruction charges. There too, all of the 'conduct elements' for those charges occurred in Florida, not DC.\" Greer concluded by saying that \"having to charge the case in S.D. Florida, where drawing Cannon was very likely, completely sucked.\" \"But prosecutors are bound by the Constitution, the law, and reality -- so charging the case there was the right thing to do, and really the only [choice] they had,\" he added. \"Womp womp.\" CONTINUE READING Show less Former President Donald Trump's Memorial Day remarks were met with fierce backlash from a slew of journalists, as well as legal and political experts Monday. The MAGA leader's message — which was posted to Truth Social — included attacks on Judges Lewis Kaplan, who presided over two defamation cases against Trump from veteran writer E. Jean Carroll, and Arthur Engoron, who presided over the ex-president's New York civil fraud case. He also mentioned Judge Juan Merchan, who's presiding over Trump's hush money trial, which is expected to conclude this week. The former president wrote: Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country, & to the Radical Left, Trump Hating Federal Judge in New York that presided over, get this, TWO separate trials, that awarded a woman, who I never met before (a quick handshake at a celebrity event, 25 years ago, doesn't count!), 91 MILLION DOLLARS for 'DEFAMATION.' She didn't know when the so-called event took place - sometime in the 1990's - never filed a police report, didn't have to produce the 'dress' that she threatened me with (it showed negative!), & sung my praises in the first half of her CNN Interview with Alison Cooper, but changed her tune in the second half - Gee, I wonder why (UNDER APPEAL!)? The Rape charge was dropped by a jury! Or Arthur Engoron, the N.Y. State Wacko Judge who fined me almost 500 Million Dollars (UNDER APPEAL) for DOING NOTHING WRONG, used a Statute that has never been used before, gave me NO JURY, Mar-a-Lago at$18,000,000 - Now for Merchan!

He said House Democrats told him they did their job, while Republicans pushed the questions to House Speaker Mike Johnson. MacFarlane said Johnson's office provided the following statement to CBS News: \"The Speaker's office is working with the architect of the Capitol to get the plaque mounted.\" No date is certain, he added.

        "content": "By PTI Comments READ LATER Minority shareholders are expected to benefit from the demerger of ITC 's hotel business into a separate entity, ITC Hotels, as it may unlock value for them, and improve return ratios of the FMCG major, as per reports of four proxy advisory firms. The reports from proxy advisory firms, including InGovern Research Services, ISS and SES, come ahead of the June 6 meeting of shareholders of ITC to consider and approve the demerger proposal. According to proxy advisory firm ISS, the demerger may unlock value for its shareholders and improve ITC's return ratios. \"The structure will enable ITC Hotels to operate with an optimal capital structure with the ability to access capital to fund its growth requirements. \"It can attract the right set of investors, strategic partners and collaborations whose investment strategies are more sharply aligned with that of the hospitality industry,\" ISS said in its report. Last year in August, ITC board had approved the demerger of its hotels business into a separate entity. Shareholders of ITC will get one share in the soon-to-be-listed hotel entity for every 10 shares they hold in the company. Highlighting the benefit of demerger, another advisory firm InGovern said that the current ITC shareholders will receive a direct stake in a dedicated, publicly traded hotel entity, becoming shareholders of a specialised company focused solely on the hotel business. This move aligns with ITC's corporate strategy of fostering multiple growth drivers, ensuring continued interest in the hotel sector, and protecting against potential hostile takeovers in the future, it said. \"Given the clean swap of shares which is beneficial for the minority shareholders as well as for the growth of both the companies, we recommend shareholders vote for this scheme of arrangement,\" it said. Proxy advisory firm SES is of the view that the decision to keep 40 per cent stake with ITC, is a strategic decision to give stability and allow fair discovery of price and is in interest of shareholders. SES does not identify any major concern with regard to the proposed demerger. Another proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, has also recommended the proposed demerger scheme. However, Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) has suggested shareholders of ITC Ltd to vote against the proposed demerger of the hotel business on the grounds that it does not provide complete value unlocking for shareholders.

(Image: Getty) Formula One fans have shared a theory that Charles Leclerc jinxed Max Verstappen , which could lead to the Ferrari ace winning his maiden Drivers’ Championship title. Leclerc held his nerve on the narrow streets of Monaco to secure a first-ever victory on home soil. The 26-year-old finished seven seconds ahead of second-placed Oscar Piastri, with Leclerc narrowing the gap at the top of the standings. He now sits just 31 points behind Verstappen, whose hopes of securing a fourth straight world championship title have hit a roadblock. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114291&playerApiId=v114291');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114291\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Related articles Lewis Hamilton raises George Russell suspicion as Mercedes urged to shun star Mick Schumacher speaks out as son of Michael in line for second chance in F1 Verstappen remains the favourite to take home this year’s championship, but the emergence of Leclerc as a serious contender has whet the appetite of Formula One fans. What’s more, supporters have shared an interesting theory that Leclerc may have jinxed his Dutch counterpart through the medium of music. Leclerc, who spends a lot of his spare time playing the piano, is a published musician, with his discography including three songs titled AUS23, MIA23, and MON23 - the abbreviations for the Australian, Miami and Monaco GPs. Well, eagle-eyed supporters have pointed out that the three song titles also correspond to the only races Verstappen hasn’t won so far this season. Read more...

The Type 45 destroyer, which set sail from Portsmouth today, will relieve sister ship HMS Diamond, which has shielding vessels from Houthi attacks since before Christmas. Like Diamond, HMS Duncan is armed with the Sea Viper missile system and equipped with the same radar systems, enabling it to detect threats from long distances.

HMS Duncan’s 200 men and women have worked to ensure that their ship is ready to deploy, successfully completing trials and training last week in preparation for the deployment, which will see the ship work to ensure freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for merchant vessels.

Read our Privacy Policy HMS Duncan spent five months leading NATO’s premier task group in the Mediterranean Sea last year, prior to handing over flagship duties to the Italian Navy in December. The ship is now ready for more operations, with more than 60 new members joining the ship’s company. A missile splashed down in the waters of the Red Sea last Thursday (May 24), but caused no damage to a passing commercial vessel. The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack, although it can take hours or even days for them to acknowledge their assaults. Trending The attack happened in the southern Red Sea near the crucial Bab el-Mandeb Strait, theUnited Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations Centre said. The private security firm Ambrey similarly reported the attack. The Houthis have launched attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding that Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the United States Maritime Administration. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat.

        "description": "The UAE excels in road quality, port services, and public transport, boosting tourism and attracting investment. Discover how these rankings impact travelers and the tourism industry.The post Understanding how tourists will enjoy visiting UAE appeared first on Travel And Tour World.",
        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 The UAE has achieved remarkable global rankings in various infrastructure sectors, which is set to significantly impact tourists, travelers, and tourism businesses. According to the Travel and Tourism Development Index 2024 report by the World Economic Forum, the UAE ranks fifth globally and first among Arab countries in road quality. Additionally, it ranks ninth globally and first among Arab countries in the efficiency of port services and tenth globally and second among Arab countries in public transport efficiency. Strategic Vision and Leadership Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, attributes these accomplishments to the forward-looking vision of the UAE’s leadership. He emphasized that these rankings validate the country’s long-term strategic plans, which are designed to foster growth and development. Al Mazrouei highlighted that these achievements showcase the UAE’s proactive approach and strategic planning across various sectors, reinforcing the nation’s ambition to be recognized globally for innovation and excellence. Impact on Tourists and Travelers For tourists and travelers, the UAE’s high rankings in infrastructure translate to enhanced travel experiences. The superior quality of roads ensures smoother and safer journeys across the country. Efficient port services facilitate seamless entry and exit for cruise passengers and goods, enhancing the overall travel experience. The top-tier public transport services offer tourists reliable and comfortable means to explore the UAE, contributing to a hassle-free visit. Boosting Confidence Among Investors Al Mazrouei noted that these high rankings also play a crucial role in boosting the confidence of international investors. The UAE’s robust infrastructure creates a reliable and attractive business environment, encouraging foreign investments. This influx of investment is expected to spur further development in the tourism sector, creating more opportunities for both local and international tourism businesses. Benchmark for Quality Hanan Mansour Ahli, Director of the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre, stated that the UAE’s infrastructure now serves as a benchmark for quality. The country’s adherence to the highest standards and best practices across roads, public transport, and port services sets it apart on the global stage. These developments are poised to attract foreign investments, which will further enhance the UAE’s GDP. Tourism Industry Benefits Tourism businesses in the UAE are likely to benefit greatly from these developments. The improved infrastructure means that travel agencies, hotels, and tour operators can offer their clients more efficient and enjoyable travel experiences. The enhanced reputation of the UAE as a top travel destination will likely lead to increased tourist arrivals, boosting the local economy and creating more job opportunities in the tourism sector. Opportunities for Growth The UAE’s strategic investments in infrastructure not only enhance the quality of life for residents but also create a more appealing destination for tourists.

        "description": "Anchal Bhateja lost her eyesight just before her board exams. She chose to keep her dreams alive and worked twice as hard as her peers to become a lawyer. Here's how she and others like her found their way in life using screen readers and other such tools of digital inclusion.",
        "content": "“Once blindness takes over, it shatters your world and you don’t know what to do, where to go, especially after the doctor says that they can’t do anything at this point,” explains Anchal Bhateja when asked about how she coped after going completely blind as a school student. Anchal was born with low vision due to complications at the time of her birth. While she was able to cope in a mainstream school till class 10, she completely lost her vision right before her board exams. Following her diagnosis, Anchal had to chart out a path for herself on her own — from taking her exams with the assistance of a scribe to figuring out tools that would help her complete her education. At this point, she met another blind person in her hometown, Bhatinda, who used computers with a screen reader. Anchal learned quite a bit from him and thus, her journey with digital accessibility devices began. She completed her schooling by referring to audiobooks of her course and used a scribe to appear for the exams. The is celebrated on the third Thursday of May every year. The day strives to get the international community together to talk and build awareness about Digital Accessibility for disabled persons. The mission for Digital Accessibility is spearheaded by Through GAAD, impacted communities worldwide make the case for digital accessibility for diverse disabilities. There are approximately in the world, and creating accessible digital technology is important from a civil rights as well as a business perspective. Life after diagnosis “I had to figure it out all on my own. Most people, including my father, initially felt that I would not be able to continue my education. Despite my father being educated, he still didn’t know what was the way forward for me. I don’t blame them, that’s what any lay person feels about blindness,” she says. Determined to continue her education, Anchal appeared for the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) and went on to become the first blind student to study at the National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru. With the admissions season upon us, every recent school graduate and their parents have been worried about the upcoming entrance exams. Anchal’s story is also a reminder to each one of us about how this too shall pass. In spite of all the hurdles, Anchal completed law school in 2023 and is currently working as a lawyer at one of the top law firms in India. However, her story doesn’t end with just clearing the CLAT Exams. In fact, that was the beginning in a number of ways. As a first-year student, Anchal used to write her exams with the help of a scribe until her Legal Theory professor recommended she type out her answers. Initially reluctant, Anchal took her laptop to the exam hall and began typing out her responses. Surprisingly, she was able to finish it within 3 hours. There was no looking back after this. Anchal went on to take all her exams on her laptop without the assistance of a scribe. “I was always offered half an hour extra but I never needed it; I was always one of the first students to finish writing,” gleams Anchal. “Now that I work in Telecom Media and Technology Law, my friends joke that my entire life is in virtual space. I use apps for grocery, for cabs, for everything!” she shares. Newer technological innovations and services, especially app-based deliveries and services, have made . Lack of digital infrastructure a major challenge Not having the proper digital accessibility and awareness continues to pose a challenge. As per the latest Web Accessibility Report by over 95% of the home pages of 1,000,000 most visited websites had accessibility issues. This means that even , a number of web spaces remain inaccessible. This has an impact on their work as well. In her work as a lawyer, Anchal has to access case judgments using online archives. However, websites that the courts accept don’t have accessibility built into them. As a result, Anchal often has to rely on someone else to help her navigate through these websites. Other than this, Anchal mentions how even the IT staff is not fully aware of how a screen reader works and how it can be amalgamated with the softwares used at the workplace. Anchal’s journey underscores the critical need for widespread accessibility awareness. The Rights of Persons with Disability Act, 2016 mandates all institutions and workplaces to provide reasonable accommodation and accessible infrastructure. This includes offering accessible materials and resources and conducting regular accessibility audits to identify and address infrastructural barriers and providing training and support to employees with disabilities, along with conducting sensitisation programmes for other employees and people in the workplace or institution. Law is a competitive and demanding profession which requires one to do a lot of reading and documentation. The general understanding so far has been that this would not be appropriate for a visually-impaired person. However, digital innovations have made it possible for persons with disabilities to add to the diversity of the profession. Inclusivity IRL When asked about the disability inclusion journey at her organisation, Seema (name changed), a human resources manager based out of Delhi, says “Including persons with disabilities has helped the organisation in several unintended ways. Beyond just creating a more equitable workforce, having PwDs at the workplace has helped us relook at our policies, processes and infrastructure from a new perspective.” As more and more employers warm up to the idea of employing lawyers with disabilities, the industry is also moving towards becoming a more inclusive space for all. Echoing this sentiment, Amar Jain, a visually impaired lawyer and accessibility professional, says “As a lawyer with a disability, we face enormous barriers. The data provided by clients is not accessible, the physical case files don’t have digital copies. However, there are a number of progressive steps being taken by the judicial system.” “For instance, the Delhi High Court recently released a mandate to provide digital copies of case files to lawyers with disabilities. The landscape is changing, slowly but surely,” he adds. A little understanding can go a long way in such a situation. Anchal interned at Justice DY Chandrachud’s chambers as a student. She remembers how forthcoming they were with respect to offering ‘Reasonable Accommodations’ to help her work better. “We need to make case briefs with page number references. As a visually-impaired person, it is sometimes difficult to find the right page number, so I use paragraph numbers instead and this request of mine was accommodated and helped me better do my work,” she explains. Anchal also recollects how she received a letter from Justice Chandrachud upon completing the internship in his chamber. “He told me that my research skills were remarkable and that he faced no challenges in using the briefs prepared by me. He was also an understanding senior as he was open to me working in my own way and using slightly different formats to present my briefs,” she shares. Aanchal’s story is more than just an individual’s triumph over adversity, it is a powerful call to action for building a truly inclusive society. By promoting accessibility awareness and implementing robust support systems, we can empower everyone regardless of ability to reach their full potential. Anchal’s journey is just one of the many. . This can be found in a number of different forms. From adaptive keyboards to speech to text softwares, technology has come a long way in finding ways to accommodate human diversity, all that is remaining is a sincere effort from us to integrate it into our lives.",

        "content": "Bengaluru: Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara on Tuesday indicated that the next procedure to bring back Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of sexually abusing several women, from abroad will commence if he does not turn up on May 31. His statement comes a day after Prajwal released a video statement that he will appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) and cooperate with the inquiry. “We have taken all efforts within the country to bring Prajwal back. We have written to the central government, we have obtained a warrant against him, which we have informed the Ministry of Home and External Affairs. Also, a Blue Corner Notice has been issued. In the meantime, he released a video message about his return,” Parameshwara told reporters. Prajwal’s decision to come back is appropriate as no one can escape from the clutches of law, he said. “It is said that his membership will expire if he loses the election, and his diplomatic passport will also be impounded. Considering all this he might have decided to come back.” Once Prajwal returns, the legal process would begin, he said, “I don’t know what prompted him to release that video... We will see what happens on May 31. If he doesn’t turn up, the next procedure will start.” To a question, would Prajwal be arrested at the immigration centre when he lands here, Parameshwara said, SIT will decide it. “There is already a Blue Corner Notice, arrest warrant, notices have been served asking him to appear before SIT. A chargesheet and other things will be done later. Now we have to find out the truth,” he said, replying to a question if he will be arrested upon surrender. Asked about Prajwal’s allegation that Congress conspired against him, the Home Minister said, “Let’s see all those things. SIT will consider all those things.” Prajwal (33), the grandson of JD(S) patriarch H D Deve Gowda and the NDA candidate from Hassan Lok Sabha segment, is facing charges of sexually abusing women. He reportedly left for Germany on April 27, a day after Hassan went to polls, and is still at large. A ‘Blue Corner Notice’ seeking information on his whereabouts has already been issued by Interpol, following a request by the SIT via the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A Special Court for Elected Representatives issued an arrest warrant on May 18 against Prajwal Revanna, following an application moved by the SIT. To a question on BJP’s protest against alleged rise in murders in the state and brand Bengaluru taking a hit, the Minister said, “protesting is their right, we are not saying that they should not protest. We will respond to it at the appropriate time.” Claiming that the law and order situation in Karnataka was good, he said, “murders have been reported unfortunately... They should not have happened. I will also release the data on the crime rate and number of murders that took place when BJP was in power. Also, drug cases during their time.”",

        "description": "It is recommended that elected officials may be the subject of a public report even if corruption allegations are not proven, if the report is purely factual and in the public interest.",
        "content": "A landmark review has recommended Queensland's anti-corruption watchdog should be able to report on corruption allegations about elected officials even if the person is not found guilty. The report by former Queensland Chief Justice Catherine Holmes recommends law changes, but they won't give the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) unfettered powers. Justice Holmes recommended the CCC be able to make public reports retrospectively, provided it satisfied specific criteria. A 2023 High Court ruling blocked the CCC from publicly releasing a report into the The dismissed appeal meant the CCC was unable to publicly release reports and media releases about other investigations. An independent review was announced in February and handed to the government last week. Justice Holmes noted in the review it became clear a \"one size fits all\" approach would not be suitable. \"The conclusions I have reached almost certainly will not please all, but they set up a workable regime which balances the considerations of human rights protection and the desirability of public sector transparency and accountability,\" she said. Public interest and retrospective ruling Justice Holmes made 16 recommendations in the almost 500-page report, with the first outlining that CCC public reports and statements should be made in the public interest. Some factors it must take into account include: Public reports on individual corruption investigations will be allowed where serious conduct has been substantiated by a court, tribunal, or disciplinary process. Elected officials may be the subject of a public report even if corruption allegations are not proven, \"provided it contains no critical commentary or expression of opinion concerning them\", other than if the allegations of corruption are unsubstantiated. Anyone identifiable in a CCC public report will be given 30 days to submit whether it should be anonymised. Government to accept recommendations Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath said the government will adopt all the review's recommendations. \"Ms Holmes has considered all sides of the issue of public reporting and left no stone unturned in delivering a clear and balanced set of recommendations,\" she said. \"There is a clear public interest in the CCC being able to report on corruption matters. This is vital for the transparency and accountability of our democratic institutions. \"Public reporting cannot occur at the expense of due process and proper regard to individual rights. Respect for these values is equally important.\" Review sparked by high-profile cases Former state public trustee Peter Carne was investigated for corruption by the CCC in 2018. He was cleared and not criminally prosecuted. The CCC moved to make its report on the investigation public through state parliament but Mr Carne took legal action to block the move. His initial case in Queensland's Supreme Court failed but the Court of Appeal overturned the decision on appeal. The CCC then took its fight to the High Court but it was dismissed. Former Deputy Premier Jackie Trad also launched a bid in the Supreme Court to suppress a separate CCC report. Under parliamentary privilege, Deputy Opposition Leader Jarrod Bleijie said the investigation related to the independent recruitment process of former under treasurer Frankie Carroll in 2019. It's not known if the report made any findings against Ms Trad. The case was dismissed last year after the CCC conceded it had . At the time, Ms Trad welcomed the outcome, saying the CCC's conduct had a \"significant impact on my political career and my family over the past three years\".",

        "description": "Cape Town Spurs CEO Alexi Efstathiou has explained why one of his most-wanted youngsters, Luke Baartman, did not feature in the last match of the season against Kaizer Chiefs.",
        "content": "Spurs's 2-0 home win over Amakhosi saw the sleeping giant finishing outside the Top Eight in the DStv Premiership log table, marking an end to what has been the visitors' worst season in the PSL era. The absence of \"Boere\", as the talented Baartman is fondly known in football circles, caught the eye. This was more so because the last time the two sides had met, in November 2023 at FNB Stadium, Baartman came from the bench to score a stunning goal past Itumeleng Khune. The youngster is one of the players that form part of the Chiefs faithful's wish-list ahead of what is hoped to be a much improved season for the Soweto giants, hence the question marks regarding his absence from the team sheet on Saturday. The highly-rated 17-year-old made 10 appearances for the Urban Warriors in all competitions, and saw a return of league goals in what was a challenging season for the Urban Warriors. Speaking to , Efstathiou explained why the teenage sensation could not take part in the exciting encounter. \"The reason he was not part of the team that played against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday is because he is writing exams, he is in Matric,\" Efstathiou revealed. Nevertheless, the likes of Asanele Velebayi and Ashley Cupido gave a five-star performance at DHL Stadium to heap more misery on Cavin Johnson's men, who would have been pleased to hear the sound of the final whistle as it marked the end of a season to forget for them. As for Baartman and a couple of his teammates who have been linked with moves away from Spurs, it remains to be seen if they will be wearing new colours in the new campaign.",

        "content": "A woman has confessed to eating her grandmother's ashes in a bid to cheer her grieving mum up following her death. Cheyenne, from the city of Narre Warren in Australia , shared how she put her nan's cremated remains in a bowl so she could consume them. Since then, she has encouraged her mother to join in and sprinkled them on her brother's pasta on another occasion. However, her sibling seemed to be unaware of what she had done. Despite the controversial decision, Cheyenne believes her grandparents will live on in her \"forever\" after using her as a garnish. She said her mother didn't seem to mind the suggestion because it was \"just for fun.\" She revealed her bizarre actions after calling into Fox's Melbourne breakfast show during their 'Cashfessional' segment. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Host Fifi Box was left stunned when a caller admitting to consuming her nan's ashes ( Image: Fox) But hosts Fifi, Fev & Nick were left speechless after they asked Cheyenne what her confession was. \"I ate my Nan,\" she said. \"My Nan passed away in August last year and got cremated. My family and I were grieving, so we went over to Mum's one night and we thought to cheer her up again... let's eat Nan.\" All three presenters gasped in shock following the unexpected outburst, which led the grandaughter to further explain her actions. \"After I did it once, I got Mum to do it because I didn't want to be alone in it. But that's not the only part of the story... this is the part I've told nobody. My brother got out of jail not too long ago,\" she added. The hosts were left in 'shock' by the confession ( Image: Fox) Fev, 43, interrupted and said \"Oh God\" before Cheyenne explained that she wanted to prank her brother who was finally out of jail. \"I put some of Nan's ashes in the pasta sauce,\" she giggled. Co-host Fifi Box, 47, said she was trying to wrap her head around the concept before she asked: \"This is so much for me. I'm taking this on board. Have you stopped eating her?\" In response, Cheyanne said: \"I'll say yes for your sake, Fifi. I eat her just for fun. Nan will live on through me forever.\" Fev rounded up the conversation and commented: \"I'm a little bit shocked. I don't get shocked too often.\"",

The market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 7.34% during the forecast period. For more insights on the forecast market size and historic data (2018 - 2022) - The global home decor market is experiencing significant growth due to the increasing demand for eco-friendly furniture and interiors. This trend is driven by both consumer preference and environmental regulations. The health concerns associated with traditional furniture, which emits harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are also fueling this demand. As a result, there is a strong focus on sustainable materials such as reclaimed wood, rubberwood, bamboo, rattan, and wicker. Popular furniture companies are responding to this trend by offering certified and salvaged products, contributing to the expansion of the eco-friendly office furniture market. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 8.5 million tonnes of office furniture are disposed of annually, highlighting the need for sustainable alternatives. The home decor market is currently experiencing a surge in trends, with smart technology leading the way. Devices such as voice assistants, urban planning, and bedrooms are being integrated with technology for convenience and efficiency. Carpets and consoles are popular decor choices, with consumers seeking rugs and room dividers that add style and function to their spaces. Bedrooms are a focus area, with consumers looking for comfortable and stylish bedding and storage solutions. Prefabricated and consumer-friendly home decor solutions are also gaining traction, offering affordability and ease of installation. Overall, the home decor market is seeing a shift towards practicality, convenience, and technology integration. Research report provides comprehensive data on impact of trend, driver and challenges - The furniture sector in the global home decor market experiences continuous growth due to consumers' desire for functional and stylish home solutions. This category encompasses products like sofas, chairs, tables, beds, and storage units, with designs ranging from traditional to modern. The preference for wooden furniture among middle- and high-income demographics fuels this growth, driven by its superior quality and aesthetic value. Furthermore, the increasing adoption of modular kitchens and closets, as well as eco-friendly materials, broadens the market scope. Ashley Global Retail LLC, a leading American manufacturer and retailer, offers a diverse range of home furnishings, including the Signature Design by Ashley sofa collections, the Bolanburg dining room set, and the Porter bedroom series, catering to various preferences. Consequently, the increasing demand for furniture products will propel the furniture segment's expansion in the home decor market during the forecast period. For more information on market segmentation with geographical analysis including forecast (2024-2028) and historic data (2017-2021) - The home decor market encompasses a wide range of products, including furniture, textiles, and floor coverings, catering to the needs of small-sized houses and enhancing living standards. Skilled labor plays a crucial role in the production of these items, ensuring high-quality craftsmanship.

        "content": "28 May 2024 The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has agreed to pay a $10 million fine to settle charges that it caused nine wholly-owned subsidiaries – including the New York Stock Exchange – to violate a rule requiring them to notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of a ‘cyber intrusion’ within 24 hours. The matter stems from events that occurred in April 2021, when ICE personnel did not notify legal and compliance officials at its subsidiaries even after determining that a “threat actor” had inserted a malicious code into a virtual private network device used to remotely access its corporate network. Instead, they took four days to assess its impact and internally conclude it was a minor event, according to the order. “The respondents in [this] enforcement action include the world’s largest stock exchange and a number of other prominent intermediaries that, given their roles in our markets, are subject to strict reporting requirements when they experience cyber events,” Gurbir S. Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, said in a statement. “When it comes to cybersecurity, especially events at critical market intermediaries, every second counts and four days can be an eternity.” The settlement sheds light on monetary costs of cyber threats that extend to penalties incurred for non-compliance with regulations that require disclosures be done in a timely manner. The burden of regulatory compliance in the wake of cyber attacks has also risen as new SEC rules have recently gone into effect that require companies to determine the materiality of a cyber security incident “without unreasonable delay following discovery and, if the incident is determined material, file an Item 1.05 Form 8-K generally within four business days of such determination.” In the case of the ICE matter, it was the Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity rule that required the subsidiaries to immediately let the SEC know of cyber intrusions into their systems if they could not immediately determine that it will have a minimal impact, according to the release. Under the rule, the subsidiaries would have been required to immediately contact SEC staff about the problem and provide an update within 24 hours unless they could determine that it had a minor impact. As a result of ICE’s failure to let them know of the event, the subsidiaries didn’t comply with the rule. In a statement emailed to CFO Dive by a spokesperson, ICE said the settlement involved an “unsuccessful attempt to access our network more than three years ago. The failed incursion had zero impact on market operations. At issue was the timeframe for reporting this type of event under Regulation SCI.” The penalty drew criticism from two of the agency’s members, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, who voiced objections in a statement on the agency’s website. “Entities covered by Regulation SCI should comply with the rule’s notification requirements and communicate SCI events to the Commission; however, imposing a $10 million civil penalty on ICE for its subsidiaries’ failure to notify the Commission of a single, de minimis incident is an overreaction. Unfortunately, this type of response is increasingly common in Commission enforcement actions,” the statement said. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, ICE and its subsidiaries, which included Archipelago Trading Services, the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE American, NYSE Arca, ICE Clear Credit, ICE Clear Europe, NYSE Chicago, NYSE National, and the Securities Industry Automation Corporation, agreed to a cease-and-desist order in addition to ICE’s monetary penalty.

        "description": "Jade Williams, 31, began getting heavy periods after the birth of her first child and they grew heavier and heavier over the years - but doctors couldn't figure out why",
        "content": "A mum with bleeding so heavy she got through 30 pads a day - costing £600-a-year - discovered it's because she has two uteruses. Jade Williams, 31, began getting heavy periods after the birth of her first child, Elouise, in November 2012, when she was 19. They grew heavier and heavier over the years but doctors didn't know why. Even after having three more children - Ajay, seven, Maisie, five, and Sienna, four - Jade's bleeding persisted and doctors struggled to pinpoint the reason. They tried her on various medication but nothing worked and the bleeding became so intense she would have to wear nappy-sized period pads and two pairs of trousers to avoid leaks. She would get through 30 pads a day - costing her around £600-a-year - and would bloat so much she was \"bigger than during pregnancy \". Eventually in late 2023 she switched to a different hospital and demanded answers. An exploratory surgery revealed an unexpected outcome - she was bleeding from two uteruses. Despite having been through four pregnancies and countless scans, the rare condition - known as uterus didelphys - had been missed. Skincare expert warns people not to 'waste money' on latest anti-ageing trend Jade at hospital ( Image: Jade Williams/SWNS) Jade has had an IUS coil fitted since then and the bleeding has been significantly reduced, meaning she can go about her daily life again without worry for the first time in years. Jade, a McDonalds manager, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: \"I had always had heavy bleeding after my first daughter. \"I could barely leave the house - I was wearing underwear, pads, leggings, trousers, and then I'd still have to go home and change. Doctors gave me pills but nothing would help and I would bloat so much I would be bigger than when I was pregnant. They told me it would stop on its own, and not to worry - but of course I did worry. \"When I found out I was bleeding so much because I have two uteruses I couldn't believe it. They said I was one-in-a-million. Since the bleeding has been under control I have been able to go back to work - and I'll be able to wear shorts and dresses for the first time this summer. But this condition ruined my life for ten years - and we need more research into it.\" Jade began bleeding after her first pregnancy and never stopped - with it getting heavier over time. She didn't even stop bleeding during her next three pregnancies and it would be accompanied by horrible cramps. She said she was \"constantly in touch with the hospital and GP\" and was prescribed medications, but said nothing helped. It affected every aspect of her life - with her needing to cancel plans, take time off work and change clothes several times a day no matter how much sanitary protection she wore. Her sex life struggled as she had to double up on underwear instead of sporting lingerie and the bed \"would look like a crime scene after\". Jade with partner Anthony Nunn ( Image: Tony Kershaw/SWNS) After a decade with no idea what was causing it, Jade - who is engaged to Anthony Nunn, 41 - put her foot down and demanded answers. She even moved to a different hospital in the hope it would be taken seriously. She said: \"I said 'I can't keep living like this' - I needed two pads and two pairs of trousers at a time. I knew it wasn't normal and it wasn't going away.\" In October 2023 she went in for a scan and was called in for an emergency biopsy shortly after. Jade had needed treatment to have cancer cells removed from her cervix directly after her first pregnancy over a decade earlier. After seeing her scan, doctors revealed the bleeding wasn't due to endometriosis, as she had suspected - so Jade became increasingly worried the cancer was still present. After further biopsies and an exploratory surgery the following month, Jade was told she was cancer-free after all. But doctors went on to tell her the reason her bleeding was so heavy - is because she was bleeding from two uteruses fused together. She said: \"They said it was one-in-a-million. They said the condition causes pre-term labour, and all my babies were early so that makes sense.\" The doctors also removed nine uterine polyps during the procedure. Medics were unsure why, but after the surgery, her second uterus started to fail - and eventually blocked off. So after having a Merina coil inserted into her one remaining functional uterus, her bleeding has slowed to a spotting and become manageable. She said: \"My situation is a lot better now. Before, I was constantly using heat pads and getting through 30 sanitary towels a day - it was so bad. In summer I'd need to wear a jacket in case I needed to tie it around my waist - people would ask 'are you hot? and I'd say 'yes!'. \"Now I can go swimming with my kids - whenever they asked before, I would have to say no. Finally I know the reason why and I can have more of a normal life. But there's not much awareness and I still never really got answers. I want more women to be aware of it and I want there to be more information out there.\"",

        "content": "Spain, Ireland and Norway are moving to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, a step toward a long-held Palestinian aspiration that was fueled by international outrage over the civilian deaths and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip following Israel’s offensive. The joint decision by two European Union countries plus Norway, a nation with a strong diplomatic tradition in peacemaking, may generate momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state by other EU countries and could spur further steps at the United Nations, deepening Israel’s isolation. Previously seven member of the 27-nation European Union officially recognized a Palestinian state. Five of them are former east bloc countries who announced recognition in 1988, as did Cyprus, before joining the bloc. Sweden's recognition came in 2014. The Czech Republic, an EU member, says that the 1988 recognition by the former Czechoslovakia — of which it then formed a part — does not apply to the modern state. Slovakia's Foreign Ministry says that the two sides confirmed their mutual recognition when Slovakia was becoming independent in 1992-93, and that the Palestinian state has a fully functioning embassy in Bratislava since 2006. EU members Malta and Slovenia say they may follow suit, though not immediately. Some 140 of the about 190 countries represented in the U.N. have already recognized a Palestinian state. Here’s a look at how and why the new European announcements could be important: A U.N. partition plan in 1947 called for the creation of a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state, but Palestinians and the wider Arab world rejected it because it would have given them less than half of the land even though Palestinians made up two-thirds of the population. The Arab-Israeli war the following year left Israel with even more territory, Jordan in control of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and Egypt in control of Gaza. In the 1967 war, Israel seized all three territories, and decades of on-again, off-again peace talks have failed. The United States, Britain and other Western countries have backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel as a solution to the Middle East’s most intractable conflict, but they insist Palestinian statehood should come as part of a negotiated settlement. There have been no substantive negotiations since 2009. Though the EU countries and Norway won’t be recognizing an existing state, just the possibility of one, the symbolism helps enhance the Palestinians’ international standing and heaps more pressure on Israel to open negotiations on ending the war. Also, the move lends additional prominence to the Middle East issue ahead of June 6-9 elections to the European Parliament . Diplomatic pressure on Israel has grown as the battle with Hamas stretches into its eighth month. The U.N. General Assembly voted by a significant margin on May 11 to grant new “rights and privileges” to Palestine in a sign of growing international support for a vote on full voting membership. The Palestinian Authority currently has observer status. The leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia said in March they were considering recognizing a Palestinian state as “a positive contribution” toward ending the war. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said that his Cabinet would certify the formal recognition after a meeting Tuesday. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez said. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by the three countries might make. Even so, their recognition would mark a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Little would likely change on the ground in the short term. Peace talks are stalled, and Israel’s hardline government has dug its heels in against Palestinian statehood. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez’s government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Israel, which rejects any move to legitimize the Palestinians internationally, recalled its ambassadors to Ireland, Norway and Spain after they announced the decision last week. Steps like the ones by the three European countries will harden the Palestinian position and undermine the negotiating process, Israel says, insisting that all issues should be solved through negotiations. Israel often responds to foreign countries’ decisions deemed as going against its interests by summoning those countries’ ambassadors and also punishing the Palestinians through measures such as freezing tax transfers to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority. Some 140 countries have already recognized a Palestinian, more than two-thirds of the United Nations' membership. Some major powers have indicated their stance may be evolving amid the outcry over the consequences of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between noncombatants and fighters in its count. Israel launched the offensive following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Britain has said no recognition of a Palestinian state could come while Hamas remains in Gaza, but that it could happen while Israeli negotiations with Palestinian leaders were in progress. France has indicated that it isn’t ready to join other countries in recognizing a Palestinian state, even if it isn’t opposed to the idea in principle. German has said it will not recognize a Palestinian state for the time being. Follow AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

Gupta expresses pride in this achievement, emphasizing the importance of offering great vegetarian options in the popular Madrid neighborhood. While talking to us, she opens up about being an entrepreneur. Read the exclusive story here.",
        "content": "Earlier in an interview with Bombay Times actress Esha Gupta spoke how her partner Manuel Campos Guallar, (Spanish-entrepreneur) helped her set her business. The actress who is in Madrid right now has finally set her business and started a restaurant chain. “It’s an achievement that I’m really proud of myself to be honest. Building something from the start and seeing it turn into a reality,” she tells us exclusively. “Madrid is second home to me, it only seemed right to jump into this partnership when the opportunity arose,” Gupta adds. Ask the actress what prompted her to kick start her own restaurant, and she mentions, “I’ve been cribbing about Spain not having enough vegetarian options at good places, and when we were coming with the concept, the main priority was great veg options which everyone enjoys unexpectedly. Apart from the amazing food, it’s a more bespoke kinda place in the most famous neighbourhood of Madrid.” The actress who was last seen in , is enjoying being an entrepreneur , however, she also busts the myth that one should not come under pressure to become an entrepreneur. “Don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think we should put this pressure on anyone and compare. I became an actor by chance and gods will, but business is what I’m building. I think everyone should do what they feel is right for them. I’ve always had a “baniya buddhi” like they say. But being a mom and taking care of your family is more tiresome, so I would say women should do as it pleases them, without the expectations of the society, but be respected in everything they do.” Currently, she is happy in “life and with the people” she has. “I am satisfied, not so much as there is so much more to do, whether it’s personal growth or professional. I am just starting. Keeping my focus on other things which are in the pipeline,” she signs off.",

Gardening enthusiasts are facing the annual battle with weeds , despite the less-than-ideal weather conditions, reports the Express . One individual took to Reddit to highlight the extent of their weed problem as they asked for advice on their weed issues - with pathways and gravel areas overrun. They said: \"How to get rid of weeds in between the stones of my pathway and gravel road?\" Fellow green-fingered folk have been quick to offer their two pence on the matter. One person suggested: \"I used a weed torch to get weeds that pop up along our driveway and brick patio. It is quick and you don't need to spray chemicals.\" Another chimed in with: \"Landscaped for a good while. Weed torch is fun but is routine. I would pour boiling salt water all over those weeds.\" A third advised: \"Near boiling water, string Weeder, flame weeding.\" Someone else recommended a mix of \"white vinegar 1/3 pail of hot water.\" And another shared their extensive experience, writing: \"I have five aces, which includes a couple of paved areas and a long gravel driveway. I have tried the propane torch, salt, pulling manually, and vinegar. None of these methods have worked beyond a month and they all took a long time to complete.\" They continued: \"I'm at the point where I'm about to embrace the growth and plant some sort of moss between the pavers (I've read you can blend moss into a slurry and pour it between the cracks to grow -I have yet to try it). I'm not sure about the gravel driveway though.\" One more added their technique: \"Scuffle hoe for the pea gravel, it's way faster than anything else. For the little bricks, boiling water or a torch.\" What's your secret to a weed-free garden? Drop us a line in the comments below.

        "content": "Hannah Kamke wanted medical care—she wanted to confirm whether she was pregnant, and if so, she wanted to terminate. Instead, she stumbled onto a crisis pregnancy center that she claims lied to her about her pregnancy status and later slapped her with a lawsuit accusing of domestic terrorism. Today, CompassCare, an anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy center,” is trying to weaponize a pro-choice law known as the FACE Act against Kamke in federal court while publicly disparaging her as a violent and dangerous extremist. Kamke is fighting back, accusing the clinic of misconduct and demanding damages of her own. The high-stakes battle points toward a new stage in the effort to hold fraudulent anti-abortion clinics accountable, and in the clinics’ own attempts to evade liability through smear tactics and legal hardball—against their own patients when necessary. Kamke’s story, as relayed to me in an interview and documented in legal filings, is sadly familiar. She sought assistance because she popped positive on multiple pregnancy tests but also had her period; due to a medical condition, she believed she could not conceive but wanted a medical professional’s confirmation. Googling abortion clinics, Kamke came across CompassCare, which purported to offer health care services to women with unplanned pregnancies. When she called, the woman on the phone refused to say whether the clinic offered abortions but encouraged her to come in for a pregnancy test and an ultrasound. What happened next still haunts her. Upon arrival, the staff instructed her to urinate in a cup then wait in an exam room. A nurse entered, and Kamke told her that if she was pregnant, she intended to have an abortion. The nurse allegedly responded that “God needs every child to be born,” adding that Kamke “was put on this earth” to become a mother. According to Kamke, the nurse also stated that individuals who obtained abortions were more likely to be sexually promiscuous and, therefore, more likely to get STIs. After the nurse got the result of the pregnancy test, which appeared to be the same type of regular stick you could get from the drugstore, she allegedly told Kamke that it came back negative. But according to Kamke, the nurse asked about her “sexual history.” She encouraged Kamke to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound, and CompassCare gave her paperwork promising that a physician would oversee the procedure. Kamke—confused and distraught by this point—agreed. But a physician was not involved in the ultrasound; instead, the nurse conducted it. CompassCare would later produce Kamke’s medical records to her criminal attorneys—but the records did not make any mention of the performance of this ultrasound. The nurse declared that the ultrasound showed no proof of pregnancy. But just before Kamke intended to leave, a staff member allegedly rushed in and excitedly announced, falsely, that a “miracle” had occurred: The test had changed and now showed that Kamke was pregnant. (Medical records from the visit show that she was clearly never pregnant.) It is unclear whether this misdiagnosis might have been the product of sheer negligence or a fraudulent excuse to further evangelize Kamke against abortion. Either way, recognizing that she was not receiving legitimate care, Kamke said she walked out, violated and betrayed by her mistreatment. Fifteen months later, Kamke was still angry. As she told me, “I was mad at CompassCare and felt like they had set me into a trajectory of anger that didn’t need to exist. I was mad that these people are able to do what they do under the guise of health care when they provided no health care.” So, one night, she spray-painted the word “LIARS” on CompassCare’s sign. The clinic removed the graffiti within hours—and immediately pressed criminal charges, falsely accusing her of an affiliation with the radical pro-choice group Jane’s Revenge. Local police obtained a search warrant and raided her home. Kamke confessed to the act and eventually pleaded guilty in Amherst Town Court to a single charge of disorderly conduct, paying CompassCare $2,580 in restitution. She thought that would be the end of it. It was not. In October 2023, CompassCare brought a federal against Kamke, falsely tying to her to an “extremist group” and accusing her of participating in “a wave of violence against pro-life pregnancy centers.” The clinic alleged that, by graffitiing its sign, Kamke had violated the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act. Congress this law in 1994 to protect abortion clinics from escalating violence, including the assassination of doctors and blockade of patients seeking care. Local authorities, especially in conservative areas, could not always be relied upon to prosecute these cases. The statute applies to anyone who, “by force or threat of force,” intentionally “intimidates or interferes” with a facility providing “reproductive health services,” as well as anyone who “intentionally damages or destroys the property” of such a facility, because it provides those services. Though typically invoked in criminal charges, the FACE Act also imposes civil liability on offenders. CompassCare accuses Kamke of a civil violation and demands monetary damages. In response, Kamke argues that CompassCare has no right to invoke the FACE Act because it “does not provide” reproductive health services but rather attempts to trick women out of receiving such services. She also asserts that she did not graffiti the clinic’s sign it provides reproductive health services, as the FACE Act requires, but because it doesn’t. Kamke—now represented by the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine—volleyed her own allegations at CompassCare . She of violating New York law by engaging in malpractice and negligence. The clinic, she alleged, refuses to tell patients whether it performs abortions until they have already been ensnared in its “care”—at which point it subjects them to evangelical coercion and pseudoscientific malpractice. She said it fails to provide informed consent for invasive services like the transvaginal ultrasound and lies about who will perform them. This blizzard of malpractice and misinformation, Kamke alleges, amounts to serious fraud against patients, subjecting them to “harm and trauma.” CompassCare has responded by furiously Kamke in public, an unusual way to treat a former patient. Rather than denying her allegations outright, the clinic a First Amendment right to lie to patients by falsely telling them a pregnancy test turned positive because of a “miracle.” (CompassCare and its attorney did not respond to Slate’s requests for comment.) But Kamke’s counterclaim is not the only legal trouble the organization faces: New York Attorney Tish James recently filed against CompassCare, along with other crisis pregnancy centers, accusing them of illegal and deceptive business practices for advertising “abortion pill reversal,” or the ability to halt a medication abortion after it has begun. Legitimate medical groups this practice to be dangerous, unethical, and ineffective; James charges CompassCare with unlawfully advertising and performing it as an “experimental medical treatment” on vulnerable women. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has a similar suit against Heartbeat International, which runs a sprawling network of crisis pregnancy centers. James, Bonta, and Kamke’s lawsuits are part of a new approach to holding crisis pregnancy centers to account for misleading and mistreating women. For a while, blue states like California tried to limit the centers’ deceptive practices by mandating disclosures—like informing patients that they lack a license to provide medical services. But the Supreme Court blocked this approach in 2018, , in effect, that anti-abortion groups have a First Amendment right to mislead potential patients. Four conservative justices accused California of borrowing a tactic from “authoritarian regimes.” Since then, both victims and pro-choice advocates have shifted toward the civil justice system for solutions. Suing specific crisis pregnancy centers for mistreating patients is not a swift or perfect solution; a statewide law like California’s would curb the clinics’ deception more efficiently. Litigation, though, has its own benefits: It shows courts the precise harms inflicted by the clinics’ lies and allows a jury—drawn from the very community targeted by the clinics—to hear the facts and impose civil liability if they’re proved. A woman in Massachusetts, for instance, is currently the crisis pregnancy center Clearway Clinic. The plaintiff alleges that the clinic failed to identify her ectopic pregnancy during an ultrasound, then encouraged her to continue the pregnancy; this oversight could have literally killed her. She’s certainly not the first person whose life has been endangered in this exact way: Although crisis pregnancy centers rarely admit it, the ultrasounds they offer designed to thwart abortions rather than identify potential complications. Any patient with an ectopic pregnancy risks death by amateur misdiagnosis. Anti-abortion organizations accuse all these plaintiffs of a vindictive political agenda. And the CEO of CompassCare, the Rev. James Harden, has relentlessly vilified Kamke, “humiliating and denigrating” her, in her lawyer’s words; Harden even announced on TV that he intended to hit her “in the pocketbook.” But Kamke isn’t chasing money, or retribution—just an end to this legal saga, and maybe some measure of closure. In conversation with Slate, she said she wanted some semblance of justice, however small, and a confirmation that she suffered a genuine wrong. Three years after her appointment at CompassCare, she remains rattled by the experience. “What do I really want? I want my life back,” she told me. “I want these people to no longer have control of my",

We're almost out of May now, but aside from Moving Out 2, there are still a few upcoming Game Pass games to check out this month. Xbox Game Pass adds Moving Out 2 today \"At Smooth Moves, we pride ourselves on delivering unforgettable and completely reliable moving experiences. Join us in rebuilding Smooth Moves and become an all-star F.A.R.T. (Furniture Arrangement & Relocation Technician)!

(as well as the same pressure-fuelled arguments). Moving Out 2 launched in 2023 and currently has a \"mostly positive\" rating on Steam . It's been a busy month for May additions already, with one of this year's most anticipated upcoming Xbox exclusives having launched into the service last week.

        "content": "The pledge came from Belgium, which topped up the money with a commitment to give 30 F-16 fighter jets over the next four years. The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defence system, which Mr Zelensky sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that cause wide destruction. A day earlier, Mr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates one billion euros of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and five billion euros by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the EU is again struggling to overcome Hungary’s objections to the 27-nation bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia’s staunchest ally in the EU. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine’s defence efforts. Mr Zelensky met Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the Nato alliance. Since Russia launched a spring offensive around eastern Kharkiv, Mr Zelensky has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more US-made Patriot air defence systems. Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting wher EU colleagues, said that such a system will be built “in a short time frame”. The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. “Ukraine is also fighting Europe’s fight,” she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose the swift distribution of centralised EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. “We need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,” said Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur. “The urgency is very, very acute.” Mr Zelensky was due to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia’s response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force.",

The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defence system, which Mr Zelensky sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that cause wide destruction. A day earlier, Mr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates one billion euros of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and five billion euros by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the EU is again struggling to overcome Hungary’s objections to the 27-nation bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia’s staunchest ally in the EU. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine’s defence efforts. Mr Zelensky met Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the Nato alliance. Since Russia launched a spring offensive around eastern Kharkiv, Mr Zelensky has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more US-made Patriot air defence systems. Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting wher EU colleagues, said that such a system will be built “in a short time frame”. The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. “Ukraine is also fighting Europe’s fight,” she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose the swift distribution of centralised EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. “We need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,” said Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur. “The urgency is very, very acute.” Mr Zelensky was due to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia’s response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force.",

        "description": "Chinese automobile manufacturer SAIC has announced plans to fit the electric vehicles from subsidiary IM Motors with solid-state batteries from 2027.",
        "content": "2027 will be an interesting year in terms of the introduction of solid-state batteries. After CATL, Toyota and Nissan, SAIC is now also positioning itself as a pioneer of this technology and is committing to a similar time horizon to bring solid-state batteries into series production. Several media reports on a new strategic plan came out a few days ago, according to which SAIC intends to complete its first production line for solid-state batteries next year and start series production the following year. The first IM Motors brand models with solid-state batteries on board are planned for 2027. The energy density will then be over 400 Wh/kg, according to reports. Lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes currently reach their limit at around 350 Wh/kg. In a first step, SAIC plans to equip with semi-solid-state batteries this year, which, according to the manufacturer, will achieve an energy density of over 300 Wh/kg. The semi-solid-state batteries will also be used in other SAIC brands from 2025. China’s largest state-owned car manufacturer is keeping a low profile when it comes to further details. When it comes to solid-state batteries, SAIC merely states that the new battery technology will increase the safety of the batteries and that the production costs of solid-state batteries will be around 40 per cent lower than those of batteries with liquid electrolyte. SAIC’s battery strategy is embedded in a broader innovation approach that also focuses on digitalisation in the vehicle. The Chinese company is also expanding its cooperation network: For example, the state-owned car manufacturer recently signed a contract with Audi to jointly develop electric cars. The is due to be launched on the market in 2025. At the beginning of the year, the Japanese business newspaper revealed that a number of major Chinese battery and car manufacturers had formed an alliance to jointly drive forward the commercialisation of solid-state batteries. The Chinese government is said to be the initiator of the alliance. The consortium called China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform (CASIP) was founded in January with the aim of developing and producing competitive solid-state batteries and establishing a supply chain by 2030. According to , CATL, CALB, EVE Energy, SVOLT, and BYD’s battery subsidiary FinDreams Battery are involved in the alliance. There are also several state-owned manufacturers from the automotive industry as well as the private companies BYD and Nio. Other players include representatives from the government and academia. According to the Japanese newspaper, ‘influential state-sponsored funds are also on the CASIP membership list’. It is unclear whether SAIC is one of the state-owned manufacturers involved. The car manufacturer was not explicitly named when the plans were announced in February. The alliance demonstrates that China will not allow its market-leading position in electric car batteries to be overtaken by a technological leap towards solid-state batteries. Against this backdrop, the new consortium will primarily focus on basic research, key technologies, the joint development and production of electric vehicles with solid-state batteries and the establishment of a corresponding supply chain. A member, CATL has now announced its intention to produce pure solid-state batteries in small quantities for the first time . With regard to the alliance, it should be emphasised that the project coordinated from Beijing brings together competitors who are sometimes aggressively fighting for market share. One example cited by is the fact that CATL has sued its competitors CALB and Svolt for patent infringement. Together, the Chinese rivals are bringing together the initiatives launched in South Korea, Japan, North America and Europe to commercialise solid-state battery technology, which could outpace the Chinese industry. Toyota, for example, wants to launch the , while . , ,",

        "description": "@nomither6 I still do have my collection and like to keep my games too which is why I would never buy the game if it had the 'GH' packaging. If I didn't own the game by the time it was a 'Greatest Hit' and wanted it, I would rather hunt for used copies if that's the only way to find the OG packaging.",
        "content": "@Th3solution You know, I hadn't even noticed it hadn't been continuing. I did like the Platinum line from the early days, but the red banner of Greatest Hits titles I found rather ugly. Anyway, could it be something to do with most games being sold through digital storefronts now, and continual sales? I'm ashamed to admit, but I couldn't tell you the last time I looked at games in a physical store. Even having said that, they could do a section in the digital store announcing a line that hits a certain sales threshold (and if you notice, some games do get stealth permanent price drops), thereby getting a lower price and becoming platinum or whatever. There's a lot they could do to improve the store, I feel. @BAMozzy The Greatest Hits program was never exclusive to first party games. In fact the majority of games on it were third party. Stuff like Battlefield, Crash Bandicoot, Battlefront, Monster Hunter, Metal Gear Solid, LEGO, Resident Evil, and Yakuza games, to name a few from the PS4 gen GH collection. For first party, I agree it becomes a little sticky when a game is cross gen, but some of them are sold as a package with both PS4/PS5 versions included. I also agree that the PC releases also complicate things because they seem to be releasing around the timeframe that a game would be considered a “greatest hit”. Remakes shouldn’t be a problem though since it didn’t stop them before (The Last of Us Remastered is a Greatest Hit on PS4, as is The Nathan Drake Collection) Still, at this point I think it would easily make sense to consider games like Demon’s Souls, Returnal, Horizon Forbidden West, R&C Rift Apart, GoW Ragnarok, SM1 & Miles Morales, UC Legacy of Thieves Collection; as well as 3rd party games like It Takes Two, Resident Evil 8, Yakuza Like a Dragon, No Man’s Sky, Hades, DMC5, Deathloop, GT7, AC Valhalla, FF7 Remake, Control, Stray... etc, etc. We’ve reached a point where there are enough games that have sold well and/or received accolades that they can be celebrated (and sold at a discount). Of course, I’ve always thought there was a weird inconsistency of which games get the special “Greatest Hits” moniker on their cover art. Games like Friday the 13th, Project CARS, and Plants vs Zombie: Garden Warfare 2 were included and yet hits like Shadow of the Colossus Remake, RDR2, and Detroit Become Human were not. Edit: As far as a GH collection cannibalizing the subscription service, I don’t think it would. PS+ subscription numbers have remained stagnant anyways. Some people would rather buy their games and I think the promotion of being a discounted GH would help sales. @Malaise The red “Greatest Hits” stripe still appears on the digital cover art, but it’s less noticeable than the red disc jacket of the physical versions. Like you say, the tradition could easily transfer over to the digital storefront, especially if the games are getting a price drop anyways. @Th3solution What I meant was that the main reason behind the 'Greatest Hits' maybe no longer relevant. The 'purpose' from the business perspective wasn't 'Customer' focussed but a way to have a secondary PR run to boost sales of an 'older' game that wasn't really selling anymore. Now they have PC and PS+ Sub services and the 'hype/PR' around those games releasing on PC or into a Sub service generates 'sales' on PS5. When Spider-Man came to PC, PS5 sales were also 'boosted' because of the PR. All I am saying is that Sony/Playstation is not the 'same' as it was when they weren't releasing games on PC to generate a second wave of 'sales' and if you missed their 'Greatest Hits', Subscribe to a higher tier to get to play them. If they were 'budget' price now on PS5, it devalues their Sub service and/or being able to sell the game at 'full' Price on PC. Essentially, that Sony are not in the same situation they were in, their 'market' has changed as they aren't solely relying on Game Sales on their Console as its now supplemented by PC and Subscription sales. Those still 'remind' people those games are all on Playstation too... @BAMozzy Perhaps that’s true. Either way, it’s unfortunate that the tradition has stopped after 5 generations. i used to keep my game cases back then and hated the greatest hits ugly red cover lol White DS5 that came with the console is on its way back to Sony due to developing a tendency to go left constantly. Almost a year to the day since having the console and what I can only describe as 'light' use - posted it back 3 days before its warranty expires so hopefully Sony will repair/replace the innards. I've still got 3 official DS3s and 4 DS4s - much more heavily used and no sign of drifting. @nomither6 I still do have my collection and like to keep my games too which is why I would never buy the game if it had the 'GH' packaging. If I didn't own the game by the time it was a 'Greatest Hit' and wanted it, I would rather hunt for used copies if that's the only way to find the OG packaging.",

        "description": "Jake Last was goalkeeper for Burnley under 14s Academy and hoped for life as a professional footballer until his dreams were shattered after a hospital visit",
        "content": "A promising footballer has seen his life turned upside down after a twinge in his knee led to a devastating diagnosis. Two years ago Jake Last was playing in goal for Burnley under-14s Academy, earing the nickname of \"The Cat\" because he was so agile. The devoted Manchester United fan had hoped for life as a professional footballer - only for a heartbreaking diagnosis which has meant him having to rethink his future. For tests after he began to suffer with a sore knee revealed he had bone cancer. And while initially it looked like treatment was successful - with Jake even ringing the bell - the cancer has returned leaving the youngster having to have his right leg amputated with surgery set for next month. But, the now 15-year-old, from Chadderton , Oldham , is already hoping for a footballing future, potentially playing for the Manchester City or Everton amputee teams - and even England. His dad, John, 54, said: \"I don't think you will ever get Jake to not be involved in football. He is an amazing lad. He has been unbelievable. \"It is strange to say, but he lives as if he has never had the disease. The treatment (chemotherapy) has been brutal. But he knows it is having an effect on the cancer and helping get rid of it.\" Jake's determination has impressed both Manchester footballing halves - City and United. Kobbie Mainoo, the United star, who shone in last weekend's FA Cup Final, sent him a video message telling the teenager: \"Hi Jake, it's Kobbie. I'm sorry to hear everything you are going through. Stay strong and I hope everything goes well with the surgery.\" A friend of his family who is a City fan donated a framed, signed shirt worn by City goalkeeper Ederson, which was auctioned to raise money to help Jake's family through tough times. You can donate here. John told how the family's nightmare began when Jake said he had a twinge in his knee. He said: \"He was playing for Burnley under 14s and had suffered an ankle injury and was on crutches for six weeks. We thought the pain in his knee was just because he had been on crutches so long.\" Eventually Jake was taken to hospital for an X-ray. It was initially thought he had damaged his tendons - but further tests in March 2022 revealed it was Osteosarcoma - bone cancer. Jake had 16 weeks of chemotherapy at Manchester Children’s Hospital before having surgery at Birmingham to replace his knee, tibia and femur with titanium implants. The teenager had 14 more weeks of chemotherapy at Manchester Children’s Hospital to \"mop up\" any remaining cancerous cells. He rang the bell in May of last year, as there was no sign of the cancer, then underwent tough physiotherapy and hydrotherapy to help him to walk again. But last October a MRI scan found that the cancer had returned in his hip. John said: \"We were devastated as we really thought he had beat this horrible disease. So he started a different type of chemotherapy in February of this year, of which there are six sessions, he has one more to go which is from June 4 to June 9. \"He had an MRI scan after the second lot of chemotherapy and it was found that the chemotherapy was attacking the tumour and breaking it down. It also showed that there was a small cancerous tumour in his lung and a suspected tumour in his spine but the tumour in his lung had not grown since his first scan so that is good news\". Following a recent scan, the radiologist said his back problem is now not cancerous. He needs to have a final scan next month before undergoing surgery. John said: \"Jake has decided he will be more able bodied if they remove his right leg at the hip. The higher we go the less chance there is of the cancer returning. He had already said to the doctors after being diagnosed 'why don't you just take my leg off'. But they rightly said they had to try and save his limb. Now it has come back in his hip he struggles to walk without his crutches.\" Determined Jake had already started football training again before the cancer was discovered in his hip, this time playing for grassroots side, Droylsden . He was invited to watch the England amputee team play in Partington which was \"brilliant\". His dad added: \"Around here there are only Manchester City and Everton that have amputee teams. He can hopefully go training with one of them and one day get in the England set up.\" Chelsea Ashworth, who has set up a Gofundme page to fundraise for Jake's family, said: \"Jake is an absolute incredible inspiration and has endured so much over the last few years and still has a long road to recovery.\" Jake is the second child of John and his wife, Tracy. \"In 2007 we had a daughter, Olivia, who died shortly after her birth. Jake was born in 2008 and I guess the loss of Olivia was why he was born so soon after. He still talks of his sister - and I am sure if she was here she would be saying I'm right behind you,\" said John. You can make a donation here. So far £7,700 of a £10,000 target has been raised.",

        "description": "Let's look at the five ways Shonda Rhimes and Sanjay Leela Bhansali portray powerful women on screen",
        "content": "Few storytellers have been able to capture the many shades of power held by women in society as effectively as Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Shonda Rhimes. The women that exist in the stories of Netflix’s Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar and Bridgerton wield many weapons, whether it be the inscrutable power of Lady Whistledown’s pen or the tantalizing allure of a tawaif. Both Bhansali and Rhimes don’t try to box their female characters with stereotypes of either femininity or feminism, showcasing a diverse range of women who are both strong and imperfect. Let’s look at the five ways Shonda Rhimes and Sanjay Leela Bhansali portray powerful women on screen: The matriarchs of Bridgerton and Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar From Violet Bridgerton, fighting tooth and nail to ensure that her children choose love over societal norms, to Mallikajaan leading an army of tawaifs to ensure her daughter Bibbojaan knows she’s not alone in her final moments, these women show vastly different sides of the matriarchal figure. Yet, both Rhimes and Bhansali understand the fierceness with which the matriarchs love their own, and the extent they’re willing to go to protect them, damned be the rules of their society. The silent revolutionaries of their stories Penelope Fetherington through the persona of Lady Whistledown is completely able to shake up the status quo of London’s Ton simply through her sharp wit. Bibbojaan uses her enchanting allure to extract key strategic secrets from the unassuming men of the British government who play a key role in the rebels’ independence movement. While one lady might be a wallflower utilizing people overlooking her to her advantage while the other uses the rapt attention and affection given to her to help her comrades in their struggle against the ruling forces, both yield incredible power in their own right. Romances that empower Both Bhansali and Rhimes have never treated romance as something frivolous or anti-feminist. With Kate Sharma in Bridgerton, we see a high-strung older sister who has sworn herself to a life of spinsterhood for the sake of her family, choosing love and happiness for the first time in her life through her romance with Anthony Bridgerton, freeing herself from the responsibilities that shackled her. In Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, Bhansali crafts a romance between Alamzeb and Tajdar that allows Alamzeb to finally explore the freedom beyond the huge walls of her mother’s Shahi Mahal. While their love story might have had a much more tragic ending than Kate’s, both narratives prove how love can also liberate women just as much. Breaking the moulds Eloise Bridgerton stands out as a character who challenges traditional gender roles with her keen intellect and curiosity, actively seeking knowledge and questioning the norms that confine women to domestic spheres. In Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar Fareedan depicts the figure of a woman who defies societal expectations. In Tilasmi Bahein we see her dancing with abandon, completely free and uncaring of the sort of delicate allure typically associated with a tawaif’s mujra. Through Alamzeb and Bibbojan on the other hand we see woman who rebel against their mother, to forge their own paths in life whether it’s for love or for freedom. These women challenge the expectations inflicted by their society to follow their own paths, granting them agency in their narrative despite the era the story takes place. The power of female solidarity In Bridgerton season 3, we get to see Eloise explore female friendships with the other women in the London Ton. While she starts out hesitant and dismissive of their interests, her newfound friendship with Cressida Cowpler makes her rethink the way the women of the ton are pitted against each other, finding solidarity with someone who while having completely different views on marriage from her is also shackled by the same patriarchal system as her. Similarly, in Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar, Fareedan sets aside her rivalry with Mallikajaan upon learning of Bibbojaan’s arrest and the impending British attack, recognizing the greater need for tawaifs to unite. Both Bhansali and Rhimes understand the power of female solidarity and its ability to empower women against the systems that disable them.",

        "description": "The Pope's behind-the-door remark has caused outrage, particularly because he has been hailed as a \"pro-LGBTQ+\" Pontifex, particularly when compared to his predecessors.",
        "content": "Pope Francis , often deemed too liberal by more conservative elements of the clergy, is under fire for using a cuss word to describe homosexual men. According to a report in The Guardian, several Italian media outlets have reported that the pontiff used the term “frociaggine”, a vulgar Italian word that roughly translates to “faggotness”, while reiterating his objection to admitting gay men to Catholic seminaries. The remark was made when the pope said that while it was important to embrace everyone, there was already too much “frociaggine” in some seminaries. The story was first reported by Dagospia, a gossip website before being covered by dailies like La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera. The media reports claimed – while quoting unnamed bishops – that the pontiff meant the derogatory terms as a “joke” and left those who heard it “surprised” and “perplexed”. One bishop is quoted saying that the pope might not have been familiar with the offensive nature of the term. Two newspapers, La Repubblica and Corriere, stated that it was decided that homosexual men should be admitted to seminaries, but the move was vetoed by the pope. The word “frociaggine” stems from the word “frocio” that refers to the English term faggot. The term faggot is often used in the Anglosphere to refer to a gay person in a derogatory manner though its shorter fag is also used for cigarettes. Historically, while the term fag/faggot has been used to refer to men perceived to be less masculine it evolved over term to refer to homosexual mean. In recent years, it has also been “reclaimed” by gay men, much like the N word was “reclaimed” by black folks. Unlike his predecessors, Francis has taken a more ambiguous approach to the LGBTQ+ community, earning the disdain of more conservative cardinals. In an impromptu press conference on the papal plane when he took over, when asked about gay priests, Francis had said: “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge? The catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well. It says they should not be marginalised because of this [orientation] but that they must be integrated into society.\" While approving a ruling in December 2023 allowing priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples, he has always been vocal about not allowing gay people to join the clergy and claimed he was “concerned” about the “fashion” of being gay to which the clergy is “susceptible”. Pope Francis’ ambiguous position is sharply different from his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI who has been a longtime opponent of homosexuality. While opposing same-sex marriage, Benedict had said: ““People dispute the idea that they have a nature, given to them by their bodily identity, that serves as a defining element of the human being. They deny their nature and decide that it is not something previously given to them, but that they make it for themselves.” The Church’s official position remains that homosexual acts are “sinful”. A 2016 decree stressed the obligation of sexual abstinence as well as “barring” gay men from the clergy. To say the Catholic Church has had a complicated relationship with sex would be an understatement. While the Church remains steadfastly opposed to abortion and some forms of birth control, it has also had a rather chequered past about dealing with sexual abuse within the clergy. While cases of sexual abuse by the clergy are more documented in various parts of the world, it’s almost impossible to pin a number in Italy because of an Italian government treaty with the Vatican the guarantees areas of immunity to bishops and priests. In the US, a 2006 documentary called Deliver Us From Evil showed how a priest named Olivier O’Grady was switched from parish to parish to cover up his rape of dozens of children. Spotlight , a 2015 Academy Award-winning team, also showed a dramatized version of a true story of the Boston Globe’s investigative reporting team shone a light on the widespread sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in the 1970s, and the cover-up attempts of the Boston archdiocese. In 2018, a Pennsylvania grand jury published a 1,356 page report documenting the decades of sexual abuse by over 300 Catholic priests in six dioceses and also accused senior church officials in Pennsylvania and the Vatican of a “systemic cover-up”. A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse by Dr Thomas Plante, states that approximately 4% of the priests in the past half century (mostly ‘60s and ‘70s) had a sexual experience with a minor. The study claims that the number is “consistent with male clergy from other religious traditions” and is “significantly lower than the general adult male population which may double this number”.",

Byeon Woo Seok, who became an icon of pure love by portraying Ryu Seon Jae, said, “I remember the scene (in episode 15) where Sun Jae restores his lost memories.” He explained, “It is the moment when Sun Jae, who has lived for 15 years with forgotten memories, reunites with Im Sol. The deep and desperate feelings of Sun Jae that I felt while acting were so vivid that I had lingering emotions, which is why I remember that scene the most.“ Kim Hye Yoon, who plays Im Sol, shared, “It is the scene (in episode 2) where Im Sol runs toward Sun Jae while holding a yellow umbrella. I thought it was Sun Jae and Im Sol’s first meeting and the beginning of their relationship at the same time.” Song Geon Hee, who takes on the role of Kim Tae Sung, also picked the same scene as Kim Hye Yoon. He remarked, “I think the epilogue of episode 2 is the best scene. I was impressed by the process of depicting Sun Jae’s feelings and how he falls in love with Im Sol as soon as he sees her holding an umbrella for him.” Lee Seung Hyub, who plays Eclipse’s leader Baek In Hyuk, shared, “I remember the scene (in episode 10) where [Bae In Hyuk] parodies Jung Dae Man (Mitsui Hisashi) from ‘Slam Dunk’ by saying, ‘I want to do music.'” He explained, “Even though it was Bae In Hyuk’s imagination, it was my first time acting with this much of a comical element. As it was a new challenge, I was very nervous at the time of filming. But I was also able to enjoy watching it because viewers said that it was entertaining.” The final episode of “Lovely Runner” airs on May 28 at 8:50 p.m. KST.

        "content": "MADRID (Reuters) : Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after seven months of conflict in Gaza. By joining more than 140 of the 193 member-states of the United Nations that recognize a Palestinian state, Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. “This is a historic decision that has a single objective: that Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address before a cabinet meeting that will formally approve the measure. Spain will recognize a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said. The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision. Sanchez said Madrid will not recognize any changes to pre-1967 borders unless agreed to by both parties. “It’s the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognizes as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security,” he added. Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy. The three countries say they hope their decision will spur other European Union countries to follow suit. Israel has repeatedly condemned the move, insisting that it bolsters Hamas, which staged the Oct. 7 attack on Israel from its Gaza base. “Sanchez, when you... recognize a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday. The Palestinian flag was flying outside the Irish parliament as the government was set to approve the recognition in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. “The people of Ireland know that a two-state a solution is the only way to bring peace and stability to people in Israel, and to people in Palestine,” Prime Minister Simon Harris told journalists before the cabinet meeting. Of the 27-members of the European Union, Sweden, Cyprus, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria have already recognized a Palestinian state. Malta and Slovenia have indicated they could follow. Britain and Australia have said they are considering recognition, but EU member France has said now is not the time, while Germany joined Israel’s staunchest ally, the United States, in rejecting a unilateral approach, insisting that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue. The conflict, which was triggered after Hamas militants stormed across Israel’s southern border on Oct. 7, has so far killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Israel says the initial assault, the worst in its 75-year history, killed 1,200 people, with more than 250 hostages taken. Israel has responded to the recognition move by pulling its ambassadors from Madrid, Oslo and Dublin and summoning the three countries’ ambassadors to watch videos of Israelis being taken hostage by Hamas gunmen. It also blocked Spain from providing consular services to Palestinians in the West Bank and accused Spain of helping Hamas. In response, Spain has escalated criticism, describing the Gaza conflict as a “real genocide.” Spain said on Monday it would ask other EU members to officially back last week’s International Court of Justice order for Israel to halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. But Sanchez on Tuesday sought to ease tensions by condemning Hamas and calling for the release of hostages. “It is not a decision we take against anyone, certainly not against Israel,” he said. “We want to have the best possible relationship.”",

        "content": "Protesters demonstrating on the streets of Palma de Mallorca say that marches against overtourism will continue until the Balearic government introduces measures to counter the housing emergency on the island. Thousands of locals made their way through the island’s capital on Saturday, warning tourists to “go home” with banners which read “Mallorca is not for sale”. The estimated 10,000 protesters headed for Weyler Square, where holidaymakers were out for dinner and drinks. A neighbourhood organisation from Sencelles in central Mallorca, Banc del Temps, planned the 25 May protest. Banc del Temps spokesperson Javier Barbero, one organiser of the large demonstration in Palma, said: “This has only just begun”, the Majorca Daily Bulletin reports. Barbero added that Mallorcan citizens feel “suffocated” by the housing situation but insisted “we are not saying ‘no’ to tourism” completely. According to data from Exceltur, an industry organisation, tourism generates 45 per cent of the island’s gross domestic product, with 14.4 million holidaymakers visiting the Balearic Islands last year. The group against excessive tourism said in a statement on Facebook: “The right to housing is an ignored constitutional right. “They take us from our home and the island to benefit tourism [...] because we can’t pay.” Protest demands to the Ministry of Housing include preventing tourists from buying properties on the island if they have not lived there for more than five years, regulations on holiday accommodation rental prices, and measures to declare the Balearics are experiencing a housing emergency. “If measures aren’t taken we will continue taking to the streets until we see action,” Barbero said. The protest follows mass demonstrations on the Canary Islands in April with calls for Tenerife to temporarily limit tourist arrivals to stem short-term holiday rentals and hotel construction that is driving up housing costs for locals. Similar protests at Palma de Mallorca’s airport in peak season could bring air travel on the holiday hotspot to a halt if measures are not introduced to protect the island from overcrowding.",

        "description": "This year, the growth is expected to be tempered by a high base effect",
        "content": "By ANI Comments READ LATER Bank credit growth is expected to moderate 200 basis points (100 basis points is equal to 1 percentage point) to 14 per cent this year after an estimated robust growth of 16 per cent last financial year, according to Crisil Ratings. Strong economic activity and retail credit demand drove loan growth last year. This year, the growth is expected to be tempered by a high base effect, a revision in risk weights, and a somewhat lower gross domestic product (GDP) growth, asserted Crisil. However, on the positive side, it notes that the fundamental drivers of credit demand seem to be broadly intact and a revival in private corporate capital expenditure, especially towards the second half of year 2024-25, can provide some tailwinds. Within the expected overall bank credit growth of 14 per cent in 2024-25, the largest segment, corporate credit, at 45 per cent of bank credit, should see growth remaining steady at 13 per cent, while retail (at 28 per cent of bank credit), the second-largest segment, is expected to grow the fastest at 16 per cent. Ajit Velonie, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings, said, \"Growth in corporate credit will be supported by private sector industrial capex in fiscal 2025, underpinned by expectations that GDP growth will remain solid.\" Retail credit will likely report a tad lower at 16 per cent, compared with 17 per cent last year, but will remain the fastest-growing segment for banks. Explaining rationale, it said the retail segment will feel the drag of lower growth in unsecured consumer credit (at 25 per cent of retail credit) as banks realign their strategies following the regulatory advisory to counter a potential rise in loan delinquencies. Home loans remain the largest constituent of retail credit and should grow steadily, given increasing preference for home ownership and better affordability, the rating agency said. Agricultural credit growth will remain linked to monsoon trends but should witness a moderation on the back of a strong financial year 2023-24. The southwest monsoon, as predicted by the weather bureau IMD, is likely to hit Kerala on May 31, a day before the normal date of June 1. The India Meteorological Department said conditions are becoming favourable for the onset of the monsoon. These rains are crucial to the Indian agriculture economy, especially for kharif crops. India has three cropping seasons - summer, kharif and rabi. Comments",

        "description": "Cartwright was confirmed as Hull FC's new head coach for 2025 and beyond last week.",
        "content": "Jake Trueman believes the appointment of John Cartwright is a ‘promising’ step forward for Hull FC and will help the club, namely Director of Rugby, Richie Myler, with his ongoing recruitment drive. Myler is expected to work in tandem with Cartwright, especially when it comes to the acquisition of NRL-based players, with Hull, as it stands, having two quota spots available for this year. And now that Cartwright is confirmed on a three year deal from 2025 and beyond, it gives the club more leverage should they dip back into the overseas market. Trueman, meanwhile, is buoyed by that possibility, with the half-back recently making a successful return to play after a long-term injury. The 25-year-old also pointed out Cartwright’s current State of Origin role with New South Wales, with the Australian set to learn the ins and outs of Super League ahead of pre-season training in the autumn. Click here - Get the latest news on our Rugby League Live WhatsApp channel Speaking on his appointment, Trueman said: “Super League is a bit different from the NRL, but I'm sure Grixy will let him know the trends and stuff over here. I don't think he'll come here undercooked. He'll know the league and what to expect. \"It looks like a good appointment. He's Brisbane’s and New South Wales' assistant, so he must know his stuff. He's in good position at the moment, so he must be a good coach. “It's very promising. Hopefully, he'll have picked up a lot over the years, and he'll be good for us. It's exciting, and now that it's done, hopefully it will help the club with recruitment. “It makes Richie's job a bit easier, as we know where the club is going. It might also help a few players who are out of contract and want to stay around, but at the moment, we've got the squad we've got, and it's down to us to change it.” Trueman, who played in Hull's las three games after making his comeback at Warrington earlier this month, also paid tribute to Tony Smith , who departed the club six weeks ago after 18 months in charge. \"It was a weird one,” Trueman said on Smith’s exit. “It was the first time I've been through that where a coach has left midway through the season. “For the next few days, you didn't know what to do. It was weird coming into training without Tony there. He was such a big figure and the leader of the club. “I got along well with Tony as well, so I felt for him and felt bad that I couldn't get out there and help him, but Grixy has been great. Hopefully, we can keep hold of him, as he's a really good coach.” Read more: Simon Grix reveals 'honest' talk with Herman Ese'ese as Hull FC prop cleared of abuse charge",

        "content": "Dear Annie: My heart is broken, and so is my wife’s. This past year, we planned a family vacation because my daughter and her family and my son and his live in a different state. We were meeting in the middle to save everyone from such a long road trip. My wife and I have been married almost 35 years, and she helped raise my two children. My grandchildren all adore her. On the second day of our trip, my wife and my son’s 7-year-old son were playing cards. My wife went to give him a hug, and out of the blue, my son and his wife literally jumped up and said, “No! We don’t do that!” It was shocking to say the least. My wife couldn’t believe it; she immediately left the room, and she says even now, four months later, that the look on our grandson’s face when that happened broke her heart. Needless to say, the rest of the trip was very awkward. I am very close to my son, and we still talk roughly every other day, but my wife will never forgive them for that. I feel like my son and his wife owe my wife an apology because things will never be the same. My son is a police officer, and he has seen a lot, and as a result he and his wife are very overprotective of his children. They don’t let them spend the night away from home because they don’t trust people. I know that we can’t be too careful, but the way they handled that situation was totally wrong. I told my wife that if they had decided that no one could be “affectionate” with their son, they should have told us that in private. Please give me some advice. Thank you! -- Heartbroken Dad and Grandfather Dear Heartbroken: You are correct that they should have spoken to you in private about their wishes that you not hug their children. By reprimanding your wife in front of her grandson, they are hurting their own son by depriving him of a grandmother’s hug -- which is a sad thing to deprive a grandson of. Instead of never forgiving, try to get curious about the why. You mentioned that your son is a police officer and has seen a lot. Maybe he just saw something very disturbing. Whatever the reason, it’s important that you have a dialogue about it so that you and your wife can have a better understanding of it. In the future, hopefully, your son and daughter-in-law never reprimand you or your wife in front of your grandchildren. But forgiveness is a gift you give yourself. So forgive. “How Can I Forgive My Cheating Partner?” is out now!

        "content": "A WOMAN has revealed that she makes £20,000 a month from a simple side hustle, that takes minutes to set up. Taylor Couch shared details of her money making hack via a video posted to her TikTok channel, which she often uses to share side hustle tips and tricks. The side hustle pro revealed that YouTube pays around £10-£20 per 1000 video views. She then explained that simple, faceless videos such as 'relaxing cafe music mix' or 'cosy fireplace sounds' gain around 60 million views on the video sharing platform. This means that the creators of these videos made over £230,000 from just one video. To make your own video, Taylor explained that all you need to do is go to ai.invideo.io. Then, ask the AI to make you a video, being as descriptive as possible. For example, Taylor asked the AI to create a three minute YouTube video with 10 scenes of beautiful scenery, paired with relaxing music. Then click 'generate video' and select your audience. \"Boom! Within minutes you have a video\", she said. You can then edit the video if you want to, and when you're happy with it, simply download it and upload it to YouTube. You can do this as many times as you like, creating a variety of different videos. \"Then sit back, and collect income passively\", she said. Taylor's video, which was posted under the username @thecouchclub , has likely left many people impressed, as it has racked up over 780,0000 views on the video sharing platform. TikTok users raced to the video's comments section to share their thoughts. One person said: \"Golden!! Thank you for sharing this!!\" A second person said: \"Thank you, helpful tips and ideas that I really appreciate. Based on new research from Finder, an estimated 22.8 million Brits are using side hustles to top up their income. Among generation those aged 18-23 68 percent have a side hustle in 2024. Those aged 24-42 aren’t far behind, with 65 per cent having an additional source of income. Side hustles are less popular among older generations, with 40 percent of generation those aged 43-54 having one. Whereas 23 percent of people aged 55-73 and just 7 per cent of those aged 74 and over are earning extra cash this way. \"Definitely want to try this!\" A third person added: \"AI is really changing the game!!\" A fourth said: \"I love the way you can use AI to make money online\".

So, after getting inspiration from others online, Victoria decided to splash out on some stick on tiles from Temu to give her kitchen a revamp . She documented the process in a video on her TikTok page, as she admitted she was initially hesitant to buy from Temu after hearing mixed reviews. \"Would you believe that these stickers only cost me £16 from Temu?\" Victoria said. \"I've never bought from Temu before, and I thought it was gonna be a bit of a scam, but honestly this is so good. \"They actually look like real tiles - you cannot tell they're stickers!\" She initially showed where she'd tried to clean some of the grubbiness off her splashbacks, and it had taken the paint off. Victoria then showed the tile stickers she'd picked up, as she had been inspired by someone else who had bought the pink version. \"You simply peel back the plastic, and then you peel back the other bit for it to be sticky,\" she said, demonstrating as she went. \"I placed it on the wall like this - trust me it took me hours, but it's super easy. \"This is the final result and I am so chuffed with it!\" Victoria added in the caption: \"This isnt an ad, im so really happy with how these came out! \"You literally can't tell they are stickers!\" But the process wasn't entirely straightforward, as Victoria added: \"The cutting in around the plugs though was a REAL faff!\" \"I buy loads from there tbf,\" one person commented on the video. \"I've had some great stuff but prices have definitely gone up.\" \"Well if £16 is inflated I am sure gutted I missed them 'cheap',\" Victoria laughed. \"It doesn’t look any different on camera unfortunately,\" someone else argued. Well Polished conducted a survey and the results are in! Most Hated Household Chores Most Liked Household Chores Men VS Women: Who Puts the Work In? Men spend 7 hours 54 minutes a week cleaning. Women spend 12 hours 15 minutes a week cleaning. \"I wish they were more defined!\" But Victoria was entirely unbothered by the remark, as she replied: \"That's okay! \"I don't look at it through a camera! \"And boy has it made a difference in real life!\"",

        "content": "Jonathan Kitchen Stock futures edged higher in the early trading hours of Tuesday, with Nasdaq Futures adding 0.5% to a session high after Apple’s China iPhone shipments rebounded. Here are some of Tuesday's biggest stock movers: Biggest stock gainers Shares of meme stock GameStop ( GME ) surged around 17% after the company announced the completion of a previously disclosed, roughly $933.4M equity offering through the sale of 45M shares. It intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments. The offering follows a recent spike in meme shares following the return of influential trader and analyst Keith Gill to social media. Gill, also known as “Roaring Kitty,” was an important figure in the 2021 meme-stock frenzy. CAVA Group's ( CAVA ) shares rose over 5% ahead of the company's Q results, scheduled after the market close, with analysts estimating EPS of $0.05 and the consensus revenue of $245.46M. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 5 upward revisions and 0 downward revisions, while revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 1 downward revision. Biggest stock losers Hello Group's ( MOMO ) shares fell nearly 6% after the company reported mixed Q1 results, with revenue dropping 9% Y/Y on the back of a decline in live video service revenues, Value-added service revenues, and Mobile games revenues. Monthly active users on the Tantan app fell to 13.7M, compared to 19.5M a year earlier, while Momo's total paying users were 7.1M in Q1, compared to 7.8M a year ago. The company also sees Q2 total net revenues between RMB2.65B and RMB2.75B, a decrease of 15.5% to 12.4% Y/Y.

While Asake and Seyi Vibez have not had any public spat, there has always been a chill between their fanbases, especially on social media. In a recent interview with The Beat FM Lagos, Ayra Starr was asked whether her decision to work with both men on her sophomore album, ‘The Year I Turned 21,’ was intentional because of their rivalry and she denied knowledge of the rivalry. According to her, she decided to work with them because she loves their sonic prowess. She said, “I didn’t put Asake and Seyi Vibez on my album because of their rivalry. I didn’t know about the rivalry between Asake and Seyi Vibez. I just love both of them as artists. “I’m really big on sonics; what would sound good sonically. My team is always thinking of the business side but I’m just thinking of who would be sonically compatible with me. And I’ve been listening to Seyi Vibez’s ‘Different Pattern’ for a very long time. So I decided to work with him. When I sent the record to him, he sent his verse almost immediately. They were very quick with it. Asake, too, he sent me his verse in three days.” Related Topics: Asake Ayra Starr Seyi Vibez Don't Miss How I met my husband – Veekee James You may like I’m not aware of rivalry between Asake, Seyi Vibez – Ayra Starr ‘Sabigays’: Controversy as Ayra Starr embraces LGBTQ fans at Brazil concert Ayra Starr relishes BET nominations Burna Boy, Ayra Starr, others bag nominations for 2024 Bet Awards ‘I didn’t know Rihanna was real until I saw her’ – Ayra Starr ‘I’m single but have broken a few hearts’ – Ayra Starr Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

        "content": "Dear Readers : I appreciate it when people give me updates on previously published advice. Related Articles Ask Amy: My husband wants me to stay home, but I can’t do that Ask Amy: My unsociable neighbor doesn’t know about me and his wife. When should I tell him? Ask Amy: He asked me if I like his girlfriend, and I couldn’t tell the truth Ask Amy: Amy Dickinson announces her column is ending Ask Amy: Am I being unreasonable about my husband’s attachment to his friend? Below is a Q&A originally published in 2016, and then the recent update. Dear Amy : I’m hoping for a career in art, specifically as an illustrator. Three years ago I graduated with an art degree and have been working to make that happen, doing a lot of research, building a portfolio and exploring my options. I work part time to keep myself fed, but otherwise I’m always drawing, painting and networking. From what I’ve learned, it takes years before most artists can quit their day jobs. I’m prepared for this; I’m in no way lazy, but I know it will take me a long time. I keep my head down and keep trying. My family and friends are supportive, which is wonderful, but there is a big problem. They don’t understand why it is taking me so long. So they offer art advice, although they are not artists: advice on what to paint, how much to sell it for, whom to work for and so on. Sometimes the advice is ridiculous, if not insulting: “Just go work for Disney,” or “Nobody wants to buy those kinds of paintings. Paint portraits; those will sell.” Or, “Do it for the exposure if you have to.” They don’t trust that I know what I’m doing, and they don’t recognize how hard I’m working. It gets to the point where I don’t want to talk about my art at all. I want to enjoy my family get-togethers again. How can I let on (politely) that I’m not interested in their bombardment of ill-informed advice? – Struggling Artist Dear Struggling : Everybody’s an expert, and the less people know about your particular field, the more “expert” their advice becomes. What you are going through is akin to people telling a certain struggling writer (yours truly), “You should write a book and get Oprah to endorse it!” This sort of statement might actually be a vote of confidence from the person offering it; unfortunately, instead it highlights the fact that none of these spectacular goals has been met. It’s a quick way to feel like a loser. Don’t stop talking about your work (if you’re asked), and don’t avoid or ignore this unsolicited advice, but look for effective ways to cope with it. “You should work for Disney,” could be met with “That might be very cool. Do you know anyone there I can call?” Remember always that this is really your fan club; they’re just disguised as a Greek chorus of know-it-alls. Dear Amy: I wrote to you as a struggling artist who was bombarded with bad career advice from family and friends. Well, I’m still a struggling artist and I’m still bombarded with ill-fitting advice, but I’m excited to say I’ve just received an offer on my picture book. I am going to be a published children’s book author/illustrator! The best thing I did was ask for advice from authors and illustrators. I joined the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators and got involved with the local chapter. I’m lucky I found a kick-butt agent and a wonderful writing group. Meanwhile I let the bad advice from my family roll off my back. I know they mean well, and I’m sure they’ll be thrilled to receive a copy of my picture book. My grandma, who taught me how to paint as a child, has dementia now and can’t give advice anymore, but she giggles in delight when I doodle for her. She’s still my biggest fan. – Soon to be Published Dear Soon to be Published: Your update is delightful. Your hard work has really paid off! I look forward to adding your book to my library. Dear Amy : You recently answered a question from “Living a Lie,” who had been lying for 50 years, claiming to be a Vietnam veteran. I am a female military veteran. I, along with countless other women, served proudly alongside our male counterparts. I am disappointed with your comment to Living a Lie about “many thousands of men who served during the Vietnam War, and who have oftentimes suffered because of their service.” Related Articles Ask Amy: My husband wants me to stay home, but I can’t do that Ask Amy: My unsociable neighbor doesn’t know about me and his wife. When should I tell him? Ask Amy: He asked me if I like his girlfriend, and I couldn’t tell the truth Ask Amy: Amy Dickinson announces her column is ending Ask Amy: Am I being unreasonable about my husband’s attachment to his friend? Too often our female soldiers are not acknowledged or recognized for their vital contributions in military service. A quick Google search may have provided you the opportunity to be more inclusive with your response. – Proud Veteran Dear Proud : I’ve heard from several women veterans, highlighting your point. I should have been inclusive in my response, and I apologize for my mistake. You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O. Box 194, Freeville, NY 13068.

        "content": "The QRCS said the campaign seeks to help the charity payers wishing to offer Udhiya for the sake of Allah and in sympathy with those in need, with the aim of securing diverse Sharia-acceptable sacrificial animals, carrying out slaughter at the religiously dictated time, and distributing meat rations to thousands of recipient families across the target countries. This year, the types of sacrificial animals available for donations are sheep (fresh and frozen lambs), cattle (one seventh of a buffalo), and goats. First launched in 2018, the QRCS’s Adahi Campaign effectively helped the donors to secure sacrificial animals like sheep, goats, and cows, had them slaughtered by partners as per Sharia regulations, and then distributed meat rations to almost 1 million refugees, displaced persons, and poor people in numerous countries.

        "description": "An update from the illustrator who was told \"just go work for Disney.\"",
        "content": ": I appreciate it when people give me updates on previously published advice. Related Articles Below is a Q&A originally published in 2016, and then the recent update. : I’m hoping for a career in art, specifically as an illustrator. Three years ago I graduated with an art degree and have been working to make that happen, doing a lot of research, building a portfolio and exploring my options. I work part time to keep myself fed, but otherwise I’m always drawing, painting and networking. From what I’ve learned, it takes years before most artists can quit their day jobs. I’m prepared for this; I’m in no way lazy, but I know it will take me a long time. I keep my head down and keep trying. My family and friends are supportive, which is wonderful, but there is a big problem. They don’t understand why it is taking me so long. So they offer art advice, although they are not artists: advice on what to paint, how much to sell it for, whom to work for and so on. Sometimes the advice is ridiculous, if not insulting: “Just go work for Disney,” or “Nobody wants to buy those kinds of paintings. Paint portraits; those will sell.” Or, “Do it for the exposure if you have to.” They don’t trust that I know what I’m doing, and they don’t recognize how hard I’m working. It gets to the point where I don’t want to talk about my art at all. I want to enjoy my family get-togethers again. How can I let on (politely) that I’m not interested in their bombardment of ill-informed advice? : Everybody’s an expert, and the less people know about your particular field, the more “expert” their advice becomes. What you are going through is akin to people telling a certain struggling writer (yours truly), “You should write a book and get Oprah to endorse it!” This sort of statement might actually be a vote of confidence from the person offering it; unfortunately, instead it highlights the fact that none of these spectacular goals has been met. It’s a quick way to feel like a loser. Don’t stop talking about your work (if you’re asked), and don’t avoid or ignore this unsolicited advice, but look for effective ways to cope with it. “You should work for Disney,” could be met with “That might be very cool. Do you know anyone there I can call?” Remember always that this is really your fan club; they’re just disguised as a Greek chorus of know-it-alls. I wrote to you as a struggling artist who was bombarded with bad career advice from family and friends. Well, I’m still a struggling artist and I’m still bombarded with ill-fitting advice, but I’m excited to say I’ve just received an offer on my picture book. I am going to be a published children’s book author/illustrator! The best thing I did was ask for advice from authors and illustrators. I joined the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators and got involved with the local chapter. I’m lucky I found a kick-butt agent and a wonderful writing group. Meanwhile I let the bad advice from my family roll off my back. I know they mean well, and I’m sure they’ll be thrilled to receive a copy of my picture book. My grandma, who taught me how to paint as a child, has dementia now and can’t give advice anymore, but she giggles in delight when I doodle for her. She’s still my biggest fan. Your update is delightful. Your hard work has really paid off! I look forward to adding your book to my library. : You recently answered a question from who had been lying for 50 years, claiming to be a Vietnam veteran. I am a female military veteran. I, along with countless other women, served proudly our male counterparts. I am disappointed with your comment to Living a Lie about “many thousands of men who served during the Vietnam War, and who have oftentimes suffered because of their service.” Related Articles Too often our female soldiers are not acknowledged or recognized for their vital contributions in military service. A quick Google search may have provided you the opportunity to be more inclusive with your response. : I’ve heard from several women veterans, highlighting your point. I should have been inclusive in my response, and I apologize for my mistake.",

        "description": "Actor Manchu Manoj returns to Tollywood after an eight-year hiatus. During this break, he found love, married Mounika, and welcomed their daughter in April 2024. As he prepares for a comeback with Mirai and What the Fish, Manoj reflects on embracing fatherhood and a new perspective on life.",
        "content": "Actor Manchu Manoj is celebrating two decades in Tollywood this year, but it’s been an eight-year hiatus since his last film. The actor, who made his debut in a lead role with Donga Dongadi in 2004, attributes this hiatus to a “necessary break to rebuild his personal life”. The actor shares, “During this time, I found love and married Mounika . Our joy was doubled when we welcomed our daughter in April 2024.” Manoj has been relishing this new chapter in life, embracing fatherhood fully. Now, as he gears up for a comeback in 2025 with Mirai and then What the Fish , Hyderabad Times catches up with the actor for a tete-e-tete. Excerpts... The first time Manoj saw his baby girl, admittedly his blood pressure shot up because of his excitement. “Experiencing the birth of my daughter was surreal; it’s still sinking in. Holding her for the first time, I felt like I was cradling a precious gift from God. My sister, Lakshmi, handed her to me in the operation theatre, and as I embraced her, my emotions overwhelmed me,” he says, adding, “Witnessing my wife’s strength and pain during labour, while trying to comfort her, transformed me profoundly. It was a moment that reshaped my perspective on life.” When his daughter was born, the room filled with joy as she let out a soft roar. The nickname “Puli” stuck, inspired by her initial reaction. “It’s a temporary moniker until we settle on her official name. The ‘MM’ in ‘MM Puli’ symbolises our bond—Manoj and Mounika,” he says. Manoj is set to make a comeback with Mirai. It was HanuMan actor Teja Sajja who approached Manoj to star in the film. “He narrated the script to me, and I fell in love with the character. It’s a crazy concept. Coming to my other project, What The Fish, it is currently in the pre-production phase and the shooting will soon commence in Canada,” he reveals, adding that the audience will witness him in never-before-seen avatars in his upcoming films. Manoj was born with a passion for acting and he is always hungry for good roles. “Like Hulk says, ‘I’m always angry’, I’m always hungry for acting. When I hear a new script, my energy levels always go up,” he shares. It was in the year 2016 that Manoj felt he deserved a break. “I was 11 months old when I entered the industry as a child actor! When you are born into a film family, you need to realise when to pause and make yourself a priority. Finding Mounika helped me restart my life with a fresh perspective,” he says.",

        "description": "Poco F6 review: Big display, bigger battery but nothing else",
        "content": "Listen to Story Poco F6 is not the dream smartphone that was promised. If I were writing this review within a couple of days of using the phone, my verdict could have been different. The initial days with Poco F6 were pretty good. However, I used the Poco F6 for a little over a week and I saw it struggle in some areas. While it has its pros, the cons overpower the overall performance. Let’s dive deep into the details of the latest Poco flagship. Poco F6 was launched in India on May 23 at a starting price of Rs 29,999. While the smartphone has a plethora of listed features, Poco focused on 4 major parts for this flagship — display, gaming performance, camera, and battery. The smartphone is available in three different variants. The standard variant with 8GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage is priced at Rs 29,999. And other variants are 12GB+256GB and 12GB+ 512GB priced at Rs 31,999 and Rs 33,999, respectively. But is the smartphone worth it? Let's see. The display is perhaps one of the best features of Poco F6. The screen does justice to the vibrant colours presented on it which enhances the gaming or Netflix sessions on the phone. I watched the last legs of IPL on Poco F6 and I have nothing to complain about. It hit the brightness of 2400 nits and I could feel it. While I mostly watched content during the latter part of the day, it was easy to text even under the peak sunlight. The touch is quite smooth and cheers the response rate. I did not feel any hindrance when it came to the touch and display. Adding on to the same point, the fingerprint lock is also built so well that it instantly, within a few seconds, picks up and unlocks the phone. I have a habit of using the face lock — which is also very quick— and could not use the fingerprint lock that often. But whenever I did, it worked just fine. The smartphone has a boxy look with curved edges and a very big screen. To review Poco F6, I moved from iPhone 13 which was a big screen change. I am not kidding when I say that the Poco F6 is as big as my face. While it was excellent for watching content and gaming, Poco F6 is not handy. I do not follow the “phone in the front pocket” phenomenon (because my denim pockets are equal to nothing) but the phone is too big to keep in your hand or in your back pocket. I struggled to use the smartphone with one hand only. I tried typing with my left hand on the phone, but couldn’t reach for the letters at the other end of the keyboard. Coming to the back panel of Poco F6, I was using the classic black version. The phone looks sleek and has a classy edge to it. But I also noticed that it gets attached to smudges and fingerprints. The big gas stove cameras add a heavier look to the device, but in fact Poco F6 is very light. The battery was another aspect that impressed me massively. I never charged the device twice in a day. And on a day when I did not use the device much, the battery was able to stretch for another half a day. Staying true to what was said in the event, the device charged up pretty quickly. In just 15 minutes, the charging speed picked up pace from 41 per cent to 88 per cent, thanks to 90W turbocharging support. Poco F6 features a big 5,000mAh battery. The only fact to be worried about is that it heats up while charging. Even after Poco said that the device has several sensors all across the body to cool down the system. And the disappointment begins! On a personal note, the camera is not that impressive. I tried to click images in all modes, but did not enjoy the experience. The camera does not do justice to the subject being clicked. The images clicked on the phone also have really high saturation, and despite switching off the skin filters, the phone clears out the subject’s skin, even in the selfie mode. Now, this may actually not be a dealbreaker for all users, because this eliminates the need to edit and image and are somewhat social media-ready. However, anyone looking to get at least close-to-authentic shots on the phone, would be disappointed. The Poco F6 features a dual-rear camera system with a 50-megapixel Sony main lens and an 8MP Sony ultrawide lens. The pictures in a well-lit environment come out fine, but the night mode is a bit underwhelming. Pictures clicked by Poco F6 I think the camera is just on the boundary of workable but fails to make it into the great category. The portrait mode has good edge detection, but the overall result is a heavily touched up picture, and I am not a fan of that. Poco F6 portrait mode Here are a few pictures I managed to click this week: It is all well if it ends well. But here, it does not. Poco bragged about the gaming experience so much that one would think that this device could take up hours of gaming. The truth is, after playing Call of Duty for only 30 minutes, I could feel the device heat up. I understand that Delhi is under the wrath of the sun these days, but even in a well air conditioned room, the device heats up during gaming sessions. It was not uncomfortably hot, but it was warm enough that I decided to give it a rest. The plus point, however, is that it cools down quickly as well. I think the liquid cooling system is doing its job. The Hyper OS was supposed to be a better one than the previous operating system, but I felt there were a few drawbacks. Starting with the bloatware on the phone. If I am spending Rs 30,000 on a device, I expect it to be clean. But Poco F6 comes with a bunch of extra applications pre-installed in it. These can be uninstalled, sure, but I would personally prefer no bloatware in the first place. What makes the experience worse is ads in the user interface. For instance, if you want to play any of these pre-installed games, you will have to go through different advertisements. In fact, every time I wanted to search for an app or content, Poco F6 would throw an ad on my face. Over and above, for one time, the device processor slowed down and could not load the home page for a few seconds. But this happened only for one time and never again. Poco might bite me back saying, one can easily uninstall applications which are not in use. My question is how many should I remove? It entails a number of games including, Bubble shooter, Tiles, Block puzzle, Word trip. It also has other heavier applications, like Snapchat and LinkedIn pre-installed. The bloatware does not only take up a huge amount of storage but it also slows down the processor over time. And it is quite frustrating to look at these many apps when I am not even using them. Poco F6 is priced at Rs 29,999 in India. It may make sense for someone looking for a device with a good battery backup and a beautiful display. The phone is also great for users who want to game on their mobile on a budget. However, the excessive bloatware, heating up and okayish camera, makes the phone harder to recommend.",

        "content": "The European Union (EU) and US have been “too soft” on Serbia and should set a deadline for it to adopt sanctions on Russia, Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti told the Financial Times in an interview. He added that the alignment of Serbia’s foreign policy to that of the EU is of vital importance to ensure a sense of security in Kosovo. “Once Serbia puts sanctions on the Russian Federation, then that would be a moment when they would show that they want to get integrated into EU, and Serbia without Russia cannot threaten the security of the continent. So then, I could trust that they basically want peace. And US and EU would not try to appease them anymore,” said Kurti. He justified the Kosovo police raid on several branches of the Serbian Postal Savings Bank in the north of Kosovo last week, in which Serbian dinars, which have been “outlawed” in Kosovo, were seized. Kurti said the restrictions stemmed from Kosovo’s Constitution, which stipulates only one means of payment. He said two-thirds of Serbs received benefits from Kosovo in euros. The Kosovo prime minister declined to say when Pristina would pull its special police back from the northern municipalities but insisted that “complaints from Serbs about their presence were receding.” Kurti conceded there are “sometimes differences” with his European and US allies “when it comes to strategies, operations and tactics on the ground on one hand, and when it comes to relations with Serbia,” but not on values or principles. He said the West’s “soft” approach was “a consequence of having high hopes that sooner rather than later, Serbia will jump into the western democratic camp. In my view, we have waited for too long to be still hopeful,” Kurti told the FT.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, DuPont (NYSE: DD ) stock received an upgraded rating from Citi, moving from Neutral to Buy, with an increased price target set at $95, up from the previous $85. The upgrade follows a positive investor reaction to recent company announcements, with DuPont shares experiencing an approximate 3% rise in the 1.5 days following the news. Citi's analysis indicates that DuPont's decision to operate its businesses independently could drive value through targeted growth and clearer portfolio structure. Additionally, the firm anticipates benefits from a recovery in the electronics sector and a reduction in destocking in more challenging markets. The main concern among investors has been DuPont's valuation, especially in the Electronics and New DuPont (RemainCo) segments. However, after reassessing DuPont's Sum of the Parts (SOTP) valuation in light of the new business structure, Citi has expressed confidence in the company's prospects. The firm's revised outlook is partially based on strong earnings expectations from the electronics division over the next 18 months. Moreover, Citi suggests that further details on the company's separation plan could act as additional positive catalysts throughout the year. DuPont's stock performance and Citi's upgraded rating reflect a broader sense of optimism regarding the company's strategic moves and potential market recovery. The new price target of $95 represents a significant increase and underscores Citi's positive expectations for DuPont's financial future.

        "content": "THIS is the shock moment riot cops raid a Costa del Sol club packed with bikini-clad tourists in a chilling crackdown known as Operation Marbella. The chilling footage shows nearly 20 heavily-armed police storming the Ocean Club Marbella in the Spanish resort of Puerto Banus and ordering revellers out of the pool. British holidaymakers watched on speechless in their swim shorts and bikinis as officers clad in body armour crashed the venue in a broad-daylight raid. Tourists packing out the \"beautiful people\" venue, which over the weekend held one of its two annual champagne parties popular with Bank Holiday visitors from the UK , were urged to keep calm. Police issued loudspeaker messages in Spanish and English saying: “This is just a routine check. The minute we finish you can continue enjoying your afternoon. “Don’t worry, there’s nothing serious going on.” But the images of the operation, which lasted nearly two hours and also involved a police helicopter hovering overhead, showed why some revellers were left uneasy over the ordeal. One clubber is understood to have been arrested, although police have not yet commented officially on the reason for the detention. The spectacular club raid followed a string of shootings in the area, sparking the launch of the so-called Marbella Plan last month to keep British and Irish tourists safe. Police warned locals and visitors at the time they could expect to see more random stops and police checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They said nothing about surprise raids on busy tourist-popular venues, although earlier this month heavily-armed officers crashed a gym at a sports club in the residential area of Nueva Andalucia near Puerto Banus and made three arrests. Gym-users were asked for their ID before being allowed to continue with their routines. The series of shootings so far this year in the Marbella area included a March 11 attack on British-run eatery La Sala near Puerto Banus. The shooting led to the arrests in April of a British man and Irish national described by police as having links to organised crime. Kerry Katona recently claimed she had U-turned on a decision to move to the famous Costa del Sol resort with her family, including fiancé Ryan Mahoney, because of the violent incidents there. Fernando Bentabol, the prosecutor in charge of combating narco crime in the province of Malaga, which Marbella is part of, shone the spotlight on its dark underbelly in a recent newspaper interview. Asked by a local Spanish journalist if the Costa del Sol was turning into Medellin, Colombia’s second largest city previously the most violent in the world and the former home of notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar , he said: “Yes and no. \"It can’t be compared to Medellin because countries such as Colombia are the ones that produce drugs, and most of the actions there are related to plantations, as happens in Morocco for example with cannabis. “We are in the area where the drugs are introduced and distributed to Europe. “But in terms of the level of the organisations involved and their economic capacity, yes it can of course be compared.” Locals have branded parts of Marbella like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\". One suggested recently tourists should start thinking about putting on a bullet-proof vest with their swim shorts and sandals. Another wrote on social media, expressing her fears an innocent person could be killed: “A stray bullet could end up entering a house.” In the early hours of Saturday morning, a 33-year-old man was shot on a residential estate a short drive from Puerto Banus, just across the Marbella muncipal border in the neighbouring municipality of Estepona. No arrests have yet been made. Around ten shell casings thought to have been fired from an AK-47 were reportedly found on the ground at the scene. British man Marcus Stewart mowed down several pedestrians in May 2017 after speeding away from the Ocean Club in an Audi following a fight between two groups of men from the UK. He was arrested by an armed cop on the beach after a police chase following a spectacular head-on crash on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile with a car carrying an 18 day-old baby. He was later jailed for more than five years. By Tom Malley SPANISH police have launched \"Operation Marbella\" to crackdown on violence and keep Brits safe after a spate of recent gang shootings. The Costa del Sol resort is fast becoming a hotspot for crime and cops have warned locals and visitors they can expect to see more random stops and officer checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They are understood to be increasing vigilance in residential areas as well as shopping centres and nightspots, like the millionaire’s playground of Puerto Banus. It comes after two terrifying shootings in March, within the space of a week. As police crackdown on crime they are recruiting the help of sniffer dogs and “aerial resources” - including helicopters and drones. The start of the operation, which will continue through the summer season into October, comes after locals started branding areas like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\" following four shooting incidents in just over a month. No charges were brought against a second Brit held in the drama, a passenger in the car. The Ocean Club describes itself on its website as the “original classic beach club in Marbella and a reference for style, modern luxury and an atmosphere that has made it famous as one of Europe’s chic favourites for relaxing, partying and enjoying the best that summer has to offer.” It adds: “Daytimes are easygoing, with a quality restaurant, while our themed parties are famous for being as glamorous as they are exciting and lively. \"Live music, dancers, entertainers and beautiful people make it an experience to remember.” It held its opening party this year on May 3 and its second champagne party on Sunday, a day after the weekend police raid. High-season bed packages round its saltwater pool cost up to €1,150 (£980). The most expensive packages include three bottles of Veuve Clicquot, a luxury champagne from France . Revellers who book the most expensive VIP beds are warned online there is an additional €1120 (£955) minimum spend on Saturdays. A WAVE of anti-tourist measures are being implemented across Europe to curb mass tourism in popular holiday hotspots. Overcrowding has become the main problem in many sunny destinations, with authorities trying to find a solution to keep tourists and locals happy. Officials have attempted to reduce the impact of holidaymakers by implementing additional taxes on tourists, or banning new hotels. Earlier this year Venice became the first city in the world to charge an entry fee for holidaymakers after it started charging day-trippers €5 (£4.30) if visiting the historical Italian centre. It was followed by an area in Barcelona which resorted to removing a well-used bus route from Apple and Google Maps to stop crowds of tourists from using the bus. Meanwhile, San Sebastián in the north of Spain, limited the maximum number of people on guided visits to 25 to avoid congestion, noise, nuisance and overcrowding. The city has already banned the construction of new hotels. The Spanish government has allowed restaurants to charge customers more for sitting in the shade in Andalucia. Benidorm has introduced time restrictions, as swimming in the sea between midnight and 7am could cost a whopping £1,000. The Canary Islands are also considering adopting measures to regulate the number of visitors - and charge tourists a daily tax. Greece has already enforced a tourist tax during the high season (from March to October) with visitors expected to pay from €1 (£0.86) to €4 (£3.45) per night, depending on the booked accommodation. Officials in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia want to introduce a fee for travellers to remind people to be courteous during their trips.",

        "description": "The father of NRL star Payne Haas is accused of being at the “centre” of a failed drug smuggling attempt in Indonesia.",
        "content": "Indonesian investigators expect to extradite Gregor Haas from the Philippines “very, very soon” for his alleged role in the attempted importation of enough drugs to qualify a convicted person for the death penalty. Haas, an Australian citizen and the father of NRL star Payne Haas , has been in detention in the Philippines since his arrest this month in a dramatic sting involving local and Indonesian police, who had been hunting him for months. Gregor Johann Haas poses for a mugshot following his arrest in Cebu province. Credit: AP The latter are desperate for him to face justice and questioning in Indonesia. Australia, though mostly silent on this case, is against any outcome that opens the possibility of execution. The Indonesians accuse Haas of links to the notorious Sinaloa Cartel of Mexico and of attempting to import more than five kilograms of methamphetamines, hidden in consignments of ceramic flooring, through Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in December. The drugs were allegedly sent from the Mexican City of Guadalajara. Indonesian narcotics agency spokesman Sulistyo Pudjo Hartono accused Haas of being at the “centre” of the operation and “above” six other suspects, all of them Indonesian. Brisbane Broncos player Payne Haas (left) and Gregor Haas at the 2019 Dally M Awards at the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney. Credit: AAP Sulistyo said Haas, 46, had been living on a small island off Lombok on a temporary stay permit as an investor and businessman. The Australian was believed to have entered the Philippines on December 6, several days after Sulistyo said Indonesia received intelligence about the alleged shipment. He would not speculate on whether Haas had received a tip-off. Where the Australian gets sent next, and under what circumstances, is a matter for the Philippines, which is now under the more Western-friendly leadership of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. While authorities there do not have to consult Australia, they have promised to do so anyway in a show of goodwill between the two countries. Asked if Haas could be deported to Australia, Sulistyo declared emphatically, “No!” “If an Indonesian citizen commits a crime, killing an Australian citizen in Sydney or Melbourne, he will be prosecuted over there, he will be indicted over there, he will be questioned over there and will be imprisoned over there. It is all similar everywhere,” he said. A decision by the Philippines Bureau of Immigration may be weeks away, or possibly longer. Complicating the matter of extradition, and potentially putting international loyalties to the test, is the case of Philippine citizen Mary Jane Veloso, who has been on death row in Indonesia for a more than a decade on a contested drug conviction. Marcos Jr is under intense pressure to bring her home, and Haas could be used by both Indonesia and the Philippines as a bargaining chip. The Australian Federal Police has said it had no role in tracking or arresting Haas. Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's opposition-controlled legislature passed changes on Tuesday that are seen as favoring China and diminishing the power of the island's president. The changes pushed by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies give the body greater power to control budgets, including defense spending that the party has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. The Nationalists took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan's de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Thousands of people gathered outside Taiwan's legislature on Tuesday to oppose changes being pushed through by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies that would give the body greater power. The Nationalists, also known as the KMT, took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan's de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. The proposed legislative changes would give them more power to control budgets, including defense spending that the KMT has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. Taiwan's legislative chamber was festooned with banners promoting both sides in the dispute, while arguments on the floor broke out into shouting and pushing matches.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: While dismissing the rumours of becoming the next head coach of the Indian men's cricket team, former Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh empathizes with Hardik Pandya as he navigates a challenging phase in his career. Despite Pandya's struggles in the IPL , both as a captain and player for Mumbai Indians, Harbhajan believes that he will perform differently when representing India in the upcoming T20 World Cup . He hopes that Pandya, who \"hasn't been a free man in the last two months,\" will find his form during the tournament, as a strong performance from him could significantly boost India's chances of success. \"When he wears that blue jersey, he will be a different Hardik Pandya because we know he can score those runs and take those wickets. I want Hardik to come good as he has gone through a lot and I wish him all the very best to have a very good tournament for India,\" said Harbhajan. \"If he has a good tournament, obviously India will have a great chance to go forward. Yes, his form is a bit of a concern...and lot of other stuff was going on around him, his shifting from Gujarat to Mumbai, was a big change and the team (MI) didn't react too well to Hardik coming back and that too as captain,\" the 43-year-old added. He urges the team management to ensure that Pandya and Rohit are on the \"same page\" and that the entire team plays together as a cohesive unit. \"It looked like they (MI) were not playing together as a team. So there was a lot going on. Hardik wasn't a free man in the last two months. I believe both of them and many others who have played in different teams will have to come together to do something special for the nation,\" he said. Regarding India's pace attack, Harbhajan believes that Jasprit Bumrah is the only bowler who can consistently perform well regardless of the conditions. He feels that Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj may need assistance from the pitch to be effective. Harbhajan hopes that the other bowlers will step up and take responsibility alongside Bumrah. \"Pace attack definitely could be a concern because because Bumrah is in a different league for the kind of bowler he is. He will win you games on any kind of pitch. He doesn't need conditions whereas other bowlers like Arshdeep and Siraj would need help from conditions. If there's bounce, Siraj might do well. He is tall, can also swing it both ways, hits the deck hard and has got pace. But if wickets are slow then the challenge begins for other bowlers,\" said Harbhajan. Impressed by Virat Kohli 's improved strike rate and the addition of new shots to his repertoire during the IPL, Harbhajan emphasizes the importance of Kohli and Rohit Sharma scoring quickly in the Powerplay while also respecting the conditions in the USA and West Indies. \"Virat has shown a lot of improvement from last year to this year and people spoke about his strike rate. It was in 130s during last year and this time it is in 160s,\" he said. Regarding the speculation surrounding Gautam Gambhir as a potential candidate for India's head coach position, Harbhajan believes that the most crucial task for any coach is to bring the team together and ensure they play as a cohesive unit. \"I don't think I will be able to give that much time. At this stage of my life I have a young family and I need to be around them and look after them. Yes, when the right time comes, I will put my foot forward and say I am ready for it,\" he concluded.",

        "description": "Qatar tourism sector has been identified as one of the key sectors in the country’s economy contributing to attracting investments and increasing the revenues.The post Qatar to simplify licensing procedures for hotels appeared first on Travel And Tour World.",
        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 A joint initiative by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Qatar Tourism aims to simplify licensing procedures and stimulate the tourism sector. In a bid to boost the nation’s hospitality and tourism sectors, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Qatar Tourism have launched an initiative to streamline licensing procedures for tourism establishments and businesses. The initiative includes elements like seasonal discounts, festival-specific discounts, promotional offers, and special deals, all designed to stimulate the tourism sector. The key focus is on simplifying and speeding up ‘Qualitative Licensing Services’ making it easier to overcome challenges faced when applying for promotional and price reduction licenses, as well as procedures for festival, event and exhibition licensing. Hassan Sultan Al-Ghanim, Assistant Undersecretary for Consumer Affairs at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, said: “This was introduced to facilitate the procedures for obtaining specific licenses for tourism and hospitality establishments, where obtaining the license would take one business day, with the prerequisite that all terms and conditions are met and the required documents submitted, this would have a direct positive impact on the entire sector’s value chain. Qatar tourism sector has been identified as one of the key sectors in the country’s economy, which contributes to attracting investments and increasing the revenues. “This initiative comes within the framework of the efforts of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to develop the business environment and facilitate business ventures in the country, and to establish an encouraging investment environment for entrepreneurs and investors. It is important to shed light on the Ministry’s keenness to consolidate collaborations with various relevant government entities with the aim to facilitate and streamline procedures for granting the necessary approvals and licenses to establish a business.” An integral part of the initiative is the issuance of a single-fee annual license that includes all offers and discounts provided by hotels, as announced through their marketing plans. The application process for the ‘single- license’ will be overseen by Visit Qatar, the main branch of Qatar Tourism, thus ensuring streamlined procedures and enhanced inter-sector cooperation. Omar Al Jaber, Acting Chief of the Tourism Development Sector at Qatar Tourism, said: “The new licensing initiative by Qatar Tourism and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry aims to enhance tourism offerings across relevant businesses and provide necessary protection for the activities of these establishments. Thus, providing the sector the flexibility to intensify its efforts by launching promotional campaigns that revive their work as well as provide tourists opportunities to enjoy attractive offerings, enhancing visitors’ experience. This initiative reflects Qatar Tourism’s commitment to develop and expand the reach of the tourism sector in the country, by including more tourism and hospitality businesses and focus on being comprehensive with its licensing protocol and elevating the efficacy and transparency of key services.”",

        "content": "Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi on Tuesday came out strongly against PM Modi over the ‘400 paar’ slogan and said that earlier he used to speak about it but now he doesn’t, adding that his mind keeps on changing. “Earlier he used to speak but now he doesn’t speak. His mind keeps changing. What I know is that people are tired of their politics. They want that there should be talk on inflation, unemployment and on several serious issues,” Priyanka said. Earlier today, in an interview with ANI, PM Modi said that the last phase of the general elections will be the last stage of the people who dream big and make false promises. On being asked about whether he thinks that the BJP will cross 400 seats as the last phase of the elections is approaching, PM Modi said, “I can see many things in it. One, our new era will begin. There is a sign in it. Secondly, the people who were dreaming big and making big promises, this is the last stage for them as well. This is not just the last stage of elections; this is the last stage of their situation as well.” Meanwhile, speaking at a rally in Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi accused the BJP of ignoring Himachal during the floods. “Soon after our government was formed, a disaster struck Himachal Hundreds of people were left homeless, schools and roads were destroyed Every Congress leader worked for the people during the disaster Narendra Modi, who calls Himachal his second home, did not even come to see you,” she said. She further accused the BJP of trying to topple the elected government in Himachal Pradesh by using money power. “In democracy, people are supreme- this is the ideology of Congress. But today a different kind of politics of BJP has emerged, which takes the name of religion but does not follow the path of religion. Religion teaches us to speak the truth and have respect for the people. But BJP tries to topple the government elected by the people on the basis of money and power,” she said. In another election rally in Kutlehar she alleged that PM Modi had not kept any of his promises made during the 2019 elections. “The public placed their faith in Modiji and made him win. He told the public that... I will bring back black money from foreign countries I will deposit 15 lakh rupees in people’s accounts I will provide 2 crore jobs every year I will double the income of farmers. But he did nothing. Now at the time of the elections, Narendra Modi has come to ask for votes from you, but he is not telling you what happened to the old promises? Himachal Pradesh goes to the polls in the last phase of elections on June 1. In 2019 the BJP won all four seats in the state and the Congress will be hoping to upset the BJP this time. The results will be declared on June 4. (ANI)",

Well, it doesn’t have to be if you do it right. Start by choosing an appropriate time and place, ensuring privacy and calmness. Use easy, age-appropriate language to explain the biological process. Also emphasise the importance of hygiene, while reassuring them that they can always come to you with any concerns or questions. Here’s a handy guide.",

        "description": "Playing Destiny 2. Not played it in a few years, and I've never really been able to follow the story that well, possibly cos I never pay that much attention to it anyway. It is pretty cool though when I've read up about it. The gameplay still feels as good as ever, especially the shooting which is probably one of my favourites in a FPS.I'm playing solo which has mostly been fine. I did bump up difficulty to Legendary, as I found I was destroying everything. That made the horde sections too difficult for me, as you get dumped back to the start of the section when you die. So back on to Classic, seeing as you can't change the difficulty mid mission.",
        "content": "After a few weekends of not playing anything, I got the itch to just play something, so I went back to the FF7 remake. I won't say it \"clicked\" for me this time necessarily, I still think the combat is wildly overrated and the pacing of this game has been so far pretty horrible, but after a couple of really boring early chapters, Chapter 4 and 5 were significantly more interesting to me than basically anything that came before it outside of the opener. And I quite literally have nothing else to play right now, so I may as well see this to the end. Also I don't care if it is all a trick, Jessie you are welcome to ruin my life. Hopped back on Tekken 8 because I have a local tournament coming up this week. Starting again after a break was rough but after a couple days I think I can hold my own again. Also, finally started Hi-Fi Rush and it's been delightful. Dave The Diver and Animal Well are queued up next. Still playing FF7 Rebirth (102 hours, now in Chapter 12) and a little bit of Fallout 76 here and there. I’m having a lot of fun with Stellar Blade! For a game that actually has a lot of little issues that do add up, it’s getting enough right to keep me fully engaged, though I am surprised just how much it really does take from NieR. I was looking for something breezy and this is fitting the bill wonderfully. @Jimmer-jammer Did you play Fallen Order? If so, how does it compare to Stellar Blade? @Black_Swordsman Structurally, I’d say Fallen Order is actually a pretty fair comparison, though Stellar Blade is a fair bit more clumsy in it’s execution and its writing and characters just aren’t on the same level. Beyond that, little things like unpausable/unskippable cutscenes and a protagonist who tends to control like a dump truck at the most inopportune times chip away from what could be a smoother experience. Overall, it fits well within PlayStation’s portfolio of graphically sexy, straightforward and polished comfort food. @Jimmer-jammer I'm glad to hear it's not all bad, then. I loved Fallen Order but from what you say overall I think I will still give Stellar Blade a pass. Eyeing up RotR for when I end my gaming break, so I'll tag you when I have gotten round to the part of the game where you're past the early hours and the real experience begins! Got a specific build in mind, but not Berserk-related this time. 😉 I love the fact that there are preset character creation codes in the game. I'll give you a clue as to my build. \"Got the coin for it?\" 😃 @Black_Swordsman You actually get to make two characters, so you can probably role play that even farther than you might think 😊 I'm making my way through Sand Land and finding it pretty enjoyable. Definitely my type of game. Also still playing and loving Sea of Thieves. I'm playing Rise of the Ronin currently. So far it seems like Ghost of Tsushima with better combat which is a good thing because I loved that game. I'll probably make a start on WRC 10 tomorrow also. WRC 9 was great so I'm expecting more of the same. @xeofate I just started this as well (RotR) I went for a Geralt of Rivia build as I was saying to Jimmer-jammer above. Only played a bit so far, loving the combat which is excellent as you say. I remapped the controls to make them match the control scheme for the Souls games. 😃 Did you go for a specific type of character for your primary Blade Twin? @Black_Swordsman That's not a bad idea remapping the controls actually, might do that myself. I went with the Dex build of Breaker like I always do in souls games. For the main protagonist I kind of made him like an old greying Jin from Ghost of Tsushima. As for the other Blade Twin I made her like my pawn in Dragon's Dogma 2 which was named after my old German Shepherd dog Rusty I've been in a bit of a gaming slump since beating Dragon's Dogma 2 but I think this game is going to change that, liking it so far. xeofate wrote: I'm playing Rise of the Ronin currently. . Black_Swordsman wrote: @xeofate I just started this as well (RotR) I am many hours into RotR and have enjoyed my journey so far i think its a better game than GoT but that's just my opinion. Decided to give XDefiant a try. I've been looking for a game that I can play when I have a spare 15 minutes and this looks like it'll be perfect for that. I've put in a few hours on Deliver Us Mars. The story seems compelling enough, the graphics and score are fantastic and the exploration puzzle gameplay is pretty much what I'd expected from playing the first game. The only thing that's getting to me is the jankiness of the character animations, it's like half way between cartoon and realism and keeps throwing me out of full immersion. The spacey sci-fi geek in me is enjoying it so far though. Just started RotR properly. Looks promising so far. Loving the combat. Edit: Just beat the Prologue and first boss. Proper action rpg game so far. Edit 2: Haha, didn't realise the second boss that you're meant to defeat was actually the final boss battle of the prologue, completed and got the appropriate trophy this morning🤣 . @Jimmer-jammer Now let loose in the world! @xeofate Idk how it is for you but, also, RotR strongly reminds me of TW3 so far for some reason. I think it's related to the quest & leveling-up system. I’m currently playing Dragon’s Dogma 2 . I’ve been playing for 40 hours, and I’m level 32 and have barely touched the main quest. I love this game. Playing Destiny 2. Not played it in a few years, and I've never really been able to follow the story that well, possibly cos I never pay that much attention to it anyway.

        "content": "LONG-TIME Derby favourite City Of Troy looks set to be replaced at the head of the market - as the wounded superstar loses supporters everywhere and drifts alarmingly in the market. City Of Troy suffered a disastrous 2000 Guineas after being sent off the red-hot 4-6 fav on the back of glowing reports from trainer Aidan O'Brien and a sensational two-year-old campaign. The Ballydoyle handler has since admitted he treated the colt 'like too much of a God' in the run-up as he crashed out at Newmarket. With doubts building over just how much these Justify colts train on at three and the horse's confidence no doubt shattered by his no show, punters are looking elsewhere in the Derby market. And Coral are predicting City Of Troy, who has spent months at the head of the market, will be replaced if money keeps coming in for two key rivals. One of them is Aidan O'Brien's Los Angeles, who's unbeaten in three, was a Group 1 winner last season and looks tailor made for the 1m4f Derby trip. Described by his trainer as 'lazy', Los Angeles was last seen holding off Euphoric to win a Group 3 over 1m2f at Leopardstown earlier this month. The other is Charlie Appleby's Dante runner-up Ancient Wisdom. Last year's Futurity winner was pumped six lengths by Economics at York but William Haggas will not run his stable star at Epsom. Ancient Wisdom might have been the second string of Godolphin had Hidden Law not suffered a fatal injury seconds after winning the Chester Vase . But he deserves his place near the top of the betting and is now into as short as 4-1. Los Angeles has been cut into 7-2 with City Of Troy drifting alarmingly out to 11-4. Bookies Coral joked City Of Troy is 'under siege' as Derby favourite - but there's no denying he could find himself completely friendless before Saturday's race. Coral's David Stevens said: \"City Of Troy was as short as 7-4 for the Derby last week, but in recent days Ancient Wisdom, who was 11-1, and Los Angeles, 6-1 at the weekend, have been the pair attracting the most support. \"The money has come to such a point where either could now end up replacing City Of Troy as big race favourite come Saturday.\" Betfred Derby odds via Coral 11-4 City Of Troy 4-1 Los Angeles 5-1 Ambiente Friendly, Ancient Wisdom 11-1 Dancing Gemini 12-1 Macduff 16-1 Bellum Justum 20-1 Voyage, 25-1 Deira Mile 33-1 Bar A responsible gambler is someone who: Find our detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here .",

        "description": "Generations of families have warm memories of Melton Mowbray’s Trevonne Dance School, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this week.",
        "content": "Many former students were in the audience at the weekend for a celebratory showcase of the family-run organisation at Melton Theatre. Just 10 youngsters took part in the school’s inaugural sessions at what is now John Ferneley College back in the 1970s. Advertisement Advertisement Sign up to our daily newsletter Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Melton Times, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Half-a-century later, 300 students, aged from toddlers to women in their 60s, strut their stuff at the modern studios based at North Street in the town. Hayley Sessions runs Trevonne after taking over in the late 1990s from her mum, the school’s founder, Yvonne Makins. On clocking up 50 years, Hayley told the Melton Times: “It’s amazing. There were students my mum used to teach before my time and their children were part of my cohort of dancers and they now bring their own children to sessions. It is fabulous to see that they all bring their children back.” Trevonne started out using The Drill Hall in Melton and they also staged lessons at Venture House and Melton College at various times. Advertisement Advertisement The school moved to North Street three years ago - they have three senior teachers, five assistant teachers and some volunteer teachers giving lessons in their three studios. “It’s so nice having our own studios because when you are working towards exams or shows and you have the older girls who want to put in more hours they can stay on later,” said Hayley. “We’ve had to stop dancing in the past when the caretaker’s rattling his keys somewhere we’ve hired.” The school regularly sends dancers to perform at events in London, at iconic venues like the Royal Albert Hall and Sadler’s Wells. Advertisement Advertisement Many students also train with Trevonne and go off to do performances in Leicester or Nottingham. They also put on productions in their own studios after hiring equipment in and they use Melton Theatre about three times a year for shows. Some students go on to study performing arts at Brooksby Melton College or at colleges in Leicester and Nottingham. Being part of Trevonne has been important for the development of children who attend sessions. Advertisement Advertisement Hayley, whose speciality is teaching modern and tap although she is trained in all genres, said: “It is great for building friendships, discipline, confidence. “It’s great to put their school books away and come and enjoy dancing. For some it becomes a way of life, it is something they are good at.” Reflecting on the achievements of Trevonne, she added: “It is incredible. It doesn’t seem possible at all that it’s been going so long and all the young lives that we’ve touched. It’s a huge achievement that we are still here and going strong. “Two of my daughters are teachers and one is a dancer as well. Advertisement Advertisement “They just enjoy it and hopefully one day I can pass it on to them.” Any family interested in dancing with Trevonne can email [email protected] or call 07946 009401.

Read on for actionable insights on leveraging customer intelligence and staying ahead in this rapidly developing area. You’d be hard pressed to find two more overused buzzwords than artificial intelligence (AI) and omnichannel. But when retailers put these two ubiquitous topics together? That’s when the magic starts to happen. There are exciting times ahead as AI finally makes omnichannel retail a reality. The promise of omnichannel retail The concept of omnichannel retail experiences is nothing new. Retailers have long sought to provide shoppers with seamless, fully connected interactions regardless of the channel via which they choose to browse or buy. So far, however, few execute this really well. Instead of the omnichannel dream, most retailers are stuck in a multichannel model where they market and sell via disconnected online and offline touchpoints. They rely on campaigns being designed to deliver consistent messaging, but their interactions are disjointed and don’t take into account how the individual shopper is navigating the retail experience. AI-enabled experiences in an evolving space AI is set to change all this. It allows retailers to get smarter about how they engage with people – understanding where shoppers are on the purchase journey, predicting what they need, and tailoring the experience accordingly. AI also overcomes resource limitations, enabling the execution of thousands of creative variations for truly one-to-one interactions. But all this is only possible when AI has a strong foundation of data and identity – in other words when it is fueled by customer intelligence. Customer intelligence is fully connected data that delivers a single customer view. It allows retailers to understand the people they are interacting with, and to apply that understanding in a meaningful way. Most retailers recognize the need to use data to fix disjointed experiences. Customer expectations continue to rise, and personalization is required to build trust. What’s more, the retail landscape is constantly evolving. The convergence of commerce and marketing in areas such as social commerce and shoppable ads is one example. Another is the reinvention of how shopping feels in the physical space, with retailers bringing digital elements to in-store shopping to create ‘phygital’ experience (think virtual assistants advising on in-store purchases). Both of these trends require deep, data-driven customer understanding. Moving ahead with customer intelligence Despite understanding the need for customer intelligence, few retailers really know how to use it. So, what can they do to reach the point where they can fuel AI and make omnichannel a reality? The steps retailers should take depend where they are on the path to customer intelligence maturity. Our research reveals that while 90% of brands have started the journey, only 4% are already able to use customer intelligence to gain a competitive advantage. The vast majority only have pockets of insight and are using data solely for rear-view measurement. There’s a long way to go to achieve real-time, predictive, innovation-focused customer intelligence, with use cases fully aligned to business value. Here are four actions retailers can take today to move forward with customer intelligence and support AI-enabled omnichannel experiences: 1. Ensure there’s a board-level sponsor A board-level champion can get buy-in for customer intelligence and articulate what the organization wants to achieve with it. They can push for greater integration, and ultimately embed insights into boardroom decision making. Perhaps most importantly, they can ensure there is a dedicated budget for customer intelligence and grow it to enable a culture of innovation. 2. Build a comprehensive data set Bringing data together, using an enterprise data management platform and an advanced identity solution, achieves a single, coherent view of shoppers. Then a data audit can reveal any gaps. Retailers should establish the right value exchange for their first-party data, being clear what data will be used for, asking customers for their permission, and then following through. They can then bolster this with high quality second- and third-party data. 3. Increase analytics sophistication Most retailers have a basic toolkit of conventional, reactive analytics. They should look for opportunities to apply advanced, predictive analytics – building on the view of what has happened with a view of what will happen. Based on those future scenarios, they can make decisions across product development, supply chain, and customer service, as well as marketing. 4. Assess infrastructure and support Retailers should ensure their tech stack is up to date and cloud based, allowing collaborative access to customer data across the organization. Ultimately, they should work towards an entirely automated workflow from data gathering and ingestion to analysis and activation. They should also establish a core, multidisciplinary team to drive standardization and maintain quality. There’s potential to work with partners to make the most of in-demand skills and expertise. It’s nothing new, but true omnichannel experiences – that meet shoppers where they are and offer meaningful, personalized interactions – are still the retail dream. Only now AI enables retailers to turn it into reality. With a strong foundation of customer intelligence, the dream is well within reach. Learn more about Acxiom’s retail marketing solutions.",

        "description": "PRIME Minister Rishi Sunak has been ordered to publish secret documents showing the impact of his cut to Universal Credit.",
        "content": "As Chancellor, Sunak scrapped the £20-a-week uplift introduced during the pandemic in March 2020 despite being urged not to do so by the likes of footballer Marcus Rashford. The Government has subsequently refused to publish analysis examining the impact of not extending the support. However, the Information Commissioners' Office (ICO) has now demanded the Treasury disclose the details. The support was worth around £1000 a year and was a temporary measure to help vulnerable families through the coronavirus crisis . READ MORE: SNP will force vote on Palestinian statehood, John Swinney says It came to an end in October 2021 despite warnings it could plunge 800,000 people into poverty . Last summer the Treasury refused to release any analysis of ending the support when requested by The Mirror. They argued it would \"not be in the public interest due to the harm it would cause to policy development and delivering for welfare benefit claimants\". But in a decision notice - sent to the paper just hours before the General Election was called - the ICO ordered the Treasury to publish the information \"within 30 calendar days\". It means the Government has until June 21 to publish the details, just two weeks before the UK hits the polls. In its judgement, the ICO said: \"The commissioner has concluded, that the public interest favours disclosure of the request information. In reaching this view, the Commissioner has given particular weight to the fact that the policy to which the statistics relate is no longer live. \"He has also given weight to the fact that the policy was one which was developed in the unique circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a strong public interest in knowing as much as possible about what information the government was considering in that unprecedented and challenging period.\" READ MORE: SNP MSP John Mason claims ICC is 'biased against Israel' During the investigation, the Treasury told the ICO it did not conduct \"a formal impact assessment relating to the conclusion of this temporary policy\", but it admitted information was held \"that details our analysis on the impacts of further extensions, which can be used to show the impact of not extending the uplift\". It added: \"The uplift was initially put in place temporarily between April 2020 and March 2021. In March 2021, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced it would be extended for a further 6 months. This policy was always designed as temporary so the information in scope relates to analysis completed prior to the 6-month extension\".",

        "content": "The Indian embassy in Muscat in association with the National Archives of India (NAI) successfully conducted a unique and pioneering initiative to archive historical documents of the Indian diaspora in Oman. ‘The Oman Collection – Archival Heritage of the Indian Community in Oman’ – a special digitisation and oral history project was conducted at the Embassy of India premises in Muscat from May 19 to 27. It saw an enthusiastic participation of 32 prominent Indian families hailing from Gujarat, whose presence in Oman spans several generations and dates back 250 years, the Indian embassy in Muscat said in a statement. This marks the first overseas project of the NAI for digitising and archiving diaspora documents, marking an important step in preserving the history and heritage of the Indian community abroad. Currently, Oman is home to nearly 700,000 Indians. Both countries share a rich tapestry of historical and cultural connections that go back 5000 years. In recent times, several merchant families mainly from Mandvi, Surat, and other parts of Gujarat have been resident in Sur, Muttrah, and Muscat since the late 18th century CE. They are an integral part of the Omani society. Moreover, many of them have become Omani citizens now, but also maintain strong ties with the motherland India. During the collection, over 7000 documents in English, Arabic, Gujarati, and Hindi languages from the private collections of the old Indian merchant families were scanned and digitized under this project. The oldest digitized document dates back to 1838, while a large majority date from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The wide variety of documents that were digitized included, personal diaries, account books, ledgers, telegrams, trade invoices, passports, citations, letters and correspondences, photographs, and many more, that highlighted the lives and contributions of the Indian community in the Sultanate of Oman. “These documents collectively constitute a vivid narration of the history of the Indian community in Oman, including their cultural practices, social activities, trade, and commerce, as well as their contributions to and integration into the Omani society, and the preservation of Indian traditions abroad,” the embassy stated. These digitised documents will be archived and uploaded on ‘Abhilekh Patal’, the digital portal of the NAI, making these documents available to researchers and the wider public. Additionally, the project also involved the recording of oral histories of the older members of the Indian community, the first such oral history project by the National Archives of India. These included personal anecdotes, migration experiences, and the evolution of the Indian community in Oman over the decades and will enrich the archival records. Arun Singhal, Director General of the National Archives of India (NAI) noted the unique significance of this project and emphasised that this marks a historic milestone for the NAI. “This is the first time that we have collected and digitized the private archives of diaspora documents from abroad. This marks a historic milestone for the NAI and a significant step towards preserving the rich heritage and narratives of the diverse overseas Indian community,” he said. Amit Narang, Ambassador of India to Oman said that this project aligns with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to strengthen connections with the Indian diaspora worldwide. “By documenting and preserving the history of the Indian community in Oman, we are rekindling a vital part of our shared heritage and fostering a deeper engagement with our diaspora,” he added. Sheikh Anil Khimji, head of the Indian community in Oman, also expressed his appreciation for the project. He thanked PM Modi and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar for their vision. “We thank Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and External Affairs Minister, Dr. S. Jaishankar for their vision of engaging and connecting with the Indian diaspora. The archiving of the historical documents of the Indian diaspora by the Embassy of India will go a long way in preserving their history and in doing so also showcase the time-tested bonds of friendship between India and the Sultanate of Oman,” Khimji said. The initiative was supported by the National Records and Archives Authority (NRAA) of Oman, which provided essential logistical and other support, ensuring the smooth execution of the project, the embassy stated. Along with preserving historical records, the digitization project also seeks to foster a more focused engagement with the Indian diaspora community in Oman, and in doing so will promote a better appreciation of the longstanding India-Oman friendship. Moreover, the project will facilitate better research about the Indian diaspora’s development and contributions and will serve as a valuable resource for future generations.",

        "content": "Falling 7-1 behind George Russell in qualifying and blaming that on his team-mate getting Mercedes’ new front wing in Monaco, Jamie Chadwick says Lewis Hamilton is “spinning” the narrative. Arriving in Monaco 6-1 down on Russell in the intra-Mercedes team-mate qualifying battle, Lewis Hamilton put his latest defeat to his team-mate down to Russell running Mercedes’ new front wing in Monte Carlo. Qualifying P7, 0.08s down on Russell who was P5, Hamilton said: “I anticipated it would be difficult to outqualify George because he has the upgraded component, but it’s just great to see that we are bringing upgrades. “ I already know automatically that I’m going to lose two-tenths going into qualifying. That’s definitely frustrating.” Going on to declare he does “not anticipate being ahead of George in qualifying particularly this year”, Hamilton was pressed on the claim with a “we’ll see” reply. But rather than read too much into Hamilton’s comment, Williams development driver Chadwick believes Hamilton is “spinning it” to suit his narrative. “I think he knows what he’s doing,” Chadwick told Channel 4. “He’s spinning it to make it sound like he’s maybe not got the upgrades this weekend which for me, I’m not sure about because a team like Mercedes, they generally always bring upgrades to both cars. “It’s not like they need to split it between the two cars. “So yeah, I think he should take his hat off to George. He’s 7-1 on someone like Lewis Hamilton, which is incredible. “And I think Lewis is probably not happy about that, to be honest. And that’s where that comment has come from.” 👉 F1 2024: Head-to-head qualifying record between team-mates 👉 F1 2024: Head-to-head race statistics between team-mates Hamilton did in fact not have the upgraded front wing in Monaco, one report claiming the drivers tossed a coin to decide who would run it, another by Jenson Button saying the seven-time World Champion opted not to as damaging the wing in qualifying would’ve meant a pit lane start as he would’ve had to revert to an old spec. Chadwick reckons Hamilton best get used to be second on the list when it comes to new Mercedes parts. “He’s on his way out next year,” she added, “George is going to be staying in that seat for what they hope is a long time so they need to keep that seat and keep George happy. “And obviously that might come off the back of maybe Lewis being not so happy but at the same time he’s done an incredible job, he’s smashing him.” Up on Hamilton in qualifying and race stats, Russell is also ahead of his team-mates in the Drivers’ standings with 54 points to 42.

        "description": "Manchester City continue to face accusations of cheating as the Premier League's 115 charges related to alleged financial wrongdoing hang over Pep Guardiola's side",
        "content": "Arsenal sporting director Edu claims that he 'cannot say how he feels' when it comes to the 115 charges of alleged financial wrongdoing facing rivals Manchester City . Premier League chiefs threw the book at City last February, three months before they secured their third of four successive league titles at Arsenal's expense. Edu's club once again finished as runners-up to Pep Guardiola and co this season, angering supporters who continue to accuse City of cheating their way to unparalleled success. The reigning champions vehemently deny any wrongdoing and it's been widely reported that City executives believe they'll be cleared once a hearing takes place - although it's unknown when . In the meantime, Edu is keeping tight-lipped. Pep Guardiola has already identified his replacement when he leaves Man City Man Utd and Arsenal eye wonderkid that team-mates claim is 'best they have seen' \"There are things that unfortunately I cannot say what I feel,\" the ex-Gunners midfielder told Brazilian outlet Estadao when asked about City's charges. \"But all the credit in the world to Pep for the training and work he's been doing since he started his career. \"I even joke with my son that I want to see if he's really good at rugby. It's a joke I make because he's already won everything in football.\" However Guardiola achieves his success won't be a mystery to Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta , who was part of the Catalan's coaching staff before making his return to the Emirates in 2019. Arteta has been working closely with Edu ever since to help reach City's level on the pitch and in the same interview, the Gunners chief explained one of the most crucial aspects of his role - transfers. Your turn! How should Manchester City be punished if they're found guilty? Let us know in the comments section Edu kept it brief when asked about Manchester City's 115 charges ( Image: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) \"You can't sign for the sake of signing,\" Edu stated. \"This has to be a process that takes weeks and weeks. On my table, I have reports with over 180 pages of a player. It is really detailed. Physical, technical, mental profile - if you have experience of Premier League, if you will be able to adapt. It has it all. \"We analyse our shortcomings, where we can improve, where we can invest and from there we go in search of this new name. What I am going to do now, we have been discussing since January. It is not my decision or Mikel. It's from a whole group.\" The aim for Arsenal is to go one better next season and lift their first Premier League title in what'll be 22 years.

        "description": "The company, one of China’s largest private-sector conglomerates, aims to cut its debts by 10 billion yuan (US$1.38 billion) annually in the next two to three years.",
        "content": "Shanghai-based Fosun, controlled by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, announced on Tuesday that the proceeds of the sale will be used to replenish general working capital. The divestment aims at streamlining Fosun’s portfolio and “enhancing [our] asset-light operation strategy”, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. “It also demonstrates the company’s continuous efforts to create maximum value for its shareholders.” Fosun, which is involved in a wide range of industries including tourism, pharmaceuticals, real estate and financial services, aims to cut its debts by 10 billion yuan (US$1.38 billion) annually in the next two to three years, co-chairman Wang Qunbin said during an earnings briefing on March 28. An asset-light strategy refers to a business model under which a company has only a small amount of fixed assets on its balance sheet. “[Fosun] could dispose of more noncore assets and could even target disposing of its stake in Hainan Mining, which could generate more than enough liquidity for all of its capital market debts,” Andrew Chan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a research note on Tuesday. Fosun owns nearly half of Shanghai-listed Hainan Mining, which has a market capitalisation of 14.6 billion yuan. Since April 2023, Fosun has spent more than US$46 million to buy its Hong Kong-listed shares as a way of boosting investor confidence, according to Chan. He added that Fosun is comfortable with its current liquidity buffer, which still has more than US$2 billion in assets that could be disposed of to enhance liquidity. Fosun reduced its interest-bearing debts, such as bank loans and corporate bonds, by 15 billion yuan to 211.9 billion yuan in 2023, according to the company’s annual earnings report. It posted a net profit of 1.38 billion yuan for 2023, turning around from a net loss of 831.8 million yuan a year earlier. Its revenue grew 8.6 per cent to 198.2 billion yuan. Taking over HAL will strengthen ABN Amro’s position as one of the top three wealth-management firms in Germany and increase its assets by €26 billion. “This is a rare opportunity to add scale to our German activities,” ABN Amro CEO Robert Swaak said in a statement. “The proposed acquisition will further strengthen our position and offer employees of the combined group the opportunity to play a driving role in the consolidating German market.”",

        "content": "The makers of Kajol and PrabhuDeva starrer action thriller have unveiled the first glimpse and title of the intense action and gripping drama. After 27 years, Kajol and Prabhudeva are reuniting for Telugu director Charan Tej Uppalapati’s action thriller, which is titled, ‘Maharagni – Queen of Queens’. Interestingly, the first schedule of ‘Maharagni’ was recently completed and now the makers have unveiled the official teaser of the film. Taking to Instagram, Ajay Devgn treated fans with a teaser of his wife’s upcoming movie ‘Maharagni’. The video opens with Prabhudeva stepping out of a charter plane, immediately takes down a group of goons. The action then shifts to Samyuktha Menon, who amidst a high-stakes chase, shares her quest for revenge. The video shows Naseeruddin Shah lying in a hospital bed sharing his heartfelt last wish and Kajol emerging in her ‘Maharagni’ avatar, exuding power and strength in her never-seen-before role. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn) Sharing the video, he wrote, “Aali re aali, #Maharagni aali! kajol.” As soon as the first glimpse was shared, fans chimed in the comment section. One of the users wrote, “Singham ki lady Singham.” Directed and written by Charan Tej Uppalapati and produced by Harman Baweja and Venkata Anish Dorigillu under the labels of Baweja Studios and E7 Entertainments, ‘Maharagni – Queen of Queens’ is a pan-India film set to be released in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. Apart from Kajol and Prabhudeva, the cast also includes Naseeruddin Shah, Samyuktha Menon, Jisshu Sengupta, and Aditya Seal, among others. Talking about the project, director Charan Tej Uppalapati stated, “Directing Maharagni – Queen of Queens has been a labour of love. Collaborating with actors like Kajol, Prabhudeva, Naseer sir, Samyukta Menon and Jishusen Gupta has elevated the project to new heights. Their unmatched charisma and acting abilities breathe life into the characters, and I can’t wait for the audience to witness this on screen.” Sharing his thoughts, producer Harman Baweja said, “Maharagni is a special project for Baweja Studios, driven by a compelling story. We are excited to collaborate with Eternal 7 and have an extraordinary cast featuring Kajol, Prabhudeva, Naseeruddin Shah and Samyukta Menon. Kajol’s talent and authenticity make her perfect for this role. At Baweja Studios, we believe in telling powerful stories, and I am thrilled to bring this project to life with such a stellar team.” Adding to that, producer Venkata Anish Dorigillu said, “As soon as I came across this story, I knew it carried a powerful message that needed to reach the masses. With Charan Tej Uppalapati’s keen eye for direction and the remarkable talent of our stellar cast, we are confident that we will deliver a unique vision that will make this story shine.” Kajol and Prabhudeva earlier worked in Rajiv Menon’s 1997 Tamil film ‘Minsara Kanavu’. The film was released in Hindi as ‘Sapnay’. More details of the project are awaited. Apart from this, Kajol will be seen in ‘Do Patti’. Recently, the makers unveiled the teaser of the film. In the teaser, Kajol plays a police officer. This is also the first time Kajol has played the role of a cop. The teaser begins with Kajol as a cop riding a bike, while Kriti Sanon’s character is also shown as a glamorous one. ‘Do Patti’ also marks Kriti and Kajol’s second collaboration after ‘Dilwale’. Ajay, on the other hand, is gearing up for Rohit Shetty’s upcoming cop film ‘Singham Again’. ‘Singham Again’ also stars Arjun Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Deepika Padukone, Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff, and Ranveer Singh in the lead roles. ‘Singham Again’ is the third instalment of the super-hit franchise. ‘Singham’ was released in 2011, starring Kajal Aggarwal and Prakash Raj in lead roles, followed by ‘Singham Returns’ in 2014. Both projects were declared box office hits. ‘Singham Again’ is scheduled to have a theatrical release in August 2024, coinciding with Independence Day.",

In the viral video, the star player could be seen searching for something with his guards and managers. As soon as Babar came out of the hotel, fans surrounded him to take pictures with him. However, the fans' sweet gesture made Babar angry, who told admirers to give him two minutes in a tough tone. Despite Babar's request, a fan continued filming the cover-drive master, after which he directed his guards to disperse his fans. Later, Babar gave a treat to his fans by posing for the pictures with them. It's pertinent to mention here that Green Shirts are currently in England for a four-match T20I series.",

        "description": "Consumer advocate says there’s more deception in the world of online reviews than people realize. She recommends getting tips from friends and family instead.",
        "content": "We use them all the time — Yelp, Tripadvisor, the BBB — websites that post reviews by customers, clients and patients of all sorts of companies and health care providers. But can we trust these reviews? Are the websites that post them taking steps to assure they are legit? “No and no,” says Kay Dean of San Jose, Calif., a former criminal investigator in the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General. Dean’s bad experience with a health care provider with glowing reviews led her on a journey into the expansive realm of fake online reviews. “I no longer put an ounce of trust in any online review site,” she says. She is the founder of Fake Review Watch , which she says is on the side of consumers and honest businesses and attempts to show the issues that major review platforms have with fake reviews.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Personal experience led to her investigation About seven years ago, Dean used stellar reviews she saw on Yelp and Google to select a medical care provider. “The experience turned out to be the exact opposite of what was claimed on the platforms, leaving me suspicious about these reviews I had relied on. And so, drawing on my knowledge as an investigator, I began doing some digging and uncovered this medical practice was trading fake reviews with other businesses in Facebook groups.” She discovered that “the online review world was saturated with so much deception — far more so than people realize.” Frustrated by a lack of official action against this widespread fraud, Dean created YouTube videos with case studies as real examples, which she offers to major news outlets. “That’s been effective, but my larger goal is to highlight the culpability of tech companies and review sites that are not doing enough to protect the public. I try to educate people not to trust online reviews at all, and I attempt to rally public support for more enforcement and new legislation.” Fake reviews are very convincing I asked Dean to share the clues consumers should look for to alert them that they are reading a fake review. “It is extremely difficult for the average consumer to discern which reviews are fake,” Dean notes, “as they can be very detailed and convincing, some written by the business itself. I’ve seen many contractor reviews with photos of work lifted off of a real estate listing in another state and thousands of Yelp reviews with content simply plagiarized from Tripadvisor written by other people, sometimes years earlier. Determining whether (a review is) real or fake often requires analyzing sets of reviewers and businesses together to see if suspicious patterns emerge indicating deception.” Dean points out that even the Better Business Bureau website “has become polluted with review fraud, hosting plenty of fake BBB reviews. I’ve found that a robust black market exists for them, including several marketers in Facebook groups offering to sell BBB reviews. I reached out to one guy from Pakistan. He offered to sell them for $3 each!” Furthermore, she notes, the BBB site lacks transparency. “Just click on a BBB review to find out something about the reviewer. Nothing comes up. There are no photos. No last names are used, nor is there any other way of finding out who or what else the person has reviewed, or if they even exist. So while the BBB says, ‘Trust us,’ you can’t.” An industry of fake reviews Online networks, many based in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, sell fake reviews for the BBB, Yelp, Google, Angi and many more, charging as little as 50 cents per review. They have “programs” for movers, lawyers, doctors, dentists, you name it, and will create fake positive and negative reviews that appear to come from real people in cities all over America. Sites such as Reviews That Stick offer reviews across multiple platforms to boost the reputation of a business. “Much of the fraud, though, is organized on social media sites with impunity,” Dean says, adding, “Facebook does little to stop the marketing of fake reviews. There are scores of groups on its platform that openly facilitate buying and selling them. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , however, web-hosting platforms are not responsible for this kind of illegal activity conducted by third parties.” Houston defamation attorney Paul Sternberg says, “But when the platform itself — such as the BBB — gives an A+ rating when they know or should know from hundreds of complaints the business is misleading its customers, I believe they have opened themselves up to being sued. Even if the platform says, ‘We do not endorse,’ the very fact of awarding that grade — which then is used by the business in its advertising — is an endorsement.” If we can’t trust online reviews, then what? Dean believes that until social media sites like Facebook and review platforms such as Google and Yelp can be held accountable for the rampant review fraud they allow to be foisted on the public, not much will change. This would require congressional action. Until then, she recommends consumers use the old-fashioned method of choosing businesses — by talking to real relatives and friends about who they would recommend.

        "content": "A CAPSULE wardrobe is a term often thrown about in the fashion business, but what is a capsule wardrobe? A capsule wardrobe is a specific selection of go-to staples you can rely on day in and day out, season after season, year after year. A capsule wardrobe is essentially a minimalist collection of clothes, that you can put together in different ways to create a simpler, more sustainable way of dressing - and easier in the mornings too - as you can mix and match those staples with other key pieces or trend items. Typically a capsule collection is a refined collection of some of your most worn pieces, your classic go-to's you can't live without, but are versatile enough to see you through every season, any occasion, year after year. Some of the most popular wardrobe staples we have in our closet - and have done for many decades - include a trusted pair of jeans, smart wide-leg trousers, classic layering items, such as T-shirts and tanks, as well as a timeless leather biker jacket or blazer. In most cases, you can wear every item in your capsule wardrobe as one complete outfit, or use it as a base to style with other garments. Pair your failsafe Levi jeans with a white t-shirt, black heeled boots, and a black leather jacket for the office, after-work drinks, brunch with friends, or your next shopping spree. Alternatively switch the white t-shirt for a more jazzy top for an evening out, either way your capsule wardrobe will be the base for many looks, save you money in the long run and leave you feeling confident and looking great. You can even pair the same jeans with. tank top and sandals for the warmer months, or a city break. The point is it is effortless, versatile and interchangeable. The best part of a capsule wardrobe is it is timeless, so if you don't have select items in your closet already they are well worthy investment pieces to see you through any occasion, season, and style. Generally, a capsule wardrobe is classic colours, and tonal hues, such as black, white, greys, navy, and camel, which can be paired with any outfit, hence why it is so popular to nail. For those who may prefer a colourful wardrobe, you can easily inject colour through other layering items, accessories, or your make-up to elevate a look and make it more personal to your style. And, if you change your style in years to come, the capsule wardrobe is still a fallback you can rely on. If you are looking to declutter your wardrobe, slim down your closet, and start to forge a capsule wardrobe, we have some handy tips to help you curate the essentials. A classic black bag is a staple, it will go with any outfit and is suitable for any occasion, day or night, year after year. You can't go wrong with this Kate Spade Pebbled Leather Tote, which can be styled not just as a shoulder bag but also as a cross-body and handbag. The pebbled black leather is an elegant choice that won't date, making it a great starting point for your capsule wardrobe and suitable for a multitude of events. It's perfect to house your laptop when heading to the office, as well as your valuables for a shopping spree. Knott Pebbled Leather Medium Crossbody tote, £375 Of course, jeans are a classic wardrobe essential, and while you may own a variety of styles; from skinny, to wide-leg, or flares, a straight leg in a classic blue denim wash is our top pick. If we were only to wear one pair of jeans for the rest of our lives it would have to be Levi's 501s, which complement any outfit, can be dressed up or down and are super flattering for all body types. Levis have stood the test of time, and are available in numerous waist and leg lengths to suit every body shape. From summer through to winter a pair of jeans are always a failsafe option. While we are trying to keep our capsule wardrobe to a minimum we recommend stocking up on this style in blue denim, ecru and black. 501s Levis Original Jeans, £100 We love a blazer more than anyone, as they are a versatile statement piece for anyone of any age, and for any occasion. Some may prefer fitted blazers, our personal favourite is an oversized design, as it is flattering, timeless, and much more versatile. You can wear your blazer over jeans and a jumper when heading to the office, over leggings and a hoodie for a quick dash to run errands, over a dress for drinks for a little more coverage, or on its own with knee-high boots, and cinched in with a belt for full-on glam. Blazers are created using various fabrics, such as wool, cotton, and linen, but we recommend a relaxed cotton design to see you all year long - as a wool blazer in summer or a linen blazer in winter isn't quite the most sensible style option. Relaxed Single Breasted Blazer, £69 When it comes to Autumn and Winter, a turtle neck, or roll-neck jumper is a must. They are chic, classy, timeless, formal and flattering as they elongate your arms and neck. They work as the perfect winter warmer, as you can style under a blazer, shacket, another jumper, or leather jacket. M&S has an impressive range of turtle neck designs, which also come in its signature Heatgen technology for extra warmth in the colder seasons. But come the warmer seasons you may switch to a sleeveless tank for layering. Pure Merino Wool Roll Neck Jumper, £35 We love a cosy knit jumper, and this & Other Stories number is a classic. A knit jumper is perfect to layer in winter, wear on its own, under a blazer or parker jacket, with jeans, leggings, a skirt, over a dress, paired with boots, trainers, you name it. But you can also keep it with you in the Spring and Summer seasons too, drape it over your shoulders so it is easy to slip on when the balmy nights turn a little chilly at those upcoming garden parties. This & Other Stories' jumpers are long-lasting, with a slightly boxy fit, so you have room to move or layer underneath. Mock Neck Sweater, £45 We have an entire drawer filled with T-shirts, the majority of which are classic white round-neck styles. Why? Because they go with everything. A round crew neck boxy t-shirt is a lifesaver for everyone and a non-negotiable in your capsule wardrobe. Arket's boxy style is perfect, as the short sleeves are the perfect length, the collar is not too tight or loose around the neck, and best still - the fabric is not see-through, yet not too heavy. Tuck into jeans, a skirt, or shorts, or wear over leggings, you can dress up or down, wear on its own, or layer on top. However you choose to style a white T-shirt, it will always look chic. Crew-Neck T-shirt, £17 If you only buy one pair of boots, make it a pair of classic black boots . One of the classics we return to time after time is a block heel ankle boot with a pointed or square toe because it goes with every outfit. You can pair this footwear must-have with jeans, a skirt and jumper for the office, and a blazer dress for weekend drinks, the possibilities are endless. Dear Frances has plenty of boot designs, but the Cube Boot is part of the Core Collection, which speaks volumes in our opinion. Cube Boot, £595 A cotton shirt sounds super formal but it doesn't have to be styled solely for the office with a suit. It's a must-have for those days you want to look \"done\" and well put together but with minimal effort. Worn with jeans and trainers, it looks classic and is a brilliant base under a chunky round knit jumper and leggings, or with smart trousers. You can even wear the shirt undone over a bralette for an evening out. Extra Fine Cotton shirt, £29.90 A pair of classic white trainers will never go amiss in your wardrobe. Some may prefer the timeless Converse, whether its high or low tops, Veja, the New Balance 550, or Superga's Nappa trainers or Cotu Classic, which are hugely popular with Kate Middleton. What we love is not only are they super fashionable, but they go with everything, and provide a little platform to elevate you. Pair with skirts and floral dresses in the summer, with jeans or trousers in winter and spring, as long as they are crisp and clean you will look super chic. 2740 Platform Nappa, £110 Over the last few years, our major obsession has been with leather trousers, faux or real, is up to you. Currently, we're loving a wide-leg leather pant, a more wearable silhouette than the PU leggings of seasons past. While they may not be the most summer-appropriate trousers, they will see you through every other season and occasion. You can pair your leather trousers with a slogan jumper, trainers and a trench coat for a casual but put-together look, with heeled boots, or a blouse and heels for evening drinks. I have lived in my straight, wide-leg, high-rise leather trousers for years, and continue to get compliments on them because they give a polished look no matter how you style them. Vegan Leather 90s Straight Pant, £82 A midi dress has been our firm favourite style for many years now, as it is practical, moveable and versatile. This design is suited for all ages, and suits various style preferences, as you can opt for midi shirt dresses, midi slip dresses, midi wrap dresses - and so much more. One of our personal favourites is a floral printed midi dress, like Nobody's Child, which is short-sleeved and falls midway down your calves as you can dress it up or down. Pair this number with sandals or trainers in the summer, heels for a wedding or formal occasion, or layer with a chunky knit jumper, tights and boots for the winter months. Wildflower Print Clover Midi Dress, £59 Linen shirts are essential when the warmer weather hits, whether that is in the balmy spring and summer seasons. If you are heading on holiday, or making the switch over from your winter wardrobe to summer, a linen shirt is paramount. You can layer over a t-shirt, tank top and jeans, or a skirt, for the daytime, or wear over a bikini for those pool days. It's lightweight and effortless, and you can even be bold by opting for a block colour such as vibrant green or bubble gum pink. Linen fabric is super gentle on the skin, and breathable, which is why it's a welcome alternative to a cotton poplin. Linen Shirt, £35 For shoppers looking for anything leather, or remotely biker/ rock chic inspired, Allsaints is the place to go. We have lusted after their leather jackets for longer than we can remember, and if you have yet to buy yours, now is the time to do so. We recommend an oversize biker style rather than a fitted leather, as it is more timeless, and goes with everything. Plus, the larger style, means you can wear it more if your body changes over the years. And the worn and weathered look after years of wear just makes it look cool and vintage, a win-win. Billie Oversized Leather Biker Jacket, £399 The LBD - also known as the little black dress - has been the iconic evening look for many years, and it is not going anywhere. A little black dress is classy and timeless, so it's no surprise it cuts our capsule wardrobe. Whether it is cotton, scuba or a satin slip dress, an LBD is a garment you will wear forever more, whether it is for a festival, drinks, or date night. You can pair it with knee-high boots, heeled boots, or stilettos, layer with a blazer or biker jacket over the top, or even opt for a t-shirt or sheer long sleeve underneath for a daytime look. The styling options know no bounds. Marlow Dress, £98 Wide-leg trousers have made a comeback in recent years, and we aren't mad about it. This style is flattering as the high-waisted design, and wide leg feature, means the trousers elongate your legs and skim over them so they appear longer and leaner. They are also a welcome alternative to formal smart trousers in the workplace, and jeans, which can feel a little restricting. Pleated Wide Leg trousers, £40 We love a trench coat in the Spring and Summer months, as well as the transitional periods between seasons. You can style it with a classic white top and jeans for a casual, yet chic, everyday look, or layer over a jumper or knitted roll neck should you wish. Some even wear over a tracksuit with a cap for those off-duty days. Premium Trench Coat, £51.60 (Was £129) A racer vest has become another wardrobe staple in recent years, and a welcome alternative to roll necks and t-shirts we wear all year round. This summer style is perfectly paired with trousers, jeans, shorts, as well as skirts, so you can get creative. What we love is River Island's design is longer length and not cropped, which some may prefer for more coverage. Plus, you can shop an unmissable deal on racer vests at River Island, which is two tops for £18. White Rib Racer Vest Top, £10 We don't feel an outfit is complete without jewellery. Over the years the resurgence of gold jewellery has proved hugely popular, and we are well on board. If you are unsure how to style gold jewellery, we recommend easing your way with a statement gold hoop, whether it is a smaller huggie or chunkier style. For those who love their accessories as much as we do, layer up with stackable rings, bracelets and bangles, as well as chokers and pendants - more is more. Missoma has a vast array of styles to shop across rings, necklaces, bracelets and earrings, so you can shop sets or individual pieces to your heart's content. Medium Chubby Hoop Earrings, £115 Outerwear is essential, and one coat design we see time and time again is a pea coat, tailored coat, and straight coat. It comes under numerous titles but it is a straight coat, with button front fastening, is a long line and is more structured than a trench coat. You can style it with any outfit, as it instantly elevates any look. Fawn Felt Single Breasted Coat, £170 New Balance trainers are the hottest footwear trend now, but what is the best style for you? Best trainers for women, these are our favourite pairs to snap up. A leather jacket has always been one of our wardrobe staples, here's where to shop the outerwear.",

        "description": "Several products by Indian brands MDH and Everest in Singapore and Hong Kong were found to contain traces of harmful ethylene oxide.",
        "content": "Ethylene oxide is a colourless gas used as a pesticide and to make other chemicals. “The issues have been sorted. We have put in place mandatory tests,” BN Jha, director of marketing at the Spices Board of India, the government regulatory and export promotion agency for Indian spices, told This Week in Asia on Monday . He noted that the contaminant was found in a consignment shipped 18 months ago and could have occurred naturally. India plans to conduct mandatory pre-shipment sample testing for six months, after which it will reassess the situation to see if there are persistent concerns. Raj Paroda, a former director general of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, told This Week in Asia: “We are concerned because it’s a matter of prestige and reputation. The system should be made stronger in terms of traceability and quality.” MDH and Everest, two of India’s most popular spice brands, have said their products are safe for consumption. “We do not use ethylene oxide at any stage of our spice production. Our products adhere to stringent health and safety standards,” MDH said in a statement reported by India’s Mint newspaper on April 28. Following the recalls, Britain’s food watchdog applied extra control measures on all spice imports from India starting this month. Once valued more than gold and silver, India’s spices trade spurred European traders to sail to the country in the 15th century. While India’s spice exports remain significant, the country must overhaul its approach to food safety and public communication to boost consumer confidence, industry experts say Over 400 products from India were flagged by the European Union between 2019 and 2024 for containing contaminants, according to a report by the Indian newspaper Deccan Herald. 03:28 India’s beloved butter chicken dish is at centre of court case probing who invented it Smita Sirohi, a former agriculture adviser to the Indian embassies in Belgium, Luxembourg and the EU, said Indian authorities had tightened preventive measures to remove any residue from ethylene oxide. “I am surprised why similar steps were not taken for other markets since they had taken them earlier for the EU,” Sirohi said, referring to the recent cases in Hong Kong and Singapore. “Certainly it will have a damaging impact,” recalling how EU importers had cautioned about Indian spice consignments in earlier cases. India exports US$4 billion of more than 200 spices and value-added products to some 180 countries annually while the country’s domestic market is the world’s largest at US$10 billion, the Spices Board of India has estimated. The sheer variety of Indian spices makes it hard for traders to trace within the supply chain to the relevant farms, Sirohi said. Farmers typically send their spices to traders for aggregation and shipment in wholesale markets. Large factories would receive supplies from these markets, and contamination can occur potentially at each step of the supply chain, according to Sirohi. Though mandatory testing can show the presence of chemicals exceeding certain legal thresholds, the problem could only be resolved by assessing the stage of initial contamination in the supply chain, Sirohi said. Authorities also need to establish guidelines for chemical use and tighten food safety processes, she added. India’s health ministry has said the country applies one of the world’s strictest standards for capping residual pesticides through rigorous risk assessments. But the cases in Hong Kong, Singapore and Europe show food safety processes and oversight in India need further strengthening, industry players say. Ruchit G Garg, founder and CEO of Harvesting Farmer Network, an agriculture technology platform, said India needed to establish excellent food safety standards. “Our spices [and agricultural products] may or may not have had traces but our track record isn’t very good and our farming practices aren’t very organic,” he said. 02:27 One family, one polling station: remote Himalayan villagers cast votes in Indian general election “India needs to invest heavily in fixing its reputation to produce healthy, chemical-free agricultural products. It has a long reputation of producing chemical-rich food, much beyond the safe limits defined by many countries.” One market analyst said there could be a spillover adverse impact on other Indian products beyond spices. “The fact that these two brands failed [to meet quality norms] does not speak well of them and could have a wider impact on other Indian brands,” said Lloyd Mathias, a Delhi-based angel investor and business strategist. “Indian standards have to be on a global benchmark. One cannot afford to have different standards. There can be absolutely no compromise on safety,” he said.",

        "description": "A licensing official and police constable said they deemed the premises to be more of a nightclub than a restaurant",
        "content": "A Cardiff restaurant and bar in a residential area that applied to stay open until 4.30am during the week is being run as a nightclub according to a licensing official. Members of Cardiff Council's licensing sub-committee refused Delta Lounge's proposals to alter its premises licence at a meeting on Wednesday, May 22. The venue, located in Lower Cathedral Road, is currently allowed to stay open until midnight at the latest. Speaking at the meeting pollution control officer at Shared Regulatory Services (SRS) Emma-Jayne Barratt said the application raised \"serious concerns\" and said noise complaints had already been made about music being played late. She said that on one occasion music from the venue could be heard by someone sat in a vehicle outside the building. Ms Barratt said: \"It is being run as a nightclub.\" READ MORE: ' Kebab shop horror as takeaway leaves 50 people ill and 11 in hospital with food poisoning' READ MORE: ' Major plans revealed to transform shopping centre into huge entertainment centre' Local councillor for Riverside, Cllr Caro Wild, said he liked the premises, better known as Rockin Chair by many in the area, but added that opening past 11pm was too late and it can get \"pretty noisy\". For more Cardiff news sign up to our newsletter here . \"It looks like a fun place... [but] for us it is really in the wrong place,\" said Cllr Wild. \"You only have to go a few hundred metres and you are right into houses in almost every direction. Personally I think those hours are too late. I don't think we should be negotiating past 11pm.\" Delta Lounge applied to open its premises from 9am to 4.30am Thursday to Sunday and 9am to 6.30am on Fridays and Saturdays. A video played at the licensing sub-committee meeting showed a large crowd of people in Delta Lounge at an event which took place from Saturday, February 17, to Sunday, February 18. In the video people were dancing and loud music was audible. There was no sign of any food being served or eaten. David Abuneke, who took on Rockin Chair in December 2023, said he wanted to extend the opening hours to accommodate for a lot of his clientele who worked late hours and came in from 11pm. He also said customers were asked to leave the premises quietly. Mr Abuneke said: \"To run a business like this is hard. I have lost all of my savings trying to get this place up and running. People who go there are not troublemakers... we don't want to have problems with our neighbours.\" PC Jason Jones, representing South Wales Police at the meeting, said he also felt that the premises was being run more as a nightclub than a restaurant. In highlighting concerns about public order, PC Jones pointed committee members' attention to a report of a fight involving \"multiple males\" that police attended at about 2.23am on Friday, January 26. Mr Abuenke said the fight did not take place inside the premises and that the issue occurred after someone was asked to leave, adding that an individual tried to have an argument with a bouncer on the door. Delta Lounge's application also included a proposal to sell alcohol on and off the premises from 9am to 4am from Sunday to Thursday and from 9am to 6am on Friday and Saturday. They were also asking to host entertainment in the form of live and recorded music from 9am to 4am from Sunday to Thursday and between 9am and 6am on Friday and Saturday.",

        "content": "However, according to CaughtOffside sources with knowledge of the situation, the English club and Unai Emery don’t consider him as part of their plans and are already working to let him go – temporarily or permanently – during the summer. Aston Villa to cash in on Phillipe Coutinho At the moment, the big obstacle to a definitive farewell seems to be his contract at Villa Park, which runs until 2026. Coutinho is unwilling to lose money on his £135k per week deal by negotiating an early termination of the agreement. Aston Villa, for their part, have set what they consider a fair price for him of around £6m-£8m. Whilst that paltry figure shows how far his stock has fallen, it has piqued the interest of various clubs around the world. Among those are some teams from Qatar and elsewhere in the Middle East, who could decide to bring him back there in the summer. Vasco da Gama are also very interested in him and have already started to talk with the Brazilian player. At the moment, however, Vasco consider the costs of the possible operation too high, when adding the amount of a transfer to the salary requested by Coutinho. In any event, Aston Villa, to lighten their wage bill, are also willing to consider a loan but continue to hope that a club will take Coutinho on a permanent basis.",

        "content": "1,000 dabbawallahs in Mumbai on Tuesday expressed their support for Team India ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup starting from June 1 onwards in West Indies and USA, by wearing the team jerseys. A large group of dabbawallahs, a cultural icon in Mumbai, which keeps the whole city going with its impeccable food and delivery facilities, dressed in Blue colours and shouted ‘India! India!’ as the team prepares for its first clash against Ireland on June 5. Ashok, one of the dabbawallahs said to ANI, “I feel proud while wearing this jersey. The World Cup is coming. We dabbawallahs are wearing this jersey to express the support. Our team is strong, Rohit (Sharma) and Virat (Kohli) will showcase their magic and India will bring the cup home. There are 1,000 dabbawallahs in Mumbai working and they are all wearing the jerseys today.” Another dabbawallah named Nakul said, “India should win the World Cup. That is why we are wearing this jersey. We will pray that India wins the WC.” India will start their T20 World Cup campaign on June 5 against Ireland at the newly constructed Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York. Meanwhile, the most-awaited blockbuster clash between India and Pakistan will take place on June 9. They will later play tournament co-hosts USA (June 12) and Canada (June 15) to wrap up their Group A matches. In the tournament, India will be aiming to end their ICC trophy drought, having last won the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. Since then, India has reached the 50-over World Cup final in 2023, semifinal in 2015 and 2019, the title clash of the ICC World Test Championship in 2021 and 2023, T20 WC final in 2014, semifinals in 2016 and 2022 but failed to secure a big ICC trophy. India will be aiming to win their first T20 WC title since they won the inaugural edition of the tournament back in 2007 in South Africa. In the last edition held in Australia in 2022, India lost to England by 10 wickets in the semifinals. India squad: Rohit Sharma (c), Hardik Pandya (vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant (wk), Sanju Samson (wk), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohd.

Becca and Lawrence were complete strangers in a banking hall until Cupid orchestrated a plan for them to bump into each other. 😍 They exchanged contacts and things took a sweet turn when they moved to new cities. Today, they are serving us love and beauty with their pre-wedding photos and you can just tell that they are so smitten. We are so happy for them as they embark on this forever journey. Enjoy their pre-wedding shoot and love story below: How we met By the groom, Lawrence : I met Rebecca in February 2020 at Zenith Bank Ogudu where she was working. I went into the bank with a friend to make some cash deposits. While waiting for my friend, she walked up to me asking me to open an account with the bank (She was a marketer at that time). While she was still trying to convince me to get an account with them, my friend showed up so we had to leave. However, we exchanged numbers that day. We started talking during the lockdown and became good friends. I later lost touch with her for the whole of 2021. In 2022 January, she reached out to me, she was already in Canada and I was in the UK. We continued from where we left off and the rest is history.

        "description": "This index fund provides exposure to artificial intelligence stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett turned Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest companies in the world through a litany of shrewd investments. In fact, its stock price has skyrocketed more than 4,300,000% since he took control in 1965. That accomplishment has made Buffett one of the most revered figures in the financial world. Surprisingly, Buffett has never recommended Berkshire stock. Instead, he has regularly advised investors to periodically purchase shares of an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC 0.70% ) . That strategy provides diversified exposure to hundreds of American businesses that are collectively \"bound to do well\" over time, according to Buffett. Indeed, history says investors can build an $903,800 portfolio over three decades by simply investing $350 per month in an S&P 500 index fund. Here's how. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides diversified exposure to hundreds of U.S. companies The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( VOO 0.68% ) measures the performance of 500 U.S. companies, a blend of value stocks and growth stocks from every market sector. The index fund covers about 80% of U.S. equities and nearly 50% of global equities by market capitalization, meaning it spreads money across many of the most influential companies in the world. One tailwind that should send the S&P 500 higher in future years is artificial intelligence (AI). Just as e-commerce, mobile connectivity, and cloud computing drove the index higher in past years, many experts see AI as the next generation-defining investment theme. Indeed, the five largest holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (shown in the chart) are all well positioned to monetize AI in the future. Here's a look at each company. Microsoft ( MSFT 0.74% ) is the largest enterprise software vendor and the second-largest cloud computing provider. The company is monetizing artificial intelligence with generative AI Copilots for its software products, and cloud AI services. Most notably, Microsoft Azure lets developers build generative AI applications with large language models from ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Apple ( AAPL 1.66% ) has cultivated brand authority across several consumer electronics verticals, and it has a particularly strong market presence in smartphones. The company undoubtedly lags its big tech peers in monetizing artificial intelligence, but upcoming versions of iOS will reportedly feature AI-powered search, summaries, photo editing, and other automations. Nvidia ( NVDA 2.57% ) graphics processing units (GPUs) offer unparalleled performance when accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence applications. The company holds more than 80% market share in AI chips, and its extensive product ecosystem -- spanning hardware, software, and services -- makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for building entire AI data centers . Alphabet ( GOOG 0.72% ) ( GOOGL 0.83% ) is the market leader in digital advertising and the third-largest cloud computing provider, and it's leaning into artificial intelligence across both product categories with its Gemini model . Specifically, Gemini simplifies ad campaign creation with natural language, supports the development of generative AI applications, and automates work in its office productivity suite Google Workspace. Amazon ( AMZN -0.17% ) enjoys a leadership position in e-commerce, retail advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is using artificial intelligence across all three product categories. Rufus is an AI-powered shopping assistant, Amazon Ads offers generative AI for creating brand images, and Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service for developing generative AI applications. The Vanguard S&P 500 is a cheap, easy way to build wealth The S&P 500 is a proven moneymaker. The index outperformed virtually every other asset class over the last two decades, from international equities and fixed income to real estate and precious metals, and it has been a profitable investment over every 20-year period in history. The S&P 500 returned 1,970% over the last 30 years, compounding at 10.62% annually. At that pace, $350 invested monthly would be worth $74,200 in one decade, $288,100 in two decades, and $903,800 in three decades. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but even a more conservative growth rate of 10% annually would turn $350 invested monthly into $791,000 over three decades. Warren Buffett believes \"American business -- and consequently a basket of stocks -- is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.\" His logic is simple: The U.S. is the largest and arguably the most innovative economy in the world. Indeed, 16 of the 20 largest companies in the world are U.S. companies, and the U.S. stock market is by far the largest. That makes a compelling argument for investing in U.S. stocks, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is essentially a basket of the most successful U.S. companies. Additionally, with an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning the annual fees will total $3 for every $10,000 invested, the index fund is a cheap and easy way to build wealth.",

        "content": "Several county athletes were competing at the East of Scotland age group athletics championships at Grangemouth last weekend. The event attracted athletes from as far north as Aberdeen down to Galashiels. Branna Kenny, of Haddington Athletics Club, was first up in the under-13 girls’ 70m hurdles. Branna Kenny (left) took gold in the girls' 70m hurdles in Grangemouth. Image: Simon Wootton She won gold in a very closely contested race by just one-hundredth of a second in a fast time of 12.70s. Archie Brown, a pupil of Law Primary School in North Berwick who competes for Lasswade Athletics Club, was taking part in three events in the under-13 boys. He dominated all his events, winning gold medals in the 100m, 200m and long jump. He ran personal bests of 13.40s and 27.15s respectively, and a long jump personal best of 4.94m. Archie Brown (centre) won three gold medals on an impressive day His sister Freya Brown, a pupil at North Berwick High School who also competes for Lasswade Athletics Club, was competing in the under-15 girls’ 1,500m. In a very competitive final, she sprinted away in the last 200m to win gold, taking 20 seconds off her personal best to finish in 4m38s. Cerys Wright, also of North Berwick High School, was competing in the U15 girls’ 800m. Freya Brown (centre) timed her sprint perfectly to clinch gold in the 1,500m She ran a very brave race from the front, just being pipped for gold by hundredths of a second. She came away with a personal best of 2m16s and the silver medal. A spokesperson for Team East Lothian said: “This was a great start to the track season with national events coming up later in the summer.”",

        "description": "A new era begins at Stamford Bridge.",
        "content": "Chelsea are closing in on the appointment of Enzo Maresca – but what style of play can fans expect from the highly rated Italian coach? Having guided Leicester City to the Championship title last season, Maresca appears to have topped Chelsea’s shortlist to replace the outgoing Mauricio Pochettino after Roberto De Zerbi and Kieran McKenna were also considered by the Blues’ hierarchy. Chelsea will need to pay around £10million in compensation but hope to have the Italian appointed by the end of the week. The 44-year-old will inherit a young and bloated Chelsea squad but one that did show promise towards the end of the season as they finished sixth to secure a return to European football. Following his retirement from the professional game in February 2017, which saw him play for the likes of Juventus and Sevilla, Maresca went straight into coaching. He enjoyed a stint as an assistant manager at West Ham under Manuel Pellegrini before being appointed as Manchester City’s Elite Development Squad manager in 2020. ‘Manuel [Pellegrini] was the person who convinced me to try to become a coach when I decided to finish playing,’ Maresca said. ‘So, I always say that in terms of an experience about football, Manuel for me is like a father. ‘If I had some doubt, to be honest he helped me a lot as a player and in the last two years when I worked with him when he was manager at West Ham, and I have a tremendous relationship with him. ‘I was still working like a player with him and one day during a chat with him he said: ‘You know when you finish as a player you should try to become a coach because I think you can be a good coach.’ Maresca enjoyed immediate success in his first season at City, guiding the team to the Premier League 2 title before leaving to join Parma at the end of the season. His time in Serie B was far from successful, though, and the Italian was sacked after just 14 games and he ended up returning to City in the summer of 2022 as one of Guardiola’s assistants. ‘Unfortunately, it didn’t go as I hoped,’ Maresca said of his short stint at Parma. ‘We signed 14 new players, it was a young team with an international environment, I was training in four languages, and it wasn’t so quick to get certain concepts across. ‘The start was difficult and from the outside there was a tendency to always see the glass as half empty. It ended after 13 games and I was very sorry, I still think we were on the right track.’ Last summer, Maresca was appointed as Dean Smith’s replacement at Leicester and guided the Foxes straight back to the top flight after a superb season in the Championship. Despite a disappointing tenure at Parma, Maresca’s impressive spell at Leicester and attractive style of play has caught the eye of many over the last year. The former City assistant helped Leicester pick up 97 points en route to the title, with his side boasting the best defensive record in the league. In addition, Maresca oversaw a total overhaul of the team’s style of play, turning Leicester into a possession-focused team, a philosophy and play style that is said to have appealed to the Chelsea hierarchy. ‘He’s by far the best manager I’ve worked for,’ Leicester City midfielder Harry Winks told Sky Sports in March. ‘He’s incredible. I think everybody will say he’s going right to the top in [terms of] managerial stature. He’s got everything. ‘He’s a great man-manager. He’s tactically incredible, some of the decisions that he tells us to do before the game and how he views the match is something I’ve never experienced before in football. ‘So, yeah, it’s opened my eyes a lot to football in the way it’s played and the kind of Pep Guardiola style as well, I know he worked with for a long time. ‘I’m loving my football, it works perfectly for me. It’s exactly the kind of football that I want to play and buy into. ‘I think since he has come in, I’ve learned so much and continue to do that.’ Maresca values control of the ball and positional play above all else. In the Championship, Leicester were known for their patient and possession-heavy build-up but this did not come at the expense of goalmouth action, with Leicester scoring 89 goals throughout the season – a tally only bettered by Ipswich. Maresca likes to involve his goalkeeper as a key cog in their intricate build-up from the back and also uses inverted full-backs to help with ball retention in central midfield. A deep-lying playmaker – as opposed to a more physical defensive midfielder – is preferred at the base of midfield to help recycle possession, with the other midfielders expected to push forward and make runs in behind the opposition’s defence. With full-backs operating infield, Maresca likes his forwards to stay high and wide in attack, although the central striker often drops deep to aid build-up. When they lose the ball, Maresca wants his side to press quickly and high to try and regain the ball, before dropping back into a 4-4-2, with a central midfielder pushing up alongside the striker to try and win the ball back. ‘When you go out on the pitch you know exactly what to do and how the opposition are going to operate and what you can do to affect that,’ Winks said in an interview with talkSPORT this season. ‘To do it so simply is the most important thing. That’s a thing a lot of managers probably struggle with, getting the message across, but the gaffer does it so well here.’ Maresca favoured a 4-3-3 formation at Leicester, although he has used a 4-2-3-1 as well at points. Robert Sanchez’s ball-playing capabilities could see him return as first-choice goalkeeper, while Levi Colwill and Wesley Fofana’s pace and passing attributes make them a potentially exciting centre-back partnership. Pochettino used Marc Cucurella as an inverted full-back towards the end of last season and the Spaniard could continue there under Maresca. Reece James often played in central midfield for Wigan during his loan spell in 2018/19 and could be deployed in a similar role on the right side. Man Utd star told Erik ten Hag he did not want to play in FA Cup final Former Chelsea player set to return as part of Enzo Maresca's coaching staff Gary Lineker questions if Man Utd star faked injury to get out of FA Cup final Arsenal miss out on Pot 1 for Champions League draw next season Moises Caicedo may be tasked with the playmaking role at the base of midfield, with Enzo Fernandez allowed a greater license to get forward. Cole Palmer may start further back in central midfield under Maresca, but the Italian’s play style should still allow Chelsea’s standout performer this season to flourish in advanced positions. In attack, Christopher Nkunku’s all-round capabilities could afford him a second chance after a wretched injury-affected first campaign at Stamford Bridge, while Noni Madueke and Mykhailo Mudryk’s pace and dribbling abilities make them obvious candidates to start out wide.

        "description": "The first woman to ride the winner of the Melbourne Cup has revealed why she is walking away from a career that made her a household name.",
        "content": "A series of “random” head knocks during track work has convinced Michelle Payne to retire from race riding almost nine years after she rewrote the history books by becoming the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup. Payne has informed Racing Victoria that she will not be reapplying for a jockey’s licence beyond this season, which ends on July 31, bringing to a close one of this country’s most inspirational sporting careers. Michelle Payne after winning the 2015 Melbourne Cup on Prince Of Penzance. Credit: Justin McManus Payne, who had her first race ride as a 15-year-old in 2001, said she knew it was time to call it quits after suffering three successive black eyes from training accidents at the end of last year. “I had three horses, one took fright and gave me a really decent whack in the head, another one did the same thing and it gave me a blood nose, and then another one of my young horses bucked me off, but with quite a nasty knock to the head again. So I got three black eyes all in a row,” Payne said. “It was late last year, and it knocked me around a bit and probably shocked me into retirement a bit quicker than I was thinking. But it was on the cards anyway.” While Payne, who has had a joint trainer-jockey licence since 2016, is intending to hang up the saddle for good come August, she has not ruled out farewell rides before the end of the season. “I did a concussion test at Sandown on Saturday, because they were doing testing for jockeys for the new season, just to see if I could ride for the last couple of months of my licence, and I passed, so that was all good,” she said. “It is a new era in my life and I guess a bit emotional, but things come to an end and I have been lucky to survive some pretty horrible injuries.” Payne suffered a number of career-threatening falls across her 23 years in the saddle. In 2004, the then 18-year-old was sent head first into the turf after her horse fell 100 metres past the Sandown winning post and she suffered a fractured skull and bruising on the brain. Jamie Kah (left), Glen Boss, Corey Brown and Michelle Payne launch the Melbourne Cup tour on Tuesday. Credit: Victoria Racing Club In 2016, just six months after her record-breaking Melbourne Cup win on Prince Of Penzance, Payne was trampled on and required pancreatic surgery after she fell from her brother Patrick’s horse during a race in Mildura. At the time, Payne defied calls to retire even though she had achieved her life-long dream of winning the Cup, a feat that inspired a movie, Ride Like A Girl , as well as a new generation of female jockeys. The ongoing impact of her seismic win and her powerful post-race speech that women “beat the world” are still being felt today. One of Australia’s leading jockeys, Jamie Kah, said at the VRC’s Melbourne Cup tour launch on Tuesday that Payne’s 2015 victory in the race that stops a nation was a “massive turning point” for women in racing. “Probably from when I started riding (in 2012), it was already changing, but probably a good five or six years before that, the Clare Lindops of the world would never have imagined doing what Michelle did,” Kah said. Michelle Payne, who is calling time on riding, helped launch the VRC’s new honour boards this month. Credit: Vince Caligiuri/Getty Images “It was just a really good turning point. Now trainers see good jockeys and they put the good jockeys on. “It is not a good female jockey, or a good male jockey – it’s, if they are a good jockey and they ride well, they put them on. There’s no sexist people in this industry any more, and I think Michelle really helped that.” During the past four months Payne has begun working more closely with her trainer brother Patrick, allowing her to find more time to balance speaking and charity engagements with the seven-day workload of training a team of 10 horses at her Miners Rest property, near Ballarat. “It probably got to the point earlier this year when I didn’t know how I could keep managing it,” Payne said. “With consistent management of staff, track riders, education of babies and grass gallops – I was very lucky to be able to lean on my brother for some support, he’s been amazing. “What I have been able to do for him [in return] is head to Tasmania for the carnival with his horses, head to Adelaide for the carnival with his team, and fill in at the races where he needs a hand.” She said it was too early to tell whether they would consider forming a training partnership. Following her rise to national prominence in 2015, Payne is still very much in demand. She helped launch the VRC’s Melbourne Cup tour at Flemington on Tuesday by announcing the Victorian destinations of Cowes, Melbourne, Alpine Shire, Mountt Wycheproof, Rochester, Nathalia, Woodside, Trentham and Lancefield. Earlier this month she unveiled new honour boards outside the VRC committee room to recognise past Cup winners and VRC chairpersons, secretaries and CEOs. “Having a bit of relief from the training definitely helps being able to juggle all of those sorts of things,” Payne said.

        "description": "Another season in the Championship looms for Leeds United after Southampton won promotion to the Premier League on Sunday at Wembley. For the sixth time...The post 'Know-how': Neil Warnock claims it would've been different for Leeds if one man played in play-off final appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "For the sixth time in their history, they suffered heartache in the play-offs, so this feeling should, unfortunately, be all too familiar for the Elland Road faithful. ‘s latest heartache will probably hurt the most because they earned 90 points – the most any team has won without winning promotion. One big issue fans have with their players is that, on such a huge occasion and their biggest game of the season, they didn’t turn up, . Neil Warnock was pretty forthright after the match and how he felt the Leeds players might have ‘believed in their own publicity’ heading into the game, as he told (26/05/24 at 5:50 pm). But he was rightfully critical of the way played and the lack of attacking threat they brought to the table. One man who Warnock was keen to mention, who didn’t play because of injury, was one and how he could have made a difference. The 30-year-old missed the start of the campaign through injury and that’s how he also ended it, as he just wasn’t able to be fit enough for the showpiece event at the home of football. But Warnock was certain that if Bamford was on the pitch, then his ‘know-how’ would have helped, with Leeds providing little service to their forward players and Joel Piroe struggling overall. Patrick Bamford misses Leeds United’s play-off final defeat “They probably read too many papers in the last few weeks, since the semi-final because they were so good, but Norwich were so poor, weren’t they?” said Warnock. “I think they might have believed in their own publicity really. It is difficult. You come here. They started on the front foot, but they never really threatened. They never crossed balls. I know I am old-fashioned. But put it in the box. You aren’t going to score if you don’t put balls into the box. “I know Bamford hasn’t got any pace either, in that aspect. But his know-how, I think would have helped.” Who will leave Leeds United after play-off final defeat? You can sense and feel wholesale changes coming up, in some aspects, it won’t be pleasant viewing for the fans. They are probably preparing themselves for the . That’s probably an obvious one, even though it will be hard to see. : But , days after the Southampton loss, that Bayern Munich, who are set to appoint Vincent Kompany as their new manager, are targeting a move for Archie Gray. You wonder who could follow suit? Perhaps Bamford could also be on his way out given that he had a poor campaign and was then injured for periods. You also had Georginio Rutter. One of Leeds’ standout stars. 17 assists in one campaign and you feel that will also attract interest.",

Discover which therapies are expected to grab the major binge eating disorder market share @ Binge eating disorder is a serious mental health condition characterized by recurrent episodes of consuming large quantities of food in a short period while feeling a loss of control over eating behavior. Unlike bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge eating disorder typically do not engage in compensatory behaviors such as purging or excessive exercise to counteract the binge eating episodes. Several factors contribute to the development of binge eating disorder, including genetic predisposition, psychological factors like stress or low self-esteem, and environmental influences such as societal pressure to attain certain body ideals. Traumatic life events, childhood experiences, and dysfunctional family dynamics may also play a role in its onset. Symptoms of binge eating disorder include eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific time frame, eating rapidly until feeling uncomfortably full, eating alone due to embarrassment over food intake, and experiencing feelings of guilt, shame, or distress after binge eating episodes. Individuals with BED often struggle with emotional regulation and may use food as a coping mechanism to deal with stress, anxiety, or depression. Diagnosing binge eating disorder involves a comprehensive assessment by a healthcare professional, including a physical examination, psychological evaluation, and discussion of eating habits and behaviors. Criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) are used to determine if someone meets the diagnostic criteria for BED. The binge eating disorder epidemiology section provides insights into the historical and current binge eating disorder patient pool and forecasted trends for the 7MM. It helps recognize the causes of current and forecasted patient trends by exploring numerous studies and views of key opinion leaders. The binge eating disorder market report proffers epidemiological analysis for the study period 2020–2034 in the 7MM segmented into: Treatment for binge eating disorder is centered around tackling the intricate issues linked with repeated episodes of overeating, often marked by a feeling of being unable to control one's eating habits. Therapeutic strategies, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), are commonly utilized to address the underlying emotional and psychological aspects. Additionally, nutritional guidance and encouragement are offered to encourage healthier eating habits, while medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be prescribed in certain instances. The primary objective is to assist individuals in managing their binge eating tendencies, enhancing their emotional state, and establishing sustainable lifestyle adjustments to facilitate long-lasting recovery. is the only medication approved by the FDA specifically for addressing binge eating disorders. Operating as a precursor to amphetamine, Vyvanse boosts neurotransmitter levels such as dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, affecting impulse control and appetite management. Clinical studies have validated its effectiveness in diminishing binge eating occurrences and ameliorating associated psychological symptoms. Nonetheless, Vyvanse carries potential side effects like sleeplessness, heightened heart rate, and anxiety. Its prescription is typically reserved for situations where psychotherapy alone might not suffice, underscoring the importance of a holistic approach to treating binge eating disorder that integrates both pharmaceutical and therapeutic measures. , categorized as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), isn't directly endorsed by the FDA for treating binge eating disorders, yet it has demonstrated effectiveness in certain instances. Despite not being formally approved for this purpose, fluoxetine is sometimes prescribed off-label to tackle the emotional and psychological aspects linked with binge eating. Through elevating serotonin levels in the brain, fluoxetine potentially aids in mood regulation and diminishing the occurrence of binge eating episodes.

        "description": "The high-profile dispute is another example of risks posed by unregulated AI development, and how little AI companies care.",
        "content": "A couple of weeks ago, shortly before it became apparent that Congress won’t be regulating the rapid development of AI technology anytime soon, the leading avatar for chatbots and other generative AI tools, Sam Altman, showed us all the true face of Big Tech and Silicon Valley, once again. Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, tweeted out a single word—“her”—on May 13, as the company’s engineers demonstrated the capabilities of its latest AI-powered voice assistant model, ChatGPT-4o, on a livestream. The message was a clear reference to the uncanny resemblance between the assistant’s voice and the voice of a real, live, and very identifiable woman, actress Scarlett Johansson, who played an AI assistant that forms a romantic and sexual relationship with a human in the movie . The intentional decision to employ a flirtatious female voice on a that will probably become near-ubiquitous one day was questionable enough. But days later, Johansson implied in a that OpenAI may have simply stolen her voice, or created a fake facsimile, after she rejected an offer to work for the company. OpenAI has that the voice was meant to sound like Johansson, and produced records showing it hired a different actress—although it’s also true that the company telegraphed repeatedly that its new feature was inspired by , and intimated that Johansson agreed to let the company use her voice. The move came days before Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) closed several months of with tech CEOs by announcing a “roadmap” that calls for billions in government spending on further AI research and development, and . A group of academics, tech accountability, and civil rights groups responded with a , explaining that researchers, labor organizations, and other public-interest groups “were marginalized in the conversation,” while “some of the loudest and most-self serving voices from the industry,” including Altman, Elon Musk, and Marc Andreessen, had lawmakers’ ears. “Any legislative process that begins with industry in the driver’s seat is fated not only to fail the public interest, but even to exacerbate AI’s ongoing harms,” the group said in the May 20 report. The dispute between OpenAI and Johansson is a neat distillation of the cluelessness, the soft bigotry, and the apathy with which the titans of industry and Big Tech conduct themselves as they develop what are widely expected to become the most world-altering, and dangerous, technologies in human history. The case also involves overt sexism and bias, which has been a of AI applications in the past. And as much as anything, it’s a clear indication of the industry’s willingness and ability to unfairly exploit and abuse the labor of even the most powerful, well-off workers in our society. Kate Devlin, a lecturer in AI and society at King’s College London and author of , said the company’s offer to Johansson was a very deliberate choice to align its vision and products with the imagined future in —i.e., people substituting interaction with attentive computers for human relationships, and even falling in love with them. The movie, incidentally, was a depiction of dystopia, not a love story. “This is despite years of criticism about the reductive and unhelpful predominance of female voices for subservient virtual assistants,” Devlin added. “Sex sells, and OpenAI knows they can get a lot more engagement with a persona for their model that coos and giggles at your every command.” Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a Brown University professor who participated in the discussions with CEOs and Congress, said the dispute shows the need for immediate regulation, so there are rules in place to protect the public while companies are debuting AI products and experimenting with the emerging technology. “They did this with a fair amount of impunity,” Venkatasubramanian said. “The idea that ‘you do this first and if someone complains we’ll see what happens’ is very much the ethos of a lot of what happens in this area for a while now. This is just an attention-grabbing example.” OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. that she received an offer “to voice the current ChatGPT system” last September, which was around the same time that Altman said publicly that is his about AI, during a demo and Q&A session at a customer relationship management conference. The movie “inspired us,” and “certainly more than a little bit,” Altman said. Reporters the resemblance during the demo between the so-called “Sky” voice and Johansson’s, all the way back in September 2023. Johansson declined OpenAI’s initial offer; and she never responded to a renewed offer from Altman this month, two days before the release of ChatGPT-4o, according to her statement. Yet, despite the lack of consent, the new voice assistant feature dropped last week, alongside Altman’s “her” tweet, and with a voice “so eerily similar” to Johansson’s that her “closest friends” could not tell the difference, the actress said in her statement. Whatever else might be said about its portrayal of the future, is a movie—an expression of human imagination meant to tell a story and to maybe say something about life and living. On the other hand, Altman is a real guy, whose company apparently ignored a real woman’s denial of consent, and capitalized on her likeness and on-screen personas (her labor, in other words) in the real world. Most people probably understand on an intuitive level exactly what OpenAI and Altman were doing. Research suggests that casting actors who are known mainly for voice acting into voiceover roles allows filmmakers to take advantage of the star’s on-screen persona(s). In this case, we have an actress who is well known as a sex symbol, and whose on-screen personas, including in , have been described as “ ,” and “ ” by film critics. In short, by “casting Johansson as Samantha, the film allows us to associate Samantha with how Johansson looks, thereby giving Samantha a ‘phantom’ sexual presence,’” according to by Devlin, at King’s College, and others. Similarly, by trying to “cast” Johansson, and by using a similar voice, OpenAI apparently sought to imbue its product with those same qualities, in order to entice more customers. It’s quite a move for a company whose technology is expected to help form the AI infrastructure on Apple and Microsoft’s ubiquitous devices. It’s also worth noting that OpenAI was criticized by in December for having an all-male and all-white board, and for nominating Larry Summers, who of sexist remarks. The company to its board in March. Venkatasubramanian said he was struck by how AI companies evade responsibility for their design choices. “On one hand, they convey the impression that what they’re doing is like sci-fi, alien and completely different from anything ever done before,” he said. “They do that through the voice that’s been described as ‘flirty,’ and by cryptically referring to the movie. These are deliberate choices. But when confronted they tend to back off and say we didn’t mean that.” are no less worrisome. As a background matter, the “magic” behind AI often includes . OpenAI, a company worth billions, has to Kenyan workers making less than $2 an hour. The development points to how AI threatens a broad range of professions, including white-collar or so-called knowledge workers, and even the most powerful in our society. Johansson chose not to work for Altman and OpenAI; still, the company was able to use its huge public profile and its technology to reap much of the attention and other benefits that it would have gained if Johansson decided to sign a contract with them. Johansson has said that the company only took down the “Sky” voice after she was forced to hire legal counsel, and it’s likely she will pursue the apparent violations of her publicity rights. She may have a good case with some precedent: Going back to the 1980s, artists like and , who are famous for their distinctive, recognizable voices, have successfully sued companies that hired people to impersonate their voices for commercial use. The Midler case went all the way to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that a famous voice is distinctive enough that an imitator cannot be used in a commercial enterprise without consent and approval. The dispute also parallels more recent circumstances, when the popular artist Drake released a song that relied on AI to generate the voice of the late Tupac, who remains one of the best-selling artists within the genre. Lawyers representing the late rapper’s estate sent a letter saying their client “would never have given its approval,” and was dismayed by the “flagrant violation of Tupac’s publicity” rights and “the legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.” The song was scrubbed from social media after the threat of legal action. Ironically, was the victim of a possible publicity rights violation in April, when a content creator uploaded a new song believed to have featured AI-generated vocals from Drake and The Weeknd. At the time, the artists’ label, Universal Music Group, made the stakes clear in a statement condemning AI-generated content that infringes on publicity rights: The issues raise a question as to which side of history these companies want to be on, UMG said: “the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation,” a UMG spokesman in a statement reported by NPR. UMG has artificial-intelligence platforms over using its copyrighted works to “train” models; and other major businesses, like , the , and a host of other publications, have filed lawsuits against companies like OpenAI and Microsoft. OpenAI had to have known about these controversies before deciding to rip off Johansson’s likeness. And yet it wasn’t a deterrent to the multibillion-dollar company. , or the fast-growing category of work known as content creation, is uniquely vulnerable to artificial intelligence. In a sense, content creators, who are effectively contract workers for social media platforms, often lack and conditions of their employment—the algorithmic systems that handle ranking and content moderation. The dispute with Johansson is simply a high-profile example of the power Big Tech and AI companies wield. Of course, the dispute also demonstrates a kind of cluelessness in the industry, much like the that showed a hydraulic machine crushing a trumpet, piano, books, and other instruments of creativity and imagination, and replacing them with the latest iPad. (Apple pulled the ad and apologized after receiving major backlash.) Polls show that most Americans don’t trust companies to use and develop AI responsibly. A recent Pew Research Center showed that 70 percent of Americans say they have “little to no trust in companies to make responsible decisions about how they use AI in their products,” and 80 percent said the information companies collect in the process “will be used in ways that people are not comfortable with.” Still, industry leaders are trying to sell us on a vision of the future and of AI focused on deep relationships with flirty, attention-trapping computers that sound like Scarlett Johansson, which will also read our children and make things like musical instruments and pencils obsolete. It’s almost laughable, until you remember the actual stakes at hand when it comes to AI, and the fact that these companies are still unregulated in the U.S.",

        "content": "My colleagues have been embarrassed by the revelations about the behaviour of Darren Wick, former head honcho of news at Nine. It’s the avalanche of allegations, of sexual harassment, of bullying, of ghosting, the desperate remnants of alpha maleness of it all which embarrasses the women – and a few good men – with whom I work. So, a couple of questions. Who knew what and when? How is it remotely possible that former MD Hugh Marks claims to have known nothing ? Look, I believe he believes that about himself. But then he was busy with other issues, wasn’t he? Former Nine news chief Darren Wick. And here’s the one I know you’re all asking yourself: how could a bunch of smart, educated, powerful women put up with this terrifying behaviour for so long? Let me answer this for you. We are still telling women not to make trouble, not to complain, just in case it ruins our careers. We are still telling women to be compliant and courteous. It hasn’t worked in my case, but then I’ve had to pay for that. The truth is, our careers are set to be ruined whether we comply or whether we don’t. If we try to tell our bosses what’s going on, we are sent on our way. Or, in the interim, we are all told to go to human resources, the place where the hopes, dreams and ambitions of many a woman have gone to die. It is true of at least the media that the power of women at work has soared over the decades since I started my journalism cadetship at The Sydney Morning Herald in 1982, but it is also true that the power of men remains ascendant. It’s true in both industries I’ve worked in – media and universities – despite the heavily feminised workforce. It’s true of nearly every sector I’ve written about, from finance to the arts to the law. Powerful men can choose to behave ethically and well. Unfortunately, they can also behave like bulldozers. For these men, it’s ultimately rewarding because they build a kingdom in which they are both admired and feared. Woe betide anyone unfortunate enough to be in their paths. We are set to be saved. All set to be saved. But it will take time. This is where we are now. I’d like to believe that Nine management on the TV side acted out of a desire to protect the woman brave enough to make the complaint. But really, the government made them do it. The end of these men is coming through legislation. And it’s accelerating because of the alleged behaviour of men like Wick . Men like Peter Fray and Chris Dore . Men like Mark Forbes . Men like the pathetic child of journalism royalty who used his connections to protect his behaviour. Men like the former ABC child genius who was forced to leave before it all came undone. Now Adrian Foo, Nine’s former publicity boss of Stan, is in the queue . It’s true that not all the men named here behaved in the same way. Some were accused of being workplace jerks, rather than workplace predators. And none of them wielded a casting couch in the way Harvey Weinstein did. Let me tell you about the former chief of staff conducting parallel relationships with two infant journalists, each of whom thought they were “the one”. Only one got the job she wanted at the end. The other was “managed out”. As I have suggested on many, many occasions, we should have workplace bonk bans . Sure, shag who you want on your own time but when you are doing it with a person who is professionally beneath you, it brings all manner of trouble. And the chances are that on many of these occasions, women say yes because they fear what will happen to their careers if they say no. Do not criticise women who are silent. They fear they have no choice. What happened at Nine happens in every sector in Australia. In finance (think AMP’s Boe Pahari ), in mining, in the law (think Dyson Heydon ). There are cases after cases with decisions made in favour of the women complainants. But it takes more than guts to bring a complaint. It takes time, money and more resilience than most of us have. But here is what’s about to happen. As Karen O’Connell, longtime researcher and now professor of law at UTS says, we are set to enter a new world: “We will have had a complete paradigm shift in Australia because of the introduction of positive duty.” Shorter version: this is basically regulation of the kinds of behaviours we think of as sexual harassment. Employers will have to take a step back and look at their whole culture. As I’ve said, maybe Nine acted out of decency. But my money is on Nine acting because it had no choice. The law says employers have a positive duty to protect staff. In the past, we have had to rely on individuals to speak up. In the case of Boe Pahari, it’s hard to feel anything but grief when thinking about the career of Julia Szlakowski, the woman who made the complaint about AMP’s rainmaker. It’s hard to feel anything but grief when thinking about the career of young journalist Amy Taeuber, who made a complaint about a colleague and got sacked for her trouble. There’s a long list of women who are less famous but just as hurt, whose careers are in tatters because they dared to say something. The law backs this. As O’Connell says, the future for men looks like this. Men will need to have a set of skills and a set of values that their employers need them to meet. And men will not be permitted to succeed unless they know how to treat people equally. All I would say to the Hugh Markses of this world is, maybe listen to the women. No, you don’t have to believe every complaint which comes to you, but you do need to have open hearts and open minds. And that’s the only way to protect women at work.

        "description": "In his quest for a sixth term, 1st Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe, a Democrat, is facing a challenge in the June 11 primary.",
        "content": "In his quest for a sixth term, 1st Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe, a Democrat, is facing a challenge in the June 11 primary. Columbia attorney Austin Drake Nichols is making a bid for the office. The 1st Judicial Circuit includes Orangeburg, Dorchester and Calhoun counties. Party primaries will be held June 11 with any runoff scheduled for June 25. The general election is Nov. 5. Pascoe was first elected in 2005 as solicitor for the 1st Judicial Circuit. \"Being a prosecutor has been a calling my entire adult life. It is all I've wanted to do even before law school. A prosecutor's duty is to seek justice in every case and protect the rights of both victims and defendants,\" the 57-year-old said. \"I take this role very seriously since a prosecutor is the only person in the judicial system whose job is to do 'justice.' Other than being a father to three amazing sons, being solicitor is both the most important and only job I desire waking up to every morning,\" said Pascoe, who is married. Pascoe said his office would seek justice, something which he has experience in. \"Having done it for 30 years and having prosecuted corrupt politicians at the Statehouse, I am in a unique position which is allowing me to call out selfish and corrupt behavior when their actions impede the fairness of our justice system,\" he said. Pascoe was assigned as a special prosecutor in a public corruption probe of the General Assembly in 2014. He oversaw the investigation and secured the convictions and office removals of five state General Assembly members, including the House speaker, Senate president pro tem, House Judiciary chairman and two former House majority Leaders. \"I have the experience in bringing diversion programs to our circuit by establishing drug courts and a Youth Mentor Program, which has been recognized as best in the state. I am currently in the process of getting a youth program implemented to deal with our current statewide epidemic of guns in the hands of our children,\" Pascoe said. The Youth Mentor Program was the first of its kind in the 1st Circuit to target youth juvenile violence by linking the judicial system with the local faith community, the solicitor said. He continued, \"My office has been working with Orangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenell and the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office for several months now to come up with a program that will be operational very soon.\" Pascoe said the difference between him and his opponent is that he brings more \"experience, results and commitment to the community.\" \"I have 30 years prosecutorial experience and successfully tried over 200 violent crime cases. My opponent has none. I have created drug courts and diversion programs in our circuit. My opponent has no such experience. Finally, I live in the circuit and raised three sons in Calhoun and Orangeburg counties. My opponent was not even registered to vote in the district when he filed to fun,\" he said. Pascoe is a 1989 magna cum laude graduate of The Citadel. He graduated from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1993. He worked as a state prosecutor with both the 5th Circuit Solicitor's Office and Attorney General's Office after graduating law school. As an assistant solicitor, he was profiled on Court TV for the guilty verdict of Jeffery Weston, one of the state's only murder trials where the victim's body has never been discovered. As solicitor, he said he again successfully prosecuted a \"no body\" murder case in Orangeburg County, securing the murder conviction of Kenneth Cutter. Pascoe also cited the life sentences given to two men responsible for the murder of 6-year-old Winston Hunter of Woodford. Nichols is an attorney with the The Rutherford Law Firm LLC, 1315 Blanding, Columbia, SC 29202. The 29-year-old Anderson native said he now resides in Calhoun County and that questions surrounding his residency are unfounded. According to filing information with the South Carolina Election Commission dated April 1, 2024, Nichols lists his address as 1708 Bridge St. in St. Matthews. \"I reside right on Bridge St. in Calhoun (County). If I didn't reside in the county, I wouldn't have been eligible to even apply to run. It's another attack just because I'm young and haven't been out of law school much. So I've moved around,\" Nichols said. He said he is also registered to vote at the same place. \"You can't be registered to vote somewhere else and run somewhere else,\" he said. He said he wants to accomplish two things if elected. \"One, I want to be able to prosecute cases for the whole circuit. That is going to include making sure that from top to bottom -- myself included and everyone in the office -- is trained and skilled. Not saying that they aren't now, but that we continue to be intentional about polishing up our skills and polishing up our trial advocacy and studying, growing and developing that so that we're strong and effective when we're in the courtroom,\" Nichols said. He continued, \"But like I keep saying, particularly for Orangeburg, it's a college town, it's a college community. There's a lot of young people in the 1st Circuit, and I wanted to get young people back involved in service, back involved in wanting to be in law enforcement, go to law school and be a lawyer, work in the victim's advocate office, work in some type of role with city, town, county and state government.\" Nichols said he wants to \"encourage our youth and encourage young people to be civil servants.\" \"We're going to do that through the good work and through the hard work that we do while we're having fair, common sense and strong prosecution, but also making sure that we're touching the community,\" he said. He joined the firm of SC House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford of Richland County in August 2023. \"I do a lot of civil litigation all over the state. I'm licensed in both South Carolina and in D.C. I do some criminal defense, as well,\" Nichols said. He is a graduate of Westside High School in Anderson. \"I just had a little brother and niece graduate from Westside. I went to Coastal Carolina for undergrad, was student body president there and then went to law school at (the University of South) Carolina,\" he said, noting that he got his undergrad degree in political science, with a minor in ancient philosophy. He was married in April. \"It has been an extremely busy spring for me. No children, just a lot of nieces and nephews, and no animals, yet, but hopefully I can convince her to get one when this is said and done,\" Nichols said. As far as his campaign, he said it's not all about winning. \"At the end of the day in this race, we're all Democrats. ... Whether I win, or Mr. Pascoe wins this primary, I am certain that either of us will do a great job. Either he'll continue to do a great job, or I will do a great job. But we've got to continue to support Democrats along this journey, and we've got to continue to uplift people of the 1st Circuit, particularly our young people.\" Contact the writer: dgleaton@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5534.

Like all his books, it follows the eccentric personalities of the absurdly ultra-wealthy with a pixie-ish flair, not unlike the way Wes Anderson treats colour in his movies. The story begins with a wedding between Lady Augusta Leung Gresham (daughter of The Right Honourable the Countess of Greshambury Arabella Leung Gresham and The Right Honorable the Earl of Greshambury Francis Gresham) and Prince Maximillian Zu Lichtenberg of Norway. (You can imagine the fun Kwan had in creating the names of his characters). As the mother of the bride, Arabella is in her element, pulling all the strings to ensure her eldest daughter’s wedding in Hawaii is nothing short of a Met Gala-level affair. Much to her daughter’s despair, she’s also strategically using the wedding to launch the latest of her ultra-insiders resorts — part of her global lifestyle luxury brand, which she hopes to eventually sell off to a private equity group for billions. Less than 24 hours before the wedding, the bride mutates into a hot ball of rage when her mother insists she wear a couture Valentino dress that costs more than a two-storey sandstone in Sydney. The bride just wants to wear something charming by a local Hawaiian designer. But their conflict is conveniently and unexpectedly interrupted by a volcanic eruption on the island, which literally splits open the grounds of the resort. Author Kevin Kwan. Credit: Giancarlo Ciampini Thinking her life could not get any worse, Arabella returns home to the family estate (Greshambury Hall), only to be told by her husband that they are, in fact, facing crippling debt — they can no longer borrow any more money from a private investor set up by their family doctor, Thomas Tong. She’s learning the painful lesson that being descendants of Renaissance noble-people does not inoculate them from fiscal realities. “Tell me what I’m supposed to do without my Agnes Martins? My powder room will never look the same,” Arabella cries in the spirit of Moira Rose . How will she survive in prison without seeing her cosmetic dentist thrice a year? Now Arabella’s goal of marrying off her children “to the debilitated descendants of Victoria and Albert” has become even more urgent. She’s especially concerned about her only son, Rufus, a wayfaring dreamer who spends his time painting and surfing and being described by the press as “sex on a stick” whose “brow ridges alone could command half a billion.” To his mother’s distress, he’s also getting too close to Thomas Tong’s daughter, Eden – an unassuming childhood friend who grew up next to Greshambury Hall. For Arabella, when there’s a will, there’s a way — especially when you’re connected to an empire of status-obsessed individuals who have honorific titles, own luxury super yachts and have personal art consultants on speed dial. Arabella calls upon some familial help. With just one phone call, she is taking a helicopter from Battersea to Paris for a meeting to enact a trifecta of royal marriages. By having her son marry Princess Solene de Courcy of France, she can finally link the Greshams with the noblest houses of Europe and become the matriarch of her own self-made dynasty. Cue a montage of globetrotting action from London to Venice to Paris to Hong Kong to Beverly Hills to Marrakesh to Hawaii. Money can dismantle boundaries and borders. The Greshams use it to affix families together. Like Jane Austen featuring Asian people, Kwan’s novel has the impressionistic quality of a Bridgerton episode. Everyone is blessed with ethereal beauty, and it is beauty alone that will inevitably attract fortune. The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

But which game(s) are you hoping to attend in person this season? Without further delay. #ForTheShoe 2024 Schedule Release on NFLN pic.twitter.com/WapibyiXux If you are struggling to decide which games, whether that be home or away, I have some information you might find valuable. I have found the cheapest and most expensive ticket for each game on the Colts' schedule, which is currently on the market on the world's most popular ticket sales app, Ticketmaster . Ticket prices for every game on the Colts schedule: Week 1: Vs. Houston Texans Cheapest Ticket: $90.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $1,600.00 Week 2: @ Green Bay Packers Cheapest Ticket: $233.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $798.00 Week 3: Vs. Chicago Bears Cheapest Ticket: $215.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $1,500.00 If you aren't just looking for a ticket to a Colts game but also want to find yourself up close and personal with a premium seat in Lucas Oil Stadium, Week 3 against the Bears might be for you. The best seat in most fans' minds is row 1 at the 50-yard line, and the cheapest game on the Colts' schedule to acquire that type of seat is against the Bears. That ticket can be acquired for $1,499.00 against the Bears, which isn't even the most expensive ticket for the game at this time, with a row of five seats just a few sections over coming in at $1,500.00. Week 4: Vs. Pittsburgh Steelers Cheapest Ticket: $99.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $2,606.00 Week 5: @ Jacksonville Jaguars Cheapest Ticket: $56.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $1,069.00 Week 6: @ Tennessee Titans Cheapest Ticket: $54.99 Most Expensive Ticket: $780.39 Week 7: Vs. Miami Dolphins Cheapest Ticket: $85.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $2,085.00 Week 8: @ Houston Texans Cheapest Ticket: $65.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $777.00 Week 9: @ Minnesota Vikings Cheapest Ticket: $73.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $1,535.00 Week 10: Vs. Buffalo Bills Cheapest Ticket: $129.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $2,500.00 Week 11: @ New York Jets Cheapest Ticket: $75.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $2,000.00 Week 12: Vs. Detroit Lions Cheapest Ticket: $138.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $2,606.00 Week 13: @ New England Patriots Cheapest Ticket: $105.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $1,579.00 Week 14: Bye Week Week 15: @ Denver Broncos Cheapest Ticket: $45.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $618.00 Week 16: Vs. Tennessee Titans Cheapest Ticket: $54.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $1,563.00 The current cheapest home ticket on the Colts schedule comes against their AFC South rival, the Titans. And it comes at an important part of the year during Week 16. With this being near the end of the season, this game could have massive playoff implications for the Colts as they attempt to end their season strong for either a home playoff game by winning the AFC South or a top wildcard spot. Week 17: @ New York Giants Cheapest Ticket: $58.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $1,299.00 Week 18: Vs. Jacksonville Jaguars Cheapest Ticket: $54.00 Most Expensive Ticket: $1,563.00 This article first appeared on A to Z Sports and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "A 25-year-old Orangeburg man is accused of stalking a woman and causing her to fear for the safety of her and her family, according to a warrant. Gabriel Kimani Berry, of Wolfe Trail, is charged with stalking. Berry’s ex-girlfriend claims he has been harassing and stalking her for about two months. She fears that the alleged incidents won’t stop until Berry kills her, according to the incident report. She told officers she hadn’t left her residence in a week because she was afraid she’d encounter Berry. A warrant accuses Berry of using a pattern of words and conduct “that served no legitimate purpose and was intended to cause” his accuser “fear of bodily injury and/or death of herself and her family.” It goes on to accuse Berry of: • Calling and texting his ex’s phone, threating to “smack the f - - -“ out of her with one of his guns. • Driving by his ex’s residence and vandalizing her property. • Displaying a weapon and posting his ex’s whereabouts on social media. • Threatening his ex and her mother on Facebook. Berry was taken into custody on May 21. Orangeburg Municipal Judge Chasity Avinger did not set bail on Berry on Wednesday, leaving that matter to be considered by a circuit judge later. If Berry’s convicted, he faces up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Contact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545. Follow on Twitter: @MRBrownTandD.

        "description": "BEIJING, May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- So-Young International Inc. (Nasdaq: SY) (\"So-Young\" or the \"Company\"), the largest and most vibrant social community in China for consumers, professionals and service providers in the medical aesthetics industry, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights Total revenues were RMB318.3 million (US$44.1 million[1]), compared with RMB310.1 million in the corresponding period of 2023, exceeding the high end of guidance. Net loss attributable to So-Young International Inc. was RMB21.2 million (US$2.9 million), compared with net loss attributable to So-Young International Inc. of RMB11.9 million in the same period of 2023. Non-GAAP net income attributable to So-Young International Inc.[2] was RMB4.1 million (US$0.6 million), compared with non-GAAP net loss attributable to So-Young International Inc. of RMB2.8 million in the same period of 2023. First Quarter 2024 Operational Highlights Average mobile MAUs were 2.0 million, compared with 3.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. Number of medical service providers subscribing to information services on So-Young's platform was 1,160, compared with 1,419 in the first quarter of 2023. Total number of purchasing users through reservation services was 132.8 thousand and the aggregate value of medical aesthetic treatment transactions facilitated by So-Young's platform was RMB367.1 million. Mr. Xing Jin, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of So-Young, commented, \"In the first quarter, our business continued to showcase its remarkable resilience and adaptability, with top line exceeding guidance and increasing 2.6% year-over-year to RMB318.3 million. Growth during the quarter was primarily driven by sales of medical products and maintenance services, which increased 23.3% year-over-year. More importantly, we made significant progress in the businesses we are developing to fuel future growth. Building on the success of our model clinic, we are on track to expand our network into core cities nationwide by the end of the year. With a firm focus on ensuring the quality of products and services, we standardized operating procedures to streamline every stage from site selection to clinic opening and operations, allowing us to grow our offline presence at a rapid pace. Directly complimenting this is our supply chain business. With a growing pipeline of products and an expanding distribution network now covering 750 institutions, we are able to spot emerging trends, quickly bring new high-quality products to market, and create a win-win outcome for both upstream suppliers and end consumers. We will continue to enhance the vertical integration of our platform to maximize synergies along the industry value chain. I'm confident these endeavors will create long-term sustainable value for our users and shareholders going forward.\" Mr. Hui Zhao, Chief Financial Officer of So-Young, added, \"Our sales of medical products and maintenance services business made solid progress in the first quarter as it increasingly contributes to revenue growth and gains traction in the market. Within just a few months, our newly established clinics are able to outperform our financial models. We will continue investing in and nurturing these promising businesses during their growth phases. At the same time, we are implementing disciplined cost controls to support a healthy and sustainable expansion of our bottom line.\" [1] This press release contains translations of certain Renminbi (RMB) amounts into U.S. dollars (US$) solely for the convenience of the reader.

First Quarter 2024 Financial Results Revenues Total revenues were RMB318.3 million (US$44.1 million), an increase of 2.6% from RMB310.1 million in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues generated by the sales of medical products and maintenance services from growing order volumes for cosmetic products and medical equipment. Information services and other revenues were RMB208.7 million (US$28.9 million), a decrease of 0.7% from RMB210.3 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of medical service providers subscribing to information services on So-Young's platform. Reservation services revenues were RMB23.1 million (US$3.2 million), a decrease of 22.3% from RMB29.7 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the policy change for commission rates and subsidies. Sales of medical products and maintenance services[3] were RMB86.5 million (US$12.0 million), an increase of 23.3% from RMB70.1 million in the same period of 2023, primarily due to an increase in sales of cosmetic products and medical equipment. Cost of Revenues[4] Cost of revenues was RMB117.3 million (US$16.2 million), an increase of 3.2% from RMB113.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the sales of cosmetic products and medical equipment. Cost of revenues included the reversal of share-based compensation expenses of RMB0.1 million (US$0.0 million), compared with the share-based compensation expenses of RMB0.8 million in the corresponding period of 2023. Cost of services and others were RMB74.2 million (US$10.3 million), a decrease of 8.9% from RMB81.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payroll cost. Cost of medical products sold and maintenance services were RMB43.1 million (US$6.0 million), an increase of 33.7% from RMB32.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the sales of cosmetic products and medical equipment. [3] Since the second quarter of 2023, in light of the better monitoring business development of upstream supply chain, the Company grouped the revenue generated from sales of cosmetic injectables and sales of equipment and maintenance services into one line item, which is renamed as sales of medical products and maintenance services. The sale of cosmetic injectables was previously reported in line item of information services and others. The information services and others for the first quarter of 2023 have also been retrospectively updated. The amount reclassified from information services and others to sales of medical products and maintenance services are RMB7.6 million for the first quarter of 2023. [4] Since the second quarter of 2023, the previous line item cost of revenues was separated into two line items, which are cost of medical products sold and maintenance services and cost of services and others. Cost of medical products sold and maintenance services primarily consists of expenditures relating to medical products and maintenance services, and the remaining cost of revenues is reclassified into cost of services and others. The cost of medical products sold and maintenance services and cost of services and others for the first quarter of 2023 have also been retrospectively reclassified. Operating Expenses Total operating expenses were RMB237.8 million (US$32.9 million), an increase of 3.5% from RMB229.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Sales and marketing expenses were RMB113.3 million (US$15.7 million), an increase of 0.7% from RMB112.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll costs associated with the expansion of marketing employees. Sales and marketing expenses included share-based compensation expenses of RMB0.1 million (US$0.0 million), compared with RMB1.5 million in the corresponding period of 2023. General and administrative expenses were RMB85.0 million (US$11.8 million), an increase of 38.1% from RMB61.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase was due to an increase in payroll costs associated with the expansion of administrative employees to support our business upgrade and new strategic businesses. General and administrative expenses included share-based compensation expenses of RMB24.5 million (US$3.4 million), compared with RMB6.0 million in the corresponding period of 2023. Research and development expenses were RMB39.6 million (US$5.5 million), a decrease of 29.0% from RMB55.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to improvements in staff efficiency. Research and development expenses included share-based compensation expenses of RMB0.8 million (US$0.1 million), compared with RMB0.9 million in the corresponding period of 2023. Income Tax Benefits Income tax benefits were RMB2.6 million (US$0.4 million), compared with income tax benefits of RMB4.3 million in the same period of 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, this press release presents non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to So-Young International Inc. by excluding share-based compensation expenses from income/(loss) from operations and net income/(loss) attributable to So-Young International Inc., respectively.

The use of the above non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and will continue to be incurred in the future. All these are not reflected in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures, but should be considered in the overall evaluation of the Company's results. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of its share-based compensation expenses in the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is set forth at the end of this release.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand the Company's operating and financial performance, compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and assess the Company's core operating results, as they exclude certain expenses that are not expected to result in cash payments. The use of the above non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and will continue to be incurred in the future. All these are not reflected in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures, but should be considered in the overall evaluation of the Company's results. The Company compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of its share-based compensation expenses in the reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is set forth at the end of this release.

        "content": "Dr. Ifana Mahbub, an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at The University of Texas, had already received the Young Faculty Award from DARPA in 2021, giving her US$500,000 over two years for her project. The fellowship offers an additional $250,000 in funding to continue development of the power-beaming technology. You may already be familiar with wireless charging technology; some cell phones already use near-field wireless technology to top up your battery by using low-frequency electromagnetic waves over a very short distance. It seems like black magic, but in practice, it's not all that complicated. The charging unit is a coil that creates an electromagnetic field and the receiving end – like the coil in your phone – captures the electromagnetic waves which creates an electrical current that is then fed into the battery. Mahbub and her team are researching far-field technology to send electromagnetic waves much further. Specifically to eliminate entirely the need for a drone to return to base (RTB) for a battery swap or to be charged, which can waste valuable time and resources, not to mention potentially being detrimental to the mission at hand. Why recall a UAV when you can simply charge its battery while it's still in flight? One of Mahbub's biggest hurdles is preventing electromagnetic beams from scattering and losing power over large distances. Mahbub has come up with a clever idea of using phased-array antennas; a system of transmitters and smaller antennas to direct the electromagnetic beam along a specific path. The tech she's creating uses the telemetry of a UAV in real-time to ensure line-of-sight connection for maximum charging. \"The signal can go in undesired directions,” Mahbub says. “Our goal is to engineer the waveform so that we can minimize the path loss.\" Military drones such as Medium Altitude, Long Endurance (MALE) UAVs are designed to fly as high as 25,000 ft (7,620 m), while High Altitude, Long Endurance (HALE) drones often operate at a 50,000-ft (15,240-m) ceiling. Tactical Drones will generally fly anywhere from 2,000 ft (610 m) to 5,000 ft (1,524 m). There are numerous other applications this technology could be used for. Think of electric cars traveling down the freeway while being charged. Mahbub is also working on wireless charging technology that could be used at a low-frequency, safe, FCC-approved level that could potentially charge medical implants in people. While it might sound scary to be sending these electromagnetic waves strong enough to charge a small aircraft through the air, we've already been doing similar for many years. Radio broadcasting, television broadcasting, cell phone service, radar, Wi-Fi, and even GPS uses electromagnetic waves. It would probably be ill-advised to stand between the transmitter and the drone while charging, though. Source",

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )'s smartphone shipments in China were 52% higher in April than a year ago, extending a rebound seen in the previous month, according to data from a research firm affiliated the Chinese government. Shipments of foreign-branded phones in China increased by 52% in April to 3.495 million units from 2.301 million a year earlier, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) showed on Tuesday. Although the data did not explicitly mention Apple, the company is the dominant foreign phone maker in China's smartphone-dominated market. This suggests that the increase in foreign-branded shipments can be attributed to Apple's performance. The big increase follows a weak performance earlier this year in the world's biggest smartphone market, as the U.S. tech giant faces intensifying competition in the high-end market from local rivals such as Huawei. Apple's shipments in China increased by 12% in March, marking a significant improvement from the first two months of 2024, when the company experienced a 37% slump in sales. Sales may see a further boost in May, as Apple launched an aggressive discounting campaign this month on its official Tmall site in China, offering discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318) on select iPhone models. The price reduction, double the size of a discount it offered in February, comes after Huawei introduced last month its new series of high-end smartphones, the Pura 70, following the launch of the Mate 60 last August. Huawei overtook Apple in the first quarter as the No.2 smartphone vendor in China and is ramping up its marketing campaign by opening more flagship stores and adding more retail distributors. Huawei spinoff Honor holds the top spot. Overall smartphone sales in China increased by 25.5% to 22.7 million units in April, data from the CAICT showed.",

        "content": "An Indian climber rescued from Everest has died in hospital, a Nepali tourism official said Tuesday, taking the number of fatalities this season on the world’s highest mountain to eight. Banshi Lal, 46, was plucked from the mountain last week and taken to a hospital in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu. “He died at the hospital yesterday,” Rakesh Gurung of the tourism department told AFP. Three people — a British climber and two Nepali guides — among the eight are listed as missing but presumed dead. The latest fatality comes as the Everest mountaineering season nears its end, with the death toll relatively low compared to other years. Last year was the deadliest season on the mountain with 18 fatalities. Three others died climbing other Nepali peaks including a Romanian aiming for Lhotse, neighbouring Everest, and a French and a Nepali climber on Makalu, the fifth-highest peak. Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 10 highest peaks and welcomes hundreds of adventurers each spring, when temperatures are warm and winds typically calm. All the Everest deaths occurred in areas above 8,000 metres (26,200 feet), known as the “death zone”, where thin air and low oxygen levels heighten the risk of altitude sickness. Nepal has issued more than 900 permits for its mountains this year, including 419 for Everest, earning more than $5 million in royalties. More than 600 climbers and their guides have already reached the summit of Everest after a rope-fixing team reached the peak last month. China also reopened the Tibetan route to foreigners this year for the first time since closing it in 2020 because of the pandemic. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "description": "Waitrose has unveiled its brand new cat food - Lasagne Chunks in Jelly - and it has left many people confused",
        "content": "People have been asking whether Waitrose's social media accounts got hacked after the store uploaded a picture of its new, limited edition cat food. The supermarket left many baffled after unveiling its Essential Waitrose Lasagne Chunks in Jelly with Mozzarella, Juicy Tomato and Fresh Basil. The image posted to the retailer's Facebook , X, and Instagram accounts shows the product sitting on a shelf. On the front, there is a photo of a ginger cat alongside a plate of the lasagne. In the caption, Waitrose wrote: \"Help your cat rise AND shine with our new lasagne-flavoured snack. Inspired by our favourite fuzzy orange friend #GarfieldMovie.\" So, for anyone hoping the cat food is real, they'll be disappointed to know it is made-up. The entire post is a joke and a nod to the brand new Garfield movie that has come out. The Garfield Movie is available in cinemas now, it was released last week on May 24. The 2024 film sees the iconic ginger cat - who loves lasagne and is voiced by Chris Pratt - unexpectedly reunite with his long-lost father, the street cat Vic. However, the post did seem to fool many people. Some even asked if the store's accounts had got hacked while others 'couldn't believe how well cats are now being fed'. On Reddit , one user called SmileyEeyore asked: \" Did Garfield hack Waitrose’s Instagram?\" They added: \" If Garfield got to have his say in commercialised cat food, we know he would stop the human gatekeeping of lasagne. \"The only conclusion is therefore that he’s evidently managed to infiltrate Waitrose HQ & is out there doing it for the cats.\" On X, Nushy wrote: \"Is this real? please say yes!\" Jayveeboyce put: \"Waitrose cats eating better than half the country at this point — I am not surprised.\" Deb___x agreed: \"These cats don’t know they are born.\" Squirrel_lover4 jokingly pointed out: \"April fools day was last month.\" Seagull4 replied: \"Is this an April fool? It’s May... almost June.\" Meanwhile, Eat_static seemed impressed, writing: \"Ha ha, brilliant.\" Waitrose has been approached for comment.",

Amongst many things that I carry back are the names of two tribal girls — Frooti and Selfie. One tends to think that people in rural areas inhabit a different planet from those in metros but that’s not really the case as far as penetration of junk food products — colas, chips, chocolates (and now even clicks on smartphones) — go. And so, the recently released ICMR-NIN guidelines on healthy eating that ask people to avoid eating ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is a step in the right direction. UPFs and their detrimental effects on both people and the planet are well documented. Global scientific communities are asking for warning labels on UPFs like those on cigarettes. But those are hard to come by, especially in developing economies where industries habitually push back any kind of regulation. And probably that’s why the ICMR, in its latest guidelines, asks you to read food labels and make informed choices. What does this really mean for a child though who lives in an obesogenic environment? The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2021) shows that from 2000 to 2021 there has been an almost 50% increase in DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), basically years spent in poor health. Most of this has been caused by non-communicable diseases such as obesity , high blood sugar and blood pressure in the 15-49 age group. One may be tempted to call these lifestyle disorders, the diseases that one gets because of one’s own negligence, lack of discipline and willpower. Or we can acknowledge that there is data to show that when policies that prioritise health are in place, these risks can be mitigated. One example of this is Chile which, in 2016, introduced front-of-label octagonal black warning labels on all UPFs. It does not allow advertisements of junk food on TV programs that are directed at kids. It was a response to the fact that half of their children were either overweight or obese, and the gambit paid off. Studies found that consumption of sugary beverages had dropped. Also, companies cut sugar and salt to meet the new regulations. Essentially, Chile has presented proof of concept for junk food regulation and warning labels. Many other countries have followed suit. In 2020, the Oaxaca state of Mexico banned sales, distribution and supply of sugary beverages (colas, caffeinated energy drinks etc) and high-calorie foods to all kids under 18, similar to restrictions on alcohol. In 2017, Norway (also known as one of the healthiest, happiest countries in the world) increased the tax on sugar and chocolate products by 80%. Canada too is putting restrictions in place to create a healthier environment for children.ICMR states that 56% of disease burden in India is due to unhealthy diets (read high consumption of UPFs). We are probably the only country where pizza and burger chains have a dedicated birthday area. What can you do as a parent then to ensure that your kids have not just a long life but also a healthy one? 1. Teach children that consumption of packaged food is unhealthy 2. Tell them how to recognise UPFs. They usually have more than five ingredients and include additives, emulsifiers, stabilisers, hydrogenated oils etc. And even if they are enriched with vitamins or minerals, it does not make them healthy 3. Watch out for sneaky sugars such as high fructose corn syrup 4. Reinforce that chips, chocolates and colas are chips, chocolates, and colas even when sold and advertised as low fat, sugar or low calorie Most importantly, remember that guidelines that warn you about UPFs without any policy shifts — like regulation and taxes — are toothless, to say the least. As a nation we have taken massive strides in the areas of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases. We still have a long way to go even there, but the intention and the machinery is in place. It’s time that our politicians and policy makers stop reducing obesity to a lifestyle choice and instead address the elephant in the room.

        "content": "Leadership of the renowned pan African students’ movement, The Progressive Students Movement (PSM), Nigeria Chapter has hailed President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the successes recorded by his administration in its first 1 year in office. The president of the group, Comrade Ambassador Bestman Okereafor, gave the commendation in a statement he shared with journalists yesterday. He said it is important to commend the efforts of the president on national defence and internal security. According to the statement, “Information show that our gallant military troops have succeeded in neutralising 9,303 terrorists/criminals, including degenerated kingpins such as Damina, Dangote, Kachalla Azarailu and Boderi among others “This is apart from the arrest of 6,998 and the rescue of 4,641 hostages, among other achievements. “Another key achievement of Mr. President in the last year was the signing of the Access to Higher Education Act, 2023, into law on June 12, 2023. “This law enables indigent students to access interest-free loans for their educational pursuits in any Nigerian tertiary institution, a move considered as a fulfillment of one of his campaign promises to liberalize the funding of education”. “However, we call on school managements to be accountable and transparent by ensuring that students’ data are promptly uploaded to the NELFUND site to enable students to access the loan. “We call on NELFUND to ensure the principle of federal character is upheld; all regions must have a fair share regardless of state, religion, and tribe. “We also call on the government to consider paying both the academic and non-academic staff unions their outstanding emoluments to avoid elongation of the academic year, which may further complicate the student loan plans. “We have seen a situation where ASUU went on strike for eight months under the last administration. “We also caution school management to halt any plans of hiking school fees because of the student loan, as it will be vehemently resisted.”",

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Authorities fear a second landslide and a disease outbreak are looming at the scene of Papua New Guinea's mass-casualty disaster because of water streams and bodies trapped beneath the tons of debris that swept over a village, a United Nations official said Tuesday. A mass of boulders, earth and splintered trees devastated Yambali in the South Pacific nation's remote highlands when a limestone mountainside sheared away Friday. The blanket of debris has become more unstable with recent rain and streams trapped between the ground and rubble, said Serhan Aktoprak, chief of the International Organization for Migration's mission in Papua New Guinea. The U.N. agency has officials at the scene in Enga province helping shelter 1,600 displaced people. The agency estimates 670 villagers died, while Papua New Guinea's government has told the United Nations it thinks more than 2,000 people were buried. Five bodies had been retrieved from the rubble by Monday. \"We are hearing suggestions that another landslide can happen and maybe 8,000 people need to be evacuated,\" Aktoprak told The Associated Press. \"This is a major concern. The movement of the land, the debris, is causing a serious risk, and overall the total number of people that may be affected might be 6,000 or more,\" he said. That includes villagers whose source of clean drinking water has been buried and subsistence farmers who lost their vegetable gardens. \"If this debris mass is not stopped, if it continues moving, it can gain speed and further wipe out other communities and villages further down\" the mountain, Aktoprak said. Scenes of villagers digging with their bare hands through muddy debris in search of their relatives' remains were also concerning. \"My biggest fear at the moment is corpses are decaying, ... water is flowing and this is going to poise serious health risks in relation to contagious diseases,\" Aktoprak said. Aktoprak's agency was raising those concerns at a disaster management virtual meeting of national and international responders Tuesday. The warning comes as geotechnical experts and heavy earth-moving equipment are expected to reach the site soon. The Papua New Guinea government on Sunday officially asked the United Nations for additional help and to coordinate contributions from individual nations. An Australian disaster response team was scheduled to arrive Tuesday in Papua New Guinea, which is Australia's nearest neighbor. It will include a geohazard assessment team and drones to help map the site. \"Their role will be particularly helping perform geotechnical surveillance to establish the level of the landslip, the instability of the land there, obviously doing some work around identifying where bodies are,\" said Murray Watt, Australia's minister for emergency management. Australia's minister for the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said the government would also provide long-term logistical support for clearing debris, recovering bodies and supporting displaced people. The government announced an initial aid package of 2.5 million Australian dollars ($1.7 million). \"This is an incredibly inaccessible part of Papua New Guinea and it's a really challenging process for everyone involved,\" Conroy said. Earth-moving equipment used by Papua New Guinea's military was expected to arrive soon, after traveling from the city of Lae, 400 kilometers (250 miles) to the east, said Justine McMahon, country director of for humanitarian agency CARE International. The landslide buried a 200-meter (650-foot) stretch of the province's main highway. But the highway had been cleared from Yambali to the provincial capital Wabag through to Lae, officials said Tuesday from Enga. \"One of the complicating factors was the destruction of parts of the road plus the instability of the ground, but they have some confidence that they can take in heavy equipment today,\" McMahon said Tuesday. An excavator donated by a local builder Sunday became the first piece of heavy earth-moving machinery brought in to help villagers who have been digging with shovels and farming tools to find bodies. Heartbroken and frustrated Yambali resident Evit Kambu thanked those who were trying to find her missing relatives in the rubble. \"I have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I'm standing on,\" she told Australian Broadcasting Corp. through an interpreter. \"But I can't retrieve the bodies, so I'm standing here helplessly,\" she added. Papua New Guinea is a diverse, developing nation with 800 languages and 10 million people who are mostly subsistence farmers.",

        "content": "The Benue State House of Assembly has repealed the law for the maintenance of former elected governors of the state and their deputies. The bill was passed and assented to by former Governor Samuel Ortom in the twilight of his administration in May 2023. The bill to repeal the law was presented on Monday by Douglas Akya, the Chairman of the House standing Committee on Appointments, Public Service and Pension Matters, who represents Makurdi South Constituency in the state assembly. Akya said the law was not enacted in the interest of the state which has lean resources to finance other pressing obligations. Some other lawmaker like Samuel Agada who represents Ogbadibo Constituency and Alfred Emberga of Makurdi North Constituency, noted that the meagre resources of the state makes it unwise to spend exorbitantly on former governors and their deputies, when the state has a huge infrastructure gaps and debt burden. There had been public outcry since the bill was passed by the Ortom administration, particularly from then opposition party which later won the governorship election. Many had called on Governor Hyacinth Alia to repeal the law when he assumed office but things did not take the speed of light as it took the lawmakers one year to repeal the pension law. Also at plenary on Monday, the legislators passed the bill to prohibit harassment and extortion of money from investors, developers and businessmen popularly known as ‘marching ground’. Chairman of House standing committee on Lands, Survey and Solid Minerals, Elias Audu who led debate, said when passed, the law would address the excesses of miscreants who go about extorting land from developers and residents.",

        "content": "Chef Guntas Sethi is a celebrated name in the food industry who is known for her love for all things delicious. Recognized as the ambassador for the European Union's 'More Than Food' campaign, her journey epitomizes a blend of culinary excellence and sustainability, inspiring aspiring chefs to embrace innovation and mindful cooking practices. In an exclusive chat with Etimes, she said, \"My journey as a chef began when I decided to pursue my Master’s in London at Le Cordon Bleu to study patisserie. After that, there was no looking back!\" Scroll down to read the detailed interview. Indian households have been embracing this trend since the beginning. Back in the day, when not every household have a refrigerator, which meant that there was not much that could be saved, so Indians would always think of ways to repurpose everything and not let anything go to waste. Indians have always stretched their leftovers, like dal is used to make parathas. An example of trash treasuring is seen in Gujrati culture, where it is quite common to use pumpkin skin to make chutney. In the same manner, leftover veggies have been used as fillings to make stuffed parathas or to make equity/ grilled sandwiches, which are quite famous in the north. So, I feel Indians have always looked at cooking consciously. Over the years, as technology has evolved, we have access to so much, especially with how quickly everything is delivered through e-commerce platforms. We have forgotten how to repurpose things and extract more utility out of ingredients, because it's more convenient to get something new. However, as climate awareness is gathering steam, there has been a drastic attitudinal shift in people across the world, especially younger consumers who have started to make more informed choices. There’s a greater focus on health and well-being, and people in India are now more conscious and driven to make better food choices. They want to know what they are eating and the story behind its production and how safe it is to consume. In fact, there has been a significant surge in interest and consumption of European food and beverages in India due to their stringent production standards. We need to now ensure that these ingredients are also being utilised to their fullest potential in our kitchens. What’s beautiful about European ingredients is the variety of products available. Because of how vast the geographical region is, there are a lot of different climates, soils, and topography factors, so there is a broad range of products available all of which with various characteristics and taste. What is important, I feel, with ingredients from the European Union, is to understand how to use them in a way that lets the produce shine. For example, in India, we tend to work with a lot of masalas, and we love our flavours, but with European produce, while they can be used along with Indian ingredients, it is important that we let them shine and not overshadow them because they have subtle yet extremely rich flavours. One could use cherry tomatoes from Spain in Indian gravies or add mozzarella from Italy to make cheese dosas – the combinations are endless. So, it is important to treat the produce well instead of overcrowding it with a lot of other ingredients. I wholeheartedly believe that Indians are now becoming global citizens. As we travel more, we always bring back a little bit of the culture and food with us. This not only makes us want to experiment more, but also opens us to welcoming different trends and different cuisines. In recent years, there has been a sudden surge in popularity of European food amongst Indians that goes beyond just popular cheeses and wines. Indians now understand the vastness and actively opt for different cuisines such as Mediterranean, Italian, Danish and more. There is a growing awareness around not just the cuisine but also the ingredients. For example, Burrata is an Italian cheese that not a lot of Indians understood, but today, a lot of gourmet restaurants and even fast-food chains, have a burrata pizza because of how much Indians are loving it. Talking about opportunities, I see a lot of fusion food coming in. There is a particular restaurant in Bombay called Gallops, which serves a saag dish with burrata on top. Now, Palak Paneer is something that we have always eaten, but replacing an Indian version of cottage cheese (paneer) with a European cheese like Halloumi, PDO from Cyprus is a whole new variant. Similarly, Azeite de Trás-os-Montes, a PDO extra virgin olive oil from Portugal can be used to marinate paneer with other spices and served alongside crostini as an appetizer. So, there are endless possibilities on how it can all be worked around. And every day there is something new to see. For me, food is something that has always, always, always been at the centre stage of every celebration. I grew up in a Punjabi family, where the conversations revolved mainly around food. When we used to sit for lunch, we used to decide on what we should have for dinner and at dinner, what to have for breakfast the next day. So, food has always been in my DNA. However, my first choice was to get a degree in Chartered Accountancy. My journey as a chef began when I decided to pursue my Master’s in London at Le Cordon Bleu to study patisserie. After that, there was no looking back! Soon after, I started making marble cakes and brownies at home. I’d get compliments and the orders followed. It picked up so much that within nine months, I had to get a proper studio. That was the beginning of my cloud kitchen patisserie called Chef Guntas, based in Khar. As followers on Instagram took off, more avenues for growth opened up. That’s when I became the ambassador for European Union’s food and beverage campaign ‘More Than Food’ in India. When we talk about sustainability, it is important that food is, first of all, produced sustainably. The EU has put in place several measures to ensure all food and beverages are authentic and of high quality and are produced in a safe and sustainable manner. Take for instance, the Farm to Fork strategy. Part of the European Green Deal, it is a comprehensive plan aimed at promoting sustainable food systems within the EU. It focuses on various aspects of the food supply chain, from production to consumption, with the goal of ensuring food security, reducing environmental impact, and improving public health. Organic farming practices, including more efficient energy and water use and pesticide limitations, are a few of the ways European farmers and producers help mitigate climate change and preserve nature. On a personal level, it is important to understand the nutritional profile and characteristics of a produce. For example, while broccoli florets have a lot of protein in it, so does the stem. But sustainability goes beyond that: in India, 78.2 million tonnes of food goes to waste each year. To combat food wastage, there are so many ways to repurpose food. I feel food allows for a lot of innovation, with opportunities to use a lot of different fruits and vegetables in the preparation. Be it using all part of an orange from Malta – from segments to peels – in a chocolate mousse or using asparagus from Netherlands in a salad and later in an Aloo Asparagus subzi, a lot of European vegetables can be used sustainably in Indian kitchens by making sure every single part of them comes into use. So, it is not just about what can be restricted from throwing away, but also different ways to see how your available ingredients can be swapped with something that you would ideally buy, rather than just discarding it. I have long been a passionate advocate for integrating sustainability into our kitchens. Sustainably produced foods are crucial for reducing environmental impact and promoting ethical practices, and they are the cornerstone of value in ingredients from the European Union. EU ingredients truly are More Than Food and bring such authenticity and quality to our plates. While we speak about sustainable cooking and farming practices, it's equally important to be mindful in the kitchen to minimize wastage. My advice to aspiring chefs would be to choose their ingredients wisely, and to not be afraid to experiment in the kitchen. Thumb and Embed Images Courtesy: istock and Instagram/chefguntas",

        "content": "Palestinian Premier and Foreign Minister Mohammad Mustafa revealed that five European countries will soon recognize the Palestinian state. In exclusive statements to Asharq Al-Awsat, he said: “Other important and internationally prominent non-European countries will follow... They will also soon recognize the Palestinian state, and some of them may take several months...” In a telephone interview with Asharq Al-Awsat from Riyadh, the prime minister underlined the importance of Saudi Arabia’s role, stressing that coordination with “the brothers in Saudi Arabia is at the highest level.” “Saudi Arabia has linked any regional peace to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,” Mustafa stated, adding that the Kingdom plays a diplomatic role in pushing for the release of Palestinian funds that are withheld by Israel, and in supporting the government’s plans for the post-war stage. Commenting on the Brussels meeting, during which the Palestinian Prime Minister presented the reform plan with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Quartet office on Palestine, Mustafa noted that all partners have “praised the government’s reform program [...] and the wise policy of President Mahmoud Abbas.” Meanwhile, a European official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the European Union appreciates Saudi Arabia’s efforts with regard to reviving the peace process. Luis Miguel Bueno, the official spokesman for the European Union for the Middle East and North Africa, referred to the meeting in Brussels, on Monday, with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the Emirates. Bueno highly valued the Kingdom’s efforts towards ending the war and establishing a “Palestinian state that lives side by side with the State of Israel.” The European official also pointed to intensified diplomatic movements in Brussels, which he said “express a shared vision by the European Union and our Arab partners to move forward towards a two-state solution.” British foreign minister David Cameron said on Tuesday an investigation by the Israeli army into the Rafah air strikes must be \"swift, comprehensive and transparent\", again calling for a pause in fighting. “Deeply distressing scenes following the air strikes in Rafah this weekend,” Cameron said on X, saying the “investigation must be swift, comprehensive and transparent.” “We urgently need a deal to get hostages out and aid in, with a pause in fighting to allow work towards a long-term sustainable ceasefire.” Israeli tanks reached the center of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza city that has sparked global condemnation. The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area without commenting on reported advancements into the city center. Overnight, its forces pounded the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing its offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly. Since that strike, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighborhoods and took positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area. Witnesses in Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armored vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate response. Since Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah and entered some of its eastern districts but had not yet entered the city in full force. Reacting to Sunday night's attack in a camp where families displaced from assaults elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Residents said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. Around one million people have fled the Gazan city of Rafah in the past three weeks, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Tuesday. The small city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip had been sheltering more than a million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults on other parts of the enclave. Since early May, Israel's military has been carrying out what it says is a limited operation in Rafah to kill fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by Hamas, which runs Gaza. It has told civilians to go to an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" some 20 km (12 miles) away. Many Palestinians have complained they are vulnerable to Israeli attacks wherever they go and have been moving up and down the Gaza Strip in the past few months. UNRWA said the flight from Rafah \"happened with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions.\" Providing assistance and protection is becoming nearly \"impossible\", the agency said. Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a ceasefire in Gaza. He called for a permanent ceasefire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the movement seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two-state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied. The Israeli army said it kicked off a series of new security measures in the northern Israeli towns after carrying out a drill simulating a ground offensive in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group had intensified its attacks on Israel in response to the latter’s Monday strike that targeted a hospital entrance in south Lebanon killing one person. In recent weeks, the Israeli army carried out a drill simulating a ground offensive on Lebanon. The Israeli army spokesperson said the “exercise simulated combat scenarios in the northern arena, the rapid deployment of forces on the ground, the functioning of the division and brigade headquarters and the readiness of the forces for an attack”. Israel’s announcement comes amid new strict measures imposed in Israeli settlements and northern towns. News agencies have displayed images showing cement barriers placed as roadblocks in northern Israel. An Israeli newspaper also reported that the army decided to trim down its alert units in the northern towns, a decision that drew criticisms from Israeli officers. An order was also issued to close an Israeli settlement, and entry banned even for Israeli soldiers. The new measures triggered concern among the town residents, amid mass destruction of buildings estimated by Israel’s i24 News at 930 buildings destroyed by Hezbollah strikes. On Sunday, Hezbollah heavily shelled the town of Kiryat Shmona. The town’s municipal chief was quoted as saying that over 40 percent of the town’s fleeing residents have no plans of returning back. “We expect the number to rise”, he said. Hezbollah, in a wide-scale offensive, carried out 15 military operations on Sunday against Israeli targets in response to the latters’ successive attacks targeting people on motorcycles in Lebanese border towns. An Israeli strike on Monday outside a hospital in south Lebanon killed one person at the hospital entrance. He was heading for medical tests. Fifteen other people sustained varying injuries, including seven civilians and eight health care workers at Salah Ghandour Hospital in the city of Bint Jbeil. The hospital security guard, Hassan Jouni, underwent surgery due to severe injuries. For the first time since the hostilities began in the southern Lebanon border area, the Israeli army targeted the vicinity of a hospital on Monday morning. The Israeli military has increased its efforts in recent days to apprehend individuals using cars or motorcycles on the roads, resulting in the fatalities of Hezbollah members and civilians. The Lebanese Ministry of Health condemned the brutal Israeli shelling that targeted the hospital. Hezbollah retaliated against the Israeli assault on the hospital by “targeting and destroying the newly installed spy equipment at the Miskaf Am site.” The Israeli military said that it bombed a building where Hezbollah members were located in the Yaron border area on Sunday. Additionally, the air force targeted Hezbollah members in Hula, hitting a weapons storage facility in Mays Al-Jabal and military infrastructure in Khiam. The Israeli raid on the town of Yaron led to casualties. Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were attacked in Baghdad over the past 48 hours, causing damage but no injuries, and Iraqi security forces arrested some suspects, the interior ministry and police sources said on Monday. Initial investigations showed that the restaurants were targeted over the perceived support of US-based brands for Israel amid the war in the Gaza Strip, police sources said. The first attack took place early on Sunday when two men on a motorcycle threw a make-shift bomb at a branch of the American fried chicken chain restaurant in eastern Baghdad's Palestine Street, causing minor damage, police sources said. On Monday, another KFC Baghdad branch and a second American-style restaurant were attacked by group of masked men who broke into the restaurants and used sticks to smash glass and destroy furniture. They fled before the arrival of security forces, police sources said. KFC did not immediately comment on the attacks. The interior ministry did not elaborate on the motives behind the attacks and said a police commander and other officers responsible for the areas where the attacks occurred had been detained and faced punitive measures. Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protest by a largely spontaneous, grassroots campaign over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since the deadly Hamas attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The actions reflect a groundswell of anger over Israel's military operation that has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, and caused a humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration told Israel to take every precaution to protect civilians after a military strike in Rafah killed dozens of Palestinians, as it faced calls from some fellow Democrats to halt military shipments to Israel. \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. Biden has faced increasing pressure from within his own party to scale back support for Israel, even before the airstrike on Sunday night that set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze in a Rafah camp, killing 45 people. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democratic lawmaker in the House of Representatives, on Monday called the strike \"an indefensible atrocity\", adding in a social media post that \"it is long past time for the President to live up to his word and suspend military aid.\" \"Horrific and gut wrenching images coming out of Rafah last night,\" Representative Ayanna Pressley said in a social media post. \"How much longer will the US stand by while the Israeli military slaughters and mutilates Palestinian babies?\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \"genocidal maniac\". Netanyahu on Monday said the strike was not intended to cause civilian casualties but went \"tragically wrong.\" The NSC spokesperson said the US government was \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military and others on the ground to assess what happened. Almost half of Democratic voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a recent poll from Reuters/Ipsos. Weeks of campus protests about the war have added to the pressure, and wider demands for a permanent ceasefire have put Biden's reelection campaign on the defensive. An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were “civilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.” Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks “conducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel “will not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.” “The only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,” he said. Western countries, in particular the US and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a ceasefire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. The members of the Ministerial Committee assigned by the Joint Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit met in Brussels on Monday with European Union Foreign Affairs Council to discuss the war on Gaza. Chaired by Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, the committee included Qatari Prime Minister and FM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Jordan's Deputy PM and FM Dr. Ayman Al-Safadi, and Egyptian FM Sameh Shoukry. They discussed the dangerous developments in Gaza and the Israel’s ongoing military operation that is claiming the lives of innocent civilians, including the recent “appalling targeting of the tents of displaced Palestinians near the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)” in Rafah. The Ministerial Committee “stressed the need for the international community to fulfill its responsibility to intervene immediately to stop the massacres committed by the Israeli forces and to stop the deepening of the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are experiencing.” It reiterated the importance of creating serious political conditions for the establishment of a Palestinian state according to the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital, and in line with the relevant international resolutions. It expressed its rejection of “discussing the future of the Gaza Strip in isolation from the Palestinian issue.” It called for “confronting all flagrant violations committed by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people” and stressed the importance of holding the Israel accountable for the ongoing violations in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The European Union pledged more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Monday to support displaced Syrians, but it dismissed any notion of them being able to return home because of instability under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Before an EU-led donor conference on the 13-year-old war, Jordan's foreign minister said that the international community was abandoning Syrian refugees as funding to support them in host countries dwindles, suggesting that ways had to be found to ease voluntary returns to Syria. The EU conference aims to keep the war on the agenda, as well as support for the millions of refugees it has created. But as the economic and social burden on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions, diplomats say. Refugees returning home is not yet one of them however, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made clear at the start of the conference. \"While the European Union would wish that returning home could be a realistic option for all refugees, everywhere and always, we concur with the United Nations system that currently the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns to Syria are not in place,\" Borrell said. \"We insist that it is the Assad regime that bears the primary responsibility for putting in place these conditions.\" Borrell said the bloc was pledging 560 million euros in 2024 and 2025 to support refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and a further 1 billion euros for Türkiye. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir, amid the Israeli war in Gaza and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. Although Assad has long since reasserted control over most of Syria in a war that began with a 2011 uprising against him, more than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon, Türkiye and Jordan and millions more displaced internally still have little prospect of returning home. \"We're going to be sending a very clear message from Jordan as a host country that we feel that refugees are being abandoned,\" Ayman Safadi told reporters on arrival in Brussels. \"Host countries are being abandoned.\" Jordan is hosting around 1.3 million Syrians. Safadi said the issue \"can only be solved by them going back to their country. So, we need to focus more on creating conditions conducive for them to return voluntarily.\" Funding to support refugees is dropping with the likes of the World Food Program reducing its aid. Countries say hosting refugees is an increasing burden, notably in economic crisis-hit Lebanon, where the discontent has seen forced deportations. \"We expect our partners to uphold international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, and reject and condemn any forced deportations,\" Borrell said. The 8th Syria conference brings together European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges there are few signs that Europe can take the lead, diplomats said. The bloc has no ties with the Assad government and Monday's talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the EU's 27 member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. An upswing in migrant boat arrivals from Lebanon to Europe, with Cyprus and Italy major destinations, has prompted some EU countries to warn of a big new influx into the bloc. \"We'll continue to do everything we can. But unless we're helped, unless the international community shoulders its responsibility, there will be a decrease in services and there will be more suffering for refugees,\" Safadi said.",

        "content": "For about a decade, Nigeria has been facing series of security challenges. These include the Boko Haram insurgency in the North East, the increasing violence between herders and farming communities spreading from the North Central belt southwards, kidnapping for ransom, armed robbery, armed banditry and lots more. In most cases, when these security breaches occur, citizens are caught up in life threatening situations, stranded and without help from anywhere. Even the security agencies that have a constitutional responsibility to respond to such incidents are usually not available. In situations where the police or the military is contacted, excuses and delays in response time is as good as no response at the end of the day. This ugly situation prompted an Abuja based ICT company, Juggernaut, to develop a new phone application, known as ‘Prime Alert’ to aid prompt response by security agencies to emergency situations. Chief Operating Officer, of Prime Alert Nigeria, Ibok Offiong, who unveiled the phone application at a news conference in Abuja, said that it would effectively bridge the gap between emergencies and response. According to her, emergency situation has led to a lot of loses hence the need to salvage the situation by deploying technology to promote and enhance public safety and improve the nation’s security architecture. Offiong said that part of the goal of developing the app was to also set up an emergency communication system for the country. She explained that the app could be downloaded on mobile phones from the app store after which people would be asked to supply five numbers of their family members or friends in case of emergencies. “The victim will push the red button and the emergency response is immediately alerted. “Once we receive any distress alert, Prime Alert immediately places a call to the victim’s family and friend and then places another call to relevant security agencies,” she said Offiong also highlighted some of the emergencies to include accident and injury, physical or sexual assault, political and civil unrest, terrorist attacks. Others are health problems, fire outbreak, kidnapping, ritual killings, potential assault, burglary as well as flood disaster. According to Offiong, Prime Alert will be working with all government agencies that are handling different emergency cases to ehance their preparedness, response, mitigation and recovery. She listed some of the agencies they were collaborating with to include, the Nigerian Police to handle mainly crime related emergencies. Others are fire services to handle fire related emergencies, hospitals to handle medical related emergencies and the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to handle flood and other natural disasters. A security expert, Tony Nwulu said that given the security situation in Nigeria, citizens do not need to wait for the government to do everything. “Citizen response has become very important at this point in time, I want to believe that over the years unless we want to pretend like we are not in this society, we know that the security agencies have their own peculiar challenges ranging from being called and they are not mobile to come to your rescue. “As a matter of fact, our emergency response is nothing to write home about and you cannot blame them too because some of them for instance the Police, NEMA and every other sector that is involved in response has been agitating for more funding. You are not going to wait for the Fire Service that doesn’t have water and allow fire to raze down your house. “Primarily, what Prime alert addresses is that call for citizens response is most important. You find out that many lives that would have been hitherto saved get lost because people didn’t respond on time especially close relations. “Take an instance where someone had an accident and is rushed to the hospital but he couldn’t be treated because he had no cash on him at that moment and nobody knew his where about and he couldn’t make the payment and he was left to bleed till he died. ” I have come to ask myself what keeps me safe assuming anything happens to me at home? Who are those people I want to know that I’m having this emergency? You find out that in most cases, you don’t even have anybody. Once it happens that’s all because you wouldn’t know who to call but if you have a system that will trigger and let your carers know that you are having an emergency, it will help a lot in keeping you alive,” he said. Nwulu said that issues of insecurity should be taken seriously so as to save lives and property of those under any form of security threat. “Prime-alert relatively bridges that gap because it is able to make your carers, that is most immediate people that needs to know that you are in danger because if I know that a brother who might not have access to the police the way I do is in danger, I will come in because where your contacts ends is where another person’s own starts. “What matters most is how you are able to reach out during emergencies because it could happen in the middle of nowhere. The police cannot do everything for us, most times, we also need to engage ourselves because we will respond faster than any security agent when our relations are in distress. “We support with ambulance service and we will able to know where to refer you to in the case of emergency based on information you provided or probably take you to the closest hospital that we find around.

        "description": "An examination of the football vision of John Textor who has said he would like to buy Everton",
        "content": "With 777 Partners’ proposed acquisition of Everton now unlikely to happen it has been reported that John Textor is now pushing to buy the club. But what is the strategy of the current Crystal Palace part-owner? announced on September 15 that had signed an agreement with majority shareholder to acquire his entire 94.1% stake in the club and that closing of the transaction was expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, over eight months on, the Miami-based private investment firm, who have been dogged by payment issues at clubs they do own (Standard Liege in Belgium and Vasco da Gama in Brazil) and hit by legal challenges, have still yet to be given the green light on the purchase by the five members of the board. The technicalities look set to end on May 31, , with the 777 deal now looking dead in the water and there seems little appetite for and company among Everton’s supporters – the Fan Advisory Board questioned the suitability of 777 in a virtual meeting with Moshiri, who was not in the UK, last week. Sky Sports claims that Textor, who holds a 45% stake in Crystal Palace, is now the front-runner to acquire Moshiri’s majority shareholding and it is likely that an agreement with the MSP Sports Capital group, who have already invested in Everton, and Moshiri would fund the club short-term until Textor is in a position to complete his purchase. Textor doesn’t often speak publicly but three months ago the published which gave an insight into some of his thoughts on football ownership. Like 777 Partners, Textor is a multi-club owner and he believes that requires lots of joined-up thinking. He said: “I don't see acquisitions as the business model. What we do, my job - and I'm not a football guy - I watch hundreds of games a year from the grass and on film. “My job is to force loving collaboration on all our people. If my scout in Brazil is not really close with my scout in France, then I have the wrong scouts. “We're a very scout-centric organisation. We use data to help break down games and players who we want to go see. “I want eyes on the grass, on the ball, on the boy. We think a global footprint of talent can compete with unlimited money. “Why does everybody say that the City Football Group is the best multi-club model out there? They're not. Man City is the best football team out there, with an incredible management team, incredible people, but they struggle like everyone else. “They are wonderful people, they're a great organisation. People say they're the best multi-club model out there because they're Manchester City. And I'm Molenbeek, Crystal Palace and Lyon. “We probably have done more collaboration between our clubs. I was able to bring in incredible reinforcements in the January transfer window [to injury-hit Belgian club Molenbeek] from Crystal Palace, from Lyon and from Botafogo and we might just survive.” , Textor proclaimed: “Everton represents the best of English football: the struggles, the glory, the want. I love that it’s out of London. Everybody should want to buy Everton right now.” He had hinted on his plans for the future with what he told the BBC. He said: “No, I don't want to run [Palace] one day. I don't even like running the clubs I have. “I'm a fan, we have good football people in place. One of my favourite people on the planet is Dougie Freedman, everybody knows that. “The only place where I think I would like to see more collaboration is when Palace is struggling with those reserves and struggling with injuries and I have a boat-load of athletes. “I'm in it for the long game. Is there a possibility that if we can't achieve greater collaboration that we would consider selling our interest in Palace? It's possible. “Would we consider buying more? I think we'd prefer that. “This is a message to the fans again. They have a club where everybody who owns stock wants to own more of it. “Why are they complaining? Look, people deserve to complain when they’re losing games, but generally sometimes they don't want to believe their own eyes.”",

        "content": "The Western Cape Education Department reminds parents to be on the look out for offers from schools starting this week. Parents will have until 14th June to accept offers to place their child in Grade 1 or 8. Be sure to check that your contact details on file with WCED are correct and that you can access the online application portal. Parents who applied for a spot in Grade 1 and Grade 8 at Western Cape schools should know the results of their application this Thursday, 30th May. The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) says that parents who applied should make sure their contact details are correct and that they are able to access the online admissions portal here . Parents will have until 14th June to accept or decline an offer. “If a parent has not confirmed their choice by 14 June 2024, the system will automatically confirm their top-ranked choice of school that has made an offer. All other offers will then be removed, so that those places can be offered to other learners,” the department said in a statement . Should a parent not receive an offer on 30th May, the department encourages them to remain hopeful as once other parents accept offers, other spots will free up as mentioned above. “We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to place every learner whose parents applied on time as quickly as possible,” the Western Cape Education Department said in a statement. From 14th June to 31st July, the department will be filling spaces according to the offers accepted by parents. From 15th June through to the end of the year, WCED will work to place students who aren’t initially placed. Parents who don’t respond by 14th June will see their child placed into the top-ranked school which made an offer. Earlier this month WCED reported that it had received as many as 114 144 applications for placement in Grades 1 and 8 for 2025. The department also says that “The window for Grade R applications and transfer requests for Grades 2 – 7 and 9 – 12 will run from 1 to 16 August 2024.” While much of the attention is currently on the elections, if you’re a parent in the Western Cape who applied for placement, keep an eye on your notifications this week",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the country's eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon's shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province's capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor’s residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. \"Even before the typhoon hit, we've transported relief goods in places near the typhoon’s expected path, so they were all ready,” Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago , which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing , flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the country’s eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon’s shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province’s capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor’s residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. “Even before the typhoon hit, we’ve transported relief goods in places near the typhoon’s expected path, so they were all ready,” Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago, which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.

        "content": "North Korea's military satellite launch fails, rocket explodes in Yellow Sea. Analysts suspect Russian assistance in new engine type. North Korea's latest military reconaissance satellite launch ended in failure as the rocket exploded and fell into the Yellow Sea shortly after liftoff. Analysts say it shows progress in the country's space ambitions despite the setback. North Korea said that tried a new “liquid oxygen and petroleum engine” with the rocket which failed during its first stage. Initial analysis suggests issues with the newly developed liquid-fuel rocket motor, though other causes are being investigated, according to the state media. While the rocket remains unnamed and no were released, analysts believe it differs from the Chollima-1 used in previous successful launches. The Chollima-1, which also had explosive test failures, uses hypergolic fuels that ignite on contact and are typically used in North Korea's nuclear missiles, which do not use liquid oxygen due to storage temperature challenges. The new engine type may indicate Russian assistance, as Russia has previously vowed to help North Korea's satellite programme. Liquid oxygen engines, like those developed by Russia, require specialised storage and handling due to extremely low boiling points. The shift to a new engine type might allow North Korea to differentiate its civilian space program from its missile program, which is banned by the UN Security Council. Russian experts have reportedly visited North Korea to aid in this effort, though the specifics of their assistance are unclear. Analysts suggest that with proper data analysis from the failed launch, North Korea could attempt another launch soon.",

With numerous blockchain networks operating in isolation, each with its own unique features and strengths, the potential for collaboration and innovation has been limited. However, a groundbreaking solution has emerged in the form of crypto bridges, which promise to tear down the walls separating these disparate systems and usher in a new era of interoperability and cross-chain transactions. At their core, crypto bridges are protocols or platforms that enable the seamless transfer of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), across different blockchain networks. These bridges act as intermediaries, facilitating the movement of value between otherwise incompatible ecosystems, unlocking a world of possibilities for developers, users, and the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry as a whole. The Growing Need for Interoperability As the adoption of blockchain technology continues to accelerate, the need for interoperability has become increasingly apparent. Each blockchain network offers its own unique features, such as scalability, security, privacy, or specialized functionality, catering to diverse use cases and requirements. However, the inability to transfer assets or communicate across these networks has created siloes, hindering the potential for collaboration, liquidity, and innovation. Photo by Art Rachen on Unsplash Imagine a scenario where a user holds Ether (ETH) on the Ethereum network but wants to participate in a lending protocol built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Without a crypto bridge, the user would be forced to sell their ETH, incurring transaction fees and potentially missing out on opportunities. Alternatively, they might have to maintain separate wallets and manage multiple cryptocurrencies, adding complexity and friction to the experience. Crypto bridges like Defi Way solve this problem by enabling the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchain networks, effectively breaking down the barriers that have traditionally existed between these ecosystems. The Mechanics Behind Crypto Bridges At the heart of crypto bridges lies a process known as “wrapping” or “tokenization.” This involves locking the original asset on the source blockchain and minting a corresponding token on the destination blockchain. This wrapped token represents the locked asset and can be used within the destination blockchain’s ecosystem as if it were the original asset. For example, if a user wants to transfer Ether (ETH) from the Ethereum network to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), they can use a crypto bridge to “wrap” their ETH into a tokenized version, such as Wrapped ETH (WETH), that is compatible with the BSC network. This WETH can then be used seamlessly within the BSC ecosystem, allowing the user to participate in decentralized applications (dApps), lending protocols, or liquidity pools on that network. The process of unwrapping the asset involves burning the wrapped token on the destination blockchain and unlocking the original asset on the source blockchain, ensuring the conservation of value and maintaining the integrity of the underlying assets. Trusted and Trustless Crypto Bridges Crypto bridges can be classified into two main categories: trusted bridges and trustless bridges. 1. Trusted Bridges: Trusted bridges rely on a centralized or semi-centralized entity, such as a custodian or a federation of validators, to facilitate the wrapping and unwrapping of assets between blockchains. These bridges require users to trust the custodian or federation to accurately represent the locked assets on the destination blockchain. While trusted bridges offer a more streamlined user experience, they introduce a degree of centralization and counterparty risk. 2. Trustless Bridges: In contrast, trustless bridges operate in a decentralized and trustless manner, leveraging smart contracts and cryptographic techniques to enable cross-chain asset transfers without relying on a central authority. These bridges employ mechanisms like atomic swaps, hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs), or more advanced techniques like zk-rollups or optimistic rollups to ensure the security and integrity of the bridged assets. Trustless bridges are generally considered more secure and align better with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology, but they can be more complex to implement and may have higher transaction costs. Unlocking Opportunities with Crypto Bridges The emergence of crypto bridges has unlocked numerous opportunities and benefits for the blockchain ecosystem, including: 1. Enhanced Liquidity and Capital Efficiency: By enabling the seamless transfer of assets across networks, crypto bridges allow users to tap into liquidity pools and opportunities across multiple blockchains. This increased liquidity and capital efficiency can lead to better pricing, reduced slippage, and more efficient allocation of resources within the DeFi ecosystem. 2. Fostering Collaboration and Innovation: With the ability to move assets across different blockchain networks, developers can leverage the strengths and capabilities of various ecosystems to build more complex and innovative decentralized applications (dApps). This cross-chain collaboration fosters creativity and drives the development of groundbreaking solutions. 3. Improved User Experience: Crypto bridges simplify the process of participating in various blockchain ecosystems, eliminating the need for users to manage multiple wallets and constantly swap between different cryptocurrencies. This streamlined experience can drive greater adoption and accessibility for decentralized applications and services. 4. Diversification and Risk Management: By enabling the transfer of assets across multiple networks, crypto bridges allow users to diversify their holdings and exposure, mitigating the risks associated with being tied to a single ecosystem. This diversification can help users manage their investment portfolios more effectively and hedge against potential risks or volatility in specific networks. Challenges and Considerations While crypto bridges offer significant advantages, they also present certain challenges and considerations that must be addressed: 1. Security Risks: As with any blockchain-based system, security is a paramount concern. Crypto bridges can be potential attack vectors for hackers, as they represent centralized points of failure or vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Rigorous auditing, robust security measures, and ongoing monitoring are crucial to mitigate these risks. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape surrounding crypto bridges and cross-chain asset transfers is still evolving. Varying jurisdictions may have different requirements or restrictions, which could impact the adoption and utilization of these bridges. 3. Scalability and Throughput: As the demand for cross-chain transactions grows, crypto bridges may face scalability challenges, particularly in terms of throughput and transaction processing speed. Ongoing improvements and innovations in blockchain technology will be necessary to address these scalability concerns. 4. Compatibility and Standardization: With multiple blockchain networks and varying protocols, ensuring compatibility and adhering to standards can be challenging for crypto bridge developers. Collaborative efforts and industry-wide standards could help streamline the development and adoption of interoperable solutions. The Future of Crypto Bridges and Blockchain Interoperability As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve and mature, the role of crypto bridges is poised to become increasingly pivotal. With the growing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the emergence of new blockchain networks and Layer 2 solutions, the need for seamless cross-chain communication and asset transfer will only intensify. Looking ahead, we can expect to see further advancements in crypto bridge technology, with a focus on improving security, scalability, and user experience. Additionally, the development of more robust and standardized protocols for cross-chain communication could pave the way for broader adoption and integration of crypto bridges across various blockchain ecosystems. Moreover, as regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology evolve, we may see clearer guidelines and policies surrounding the operation and governance of crypto bridges, fostering greater transparency and accountability within the industry. Conclusion Crypto bridges represent a transformative innovation in the blockchain space, enabling seamless cross-chain transactions and fostering interoperability between disparate networks. By breaking down siloes and facilitating the flow of value across ecosystems, these bridges unlock new opportunities for decentralized finance, enhance liquidity and capital efficiency, and drive greater adoption of decentralized applications and services. While challenges remain, particularly in terms of security, scalability, and regulatory uncertainty, the potential benefits of crypto bridges are undeniable. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, these bridges will play a crucial role in shaping the future of decentralized finance and unlocking the full potential of a truly interconnected and interoperable blockchain landscape. The advent of crypto bridges is a testament to the innovative spirit and collaborative efforts within the blockchain community. By unifying the blockchain universe, these bridges pave the way for a future where seamless cross-chain transactions and interoperability are the norm, ushering in a new era of decentralized innovation and empowering individuals and businesses alike to harness the full potential of this groundbreaking technology.

        "content": "viewers were left absolutely horrified and threatening to turn off their TVs after the soap aired some particularly disturbing scenes involving Tom King. Tom has been deceiving everyone into believing that Belle Dingle is the manipulative one in their relationship, but in a shocking twist, it's actually Tom who's been pulling the strings. He's been systematically gaslighting Belle, making her believe she's the one at fault, when in reality, he's the mastermind of manipulation since they tied the knot. In an episode on Monday, 27 May, Belle wrongly blamed herself for their issues, claiming Tom had always treated her with love, Tom grew agitated by her refusal to communicate with him. Desperate to maintain his grip on her, he sought out new ways to exert his control, even when she wasn't physically present. The climax of the episode was too much for many fans to bear as Tom menacingly picked up a syringe and approached their beloved dog Piper, implying he would harm the innocent animal. Viewers were appalled by the scene and quickly expressed their outrage on Twitter. One upset fan tweeted: \"Blimey even a dog isn't safe in that f***ing village # ,\" while another exclaimed: \"no f***ing way is he gonna kill that dog #Emmerdale.\", reports . A third chimed in with: \"NO NOT THE DOG #emmerdale,\" and a fourth commented: \"No! this is too far poor piper leave her alone #Emmerdale.\" Another added: \"this story line is disturbing,\" and yet another viewer said: \"Oh COME ON NOW. This is beyond sick.\" Emmerdale's recent episodes have taken a dark turn, revealing the harrowing truth of Belle Dingle's (played by Eden Taylor-Draper) life with Tom, as viewers witnessed the chilling moment he discovered her lie about contraception and punished her by scalding her hand under hot water. Eden Taylor-Draper, who brings Belle to life on screen, spoke out about the intense scenes, cautioning fans: \"I think you can expect to see everything escalate throughout the episode. You'll see how easily Tom can switch on and off and how he truly feels and his anger towards Belle. You'll get a glimpse into Belle's terrifying reality.\" The actress also discussed the storyline's significance in shedding light on such a traumatic issue, saying: \"People have reached out which I think is a great sign that everything is resonating in some way.\" She continued, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to portray this narrative: \"So many people go through this and I'm really grateful that I've been able to play out Belle's story. We've worked with charities and people that have gone through this and it's important that what we're portraying is real.\"",

But he told the club's website of his time as a junior with Sheffield United: I don't know a right-back or a full-back who started off there. I couldn't get a game at centre-forward to be completely honest. I signed my scholarship and there were better centre-forwards than me, even though I went to Lilleshall as a centre-forward at Under-16s. I was a late developer. I didn't grow and I was very light. We played Nottingham Forest and they had a quick winger, but the right-back at the time wasn't playing for one reason or another. The coach put me there and from that day on I have never played another position. At first, I thought why am I not playing centre-forward? Why am I not getting the goals and the glory? But you soon realise it's quite enjoyable. Your role changes in the team and I enjoyed setting people up rather than scoring. I went from getting the odd 10 or 15 minutes in the first four months after I came out of school and into full-time football, to playing every game.\" This article first appeared on Tribal Football and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "A collaborative research team from China and Ukraine has made significant strides in tracking near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), improving our ability to assess potential risks. By conducting regular observations, the team has been able to pinpoint the locations of these asteroids and accurately map their orbits. NEAs are asteroids whose orbits come close to Earth's, posing a potential threat of collision. The necessity for immediate follow-up observations of newly identified NEAs is crucial for quickly determining their orbital elements. Accurate tracking of these rapidly moving objects requires short exposure times during astronomical measurements to prevent elongated streaks in images. Researchers from the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Mykolaiv Astronomical Observatory have developed an innovative technique to address this challenge. The rotating-drift-scan (RDS) charge-coupled device (CCD) technique allows asteroids to be imaged as point sources, even with long exposure times. This advancement is crucial for improving the precision of asteroid tracking . The research leveraged a comprehensive dataset of over 11,000 positional measurements of nearly 500 NEAs. These measurements were captured using two 50-centimetre telescopes located in Xi'an, China, from 2019 to 2023, and in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, from 2011 to 2022. This extensive data collection has been instrumental in refining the tracking and mapping of NEA orbits. A new study published in the Astronomical Journal highlights the potential of this research to revolutionise asteroid detection. By using a network of small telescopes and employing the RDS CCD technique, global monitoring of NEAs can be significantly enhanced. This improvement in detection capabilities is a critical step in protecting Earth from potential asteroid impacts. | Why solar storms impact power grids and when will a solar storm hit Earth next?",

        "description": "Nasa's Magellan data indicates volcanic activity on Venus",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: A recent analysis of data collected by Nasa's Magellan spacecraft between 1990 and 1992 reveals evidence of fresh lava flows on the planet's surface during the spacecraft's observations. The study was published in Nature Astronomy on May 27. Planetary scientist Paul Byrne of Washington University in St Louis, who was not involved in the study said, \"This definitely is another step in the path to understanding Venus as a living, breathing world.\" Despite being similar in size to Earth, Venus was long considered geologically inactive. However, many scientists believed that Venus should have comparable levels of internal heat, which is the primary driver of volcanic activity and earthquakes. The new research follows a similar approach to a study published last year, which identified a volcanic vent changing shape and potentially releasing lava in Magellan data, providing the first conclusive evidence of such activity on Venus. The current study, led by planetary scientist David Sulcanese of D'Annunzio University in Chieti-Pescara, Italy, and his colleagues, searched for signs of volcanism across Venus' vast surface area, which is three times the size of Earth's dry land. Magellan's radar images revealed long, sinuous features appearing between two of the spacecraft's passes over the western slopes of Sif Mons, a large shield volcano, and Niobe Planitia, a flat region dotted with volcanic vents. The researchers considered various explanations for these features, such as artifacts in the radar data or the result of landslides. However, the features followed the local topography, indicating that they were indeed flowing across Venus' surface, and they occurred in relatively flat areas where landslides would be unlikely. Byrne believes that the study authors have convincingly demonstrated that the changes in the surface appearance in these two instances are best explained by the presence of lava flows. He suggests that there may be many more instances of active volcanism waiting to be discovered, given the low resolution of Magellan's data and the immense land area of Venus. Both Byrne and the study authors agree that Venus could currently have a level of volcanic activity comparable to that of Earth. Future NASA missions, such as DAVINCI and VERITAS, scheduled to launch next decade, will provide more detailed maps of the Venusian surface, making it easier to identify signs of ongoing volcanic activity.",

        "content": "Israel’s deadly attack on a refugee camp in southern Gaza, which reportedly resulted in 45 deaths and 249 injuries, has sparked widespread international reactions. The Israeli Prime Minister called it a “tragic mistake,” while the country’s Foreign Ministry warned its embassies about a “strong wave of anti-Semitism.” The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that the Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp in southern Gaza killed at least 45 civilians, including 23 women, children, and elderly people, and injured 249 other civilians. This attack has led to widespread reactions. In response to the global backlash, Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Unfortunately, something tragically went wrong.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief expressed his shock upon hearing the news in his initial reaction. Meanwhile, Axios, citing an American official, reported that the White House is investigating the incident to determine what exactly happened and whether the situation necessitates U.S. action. The identities of the American officials who spoke with Axios are unknown, but the media outlet quoted them saying, “The devastating images following the Israeli military’s Sunday night attack in Rafah... are heartbreaking.” The French President, in a relatively cautious reaction, said that Israel must immediately halt its military operations in Gaza. The Spanish Foreign Minister also stated, “If Israel continues to violate the International Court of Justice’s ruling on stopping the attack on Rafah, we will seek appropriate measures to enforce this decision.” This comes as the Israeli government, led by Netanyahu, faces opposition within Israel for its relentless attacks in Gaza. Netanyahu’s speech in the Israeli parliament was repeatedly interrupted yesterday due to protests. Countries in the region, especially Arab nations, have also reacted to Israel’s attack on the refugee camp in Rafah, calling for an immediate cessation of Israeli military operations in Gaza. In a rare reaction, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused Israel of “terrorism.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. Δ",

        "content": "A Michigan mom was fatally struck by an out-of-control vehicle while heroically saving her two-year-old daughter’s life at a drag racing event on Sunday. Kadie Price, 33, was in the crowd with her family when a 1980 Jeep CJ lost control and veered off the racing strip before slamming into another vehicle, police said. The other vehicle, which had been stationary at the time of impact, struck Price as a result — just seconds after she had pushed her daughter to safety. Chaos ensued at Silver Lake State Park Sand Dunes in western Oceana County — about 270 miles northwest of Detroit, MLive.com reported . Despite several people rushing over to offer immediate care to Price, including Silver Lake State Park rangers, they were ultimately unable to save her. Price was pronounced dead shortly after she was struck just before midday. Her daughter was able to avoid “serious injury or worse,” police said, as a result of her mom’s quick-thinking. “Please keep the Price family in your prayers,” the Oceana County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. The driver of the Jeep is being identified as a 64-year-old man who hails from Michigan. His name is not being released at this time as the investigation is ongoing. Two off-roaders who took part in Sunday’s race have since detailed the horrific incident. “I’ve been coming out here a long time,” Bryce Straubel told WOOD . “That was probably one of them most brutal accidents I’ve ever seen.” “It breaks me,” Straubel added. “People are coming out here to have a good time and this mother just lost her life. She pushed her daughter out of the way to save her — it’s just rough to hear. It really is.” The Silver Lake State Park is a 3,000-acre park runs along the shorelines of Lake Michigan. It contained about 2,000 acres of san dunes.",

        "content": "Aizawl: Twelve people died, and several others were missing as a stone quarry collapsed in Mizoram’s Aizawl district on Tuesday morning amid incessant rains as an impact of cyclone Remal, officials said. The incident happened around 6 am in an area between Melthum and Hlimen on the southern outskirts of the Aizawl town, they said. “Twelve bodies have been recovered so far, while several others are suspected to be still trapped under the debris,” Aizawl’s Deputy Commissioner Nazuk Kumar told PTI. “We are looking for more bodies. The operations will continue till we clear the entire site,” she added. Director-General of Police (DGP) Anil Shukla told PTI that heavy rains were affecting the rescue operations at the disaster site. He said the rains triggered landslides at several other places in the state and at least two persons have been “swept away”. Among the victims of the stone quarry collapse are a four-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl, another police officer said. “We have also rescued two persons alive from the site,” he said. A landslide swept away a building in Aizawl’s Salem Veng, following which three persons went missing. Search is underway for them, an official said. The state capital has been cut off from the rest of the country due to a landslide on National Highway 6 at Hunthar, officials said. Besides, several intra-state highways have also been disrupted by landslides, they said. Chief Minister Lalduhoma announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia for the families of those killed in calamities caused by rains, including the quarry collapse. He handed over cheques of Rs 2 lakh each to the families of the eight Mizo people who died in the quarry collapse and said the remaining amount would be given to them soon. Home Minister K Sapdanga told PTI, “The identities of the four non-tribal people are being verified. If they are permanent residents of Mizoram, they will be given the ex-gratia amount. If they came here temporarily to work, then they will not get any financial support.” Lalduhoma said the government has earmarked Rs 15 crore to tackle disasters triggered by rains, which occurred as an aftereffect of cyclone Remal. Later, Lalduhoma along with Sapdanga, who also handles the Disaster Management and Rehabilitation Department, visited the stone quarry site to take stock of the situation and oversee the orescue operations. Because of the rains, all schools were closed and government employees, except those involved in providing essential services, were asked to work from home. Meanwhile, more than 30 families were shifted to safer places due to unprecedented flooding of the Tlawng river at Sairang village, about 21 km from Aizawl, a senior official said. “Several farms on the bank of the river have been fully submerged by the water. The water level is continuing to rise. However, no casualty has been reported,” he added. In Aizawl town, some cemeteries have also been swept away by landslides, and over 150 graves damaged.",

        "description": "A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday.",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the country's eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon's shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province's capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor's residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. \"Even before the typhoon hit, we've transported relief goods in places near the typhoon's expected path, so they were all ready,'' Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago, which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.",

        "content": "The talented young Frenchman has shone at Selhurst Park and clearly seems ready to make the step up to a bigger club, with key figures clearly eager for him to make the move to Stamford Bridge. According to Phillips, Shields is driving this and pushing for the Blues to sign Olise, who has a £60m release clause at Palace, and who is also wanted by Man Utd. The report adds that Olise came very close to joining Chelsea last summer, so it could still be that they will be able to lure him to the club this year, in what could be a vital move for the west Londoners to bring in a much-needed upgrade on the likes of Mykhailo Mudryk, Raheem Sterling and Noni Madueke. Olise transfer: Should he choose Chelsea or Man United? Chelsea and United are two of the biggest clubs in England, and indeed Europe, so it might not be the easiest choice for Olise if it comes down to a decision between those two. Still, even if MUFC just won the FA Cup final, there clearly seems to be a more promising project being put together at CFC, especially once they finalise a deal to . The Red Devils are surely at an earlier stage of their project due to the recent change in ownership and new arrivals at board level, so that could likely mean a change of manager in the near future, as well as numerous ins and outs in the transfer market. Olise would do well to take these things into consideration when choosing his next move, though in truth he’ll perhaps be hoping the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool join the race as they’d likely be much better moves for him at this stage!",

        "content": "The management of Ebonyi State University, Abakiliki, has broken its silence on the death of a final-year student of the institution, Favour Ugwuka. Naija News reported that Favour, a student of the Department of English, committed suicide in her hostel at the Ishieke Campus of the university in Abakaliki, the state capital. Favour reportedly passed all her courses but repeatedly failed a particular course, whose lecturer had vowed she would never pass. The mother of the deceased blamed the lecturer for making her daughter commit suicide. Reacting, the accused lecturer in the Department of English Language, Professor Amechi Enyi, during an interview with journalists in Abakaliki last Friday, revealed that the late student merely copied down three examination questions. The lecturer stated that it was incorrect to claim that her death was related to academic activities. Addressing journalists on Monday at the institution’s conference room, the Vice Chancellor, Professor Chigozie Ogbu, dismissed the deceased’s claims that the accused lecturer was behind her failure. Ogbu stated that the certified true copy of Ugwuka Favour Chinonye’s results, with the registration number EBSU/2018/89726 for the Department of English Language and Literature, was registered in 2018/2019, which is her first year. According to him, Favour offered 9 courses in her first year, out of which she failed 3 and had a CGP of 1.78. In the second semester of her first year, she took 8 courses, out of which she failed 2 and had a CGP of 1.75, thereby having a sessional CGP of 1.76. The Vice Chancellor further revealed Ugwuka’s academic performance in subsequent years, concluding that she had outstanding courses, including ENG 416, which she failed twice. He said, “When a student is confident that a lecturer has deliberately marked them down, and they are sure that they passed the exam, what the student does is to complain to the HOD or Dean and request re-marking, which will be sent to the Vice Chancellor’s office. “It is usually sent to another university to re-mark and let us know. Some of them, on very rare occasions, have returned positive, and whatever the student gets here is usually what they get from the other university after re-marking, and that is the process. “If at the last exam, the late student felt that she was marked down by the lecturer, she would have complained to the Dean and asked for re-marking, and the paper would have been sent to another place for re-marking. ‘But from what is seen, it’s not that the student deserves to pass, and she didn’t pass. And from the record, you will find out that this is not the only course that she didn’t pass. “In 2019/2020, which is her 2nd year, she registered a total of 10 courses. Out of the courses, she was absent in 2 courses: Intermediate English Composition (ENG 215) and Philosophy and Logic (GST 102). She was absent in the 2 courses out of the 8 she wrote, she failed 2. She had a GP of 1.41 in that 1st semester. In her 2nd semester, she registered 10 courses. Out of the 10 courses, she failed 4 and had a CGP of 1.82. Total CGP in her 2nd year is 1.62.”",

        "content": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A weak cold front will approach the area today helping to increase our rain chances ever so slightly. A few isolated showers will be possible north of I-4 late in the morning along with a few showers developing along I-75 and quickly pushing inland through the early afternoon hours. Most of the rain moves over to the east coast this evening. It will still be warm and very muggy through the day with highs in the low 90s and feels like temperatures close to the triple digits. Although this is a cold front, it is not going to drop our temperatures but it will bring us lower humidity for Wednesday and Thursday. Temperatures will be hotter though with highs in the mid and upper 90s both Wednesday and Thursday. Rain chances will come down back to a 10 and 20% each day through the weekend.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email t the start of a new school year, you are standing in front of your closet and thinking about what to wear. As you assess your options, one thing becomes clear – it’s time for a fresh pair of shoes to kick off the school year in style. Whether boys school shoes or girl’s school shoes, buying new shoes for the school year offers numerous benefits beyond just fashion. In this article, you will explore five compelling reasons why investing in new shoes for the school year is a smart choice. 1. Outgrown Shoes Your feet can grow quickly, especially during growth spurts. Wearing shoes that are too small can be uncomfortable and even harmful to your feet. Check if your toes feel cramped or if your heels slip out of your shoes when walking. If your shoes feel tight or uncomfortable, it’s time for a new pair that fits properly. Getting shoes that fit ensures your feet have enough room to grow and stay healthy throughout the school year. 2. Increased Activity Levels As the school year starts, you might find yourself getting more active with sports, games, and other activities. Wearing proper shoes is essential to keep up with your increased activity levels. Athletic shoes provide support and cushioning to help prevent injuries and keep you comfortable during physical activities. Look for shoes designed for the specific sports or activities you’ll be participating in. Whether it’s running, basketball, or dancing, having the right shoes can enhance your performance and enjoyment while staying active. 3. Fashion and Self-Expression Your shoes are a way to show off your unique taste and sense of fashion. Whether you prefer sneakers, boots, or loafers, there are endless options to choose from to match your style. Look for shoes in colors or patterns that reflect your personality and make you feel confident. Expressing yourself through your footwear adds a fun and personal touch to your school wardrobe. 4. Durability and Longevity Over time, shoes can wear out and lose their support and cushioning, especially if you wear them every day. Investing in high-quality shoes made from durable materials ensures they last longer and provide better protection for your feet. Look for shoes with sturdy construction and quality materials that can withstand the demands of school life. Choosing durable shoes saves you money in the long run by reducing the need for frequent replacements. 5. Support Local Businesses Local shoe stores provide personalized service and unique selections that you might not find in big chain stores. By shopping locally, you’re helping to support your community and the local economy. Plus, you might discover hidden gems and new favorite brands that you wouldn’t have found otherwise. Prioritize Your Footwear for a Successful School Year As you gear up for the new school year, don’t overlook the importance of prioritizing your footwear. From ensuring proper fit and support to expressing your personal style, the shoes you choose play a significant role in your comfort, confidence, and overall well-being. So, take the time to select footwear that not only feels great but also reflects your unique personality and style.

She was going through IVF in a desperate bid to become a mother, documenting her struggles on social media and on their show on Disney Plus and Hulu. The Poosh founder has now opened up about the ordeal in more detail, telling followers she went through five failed IVF cycles and three egg retrievals, all before conceiving her son naturally, welcoming their first child together last November.

In a candid response, she replied: \"I stopped after a year of trying (5 failed IVF cycles, 3 retrievals).\" She added: \"My body relaxed and I believed in God’s plan for my life. Lots of prayers for whatever was meant to be for us. Also lots of optimizing my health.\" Kourtney provided more words of wisdom for the follower, who said they'd gone through six rounds of IVF. \"I know how hard it is to feel like you're not trying, but believing in God's plan and saying your prayers is so powerful. All the best,\" she added. Kourtney's pregnancy journey has played out across different seasons of The Kardashians, from start to finish. They mentioned they were trying to conceive during season one, detailing some of the strange ways Kourtney was attempting to get pregnant. In season one, she said her doctor suggested she drink the Blink-182 drummer's semen, four times a week. In December 2022, the pair revealed they were stopping IVF and planned to conceive naturally, with the couple revealing their happy news at a Blink-182 concert in Los Angeles last June – she gave birth after an urgent fetal surgery in September.

        "description": "Esteban Ocon incurred the wrath of Alpine F1 boss Bruno Famin at the Monaco Grand Prix by causing a collision with team-mate Pierre Gasly with a brainless move on the first lap",
        "content": "Last May, Esteban Ocon stood on the Monaco Grand Prix podium at the end of one of the very best race weekends of his Formula 1 career. Twelve months on, after Sunday's race in Monte Carlo, his future with Alpine - perhaps in F1 altogether - looks to be in doubt. For more than a year, the threat of civil war at the French team never materialised into anything, but the touchpaper was well and truly lit in Monaco. Only Ocon knows what possessed him as he lunged up the inside of team-mate Pierre Gasly at Portier on the first lap of the race. They made contact which nearly flipped Ocon's car, and sparked a furious tirade from his fellow Frenchman over the radio. He also picked up a time penalty which, because the damage to his own car forced him to retire from the race, was converted instead into a five-place grid drop for the next race in Canada. But it remains to be seen whether he will even be on the Montreal grid. Mercedes 'won't tolerate' F1 star 'attacking' his team-mate as Lewis Hamilton seat ruled out Charles Leclerc made X-rated admission moments after emotional Monaco GP win If Gasly was angry, team principal Bruno Famin was beside himself. He described Ocon's botched overtake as an \"attack\" on his team-mate and warned that there will be \"consequences\" for the 27-year-old. It remains to be seen what those consequences will be. Ocon apologised to Famin and Gasly in private and said sorry in public as well, taking full responsibility for his actions - but still it seems to be a real possibility that he could be replaced in Canada. Such a punishment is extremely rare in F1 and Alpine will need to be absolutely sure of themselves before pulling the trigger on such a drastic measure, not least because of the potential legal minefield that it could produce. F1 driver contracts are so complicated these days that it would be daft to assume what clauses do and don't exist in each person's deal. But the team's lawyers will have to comb the fine print and make sure it is legally possible for them to force Ocon to sit out as a punishment. And even if it is, Ocon is not likely to react well to being benched. Tensions are high at Alpine right now and those involved would do well to take a breath and not make any rash decisions in response to this incident, for risk of making things infinitely worse for a team that is already in turmoil. Things may be worse for Ocon in the long-term, though. His Alpine contract is up at the end of the year and, though he is a candidate for the seats at Mercedes and the new Audi F1 project, those prospective new employers aren't likely to be impressed with the sort of driving he demonstrated in Monaco.

        "content": "A sessions court in Mumbai on Tuesday sentenced two former staffers of a salon chain to life imprisonment in the 2018 Kirti Vyas murder case. The body of the 28-year-old Kirti Vyas has not been found yet. The quantum of sentence of two convicts in the Kirti Vyas murder case was announced on Tuesday. In the hearing on Monday, the two were found guilty in Kirti Vyas murder case. ADVERTISEMENT Reports stated that Additional Sessions Judge MG Deshpande on Monday had held the convicts--Siddhesh Tamhankar and Khushi Sahjwani, his accomplice--guilty under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence). Tamhankar and Sahjwani, who worked as account executives and managers at an Andheri salon chain, reported to Vyas, the financial manager, the investigation states. Vyas was allegedly killed after writing a memo to one of the accused about poor performance. Vyas disappeared on March 16, 2018. Her relatives reported her missing to the DB Marg police station after they were unable to locate her using CCTV footage from Grant Road and Mumbai Central railway stations. Vyas was last seen boarding the Virar-bound train at 9:11 am from Grant Road in Andheri, according to the report. According to the PTI report, the Kirti Vyas murder case was later handed to the Crime Branch, which nabbed Tamhankar and Sahjwani. Police solved the case by conducting DNA testing on blood recovered in a car related to one of the defendants and allegedly used in the Kirti Vyas murder case.",

        "description": "A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees",
        "content": "A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the country’s eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon’s shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province’s capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor’s residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. “Even before the typhoon hit, we’ve transported relief goods in places near the typhoon’s expected path, so they were all ready,” Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago , which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing , flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.",

In late April, then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the Ukrainian Army’s losses stood at almost half a million soldiers at the time. He also said that Russian battlegroups get the better of the enemy along the entire front line, driving Ukrainian troops out of their positions. According to Shoigu, the combat potential of the Russian Army enables it to maintain constant fire on the enemy, preventing them from holding defensive lines. In March, Shoigu announced that the Ukrainian forces had lost more than 71,000 soldiers since the start of the year. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:410:3072:1639_640x0_80_0_0_291541aaf5a8aa5b8fd38171cd7b7062.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_2237c7bdc15a5cc99fca8c77d0a93800.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_2237c7bdc15a5cc99fca8c77d0a93800.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_f9dfb8b156ac67f2220d16559ef2532f.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_f9dfb8b156ac67f2220d16559ef2532f.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_5b02c9aad5740296d0394a08e0ca5a5c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_5b02c9aad5740296d0394a08e0ca5a5c.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:410:3072:1639_1280x0_80_0_0_3e565560daa6d2f7ffdb85df87f837af.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_e492aa6e5823ba3599e7d9286f6d9535.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_e492aa6e5823ba3599e7d9286f6d9535.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_38fd069eb4ba29e96ca97600f69ec20d.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_38fd069eb4ba29e96ca97600f69ec20d.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_604ec85d37234dba1738c657db4a5e21.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_604ec85d37234dba1738c657db4a5e21.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:410:3072:1639_1920x0_80_0_0_01ab6275dc966f6d8af90ab1bd58b4b9.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_aacd6739ef5c001bfdee558e6438e44c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_aacd6739ef5c001bfdee558e6438e44c.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_74f799cf267232550aeae15ec47b39bd.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_74f799cf267232550aeae15ec47b39bd.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c436e35cf8c036830f28eb79242367df.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c436e35cf8c036830f28eb79242367df.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } Russia's Special Operation in Ukraine Live Fast, Die Young: West Hints Ukraine Should Mobilize More Youth Amid Major Losses Yesterday, 15:07 GMT",

        "description": "Former This Morning duo Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford never held back on sharing insight into their busy sex life, and one TV stint saw them visit an underground sex cave to keep the fire burning",
        "content": "The 'Richard and Judy' of ITV were notoriously outspoken on screen - and that includes dishing out details about intimacy. Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford sent shockwaves through the showbiz sphere when they announced their separation after 14 years of marriage on Saturday. Eamonn is said to be \"angry\" about the split, which he allegedly claims was \"very much been orchestrated by Ruth\" who was \"determined\" to move on. The duo have reportedly been secretly leading 'separate lives, professional and personally' for two years. Eamonn broke his silence on the sensational split while presenting on GMB this morning, thanking fans for support and cryptically telling viewers 'what a weekend it was' before moving onto discussing the football. Meanwhile, Ruth is taking a break from her Loose Women duties amid the break-up. Eamonn Holmes lets slip struggle with internal turmoil after 'emotional weekend' Friends of the couple claim there are various factors which led to Ruth and Eamonn's marriage falling apart, including Eamonn's reported low moods during his struggles with chronic pain. The star has suffered with crippling health issues for years, and while Ruth has been by his side throughout, caring for him when he struggled with mobility, she previously admitted that Eamonn's injuries had been 'testing' on their marriage. Fractures in their physical spark were seemingly apparent before their public announcement, with the Mail claiming that Eamonn joked to friends about being 'touched' more by his physio than Ruth in recent years. Ruth and Eamonn visited a sex dungeon ( Image: Channel 5) But before their marriage crumbled, the presenting duo were incredibly open about their sizzling sex life, famously treating viewers to cheeky innuendos whenever they had the chance. They even hosted Eamonn & Ruth's 7 Year Itch in 2017 - a show dedicated to injecting spice back into a marriage. And it wasn't for the faint of heart. The mini series saw Ruth and Eamonn visit a sex dungeon - complete with sex swings, a latex-clad dominatrix and whips - in a bid to inspire couples in the bedroom. The Beflast-born presenter got stuck right in as he brandished a whip, surrounded by scary-looking contraptions. He also admired a blow-up sex doll on the show. A woman called Mistress Komakino joined the presenting duo in the underground sex cave to teach them how she helps couples find their spark again. Eamonn told the Mistress to spank a man in a leather bondage mask, but Ruth wasn't so keen as she winced: \"Oh I don't like hurting people!\" Eamonn got stuck in with the toys ( Image: Channel 5) But Ruth has previously revealed what makes her tick. Just months before their split, she revealed the one thing Eamonn would do to ensure he got sex. She told her fellow Loose Women panelists: \"You can have all the compliments and the flowers but then, if Eamonn comes home and has used my car and he goes, 'Filled the petrol up and did your water bottle', I'm like, 'Get upstairs right now'.\" As the studio audience burst into fits of laughter, Ruth continued: \"I hate doing it. Literally, I'll go round with my petrol light on red, the water bottle empty, smeared [windscreen], I'm like, 'Oh I can't stop and do that,' so he'll do it for me and he knows, he knows.\" She added with a smirk: \"Everyone's got their little trick.\" Meanwhile, Eamonn once joked about their active sex life, revealing: \"I love Ruth deeply but also I fancy her. How could I resist? No wonder I look tired all the time - that woman has me run ragged. I go to work for a break.\" And Ruth revealed her husband's unwavering obsession with her figure helped fan the fames in the bedroom. \"Eamonn is my biggest fan and always makes me feel really sexy,\" she once told The Mirror . \"When I think I'm at my slimmest he thinks I'm too thin. He likes me curvy - he loves boobs, bottoms and legs. I'm really lucky because it would be awful to have a man who commented on me piling on the pounds.\" Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather'",

        "content": "On Thursday (23 May) Doncaster Council revealed the details of Gateway One, an office and retail building that was greenlit by the planning committee in January. The site will revolve around digital technology, with hopes to allow Doncaster to progress as a centre of excellence for Artificial Intelligence . Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Doncaster Free Press, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Local AI firm Automatic Analytics will become a founder member of the project, with several other businesses expected to take residence in the building. According to the council, the site’s design will “enable businesses and entrepreneurs to co-locate with other likeminded businesses and industry leaders to collaborate, develop local supply chain opportunities, access local, regional, and national business support provision, and strengthen industry links with education and skills provision.” The £24 million building will be funded by the Town Deal which was granted to the council by central government. Town Deal funding in Doncaster has been earmarked for the council’s Urban Masterplan, which aims to regenerate the city. Advertisement Advertisement Located on Trafford Way, the building will contribute to the transformation of the Gateway area. Trafford Court Offices, Wolseley Plumb Centre and a vacant retail unit will all be demolished to make way for the new site. Office space will span across five floors, with two commercial units on the ground floor which incorporate alfresco dining. An area of public open space will also be incorporated into the scheme, with the site being designed to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions. Advertisement Advertisement Mayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones , said: “Our city is rapidly becoming recognised for its industry expertise around Artificial Intelligence, and I am keen to build this momentum and drive forward our ambition to regenerate our city centre and develop our economy for the 21st century. “This is an exciting time for Doncaster city centre, with work taking place across several key areas and I look forward to seeing businesses across the city and region take advantage of this state-of-the-art facility.” Work is expected to start on the site in early 2025, with completion expected in 2026.",

        "content": "Max Verstappen insisted following a tough for Red Bull that he was always aware that the 2024 season was never going to be like his exceptional 2023 campaign. Red Bull have been struggling in the past three F1 races – Miami, Imola, and Monaco – to recreate their dominant form which they have enjoyed since 2022. In 2023 Verstappen and Red Bull had an unprecedented run, the team winning all but one of the 22 races – Carlos Sainz won in Singapore – while the Dutchman took 19 wins out of his team’s 21. But 2024 has been a far cry from its predecessor, as despite still leading both Championships, that has not come easily for Verstappen and Red Bull as the like of McLaren and Ferrari are pushing them hard, with the RB20 seemingly more vulnerable than its older sibling the all conquering RB19. Red Bull boss Christian Horner has repeatedly pointed out that the car designs were going to confirm with the cars’ pace converging as well, and now Verstappen added that 2023 was an exception. Speaking to the media after the Monaco GP, the reigning F1 Champion said: “It [2024] was never going to be like last year, to have a season like that is quite rare. “I always knew that this year was going to be a little bit different but also I don’t really think about championship positions or whatever with so many races left. Some races are a bit better for us and some are a bit worse for us. At the end of the day it all works out. “The cars are much closer, some cars work better on street circuits and some work better in fast corners rather than low speed corners. It will swing a bit,” he pointed out. The RB20 doesn’t like kerbs and bumps Asked about the weakness of his RB20, Verstappen said: “Any track that is bumpy or has kerbs, or you have to ride a lot of kerbs, so the street circuits will probably be a little bit tricky but hopefully by then we have a little bit of understanding of what is going on. “We have to wait and see,” he continued when asked about the kerbs in Canada, “new surface as well I think, that might also give us some surprises but it is probably also not going to be our strongest weekend because of that but probably a little bit better than here.” The triple F1 Champion insisted Red Bull racing are resting on their laurels, he said: “We take everything very seriously but sometimes things are not very easy to fix but we are working flat-out on it. “First we need to understand what it is, we don’t now a the moment so this is something that we have to find first,” Verstappen concluded when asked how fast the issue can be fixed. Verstappen currently leads the F1 Drivers’ Standings by 31 points from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc.",

Join the debate on our social media channels Manager Martin Paterson has left Burton Albion after the club narrowly avoided relegation from League One, BBC Radio Derby reports. The role at Pirelli Stadium was the 37-year-old former Swansea City, Barnsley and Inter Miami assistant manager's first job in charge of a senior side. Whoever the new man is, he’s going to have his work cut out. Thoughts? Stockport County , MK Dons and Bristol Rovers are interested in free agent defender Clark Robertson, according to the Daily Record The centre-back could be set for a return to England this summer following a spell in Israel at F.C. Ashdod. He helped them finish in 6th position in the Israeli Premier League last season. Gillingham are keen on a move for Accrington Stanley winger Jack Nolan, according to reporter Pete O’Rourke on X . Salford have announced two more friendlies. They will face Warrington Town on 24th July and Rochdale on Saturday 3rd August. Appere will join Stevenage when his contract at Sixfields runs out next month. The 6ft 1in Scot has scored 18 goals in 106 games for the Cobblers, including nine when they were promoted to League One in 2022-23. Louis Appere joins from Northampton “It’s been in the works for a while. I’m really looking forward to getting started. “I had positive chats with the manager and it’s a club with real potential with the project and the plans that he has got in place. “The run the club went on towards the end of last season made everyone pay attention. It’s a good club with a good manager and I’m hoping we can do good things.” League Two champs Stockport County have a new man. Jay Mingi has joined from Colchester. Notts County have signed Bradford City defender Matty Platt on a two-year contract - the League Two club's first summer signing. Platt, 26, moves to Meadow Lane on a free transfer following two years with the Bantams. He moved to Valley Parade after three years at Barrow, who he helped win promotion back to the Football League Two in 2020. \"Jay had a fantastic back end of the League Two season at Colchester,\" \"He showed his versatility and intelligence, switching from a familiar central midfield role to wide centre-back, right-back and right wing-back at times. “We believe he has real potential to develop, whilst immediately having the physical characteristics of being on the front foot, aggressive and quick, which will allow him to flourish in League One.\"",

        "content": "Nyanga man sentenced for serial thefts from former employer, neighbours In a troubling case that has left a community on edge, a 28-year-old Nyanga man has been brought before the Nyanga Magistrates’ Court, facing three counts of theft. The suspect, who was previously employed as a domestic worker, has been accused of targeting his former employer and two other local residents. According to the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe, the accused was fired from his position on April 12th, 2024. The very next day, he allegedly returned to the complainant’s home while she was away at a funeral and stole a host of items, including three buckets of yams, three buckets of maize, and a bed cover. The suspect is also accused of stealing five chickens from the complainant’s fowl run. Upon the complainant’s return, she discovered that her doors had been left open, and the missing property was nowhere to be found. It was later reported that the accused had been seen selling the stolen goods. The suspect’s criminal activities did not end there. On April 29th and 30th, he is said to have dug up potatoes from the fields of two additional complainants, valued at a total of $96 USD. Thorough investigations by the authorities led to the recovery of five bags of the stolen potatoes and the eventual arrest of the suspect. The court found the accused guilty on all three counts of theft and sentenced him to a total of seven months in prison. Three months of the sentence were suspended, and an additional month was suspended on the condition of restitution. The remaining three months were further suspended, provided the suspect completes 105 hours of community service.",

        "content": "THIBAUT COURTOIS has been left out of the Belgium Euro 2024 squad as fans claimed that their “golden generation turned bronze”. The Real Madrid goalkeeper, 32, has been capped 102 times for his country. But he will not be adding to that total this summer in Germany as he was the big-name omission from the squad. Courtois missed nearly the entire season due to a knee ligament injury. He then needed another operation on his knee in March when he had a setback but he did return to play four games earlier this month for LaLiga champions Madrid. Courtois threw his Belgium future into doubt after branding manager Domenico Tedesco a liar. He and his international gaffer had been at loggerheads after he was snubbed of the captaincy for their matches against Austria and Estonia last June following Eden Hazard's retirement. Courtois staggeringly accused both the Belgian Football Federation and Tedesco of not appreciating him. Then there was further controversy last month as Tedesco claimed that he had done everything in his power to ensure the crocked Courtois plays for the Red Devils again. But the former Chelsea stopper publicly took umbrage to that claim by responding to a post with his comments with three Pinocchio emojis. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Courtois made his Belgium debut in 2011 aged 19 and has gone on to make a further 101 appearances for his country. But he had confirmed way back in December that he would not be fit enough to represent his country in Germany. Meanwhile, the likes of Manchester City’s Kevin de Bruyne and Jeremy Doku are both in, along with ex-Premier League striker Romelu Lukaku and Arsenal winger Leandro Trossard. But the Courtois news was not the only shock as Tedesco announced his 25-man squad. Belgium also recalled Axel Witsel - that is despite the 35-year-old announcing his international retirement last year. Tedesco personally visited the Atletico Madrid defender to try and persuade him to return, and his words have done the trick. Witsel earned the last of his 130 caps at the World Cup in Qatar, where Belgium were eliminated in the group stage. Meanwhile, the country’s most-capped player Jan Vertonghen has also been named at the age of 36. Here is the 25-man squad for Euro 2024 in full: Goalkeepers: Koen Casteels (VfL Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton Town), Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest) Defenders: Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Wout Faes (Leicester City), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Arthur Theate (Stade Rennais), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid) Midfielders: Yannick Carrasco (Al Shabab), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Orel Mangala (Olympique Lyonnais), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Aster Vranckx (vfL Wolfsburg) Forwards: Johan Bakayoko (PSV Eindhoven), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Lois Openda (RB Leipzig), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal). However, another notable absentee is Fenerbahce's Michy Batshuayi. The former Chelsea and Crystal Palace forward, 30, has scored 27 goals in 55 caps. Belgium have under-achieved and failed to claim any silverware for the past decade after having a squad many had dubbed as the ‘Golden Generation’. And upon seeing the squad announcement for this upcoming tournament, one fan commented: “Golden generation turned bronze...” Another said: “They are not seeing the quarter finals.” “Belgium fell off,” said a third before a fourth added: “They're just perfect for group stages exit. It's just a matter of time.” STAY in the know this summer with The Sun's transfer experts. Chelsea have been given permission from Leicester to speak to Enzo Maresca . Liverpool and Chelsea are eyeing a summer move for Crysencio Summerville. Premier League clubs are targeting Tosin Adarabioyo, who will be a free agent when his Fulham contract expires next month.

        "content": "Taraba State Governor Kefas Agbu has visited JAC Motors in China as part of efforts to boost Nigeria’s quest for a transportation revolution. The visit, which coincided with JAC’s 60th anniversary celebration, marked a major milestone in the company’s commitment to partnering with Nigerian interests. According to a statement, Governor Agbu joined international dignitaries and public servants for the ribbon-cutting ceremony, which also spotlighted JAC’s historic delivery of 30,000 Electric Vehicles (EVs) to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This move, the statement explained, is expected to pave the way for Nigeria’s access to EVs, business connections, and technology in the specialised field. “The visit provided Governor Agbu with a firsthand look at JAC’s innovative manufacturing processes and technological advancements, strengthening the strategic partnership between the auto giant and Nigerian interests. This partnership is expected to result in the delivery of electric vehicles in Nigeria, aligning with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s vision for an affordable and cleaner transportation system,” the statement added. “The collaboration between Elizade and JAC is also driving innovation and investments in Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles, a key step towards reducing emissions and revolutionising the automotive industry in Nigeria. This partnership is expected to catalyse technological advancement, job creation, and improved living standards in the country.” “Governor Agbu’s visit has raised hopes for a transportation revolution in Nigeria, and the partnership between JAC and Nigerian interests is poised to make a significant impact on the country’s automotive industry and environment,” it added.",

        "description": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexicans will vote Sunday in historic elections weighing gender, democracy and populism, as they chart the country's path forward in voting shadowed by cartel violence.",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexicans will vote Sunday in historic elections weighing gender, democracy and populism, as they chart the country's path forward in voting shadowed by cartel violence. With two women leading the contest, Mexico will likely elect its first female president – a major step in a country long marked by its \"macho\" culture. The election will also be the biggest in the country's history. More than 20,000 congressional and local positions are up for grabs, according to the National Electoral Institute. The number of contested posts has fed bloodshed during the campaigns, as criminal groups have used local elections as an opportunity to exert power. A toxic slate of cartels and gangs have battled for turf and more than 20 people seeking political office have been killed just this year. Also at play is the political legacy of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Mexico's often tumultuous relationship with the United States. WHO ARE THE CANDIDATES IN MEXICO'S PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION? Candidate Claudia Sheinbaum, the former mayor of Mexico City, has maintained a comfortable double-digit lead in polls for months. She promises to be a continuation of populist leader López Obrador and is backed by his ruling Morena party. Trained as a scientist, Sheinbaum has had to walk a fine line to carve out her own image while highlighting her connection to López Obrador, though she lacks the charisma that attracted many to her political ally. Candidate Xóchitl Gálvez, an opposition senator and tech entrepreneur, represents a coalition of parties that have had little historically to unite them other than their recent opposition to López Obrador. Gálvez is a fierce critic of the outgoing president who doesn't shy away from verbal sparring, but who hasn't appeared to ignite much fervor for her Strength and Heart for Mexico coalition. The third candidate is little-known Jorge Álvarez Máynez, a former federal congressman from the Citizen Movement party. He has focused on trying to scoop up the young vote, but has not gotten much traction. WHAT HAS PRESIDENT LÓPEZ OBRADOR MEANT FOR THIS ELECTION? Elected in 2018, López Obrador tapped into large swathes of the population like the working-class and poor, rural voters who had long felt forgotten by the political system. He made combatting corruption his top priority. Despite not being on the ballot, much of Sunday's election has revolved around him. Though he remains highly popular, López Obrador has shown himself to be intolerant of criticism and oversight. And his critics say his moves to attack the judiciary, slash funding to Mexico's electoral agency and expand the military's responsibilities in civilian life have eroded Mexican democracy. The opposition has responded with large protests. López Obrador is considered Sheinbaum's mentor and if she is elected, it would cement his legacy and show that his Morena party can survive beyond his presidency. WHEN ARE MEXICO'S ELECTIONS AND HOW DOES VOTING WORK? Parties selected their candidates well before the official start of campaigning for the presidential, congressional and municipal elections. On June 2, millions of voters will cast for their new leaders in a single round of voting. The winner of the highly anticipated presidential election will serve a six-year term. While most eyes are on the presidential race, Mexicans will also vote for 128 senators, 500 congressional representatives and for nearly 20,000 local government positions. WHY HAS THE CAMPAIGN CYCLE BEEN SO VIOLENT? Under López Obrador's \"hugs not bullets\" policy, which emphasizes addressing the societal root causes of violence, analysts say cartels and other criminal groups have expanded their control. Homicide rates have remained stubbornly high despite promises by López Obrador to ease the violence. López Obrador has in many cases refused to confront criminal groups, and activists say his government has tried to reduce the official count of Mexico's forcibly disappeared in the lead up to the election. Cartels and other criminal groups see elections – particularly local elections – as an opportunity to make power grabs. They've warred for turf and at least 145 people tied to politics have been slain by organized crime this year, according to tracking by the human rights organization Data Civica. Violence has been particularly severe in states where criminal groups are fighting for territory like Chiapas and Guerrero in the south, and Michoacan in central Mexico. MEXICO'S FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT Electing a female president would be a huge step in a country with soaring levels of gender-based violence and deep gender disparities. Mexico still has a famously intense \"machismo,\" or culture of male chauvinism, that has created large economic and social disparities in society. In its most extreme form, the misogyny is expressed in high rates of femicides, and things like acid attacks against women. Yet a historic number of women in the socially conservative country are taking up leadership and political roles. That's in part due to a decades-long push by authorities for greater representation in politics, including laws that require political parties to have half of their congressional candidates be women. Since 2018, Mexico's Congress has had a 50-50 gender split, and the number of female governors has shot up. Both frontrunner Sheinbaum and Gálvez have promised to address high rates of gender-based violence and gender disparities if they win. ___ Follow AP's Latin-America coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

        "description": "'I'm going to bomb you - not a love bomb this time, a real bomb.'",
        "content": "A grandma who split up with her 37-year-old husband is now a scam hunter and has revealed a conman threatened to send her a bomb. Iris Jones, 83, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, married Mohamed Ibrahim but says she was left thousands of pounds out of pocket by him. In a Facebook post written last week, she revealed she now hunts scam artists who fool women online. A man who claimed to be from the American air force working in Yemen got in contact with Iris. She said: ‘He asked me to send him £2,740 and I asked him how do I send it over? Just to tease him – I like to taunt them now. ‘It wasn’t ‘hi honey’, or anything like that, when I asked him what his favourite food was I expected him to say hamburger, or hotdogs or popcorn – but it was rice. ‘I called him something I can’t share online – and then he said “give me your location, I’m going to bomb you – not a love bomb this time, a real bomb”. ‘There must be a conveyer belt in these places where there are all these scammers and gold diggers who have all these women lined up and they pass you from pillar to post. ‘They don’t think of you as a person – you’re just a name.’ Since Iris has turned into a scam hunter she has offered tips as to how to spot scammers. She added: ‘Usually they send a very handsome picture of themselves, often working on an oil rig or in another country or in the army. ‘These pictures are not them – they are are pictures of genuine men and I think some of them know they are being used. ‘Also, a lot of the time they want to come off Facebook, or the dating app or Facebook dating site and then want to go onto WhatsApp because “it is more private”. ‘That is a red flag. ‘I am on scam alert and I would recommend it for people too as they tell you what to look out for. ‘Then there is the love bombing – after a couple of days of messaging they tell you they love you, and they are narcissists.

They married at a low-key ceremony in Cairo and celebrated with a KFC for their honeymoon. But it just wasn’t meant to be, as the pair split earlier in 2023.

Half term is here and the summer holidays is just on the horizon, so I wanted to share my one top tip for affordable days out with the family, one that has saved both my pocket and my sanity some days - it is a National Trust membership . In our house it is the gift that keeps on giving. Getting out, particularly in the warmer months, always helps to clear the cobwebs and offers the opportunity to make memories with the children, but it often becomes a costly exercise. Entry into most places nowadays is eye-wateringly expensive and once in, you’re sure to find many more ways to be parted with your cash, which means such outings can become reserved only for a ‘special occasion’. However, National Trust members have no such concerns and it’s much cheaper than many realise. If like me, you pay for your membership monthly, it is actually pretty affordable. Family membership including two adults and all of their children aged 17 and under costs £13.25 a month, and for single parent families, membership costs just £8.25 a month, admitting one adult with their children. Visit just one place a month and it’s more than paid for itself, visit more and you’re quids in. Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Hucknall Dispatch, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Membership offers unlimited free admission to over 200 historic houses and gardens in England , Wales and Northern Ireland so you could effectively go to one every day if you felt so compelled. Packing up a picnic rather than eating out will also save you a few quid and the outdoor spaces at National Trust properties always offer a scenic place to picnic. Over the holidays, most places also lay on some kind of added entertainment for kids including trails and fun activities. This May half term, whether you want to delve into history at a castle or historic house or discover nature at parks and gardens, there are plenty of events to encourage imaginations to run wild. For example, you can create butterfly art at Chirk Castle in Wrexham, take in a falconry display at Trerice in Cornwall or help Squirrel Holmes solve the nature clues at Lyveden in Northamptonshire. You could even give the wheel of destiny a whirl at Hughenden Manor in Buckinghamshire to become a new character – will you be the Victorian statesman Benjamin Disraeli, an ice house attendant or a woodland bodger?

What I love the most about our membership is when we’re all starting to get cabin fever this summer, and feel like we're about to climb the walls, we can just head out.

In our house it is the gift that keeps on giving. Getting out, particularly in the warmer months, always helps to clear the cobwebs and offers the opportunity to make memories with the children, but it often becomes a costly exercise.

Getting out, particularly in the warmer months, always helps to clear the cobwebs and offers the opportunity to make memories with the children, but it often becomes a costly exercise. Entry into most places nowadays is eye-wateringly expensive and once in, you’re sure to find many more ways to be parted with your cash, which means such outings can become reserved only for a ‘special occasion’. However, National Trust members have no such concerns and it’s much cheaper than many realise. If like me, you pay for your membership monthly, it is actually pretty affordable. Family membership including two adults and all of their children aged 17 and under costs £13.25 a month, and for single parent families, membership costs just £8.25 a month, admitting one adult with their children. Visit just one place a month and it’s more than paid for itself, visit more and you’re quids in. Did you know with a Digital subscription to Yorkshire Post, you can get access to all of our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. Membership offers unlimited free admission to over 200 historic houses and gardens in England , Wales and Northern Ireland so you could effectively go to one every day if you felt so compelled. Packing up a picnic rather than eating out will also save you a few quid and the outdoor spaces at National Trust properties always offer a scenic place to picnic. Over the holidays, most places also lay on some kind of added entertainment for kids including trails and fun activities. This May half term, whether you want to delve into history at a castle or historic house or discover nature at parks and gardens, there are plenty of events to encourage imaginations to run wild. For example, you can create butterfly art at Chirk Castle in Wrexham, take in a falconry display at Trerice in Cornwall or help Squirrel Holmes solve the nature clues at Lyveden in Northamptonshire. You could even give the wheel of destiny a whirl at Hughenden Manor in Buckinghamshire to become a new character – will you be the Victorian statesman Benjamin Disraeli, an ice house attendant or a woodland bodger? To search for half-term events near you, from storytelling and quests to family trails and historical costume demonstrations, visit the National Trust website where you can also join the NT gang ! What I love the most about our membership is when we’re all starting to get cabin fever this summer, and feel like we're about to climb the walls, we can just head out. And we get to choose from some of the most beautiful properties and gardens in the country - what better place to enjoy an impromptu sandwich on the lawn?",

Shah, addressing an election rally at Chandbali under the Bhadrak Lok Sabha constituency, also claimed that the saffron party is set to win 17 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats in Odisha. Also Read Villagers protest against rice mill over pollution 5 hours ago Chinks alleged in sensitive booths list 5 hours ago “Come June 4, and Naveen babu will no longer remain the chief minister, he will become the former CM... BJP is set to win 17 Lok Sabha seats and 75 Assembly constituencies in Odisha,” he said. Shah also said the BJP will ensure that the next chief minister is fluent in Odia, and understands the state’s language, culture and tradition. “Should a ‘Tamil babu’ run the government from behind the scene... By casting your vote in favour of the lotus symbol, bring a ‘jan sevak’ to rule the state in place of an officer,” he said, in an apparent reference to Patnaik’s close aide and BJD leader Kartik Pandian. Stating that lakhs of youths were migrating to other states in search of work, the home minister said: “Once the BJP forms government in Odisha, we will set up industries so that youths don’t have to look for jobs elsewhere.” He also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing free 5 kg of rice to the people of Odisha and criticised Patnaik for distributing the rice in jute bags with his photographs. “PM Modi’s government is ‘chawal wali sarkar’, while Naveen Patnaik’s government is ‘jhole wali sarkar’,” Shah added.

The veteran actor with an envious 49-year career in cinema was talking with Kaumudi movies as part of the promotion work of the movie when he cleared the air about not acting alongside actor Mohanlal for the past 13 years. Mohanlal and Maniyanpilla Raju are school friends and still carry the bonhomie. Maniyanpilla Raju: “It has been long 13 years since I shared the screen with Lal. We talk with each other daily and share jokes. But It hasn’t chanced upon me to ask for a role in his next films. There are friends among us who request Lal for roles in his next movie. Being Lal, it is normal for him to not turn anyone down and those people will be there in some roles in Lal's movies. But I believe that roles come to us if it is fit for us to perform. There is no point in pestering someone for roles. Just see for the fact that I am acting alongside Lal in Tharun Moorthy’s movie. A great role to play. See, these roles come to us, and I believe in destiny more than anything. “",

        "content": "When Yatinder, 17, applied for the Agnipath scheme last year, he was made fun of by his peers, who told him that he will retire before his father. Yatinder, oldest of five siblings, the youth from Balla area in Kangra says that he is at a loss as he has never thought of joining any other profession. His neighbour Suresh Sharma who appeared for the Agnipath exam in March this year said he did so half-heartedly. “I have been training and dreaming to join the forces, at this point, what else could I apply for?” he asks. Their concern found echo among the youths in the state where 42.3 per cent of boys said that they wanted to join the Army, as per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2023-Beyond Basics. Advertisement In fact, according to the central government data tabled in Parliament in February this year, one-fourth of the total soldiers selected from all over the country belong to this region – Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh . In the last round of recruitment held in 2019-2020 for the selection of jawans, of the total 78,629 candidates who made the cut, 18,798 were from the region. However, due to the suspension of the Indian Army’s enrollment drive for two years, around 37,000 youngsters from the region were deprived of their dream of donning the olive green, states the report. Rajesh Singh, a taxi driver and a resident of Dhaloom village near Yol Cantonment, said, “Agniveer is a big issue here. What will our children do when they return after four years? The BJP says that there is no resentment. But what will these youths do when they don’t have any job avenues after four years? Also, these children were preparing hard. They had no option but to sign up to become Agniveer”. The anti-Agnipath sentiments could be felt in many parts of the state with several Congress leaders attacking the BJP over it and the latter trying hard to defend itself. Advertisement Criticising the Centre’s Agnipath scheme, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said, “There is now less interest among the youth in serving the country (in the Army) because of the BJP’s scheme which is providing jobs only for four years.” Posing several questions to the BJP-led central government, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had on Friday asked that since the people of Himachal Pradesh have repeatedly voiced their opposition to the Agnipath scheme will Prime Minister Narendra Modi commit to scrapping the “ill-conceived” military recruitment programme? While Mandi is the biggest parliamentary constituency in terms of area, Kangra is the most populous among Himachal Pradesh’s four Lok Sabha constituencies. The cumulative number of people from Kangra serving in the Army or ex-servicemen is around 1 lakh. Making this his poll plank, Congress’ Kangra candidate Anand Sharma, who is fighting a Lok Sabha election for the first time, has termed the Agnipath scheme as an “insult” to the soldiers. Expecting to influence a considerable number of voters in the constituency, he also promised to abolish it if the Congress was voted to power, an assurance also given by other senior Congress leaders. Advertisement The BJP on its part has tried to turn the tide in their favour by not only elaborating on the benefits of the scheme but also by accusing the Congress of spreading lies. BJP’s Hamirpur candidate and Union Minister Anurag Thakur said that 25 per cent of the youth will remain permanently in the Army while reservation would be given for the remaining in central para military forces and state police, and there would be 100 per cent job guarantee for those becoming Agniveer. The issue has gained so much prominence that when Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Kangra on Sunday, the BJP got a video statement issued from him to allay the fears of the youths and soldiers regarding the scheme. He also alleged that the Congress was spreading lies regarding the scheme. Prof Ramesh K Chauhan, from the Department of Political Science at Himachal Pradesh University, says that in Kangra, every third family has someone in the Army. Advertisement “For the middle class population, the Army is a lucrative job option. The children just wait to complete class 12 and then take some physical training and then apply for the armed forces. A lot of youths from the rural belts also apply for the forces and join the lower ranks. For most, this is not just a job but also a matter of pride. With the Agnipath scheme, they will remain with the Army only for four years and then will be allotted other jobs. But that’s not what the youth wants here. If they wanted to be guards somewhere, they could have just worked with some private agencies,” says Chauhan, adding that even if the BJP pushes for the scheme, this is not going to work for long.",

        "description": "Chelsea will make Leicester City boss Enzo Maresca their new manager \"unless something crazy happens in the next 48 hours\", according to Fabrizio Romano.",
        "content": "Chelsea will make Leicester City boss Enzo Maresca their new manager “unless something crazy happens in the next 48 hours”, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano. The Blues made the decision to part ways with Mauricio Pochettino last week in a shock decision following a promising end to the campaign for Chelsea . Pochettino, who led Tottenham to the Champions League final in 2019, ended his spell in charge of Chelsea with five successive league wins, earning a Europa Conference League place for next season. That is an improvement of six places from their 12th-placed finish the season before, with Chelsea earning 19 more points under Pochettino. Speculation has been rife over the identity of their potential new boss with Leicester City’s Maresca now seemingly the top candidate to replace the Argentinian at Stamford Bridge. And now Romano insists that Chelsea will appoint Maresca – who got the Foxes promoted from the Championship at the first time of asking – unless “something crazy happens” and that the Italian “believes in the project” at the Premier League club. Romano wrote in his Caught Offside column : “Enzo Maresca will be the new Chelsea manager – unless something crazy happens in the next 48 hours. It will be a ‘here we go’ soon because the latest contacts between Maresca and Chelsea were super positive. “Maresca wants to go to Chelsea and never had any doubts despite some reports suggesting that maybe he wants to stay at Leicester. Although he loves and respects Leicester, it’s been very clear ever since Chelsea entered this story that Maresca wants to be the next Chelsea manager. “Maresca believes in the Chelsea project around young players with a big future, he thinks it is a really exciting project. Meanwhile, Chelsea are convinced he’s a super talented coach and that’s why he’s a name appreciated by both directors and owners, all convinced he can be the man for present and future. “Maresca’s obsession with ball possession, quality football, dominating the game, his knowledge of elite football despite being a young manager – all of this made the difference for Chelsea to pick him. “Talks are now really at the final stages, and it’s expected to happen soon. The salary is agreed and it’s just about the length of the contract. The feeling is that it could be a five-year contract, longer than they initially thought, and they are just discussing this final detail, but the feeling is that they are almost there. “What’s missing is just an agreement between Chelsea and Leicester on compensation, also for Maresca’s staff, but it’s just a matter of days or maybe even hours and then everything will be done for Maresca to become the new Chelsea manager. “So, that will be ‘here we go’ soon and then it will continue to be a busy summer at Chelsea. It won’t be completely crazy but they will try to make smart things happen, including a new goalkeeper and I expect them to try for at least one new centre-back, but it could be two. I also expect Chelsea to be busy with the striker position, and I mentioned many times Benjamin Sesko, who is highly rated at Chelsea but also by others like Arsenal and Manchester United.” MORE CHELSEA MESS COVERAGE ON F365... 👉 Five Chelsea players who should be delighted by the arrival of Enzo Maresca 👉 Maresca emerges as clear choice to replace sacked Pochettino at Chelsea 👉 Leverkusen sack Alonso, Chelsea press Mourinho button, Slot quits and other Managergeddon predictions Ipswich Town boss Kieran McKenna was linked with the Chelsea job before committing his future to the Tractor Boys. And now Romano has revealed that Chelsea “called” McKenna regarding the vacant manager role and informed him he was “no longer in the race”. Romano added: “It’s important to clarify another big story on managers as Chelsea called Kieran McKenna to inform him that he was no longer in the race to become their manager. He also had the possibility to go to Brighton but they wanted an answer early this week, while he also had the possibility to wait and see what happened at Manchester United, with the club still reviewing and discussing internally what to do about Erik ten Hag. “But now, McKenna has decided to commit his future to Ipswich Town. He’s going to extend his contract – everything is almost ready for him to sign a new deal, which will be an important one with big money involved. So, there are no fresh contacts with Chelsea because he’s been informed he’s no longer in the race, and he will stay at Ipswich. “Credits to Ipswich Town on this one – they’ve been waiting and hoping, offering him an important contract. McKenna has decided to accept after Chelsea told him with direct call that he was out of the shortlist to become the new manager. For Brighton, a decision will be made soon on an alternative to become their next manager.” READ NEXT: Ten Hag sack: 10 other managers who lost their jobs straight after winning trophies",

        "content": "ARE you a true foodie? There are 50 signs you know your stuff in the kitchen, from avoiding ready meals to doing your own recipes. Can you pronounce quinoa correctly? Have you any idea how to cook jackfruit? Know what is meant by to coddle something? If you think you can spot a Michelin-star meal when you eat one, why not put your money where your mouth is and give this quiz a try? It comes after research of 2,000 adults found 41 per cent are self-confessed foodies. Natalie Allen, spokesperson for salad brand Florette, which commissioned the research to launch its Gourmet Slaws range, said: “The term ‘foodie’ has been more widely used in recent years. “People make plans around which restaurants they are going to, often several weeks in advance and love to share their meals, recipes, reviews and general thoughts on food on social media platforms. “Cuisine brings so much joy. When we think of special occasions such as birthdays and weddings or even holidays, the majority of them have an enjoyment of food at the heart of them. “Dishes from around the world have progressively been integrated into our diet in the UK as we have become more inquisitive, experimental and so willing to try different and more “exotic” options.” The research also identified the 50 signs someone is a foodie – and they include the kitchen being a favourite room in the house and a tendency to plan holidays around cuisine. Knowing how to make pasta from scratch, actually using the cookbooks they own and having in excess of 30 spices in the cupboard. Owning a set of chef-worthy knives, obsessively reading food blogs, knowing where different cuts of meat come from, eating seasonal produce and hosting dinner parties are further traits. Along with a fondness for dining in Michelin-star restaurants, seeking out independent eateries, and attending food festivals. Of those polled, seven in 10 are passionate about supporting Britain’s food and drink industry. As a result, 58 per cent try to eat in independent restaurants where possible because the food tastes better (42 per cent) and for an authentic experience (36 per cent). It also emerged adults typically eat out twice a month, spending an average of £40 on food and drinks. When dining out, 55 per cent try new meals each time while 18 per cent stick to what they know and love. Similarly, six in 10 claim they are adventurous with food and 24 per cent are willing to travel hundreds of miles for the ‘perfect’ meal. For 34 per cent, eating out at high class restaurants is their idea of fun, while 45 per cent enjoy learning new things about ingredients and meals. While the best aspects of dining out were found to be the satisfaction of eating a good meal (25 per cent), not having to cook (24 per cent) and trying new foods (15 per cent). More than a fifth (23 per cent) even have a list of restaurants they’d like to visit, while 29 per cent have a wish list of countries to travel to specifically for the cuisine. When it comes to cooking, 41 per cent describe their ability as ‘average’, while 38 per cent claim it’s ‘good’ and seven per cent go as far as saying it’s ‘excellent’. But despite many believing they themselves are a foodie, the research, carried out through OnePoll, found 29 per cent dislike the term as it's pretentious (66 per cent) and elitist (18 per cent). Natalie Allen, spokesperson for Florette's Gourmet Slaws, which are inspired by flavours of Korea, China and India, added: “With summer fast approaching it’s likely social gatherings will revolve around food even more, from barbeques to al fresco lunches and late evening dining as the sun sets.” To take the quiz click here . 1.

        "description": "How an underground maze of abandoned steam pipes can save America's cities",
        "content": "Tucked beneath a 48-story San Francisco skyscraper, at the far end of the parking lot on the first subbasement level, is a door with a keypad lock. An unimposing sign reads \"Utility Meter Room.\" Behind the door is a tangled clot of pipes: yellow, blue, and orange, each one as wide as a 100-pound barbell plate. The pipes — along with thousands more just like them, winding their way under more than 600 American cities, campuses, hospitals, and airports — are more than a blast from our industrial past. They're a steampunk vision of the future. I've come to 345 California Center, a postmodern hexagon that towers over San Francisco's financial district, to get a look at the hottest new idea for how to break the urban doom loop — the post-pandemic, remote-work apocalypse that is hollowing out America's cities. And when I say \"hottest,\" I don't mean it metaphorically. It's like a sauna down here. Because the Utility Meter Room doesn't run on a self-contained, industrial-sized boiler, like most big buildings. Instead, it's drawing a feed of blistering, high-pressure, vaporized water from a century-old loop of steam pipes that runs beneath the city's streets. The steam loops are a relic of the 19th century, as forgotten as the pneumatic tubes that used to shoot mail all over American cities. But unlike the pneumatic tubes, the steam loops are still there — and they can provide enough heat to keep a building like 345 California Center nice and toasty, even on the coldest of days. The steam loops are part of an antiquated system known as \" district energy .\" It was basically a shared-services model: a utility would make steam at a central location and then pipe it out to every building in the city. Nobody had to provide their own heat — it was way more convenient, and cheaper, to get it from a common source. But then cities began to abandon district energy. Buildings, businesses, and homes started making their own hot water in boilers fueled by coal, then oil, then natural gas. Sometimes it was cheaper, and maybe it was more convenient. But it also set the planet on fire. More heating meant more greenhouse gases, and more global warming . Which brings me back to our steampunk future. Today, cities are starting to price the looming climate catastrophe into their energy costs. Starting this year, commercial buildings in New York City will be slapped with steep fines if they're emitting too much carbon. Boston and Washington have similar \"decarbonization\" laws in place, and San Francisco isn't allowing natural gas in any new construction. That means businesses need to find a cleaner, cheaper source of heat. And those ancient steam loops beneath the streets are starting to seem like a ready-made solution. \"The real benefit of a district-energy system, especially in cities, is the distribution system,\" says Kevin Hagerty, the CEO of Vicinity Energy. \"If a city wants to decarbonize, and they have a district-energy system, it's much easier. They don't have to change things on a building-by-building basis.\" In July, Vicinity is installing what will be the nation's first zero-carbon urban steam loop. Drawing electricity from the increasingly decarbonized New England grid, powered by solar and offshore wind, the utility will use the energy to boil water and then deliver steam directly to Boston office buildings and restaurants and storefronts through the city's antiquated maze of pipes. It's a remnant of the Industrial Revolution being used to forestall a lethal climate evolution. District energy could also be a godsend to businesses struggling to survive the current landscape of empty offices and boarded-up shops. By taking steam right out of the street beneath them, commercial landlords can pay less for their utilities and avoid carbon fines — which means they can lower their rents and hold on to tenants who might otherwise bail. District-energy loops also eliminate the need for boilers and other cumbersome building infrastructure, freeing up space for tenant-grabbing amenities like gyms, roof-decks, and golf simulators. (Yep. That's a real thing.) The other choice? Spend thousands to upgrade a building's energy systems — cash that landlords don't have on hand, and an expense they can't pass along to tenants. \"If you're a building owner, district energy allows you to pay a small premium on your service to get that type of steam,\" says Blake Ellis, a principal at the engineering firm Burns & McDonnell. \"Then you don't have that big capital outlay you probably don't want right now .\" Especially if, as in many downtowns, your building is only 70% occupied. About a third of the cost of running a commercial building is energy. And according to one major study, a building as energy-efficient as 345 California Center can charge 20% more for rent than a comparable, inefficient building. Every dollar saved in energy costs, the study found, equates to 3.5% higher rent. And it's a lot easier to be energy efficient if all you have to do is plug into a carbon-free steam loop. \"This building is 40 years old,\" Tim Danz, the chief engineer for 345 Cal, tells me. \"But we're using the latest technology to manage our energy.\" He points to the gnarl of pipes that shoots the steam up to the 36th floor, where it's used to cook a water supply large enough to heat the entire building. Having a boiler, Danz explains, \"would be another system we would have to provide care and feeding for.\" District energy, by contrast, is just there for the taking, right beneath our feet. The most convincing evidence that steam loops make economic sense comes from who's getting into the district-energy game. Vicinity, the nation's biggest clean-steam provider, is owned by Antin Infrastructure Partners, a leading private-equity firm. Cordia, an energy provider operating in 10 cities, is partially owned by the private-equity giant KKR. Everyone needs heat — which makes it a highly bankable investment. \"These private-equity funds come in and find areas where they can put capital into a business and get a nice steady rate of return,\" Hagerty says. \"Decarbonizing takes capital, and private equity is a great source of capital.\" In the long run, of course, private equity may decide to do what it always does and load up these new energy businesses with massive amounts of debt before dismantling them for parts. But for now, the big money sees big profits to be made from America's forgotten infrastructure . Outside of places like airports and college campuses, the idea of district energy fell out of favor long ago. We let the systems go fallow — but fortunately, all the accumulated infrastructure we buried on top of the old steam loops made it impossible to dig their little-used pipes out of the ground. So the whole thing was still down there, waiting, when COVID drove millions of city dwellers to head for the countryside. Now, by drawing heat from their old steam loops, America's cities have an opportunity to jump-start all the downtown commerce that was crippled by the pandemic. And it could happen all over the place! Dozens and dozens of cities have steam loops they can use, from New York and Chicago to Miami to San Diego and Portland and Milwaukee. What's more, lots of companies these days are looking for greener buildings, both to save money and to burnish their environmental bona fides. From AI startups to biotech companies, steampunk-heated buildings could become the cool new place to be. \"Forward-minded companies want to be in a building that doesn't have any on-site fossil-fuel combustion,\" says Costa Samaras, the director of the Scott Institute for Energy and Innovation at Carnegie Mellon. \"The best, greenest buildings will be net-zero buildings. They'll be considered a premium asset. The challenge is, are we going to get enough premium assets in time?\" Meaning: Can we use steam loops to fix the urban doom loop before the climate doom loop dooms us all?

        "description": "Leicester City boss Enzo Maresca is a frontrunner for the Chelsea job and has previous experience winning at Stamford Bridge - despite having never managed in the Premier League",
        "content": "Chelsea managerial candidate Enzo Maresca has already toppled the Blues despite not having managed in England's top flight. The Leicester City manager is believed to be in discussions with Chelsea about taking over the reins at Stamford Bridge. The west Londoners are currently without a manager following Mauricio Pochettino's mutual agreement to leave , while Maresca's reputation is on the rise after leading the Foxes back to the Premier League as Championship winners. And it's nearly five years since Maresca, 44, orchestrated a surprise 1-0 win for West Ham while serving as assistant coach to Manuel Pellegrini. The Chilean was under scrutiny with the Hammers leading up to Christmas 2019 but bought himself some time by upsetting the Blues on their home turf - although the victory wasn't entirely his doing. It later came to light that Maresca was the brains behind their tactics in west London that day in November 2019, according to The Guardian (via football.london ). Aaron Cresswell netted the only goal of the match to keep West Ham just above the relegation zone at the time, though it only postponed Pellegrini's exit by one month. Watch Champions League, Europa League & Conference League finals with TNT Sports Chelsea offer contract to Premier League star in surprise move to replace Thiago Silva The Hammers nailed their strategy and restricted Chelsea's strengths through the middle after Maresca was said to have taken over training in the lead-up to the game. It was executed to perfection and ended West Ham's 17-year wait for a win at the Bridge. Pellegrini's decision to defer responsibility to his assistant that week paid dividends, and the South American may have staved off the sack even longer had he repeated the tactic. However, Pellegrini was eventually fired in December 2019 after restoring his usual methods to no effect, and Maresca followed him out of the West Ham exit. Fast-forward to today and Maresca could be the man to take over from Pochettino this summer as he makes the step up to Premier League level. The Italian took over at the King Power Stadium in June 2023 and guided Leicester back up at the first time of asking, winning four Championship Manager of the Month awards along the way. Maresca served as Manuel Pellgrini's assistant at West Ham before both left in December 2019 ( Image: Arfa Griffiths/West Ham United FC via Getty Images) The former Juventus and West Brom midfielder's only previous senior management role was a six-month spell at Parma, which ended in disappointment after he won just four of his 14 games in charge. He then returned to Manchester City as one of Pep Guardiola's assistants, having previously worked at the club as manager of the elite development squad. Chelsea, having been impressed by the candidate's journey back to the Premier League, have seemingly decided they'd rather have Maresca on their side than against them. And it could prove to be a gamble worth taking considering his history at Stamford Bridge. DON'T SCRAP REPLAYS! Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!

        "content": "Testimony continues Tuesday in the murder trial of Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman accused of hitting her boyfriend with an SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm. Read, 44, of Mansfield, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and other charges. The prosecution says she hit her boyfriend, John O'Keefe , with her black SUV outside of a home at 34 Fairview Road in Canton during a snowstorm on Jan. 29, 2022, following a night of drinking . Her defense plans to argue that someone else is responsible for killing O'Keefe. The defense is set to continue its cross-examination of ATF Agent Brian Higgins, one of three men Read's defense lawyers have implicated in O'Keefe's death. On Friday, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally asked about flirty text messages, which were exchanged a few weeks before O'Keefe died. \"You're, hot,\" Read wrote to Higgins in one of the messages. \"Are you serious or messing with me?\" Higgins replied. \"No, I'm serious,\" Read wrote. \"Feeling is mutual. Is that bad? How long have you thought that?\" Higgins asks.

trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence Higgins testified that one day when he was leaving O'Keefe's house, Read \"planted a kiss on me. Not like a friend,\" adding that he interpreted it as romantic. In another exchange, Higgins read a message from Read in which she invited him to her house. \"I'm glad you came over tonight,\" Read later texts. Higgins said he asked Read in one message if she and O’Keefe were breaking up, to which Read replied, “I don’t know. He hooked up (with) another girl on vacation.” Read eventually went over Higgins house, where the pair continued to discuss their interactions, Higgins testified. \"I am not proud of these text messages. It is what it is. I take responsibility for them,\" Higgins told the court. \"John was a friend at the same time. If they were at the end of their relationship, they were at the end of their relationship. But I was not going to have someone utilize me, weaponize me against someone I liked.\" Defense attorney Alan Jackson started his cross-examination Friday by questioning Higgins about his \"romantic interest\" in Read. \"I was physically attracted to her, yes,\" Higgins said. Higgins was cross-examined by Jackson about his phone records and movements within the Canton Police Department. Jackson sought to imply that Higgins had conversations with Brian Albert hours before O'Keefe's body was found and suggest that Higgins had access to Read's SUV and other evidence. Prosecutors are trying to show that Read’s actions were intentional. Read's lawyers have alleged there was a cover-up involving members of several law enforcement agencies. They say O’Keefe was beaten by someone else inside the home, bitten by a dog and then left outside. They argued investigators focused on Read because she was a \"convenient outsider,\" and that prevented them from considering other suspects. The defense is trying to convince the jury that O'Keefe was beaten and argues that Colin Albert had been in a fight. Albert said the injury came when he fell in a driveway and that he never saw O'Keefe on the night in question. He was in high school at the time, but previously testified that he was drinking beer at a friend's house before going to 34 Fairview Road to celebrate his cousin's birthday. Albert is the nephew of the couple that owned the Canton property where O'Keefe was found in January 2022. He also confirmed on cross-examination that he has known the lead state police investigator in this case, Trooper Michael Proctor, since he was a child. Another man that the defense has tried to implicate in the death is ATF Agent Brian Higgins, who testified about a \"romantic\" encounter and series of text messages he exchanged with Read. In those flirty messages, Read told him that O'Keefe had \"hooked up\" with another woman during a vacation. The trial's first few days detailed the futile efforts of first responders to save O'Keefe. They found him face up when they arrived just before dawn on Jan. 29. He was pronounced dead at the hospital, and an autopsy later found he died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma. Several of the first responders said they heard Read make statements, including, \"I hit him,\" after O'Keefe was found. Defense attorneys confronted several of those witnesses by asking why those alleged remarks were not included in official reports. Officers also testified about unusual procedures used during the investigation, including the decision to collect bloody snow in red plastic cups and clearing snow from the crime scene.",

        "content": "Older voters have been promised an even bigger guarantee of their income, with the ‘triple lock plus’ coming in if the Tories stay in power. It sounds like a complicated contraption making it very hard to open a door, but it’s a metaphor meaning state pensions will keep their value in real terms, no matter what is happening in the economy . The ‘triple lock’ was introduced in 2010 , when the Tory/Lib Dem coalition came to power, and means that the annual increase in state pension will be based on whichever is highest of three values: inflation, the average increase in UK wages, or 2.5% at minimum. Unsurprisingly popular with pensioners, the policy has nonetheless been criticised by others who say it is unsustainable with an ageing population. Rishi Sunak now plans to beef it up even further with an added promise that pensioners will get to keep more of their income than other age groups before it is taxed. He said he would increase the personal allowance for those of pension age, while keeping it frozen for working-age adults, meaning that the full state pension would not risk falling into tax no matter how much it went up.

The personal allowance of income earned tax-free is the first £12,570 as standard for everyone, except those earning over £125,140 who aren’t entitled to it. Currently, the full state pension is £11,502 a year, so approaching the taxable level if it kept on increasing while personal allowance remained frozen. Rishi Sunak said that if he wins the General Election on July 4, personal allowance would also rise by the triple-lock tests, for pensioners only. So their tax-free earnings allowance would increase by at least 2.5% each year, and possibly much more, always keeping pace with pensions. While some dubbed this the ‘quadruple lock’, the government settled on ‘triple lock plus’. It’s a bit of a mouthful especially if you weren’t even sure about the original triple lock, but you can expect to hear that term a lot more over the coming weeks. The policy would amount to a tax break of £95 in 2025-26, rising to £275 in 2029-30. By 2029/2030, it would cost £2.4 billion a year and the government said it would be funded through clamping down on tax dodgers – the same pot of money which will help pay for mandatory National Service for teenagers , another flagship Tory election policy. Under the Conservatives, the State Pension had risen by Â£3,700 – and is increasing another Â£900 this year. We introduced the Triple Lock. Now weâre introducing the Triple Lock Plus ð https://t.co/KMc01VYNRc It means a guarantee in legislation that the pensioners’ personal allowance will always be higher than the level of the new state pension. But Labour said it was a ‘desperate move’ from a party which was ‘torching’ what was left of its claims to economic credibility, and they wouldn’t be offering it themselves. Positioning himself as financially responsible, Keir Starmer had a boost this morning as dozens of business leaders signed an open letter endorsing the party’s economic plans. Announcing the pensions policy, Mr Sunak said: ‘Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. ‘This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.’ It is a regular payment from the government which most people can claim when they reach a certain age: currently 66 years old for both men and women. Not everyone gets the same amount, as how much you get depends on your National Insurance contributions while working. The full amount is currently £221.20 per week under the system from 2016. Many pensioners will also rely on income from other sources, such as private workplace pensions. But Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson pointed out that about half the cost of the plan was from not imposing three more years of frozen personal allowances on pensioners. Tory MP says voters should back Reform UK candidate for her seat at General Election I have voted for Labour in every single election since I was 18 – until now What Shrek tells us about the different way the Tories and Labour use TikTok Full list of conservative MPs stepping down ahead of the General Election ‘So the £100 “saving” next year is mostly just avoiding a £100 tax increase, rather than an actual giveaway.’ And Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the ‘biggest beneficiaries of another tax system complication will largely be better-off pensioner households’. Meanwhile, Sam Bidwell of free market think tank the Adam Smith Institute said: ‘The state pension could be financially unsustainable as soon as 2035, a worrying trend which this policy will only exacerbate. Customers say you'll feel 'fresh out of the womb' with this skin foam ‘At a time when working-age people are being squeezed by higher taxes and the cost of living, tax cuts should focus on making work pay, rather than being given to every single pensioner, even those who are millionaires.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk .

        "content": "El mundo da miedo. En las pantallas y en la prensa solo vemos el horror de Gaza y de Ucrania . Pero existen 52 conflictos abiertos , entre ellos guerras olvidadas como la de Siria, Somalia y tantas otras . Sumemos a eso la tensión en muchos países por la polarización política , desde Estados Unidos a España ; y el ascenso inquietante de la extrema derecha , en casi todas las latitudes, elección tras elección. Deberíamos añadir a esa preocupante percepción, los conflictos diplomáticos tradicionales , más los que azuzan personajes como el presidente argentino Javier Milei, al que el periodista Fernando Onega propone modificar levemente su apellido para escribir MiLey . Su ley es la de la motosierra de derechos, de educación, respeto y también de la palabra como poderosa arma de diálogo y consenso. Ante ese frente abierto de despropósitos , conviene atrincherarse en la “diplomacia blanda” porque “solo con cooperación institucional es posible preservar la democracia . La cooperación es imprescindible en estos tiempos donde se grita más que se habla ”, afirmó Susana Malcorra, ex ministra argentina de Exteriores y ex jefa de Gabinete del secretario general de la ONU, Ban Ki-moon. Hablaba en el Foro Next Educación con motivo del 75 aniversario de la Organización de los Estados Americanos, la OEI , un organismo de gran relevancia e influencia pero bastante desconocido. Su secretario general, Mariano Jabonero, advierte de “una cierta fatiga democrática: la democracia debe cuidarse porque no hay libertad sin igualdad”. Con más de 650 proyectos anuales y siete mil empleados en Iberoamérica, Portugal y España, “la OEI juega un papel vital como elemento vertebrador de la cooperación internacional” , afirma Jabonero , obteniendo más reconocimiento fuera que dentro de España, porque su acción es básicamente exterior. En ese Foro, la profesora Érika Rodriguez Pinzón, directora de la Fundación Carolina , planteó que “el desafío es cómo no dejamos perder las instituciones, porque recordemos que solo un tercio de la población mundial vive en democracia ”. Tomemos nota. Y el epicentro de todo es, para la OEI, la educación . Formando a cientos de miles de profesores en matemáticas, por ejemplo, se hace una aportación neta a la calidad de la educación. Muy destacable también el trabajo para contener la brecha formativa generada por el azote del Covid que supuso, para millones de niños en Iberoamérica la pérdida de dos cursos y un retraso muy difícil de recuperar. Los empleados de la OEI se volcaron para contener esa brecha que se abría bajo los pies de los escolares americanos. En una escuela con poca digitalización y muy deficiente acceso a Internet, la diferencia de clase social se reflejó más que nunca en los niveles de formación, en sus avances y retrocesos. “La educación tiene un papel protector de la infancia. En muchos territorios les da conocimientos, los alimenta y los protege de grupos armados”, planteó Érika Rodriguez Pinzón. Porque donde hay escuela, hay civilización . Si cierra una escuela rural en España, viene el silencio y el pueblo se apaga. Pero en muchas zonas del mundo ese territorio vacío lo ocupan personajes indeseables. Otra línea de conversación muy interesante es la que abrió Mariano Jabonero: “En España, el informe PISA advierte que donde hay más escuelas rurales, el nivel medio es más alto”. “Necesitamos más instituciones para tender puentes y crear visiones compartidas y consensos”, concluyó Susana Malcorra quien felicitó a la OEI en su 75 aniversario, reconociéndole públicamente su altísimo valor, algo que en España nunca se ha hecho.",

        "content": "Attorney-general of the federation (AGF) and minister of justice, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), has called on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Judicial Council to initiate a reform-oriented review of the practice and procedure of the ECOWAS Court of Justice to avoid conflicts with national courts. He said the review should make the court realise its envisioned potential as a respectable regional court. Fagbemi, who addressed the opening ceremony of the Statutory Meeting of the ECOWAS Judicial Council in Abuja, said the council should also provide a credible network for the promotion of uniform rules of practice and procedure in the administration of justice in order to reduce conflict of laws in the region. He said the ECOWAS Judicial Council stands in a proper position to work towards the promotion of rule of law and democratic governance, which have come under intense pressure in recent times. According to Fagbemi, as the ECOWAS bloc continues to work towards achieving uniform economic policies and institutions, the judiciary should not be left behind. He said the challenges confronting the judiciary or the justice system in general across the West African states are identical in terms of judicial autonomy, provision of funding and infrastructural facilities for the courts, among others. In the same vein, he said member states also share the challenges confronting the region in terms of economy, migration, integration, insecurity, enforcement of fundamental rights. The AGF enjoined the ECOWAS Judicial Council to utilise the regional platform, as an avenue for peer review and cross-fertilization of ideas, to address the issues in order to achieve greater independence of the judiciary and a more prosperous and safer sub-region. Earlier, the chairman of the ECOWAS Judicial Council and the chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, said the council is working towards ensuring a just and equitable society. He charged member states to work towards safeguarding the principles of justice, upholding the rule of law, and advancing the cause of peace and prosperity. In his speech, the president of the Community Court of Justice, Eward Amoako Asante, restated the commitment of ECOWAS Judicial Council to upholding the principles of justice, equity and the rule of law within the ECOWAS Community. Since its inception, he said, the ECOWAS Court has served as a beacon of hope for the people of West Africa, providing a platform for the resolution of disputes and the protection and enforcement of fundamental rights.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 — Malaysia can become the key hub to supply power chips to electric vehicle (EV) cars, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said. He said the power chips are key in energy transition and decarbonisation technologies. For instance, EVs contain over 3,000 chips, two to five times that of internal combustion engine vehicles, he said. “Through Malaysia’s New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) and the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), we already have the right policy enablers and incentives for companies wishing to manufacture them here,” he said in his speech at Semicon South-east Asia 2024 conference here, today. Moreover, Anwar said the government aims to have 40 per cent of Malaysia’s primary energy mix from renewable sources by 2035. This initiative aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 10 million tonnes annually and achieve 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050. “The government supports exploring new technologies like green hydrogen, nuclear technology, and large-scale energy storage to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and meet the targets of the 2016 Paris Accord,” he said. Starting this September, third-party access (TPA) will be allowed in the national electricity supply industry, enabling other parties to supply energy using Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s transmission lines, reflecting high foreign investor interest in Malaysia, he added. — Bernama",

        "content": "A Brit dad allegedly killed a Russian paedophile with a single punch after saying he wanted to have sex with his underage daughter. The 34-year-old Brit dad is alleged to have fatally hit the Russian tourist, 36, after he made sexual advances towards his 15-year-old daughter at a pool party in Pattaya, Thailand, on May 27. The Russian reportedly told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, which led the Brit dad to punch him in the face. In the scuffle, the Russian landed headfirst on the ground and he was rushed to a hospital in the city. He later died from his injuries. Police in Pattaya launched a manhunt shortly afterward and collected video footage and witness statements in a bid to track the Brit down. Pattaya officers said they had identified the alleged attacker as a British national and issued an arrest warrant on the charges of \"causing grievous bodily harm resulting in death.\" The Brit reportedly remains in police custody following the attack ( Image: AsiaPacificPress via ViralPress) According to the Pattaya Mail, the dad - understood to be from Wales - was found in a guesthouse in Na Jomtien, about six miles away from where the fatal attack took place. He was arrested and brought into the Pattaya City Police Station for questioning. \"I did not think my punch would lead to the man's death,\" the Brit allegedly told Thai police. \"I regret my actions.\" The Brit's Thai wife, 28, said she had attended the party but that she had left early in order to go to work. She then claimed to have received a text from her husband at 3am saying he wanted to go home. Police tacked down the Brit at a guesthouse six miles away from where the fatal attack happened ( Image: AsiaPacificPress via ViralPress) \"I returned to the villa and found him walking along the street, so I took him back inside,\" she said, according to MailOnline . \"When I asked him what happened, he told me that while they were drinking, the Russian man started to sexually harass our daughter, even though his own wife was also there at the party. \"The harassment escalated until the man finally propositioned our daughter. This angered my husband so he punched him once and knocked him out.\" The British dad is understood to remain in police custody. Pattaya is a major tourist destination in Thailand and welcomes millions of visitors from across the world each year.",

        "content": "The Biden administration has asked courts to keep documents relating to Prince Harry's visa application secret, as the Duke of Sussex reportedly finds himself in a dangerous position. The controversy surrounding Prince Harry's visa application continues to stir as he becomes \"caught in the crosshairs\" with the Biden administration urging courts to keep documents related to his case under wraps. Prince Harry's residency status in the US, where he has resided with his wife Meghan Markle since 2020, is potentially at risk following a lawsuit by the Heritage Foundation, which is calling for the disclosure of his visa details. This follows revelations in his tell all memoir, Spare about past drug use including marijuana and cocaine. The conservative think tank is challenging whether he was truthful on his visa forms or received preferential treatment as such admissions typically affect eligibility for entry into the US. The Department of Homeland Security is maintaining that such information should be kept secret, asserting that it will remain undisclosed during President Biden's tenure, the Express reports. TalkTV's Royal correspondent Rupert Bell commented: \"Prince Harry has found himself in the crosshairs again.

        "content": "Ever since coming into the NBA last year, Victor Wembanyama has silenced his doubters with all kinds of magnificent displays. However, the youngster’s desire to prove his worth has always carried the risk of going too far. And sure enough, one such instance occurred recently when the San Antonio Spurs star called out one of his trolls for doubting his capabilities. The situation circled a 187-week-old Instagram post by an account , highlighting the prowess of a 16-year-old Wemby. At that time, a different fan had raised question marks over the then teenager’s ability in the comments, stating, “He not gone do none of that in the NBA”. Evidently, it caught the eyes of the Spurs rookie at least a few days ago, prompting him to hit back at the doubter, declaring, “Why not?”. This hilarious instance caught the eyes of the NBA followers. Consequently, a fan account named YKB uploaded a screenshot of the exchange on X (formerly Twitter), with the caption, “Wemby cooked that man”. This yet again provided a glimpse into his competitive mindset as a youngster. After turning the heads of the critics with his on-court displays, Wemby is now likely on a mission to ensure the same with his off-court antics. So, the 20-year-old probably didn’t think much of it while responding to a comment that is over three years old. Additionally, during those years, the Frenchman didn’t have a CV to highlight his worth to the world. This is likely why, he chose to remain level-headed back in those times, focusing entirely on the craft. But now, the tables have turned. Victor Wembanyama can now back his words with actions Shortly after entering the NBA, his high ceiling as a basketball player became evident to the world. After initially struggling a bit to adapt to the conditions of the league, the rookie rose through the ranks quickly. As a result, by the end of the regular season, Wemby won over his doubters while injecting fear into the hearts of his opponents. His impressive rookie season stat line reflected precisely this. Despite averaging just 29.7 minutes on the court, the Spurs star recorded 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.2 steals, and 3.6 blocks per game. These majestic displays also earned him the 2024 ROTY accolade while keeping him in the conversation for the DPOY award throughout the campaign. These achievements hint at how Wemby will remain one of the frontrunners to become the face of the NBA in the coming years. After all, considering how brilliant his performances are already, that day may not be too far in the future.",

        "content": "Lily Allen uses a kids’ phone to reduce the time spent on social media – and it’s something you can do too. The British singer and actor revealed in an interview with the Sunday Times , that she and her husband, David Harbour , use a system on their phone called Pinwheel that has no browsing capability and no social media , but has other apps such as Uber and Spotify. She explains that smartphones have ‘destroyed’ humanity ‘as a species’ and says the devices have had a grievous impact on her creativity. She said: ‘The creative side of my brain has been ruined by smartphones. ‘I feel like everyone feels the same. I don’t know anyone who can possibly say that the quality of their life is improved by the presence of a smartphone. ‘I think it’s destroyed us as a species. It’s horrendous that they’re designed to be so addictive. Some of us have more addictive personalities than others. It’s evil.’ Previously in 2019, Lily Allen announced that she is giving up her smartphone because she spends seven hours a day looking at it. In a live video at the time, the 39-year-old said: ‘I’m done with this dead a**e app and Twitter and email and WhatsApp. All of it can go and suck its mum’s... I just wanted to let you know that. ‘I care about the world and I care about creating things and I don’t really care about the validation that comes back any more.’ Ms Allen uses an operating system attached to certain smartphones called Pinwheel, which allows users to have the functions of a smartphone but without the internet or social media. So if you’re looking to follow in Lily Allen’s steps, there are a few basic phones you should consider. The Light Phone is a minimal phone that also does not have social media or a browser, but does have maps and podcasts and it can hotspot. This is a great alternative if you’re looking for a way to ween yourself off using social media without letting go of all the practical functions a smartphone has. To use the phone in the UK, you would need the international version, which is compatible with carriers Vodafone, 3, and Giff Gaff. The Light phone requires a nano SIM card, which is the same size an iPhone uses. The international Light Phone is available to buy in the UK, and will cost £235, or it can be bought on eBay. The Pinwheel phone is a real smartphone that has Pinwheel OS installed which allows parents or caregivers to control what is on the phone. It is not an app, but an operating system that disables social media and internet browsers to allow certain apps to feature on the phone. Going back to basics, but miss the practical keyboard of a smartphone? You may want to try the Blackberry at a cool £25 on eBay. Taking it back to the late 2000s, the Blackberry is a great choice that has standard features, but with limited apps. However, it should be noted that the Blackberry uses a mini SIM, which is bigger than the nano SIM cards used by Apple. This phone also allows you to browse the web and check your emails, but mindlessly scrolling on your feed may be a bit more difficult. If you’re ready to go completely cold turkey, you may want to consider a Doro 2404 at around £50. Its large screen with 90s buttons means it’s great for those who are partially-sighted or just prone to forgetting glasses, or if you’re just tired of the smaller keyboards on some smartphones. The flip phone is created for senior citizens, but has all the basics you’re looking for, such as calls, texting, weather, and even a camera, plus FM radio, a calculator, and games. However, it should be noted these phone needs a micro SIM card. This will be a massive change from using an iPhone but is way more sturdy than an one too. If you’re looking for that satisfying slam that you can only get with a flip phone, but want something more stylish than the Doro, you might want to consider the Motorola RAZR, available on eBay for as little as £50? This phone is an echo of those teenage days where having a phone was cool – but it also allows you to take a little breather from social media without compromising on style. The phone requires a mini SIM card to run, which is slightly bigger those ones used in iPhones. Simple. Elegant. Understated. If you’re looking for something that just allows the basics, and can be droppedwithout too much damage, this phone is going for as cheap as £15.99 on eBay. What more is there to say – other than it also takes a mini SIM. With a tagline of ‘designed to be used less’, the Boring Phone 2 can be set up to have no internet browser, social media, mobile games or application store. Getting a tattoo could trigger blood cancer Major outage leaves thousands of customers unable to access banking app Cases of most deadly skin cancer soar to an all-time high Innocent woman branded a thief by AI facial recognition software However, it can have data messaging, voice and video calling which means you don’t need to give up the smart from a smartphone. However, this phone is not yet available, and is currently on a waitlist, which may be a good way to weigh up your options in whether you’re ready to give up your phone as it is now. The Nokia 3310 is not quite a brick phone, but still lasts (almost) forever. It comes in four vibrant shades and is a fun alternative to a smartphone, while still expressing your individuality. The phone can do the basics, includes retro games like Snake, and requires a micro SIM to work. Available now for £59.99, it’s just the product to try if you want to ditch a smartphone.

        "content": "May 28 2024 For the second consecutive year, the Middle East is the fastest-growing real-time payments market globally, according to the 2024 Prime Time for Real-Time report, published by ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ: ACIW), a global leader in mission-critical, real-time payments software, in partnership with GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company. In the Middle East, real-time payments are swiftly emerging as a bedrock of modern economies. With governments in the region implementing real-time payment schemes, businesses and consumers are experiencing tangible benefits, propelling the region into a new era of financial transformation and opportunity. The region saw a remarkable YoY growth of 33.6% in 2023 with 855 million real-time payment transactions, which is projected to grow to 3 billion by 2028, a 2023-2028 CAGR of 28.8%. Last year marked a significant milestone as Oman, Kuwait and Qatar each launched their national real-time payment schemes, joining the more established regional players such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE. With all six GCC member states now running real-time payment programs, transaction value in the Middle East is projected to rise from US$230 billion in 2023 to US$903 billion by 2028. Bahrain is one of the most developed payment markets in the Middle East, with real-time payments accounting for nearly 50% of the total payment volume in the country and the majority of all electronic payments. “Real-time payments eliminate payment friction, inject greater liquidity into the system, and promote economic growth and financial inclusion. Yet, their full potential can only be realized when banks transcend legacy silo systems. With real-time payment schemes now operational in every GCC nation, local banks are at a pivotal juncture where they must harness technological evolution as the catalyst for innovation. The path to innovation lies in modernizing and future-proofing their infrastructure, enabling them to fully leverage the potential of real-time payments,” said Santhosh Rao, Senior Vice President, Sales at ACI Worldwide MEASA. The surge in real-time and electronic payments signals the Middle East’s determined shift towards a cashless economy. In 2023, electronic transactions dominated, comprising over 50% of all transactions in the region and a staggering 95% of the transaction value. Notably, real-time payments accounted for 12% of the region’s electronic transactions last year, a figure set to soar to 22% by 2028, outpacing Europe and North America. The ACI report paints a compelling vision of a cashless economy — by 2028, cash-based transactions will dwindle to a mere 3% of all transaction value in the region. Drawing on the insights gained from the report’s analysis of factors driving the success of real-time payments in the countries that currently lead global adoption, Rao said, “Active collaboration is the cornerstone of a thriving real-time payment ecosystem, fostering an environment where banks must navigate a delicate balance of competition and cooperation with emerging market players. The world’s most successful real-time payment schemes, exemplified by India’s achievements, showcase a myriad of real-time payment methods via QR codes, mobile apps, or online accounts, pushing the boundaries of innovative use cases. With the Middle East leading the world in real-time payments growth, financial institutions should seize the opportunity to carefully study these successes and extract valuable insights to inspire the launch of their own pioneering real-time payment solutions.” Santhosh Rao ACI Worldwide ACI Worldwide News News Fintech News News",

        "description": "DALAM berbagai diskusi mengenai investasi sumber daya manusia, seringkali anak usia dini kurang disinggung dibandingkan kelompok usia lainnya. Padahal, periode usia lima tahun pertama",
        "content": "DALAM berbagai diskusi mengenai , seringkali kurang disinggung jika dibandingkan dengan kelompok usia lainnya. Padahal, periode usia lima tahun pertama sering juga disebut sebagai periode kritis atau bahkan disebut sebagai usia emas ( ). ECED Ecosystem Development Lead Tanoto Foundation, Fitriana Herarti mengatakan tidak semua orang memiliki pemahaman yang sama mengenai usia emas. Secara umum, usia emas menggambarkan periode usia tiga tahun pertama kehidupan. “Pada usia tersebut, tumbuh kembang anak berlangsung dengan sangat pesat, yang tidak akan terulang lagi pada periode selanjutnya. Pesatnya tumbuh kembang ini didasarkan dari hasil riset ilmu saraf dan perilaku selama beberapa dekade yang menghasilkan sejumlah fakta penting,” kata Fitriana, Selasa (28/5). Pertama, perkembangan otak dimulai sejak masa kehamilan hingga mencapai 80% di usia tiga tahun yang kemudian akan menjadi fondasi untuk semua capaian belajar, kesehatan, dan perilaku di periode usia selanjutnya. Kedua, interaksi dua arah (serve and return) antara orang tua atau pengasuh utama dengan anak menjadi kunci perkembangan otak yang optimal. Sebaliknya interaksi yang negatif justru akan menjadi penghambat. Ketiga, kapasitas otak untuk berkembang akan menurun dengan bertambahnya usia. Lebih efektif untuk mempengaruhi perkembangan otak pada usia dini daripada mengembangkan kapasitas otak di kelompok usia lainnya. Keempat, kesehatan mental dan fisik, keterampilan sosial, kemampuan berpikir, dan bahasa yang berkembang di usia dini akan menjadi fondasi yang kuat untuk anak supaya bisa mendapatkan hasil pembelajaran yang optimal, sukses di dunia kerja, dan memiliki kemampuan sosial yang baik. Kelima, pengalaman negatif anak di usia dini, misal mengalami kekerasan, pengabaian, maupun tidak terpenuhinya kebutuhan kesehatan dan gizi akan menghambat optimalisasi perkembangan otak. “Berbagai fakta tentang perkembangan otak tersebut menjadi sebab pentingnya keterlibatan aktif dan kapasitas yang memadai dari orang tua. Pengasuhan tidak lagi cukup didasari oleh insting ataupun meniru bagaimana dulu orang tua diasuh, terlebih karena anak usia dini memiliki kebutuhan spesifik yang berbeda dengan kelompok usia lainnya,” jelas Fitriana. Karena itu, pengasuhan di periode tiga tahun pertama, harus memastikan anak mendapatkan sejumlah hal, yang meliputi kesehatan yang baik, termasuk menerima semua imunisasi wajib, kebiasaan hidup bersih dan sehat sehingga anak terhindar dari infeksi berulang, misal diare, malaria, cacingan, campak, cacar, dll. Hal lainnya adalah Gizi yang mencukupi dengan memberikan Inisiasi Menyusu Dini (IMD), enam bulan ASI Eksklusif, Makanan Pendamping ASI (MP-ASI) bergizi seimbang mulai usia enam bulan, dan ASI hingga dua tahun. Selanjutnya, anak harus memperoleh pola asuh yang responsif, yaitu memberikan pengasuhan yang tanggap terhadap kebutuhan anak untuk mendapatkan kasih sayang, interaksi dua arah yang cukup, dan mampu mengenali perilaku-perilaku anak saat merasa tidak nyaman. Pada usia tersebut, anak-anak juga harus mendapatkan kesempatan untuk belajar pada anak usia dini melalui bermain dan interaksi sehari-hari dengan orang-orang, anak lain, dan lingkungan di sekitar anak. Terakhir adalah keamanan dan keselamatan, yakni memastikan anak berada dalam lingkungan yang aman, bebas kekerasan, terhindar dari ancaman kemiskinan yang mengakibatkan kebutuhan dasar anak tidak terpenuhi, serta penerapan disiplin positif dalam membentuk perilaku anak. Fitriana menjelaskan dari hasil studi yang dilakukan oleh Tanoto Foundation selama satu tahun kepada kelompok orangtua dengan anak usia 0-3 tahun di Jakarta, Pandeglang dan Kutai Kartanegara, diketahui bahwa orangtua yang menerima pelatihan dan pendampingan untuk meningkatkan keterampilan pengasuhan di 5 komponen di atas mampu membantu anak-anak mereka untuk mencapai peningkatan kemampuan di aspek berpikir, bahasa, motorik, dan sosial-emosional lebih dari anak-anak dari orangtua yang tidak mendapatkan pelatihan atau pendampingan. Hal ini menunjukkan betapa pentingnya pengetahuan, kesadaran dan keterampilan pengasuhan orangtua untuk pertumbuhan dan perkembangan anak usia dini, dan juga masih banyak orang tua yang belum memiliki pengetahuan, kesadaran dan keterampilan untuk melakukan pengasuhan yang baik, responsif dan cukup bagi anak-anak mereka di usia 0 hingga 3 tahun. “Studi ini juga menguji kualitas pengasuhan anak di rumah melalui instrument HOME (Home Observation for Measuring the Environment). Pada kelompok intervensi, peningkatan besar terlihat pada beberapa aspek utama pengasuhan anak, yaitu responsivitas dalam memenuhi kebutuhan dasar anak, pengelolaan kegiatan sehari-hari anak, ketersedian dan variasi bahan-bahan untuk belajar melalui bermain, serta keterikatan emosional anak dengan orangtuanya, dibandingkan dengan kelompok non-intervensi,” jelas Fitriana. Pengetahuan dan keterampilan mengenai pengasuhan anak usia dini juga penting untuk dipahami oleh para pengelola layanan pengasuhan sementara saat orangtua bekerja. Oleh karena itu Kementerian Pemberdayaan Perempuan dan Perlindungan Anak (Kementerian PPPA) pada 29-30 April 2024 menyelenggarakan bimbingan teknis kepada pengelola dan pengasuh Taman Asuh Ramah Anak (tempat pengasuhan sementara di jam kerja) dari 22 Kementerian/Lembaga, dan meminta Tanoto Foundation menyampaikan materi mengenai pengasuhan anak usia dini. Dalam layanan pengasuhan sementara penting untuk memastikan bahwa pengasuh memiliki pengetahuan tentang tumbuh kembang anak usia dini agar mampu memberikan stimulasi atau rangsangan perkembangan yang sesuai usia anak, menggunakan disiplin positif dalam mengelola perilaku anak, serta memahami penerapan gizi seimbang untuk konsumsi anak selama berada di tempat pengasuhan sementara. Selain sebagai narasumber dalam bimbingan teknis ini, Tanoto Foundation juga sebagai anggota komite teknis perwakilan ahli pengasuhan dalam penyusunan SNI (Standar Nasional Indonesia) Taman Asuh Ramah Anak. Salah satu standar layanan yang harus ada adalah kegiatan stimulasi perkembangan sesuai usia anak menjadi bagian dari kegiatan sehari-hari anak selama berada dalam layanan pengasuhan sementara.

Теперь активистка не сможет заниматься деятельностью, связанной с распространением информации о деятельности Вооруженных сил (ВС) России, два года. По данным собеседника агентства, ранее присяжные вынесли обвинительный вердикт в отношении Ситдиковой по статьям о реабилитации нацизма и публичных действиях, направленных на дискредитацию использования ВС РФ . Прокурор запрашивал для нее наказание в виде трех лет колонии-поселения. Как уточняет РИА Новости, уголовное дело в отношении активистки было возбуждено из-за двух плакатов, на одном из которых дата «9 Мая» была искажена и написана с перевернутой буквой «М». В 2022 году Ново-Савиновский районный суд Казани уже штрафовал ее по той же статье.

        "content": "Покупая товар в рассрочку, россияне должны помнить, что у этого инструмента есть не только большие плюсы, но и серьезные минусы. Об этом «Газете.Ru» заявил эксперт главного управления Банка России по Центральному федеральному округу Алексей Арзамаскин. Специалист пояснил, что благодаря рассрочке потребитель может обзавестись желаемым товаром даже в том случае, если не располагает сразу всей необходимой для этого суммой. Кроме того, некоторые программы позволяют воспользоваться беспроцентной рассрочкой, а значит, избежать переплаты. Что касается минусов, то к ним Арзамаскин отнес дополнительные расходы. По его словам, к рассрочке надо относиться так же, как к кредитам, — тщательно взвешивать свои шансы на то, что платежи впишутся в бюджет. Второй минус — финансовая нагрузка, особенно в ситуации, когда гражданин уже обременен долгами. Третий минус — риск задолженности. Например, если человек лишился постоянного заработка, то гасить долги по рассрочке окажется намного труднее. Арзамаскин призвал граждан внимательно читать соответствующий договор, прежде чем пользоваться таким инструментом, как рассрочка. По его словам, некоторые продавцы включают в документы положения об обязательной страховке или дополнительных товарах. Ранее россиян предостерегли от покупки квартир в рассрочку. В свою очередь, Центральный банк России сообщил о том, что покупки в рассрочку могут быть лимитированы, дабы граждане сохранили возможность пользовать этим финансовым инструментом.",

Read More Revealed: General Hospital star Johnny Wactor's heartbreaking last Instagram video as actor is shot and killed in Los Angeles Wactor appeared on over 160 episodes of General Hospital as the character Brando Corbin from 2020 to 2022. The actor was also a series regular on the 2013 NBC drama series Siberia, which lasted 11 episodes. He did multi-episode arcs on TV shows like The OA, The Passenger, Westworld and Hollywood Girl. His first break into television came in a three-episode guest role on the Lifetime series Army Wives. He had also branched out into producing; his IMDb page has three upcoming projects listed. Wactor also wrote a short film called Broken Riders. Wactor's most recent work was in the horror anthology Dead Talk Tales: Volume I released earlier this year. Personally, his Instagram page often showed him engaging in extreme sports like rock climbing. Farrell, in her heartfelt Instagram post, also revealed that 'before acting he was a swimmer, an amazing swimmer'. The shooting occurred at around 3am on Saturday when Wactor approached three men, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Officers are pictured at the scene Three suspects drove away from the scene, police (pictured at the scene) said. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. There were no arrests as of late on Sunday. Wactor's murder comes just weeks after California was ranked among the top 10 most dangerous states in America. Violent crime in Los Angeles has been on the rise, with the LAPD recording a 2.9 per cent increase at the end of March 2024, compared to the same time last year. The LAPD reported Friday that, as of the end of April, the city's rise in the number of murders in 2024 continued to decline and, as of April 27, was only 4.2 per cent above the number of murders reported at this time in 2023, NBC Los Angeles reported. The last time the force updated robbery statistics, at the end of March 2024, thefts were up 9.5 per cent, according to ABC 7. Around 600,000 catalytic converters are stolen each year. Most cars are equipped with one converter but those with a dual exhaust system require two. Larger vehicles such as SUVs and trucks may have more than two. According to the New York Times, stolen catalytic converters are passed through 'middlemen, smelters and refineries in the United States and overseas.' They can be stolen in under a minute and cost around $1,000 to replace.

        "content": "MAURICIO POCHETTINO remains the favourite to be the next Manchester United manager. The former Spurs and Chelsea manager - who left his role at Stamford Bridge last week -leads the race to take over from Erik ten Hag . But after United finished the season with somewhat of a flourish, are they in the market for a new manager this summer? That's the question for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co, who witnessed the FA Cup win at Wembley and saw the respect Ten Hag had from the players and supporters after beating Manchester City. Wins over Newcastle and Brighton preceded it too. So is binning the Dutchman the right thing to do? Paddy Power make it 6/4 that he remains at Old Trafford next season and as low as 4/9 that he's replaced. So with it more likely he'll be gone, we look at the top candidates seemingly strongly in contention with the bookmakers. It's always appeared destined that Pochettino would be in charge at Old Trafford one day. The unfortunate thing for him and the club, it's just never appeared to be the right time. He was a strong, strong favourite prior to Ten Hag's appointment and he's always been into a project when the opportunity has arisen. Reports suggest INEOS hold him in 'high esteem' having tried to land him for Nice a couple of years ago which never materialised. Odds continue to plummet. Stellar time at Brighton but is on the move this summer. Disappointing domestic campaign as they struggle to balance the league and European football but style of football a huge plus. Had been linked with Chelsea and Bayern but they both look to be heading in different directions. So that doesn't leave too many more options at the top end. Played United in final game of the season at the Amex as Brighton boss. Was the 2-0 defeat a good audition? Tuchel had attracted most of the money in recent weeks following the news he'd be quitting Bayern in the summer. He lost out comfortably in the Bundesliga race - finishing a disappointing third in the end - and guided them to the semi finals of the Champions League . Has Premier League experience having coached Chelsea , guiding them to European glory too. He won 63 of his 100 games in charge of the club. Also played United twice earlier in the season, winning both home and away in Champions League group stage fixtures. Odds on the drift and now third favourite after being a short price at the start of the month. The Ipswich boss was seemingly well in contention for both the Chelsea and Brighton roles, though that has changed over the weekend. Odds shortened all week in this market and a return to United looked to be on the cards at one stage. His style of play at Ipswich was one thing but back-to-back promotions from League One to the Premier League has shown he's a winner and puts him in the shop window for a host of top clubs. Will that past work at United help or hinder his chances? Who knows. Odds on the drift. Southgate's name was thrown into the mix earlier on this year and he's remained strong in the betting markets since. The England boss was reportedly the number one choice of Sir Jim Ratcliffe during his takeover process, with new technical director Jason Wilcox also a fan. Southgate's potential appointment is said to be universally welcome by those in the club, including the United players. His contract with the FA runs out in December of this year, meaning this summer's Euros could be his last in charge - after shelving talks on his future until after the tournament. Regardless of the outcome, he could look to leave on a high should England finally get over the line, or admit defeat and hand the reins to someone else should they disappoint on the continental stage yet again. Either way, he could be looking for a fresh challenge after the summer and Old Trafford could present itself nicely. He's also worked with incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth at the FA, which also sways things in his favour. Paddy Power prices Earlier on this calendar year after a sticky spell for Ten Hag, it was GRAHAM POTTER (14/1) who dominated this particular market in the early parts of the season. Potter, who also has previous of working with Dan Ashworth at Brighton, has remained out of work since his sacking from Chelsea at the beginning of last year though has been linked with several top flight roles. Has met owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and no surprises should his odds be shortened still, though is reportedly being lined up for Brighton return. THOMAS FRANK (14/1) saw considerable support last week but his odds have drifted slightly following the events of the last week. The Dane revealed he was really happy at Brentford just a few days ago but could the lure of United take him away if they came calling?

Patrick Paul, Chief Executive with the Foundation said, “In India, someone is diagnosed with blood cancer or a severe blood disorder every five minutes. Despite the global registry having over 41 million donors, India has only about 0.6 million registered. Thousands of patients are in dire need of matching stem cell donors to undergo life-saving transplants. We need to expand our donor database significantly, to provide these patients a fighting chance.” His words come against the backdrop of World Blood Cancer Day (May 28). DKMS-BMST is a joint venture of two non-profit organisations, BMST (Bangalore Medical Services Trust) and DKMS, one of the largest international blood stem cell donor centres in the world, a note from the Foundation said. The representatives urged healthy people between 18 – 55 years to register and volunteer to become a stem cell donor. Over a lakh people from India are diagnosed annually with blood cancer and disorders such as thalassemia and aplastic anemia, a note from the Foundation said. “For many of these patients, a blood stem cell transplant is their only hope for survival. While conventional methods like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, a blood stem cell transplant is often crucial for patients who are at high risk of relapse or who do not respond well to conventional treatments,” it added. Dr Nitin Agarwal, Head of Donor Request Management at the Foundation, pointed out that many people in India are unaware of what blood stem cell donation involves or have incorrect beliefs about the process. “It’s crucial to understand that matching for stem cell transplants, is based on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) characteristics, not just blood type. Education is key to dispelling these misconceptions and encouraging more people to register,” he said. Comments",

Thousands of protesters are gathering in Taipei as opposition lawmakers attempt to pass controversial legislation that could curb President Lai Ching-te’s authority. What Happened : Thousands of demonstrators assembled in Taipei on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The protests erupted as opposition lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) and its allies in the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) sought to pass a contentious bill. The legislation would grant them greater investigative powers, potentially undermining President Lai Ching-te . Violent shoving matches broke out inside the legislature, echoing the unrest outside. Protesters expressed fears that the new powers could derail President Lai's agenda and lead to leaks of sensitive information. The proposed changes would allow lawmakers to summon the president, companies, and the public for questioning, and access confidential documents. Last week’s protests were among the largest since the 2014 Sunflower Movement, which saw demonstrators occupy parliament to block an unpopular trade pact with China. Inside the legislature, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers opposed the amendments, covering the chamber with placards and shouting slogans. See Also: Here’s What To Expect If Donald Trump Is Convicted As Jury Deliberations Begin Next Week The KMT, advocating closer ties with China, denies any external influence on the law. KMT lawmaker Ko Chih-en stated the reform reflects public opinion. President Lai, who was sworn in on May 20, faces potential challenges in implementing policies amid the legislative turmoil. Why It Matters : The protests come shortly after President Lai was inaugurated as Taiwan’s new president on May 20. Lai’s presidency marks a significant period for Taiwan. The legislative push by the KMT and TPP is seen as an attempt to limit Lai’s influence early in his term. Adding to the tension, a senior U.S. lawmaker recently confirmed that Taiwan’s ordered weapons are on their way , amid escalating military tensions with China. This development underscores the geopolitical stakes involved in Taiwan’s internal politics and its relationship with major global powers. Read Next: Biden Vs.

KUALA LUMPUR (May 28): OPPO’s commitment to celebrating Malaysia’s rich heritage using mobile innovative imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is supported by the Malaysian National Commission for Unesco (MNCU) and the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (Motac). During its 10 anniversary in Malaysia, OPPO launches #OPPOMalaysiaThroughTheLens campaign, to empower people to capture and preserve the fading cultures and traditions in the country. Through this program, OPPO hopes to rekindle tradition and foster peace and empathy in the society. Chief Marketing Officer of OPPO Malaysia chief marketing officer Monica Chin underlined how culture connects our past to our future and how technology, especially AI, helps younger generations understand and enjoy heritage. “Since we believe technology can enhance people’s lives, we’re excited to collaborate with the Malaysian National Commission for Unesco (MNCU) and Motac, to share Malaysia’s rich culture through mobile imagery and preserve it for future generations. “Our mobile photography has improved as the brand has deliberately invested in image technology and software,” she said, hoping that the devices’ AI will inspire consumers to capture cultural events creatively. Tourism, Arts, and Culture Minister Dato Sri Tiong King Sing said: “In collaboration with OPPO and the Malaysian National Commission for Unesco, we are proud to be part of the OPPO Malaysia Through the Lens campaign. “Utilising OPPO’s cutting-edge technology, this initiative allows us to showcase the intricate details of our cultural practices and share our stories to audiences around the world. By highlighting Malaysia’s cultural richness, this collaboration furthers our mission to preserve and celebrate our cultural legacy.” Education Minister Fadhlina Sidek, who is also Malaysian National Commission for Unesco (MNCU) president, said: “During the 42nd Unesco General Conference which took place in November 2023, Malaysia highlighted its efforts on elevating our traditional costume in support of the Unesco’s agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). “Through OPPO’s initiative, we hope to elevate the different traditional arts and heritage that Malaysia is known for, and the Malaysian National Commission for Unesco supports efforts such as these, which drive innovation by utilising technology as a tool to preserve our diverse culture for the future generations.” Through the lens of the future of tech Amelia Henderson admiring a Wayang Kulit in the making.

This was the first time Nadal has exited the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, in the first round. Zverev won 6-3 ,7-6(5), 6-3. Zverev became the third player in the history of the sport to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, behind Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling. The 37-year-old southpaw opined that playing a Grand Slam (Wimbledon in this case) and the Olympics in quick succession wouldn’t be smart on his part, especially given he has been struggling to cope up with injuries. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart after everything my body has been through,” he said. Nadal explained the reason behind thinking of skipping Wimbledon. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games,” he said. Nadal won Wimbledon twice—in 2008 and 2010—but also endured some of his toughest moments at the All England Club. He last played in the tournament in 2022, when he was forced to withdraw before his semifinal against Nick Kyrgios with an abdomen strain.",

The weather alert has been issued for Tuesday, May 28 and will begin at 3pm before concluding at 11:59pm this evening. It will mostly affect Strathclyde and the Borders. Another fresh thunderstorm warning is in place for Wednesday, May 29, which will start at 10am and end by 7pm. Forecasters have said that heavy showers and thundery weather may bring \"torrential downpours\" could cause issues with travel and potentially flooding in some areas. Hail, lightning and strong winds are also expected, alongside an inch of rain which is expected to fall in the space of a couple of hours. In the warning , forecasters said: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms will spread eastwards this afternoon before slowly fading later this evening. Where storms are particularly frequent 20 to 30 mm of rain may build up over 2 or 3 hours. Frequent lightning, hail and gusty winds will be additional hazards in some places.\" Meteorologists said in their warning: \"Early showers on Wednesday will become heavier and more widespread later in the morning for the afternoon. Where showers and storms develop they could be slow-moving and prolonged, bringing 15-20 mm of rain in less than an hour and potentially 30-40 mm in a few hours. Lightning and hail will be additional hazards.\" Scots are being told to be aware of potential flooding in their area and prepare an emergency kit if they are more susceptible to excess rainfall disrupting their home. Met Office forecasters said: \"Consider if your location is at risk of flash flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. Prepare to protect your property and people from injury. Before gusty winds arrive, check to ensure moveable objects or temporary structures are well secured. Items include; bins, garden furniture, trampolines, tents, gazebos, sheds, and fences.\" Motorists are also being told to plan their journey ahead of time and check road conditions before heading out to give themselves the best chance of avoiding delays or any unexpected issues.

        "description": "Australia is ready to provide further aid to Papua New Guinea following a landslide that buried more than 2000 people, the prime minister says.",
        "content": "Australia is holding out hope for Papua New Guinea following a deadly landslide, with assistance already underway, the prime minister says. / (min cost $ 0 ) or signup to continue reading PNG's National Disaster Centre said more than 2000 people had been buried alive by Friday's landslide in remote Enga province. The Albanese government will send technical experts and $2.5 million in initial aid as the death toll continues to rise. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Australia would stand alongside Papua New Guinea following the natural disaster. \"We hold out hope for Papua New Guinea, we hold out hope for the missing and strength to those who are now so desperately searching in what is an unimaginable tragedy,\" he told parliament on Tuesday. \"All Papua New Guineans are suffering in the wake of this terrible disaster, and we hold them in our hearts.\" Foreign Minister Penny Wong tweeted on Tuesday evening that Australia's Disaster Assistance Response Team had landed in PNG, ready to help. \"We are working closely with PNG authorities on the ground, and stand ready to respond to additional requests for assistance,\" she said. Australian defence forces have already been working alongside PNG counterparts as part of relief efforts. Defence crews have also been involved in flying members of PNG's national disaster committee to the site of the landslide, with a C-17 aircraft also ferrying supplies from Australia. Defence Minister Richard Marles said defence personnel were working to transport 750 family-sized shelters to the site of the disaster. \"There is more that we are seeking to do. But, to be frank, part of the issue here is about not overwhelming a system which is currently under a lot of stress,\" he said. Mr Albanese said Australia had been providing emergency relief supplies such as shelters and hygiene kits to the communities affected. \"At this most tragic of times, I want the people of PNG to know Australia is there for them and always will be,\" he said. \"Paua New Guinea is our nearest of neighbours and our closest friends, we stand with each other through the good times and the bad.\" Treacherous terrain in the region and difficulty getting in aid has hampered rescue efforts, raising fears few survivors will be found. The head of the International Organisation for Migration in PNG Serhan Aktoprak said the conditions on the ground were hampering rescue and aid efforts. Rocks were still falling from the mountain, soil was cracking and water was flowing under the debris. Pacific Minister Pat Conroy said the support provided by Australia was only an initial contribution, and more aid would flow at the request of PNG's government. He said the true extent of the disaster was not yet known. \"This is an incredibly inaccessible part of Papua New Guinea and it's a really challenging process for everyone involved,\" Mr Conroy said. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton said the scenes from the landside and its devastation was unimaginable. \"I want Prime Minister (James) Marape, a dear friend to many of us, but to all Papua New Guineans, to hear the very clear message that Australia will always stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Papua New Guinea,\" he told parliament.

        "content": "As a concerned resident of Honiara, I urge city officials to prioritize the installation of traffic lights and, if feasible, surveillance cameras in the Central Business District (CBD). The current lack of traffic management infrastructure poses significant risks to both public safety and efficient traffic flow. Honiara’s bustling CBD witnesses a constant stream of vehicles and pedestrians, creating a chaotic environment prone to accidents and congestion. Installation of traffic lights would not only regulate traffic but also enhance pedestrian safety, ensuring smoother and safer movement for all. Furthermore, the addition of surveillance cameras would provide valuable monitoring of traffic patterns and serve as a deterrent to reckless driving and criminal activity. By bolstering law enforcement efforts, we can create a safer environment for residents and visitors alike. It’s time for Honiara to prioritize the wellbeing of its citizens by investing in essential infrastructure that promotes safety and order. Let us work together to make our city a model of efficient traffic management and public safety. Sincerely,",

        "content": "Former nominated senator Millicent Omanga has told off a section of Kenyans criticizing the cost of President William plane to United States of America during his state visit. Omanga through her official X account on Tuesday, May 28, 2024, said the focus of Kenyans should not be on the cost of Ruto's US state visit. The politician-cum businesswoman pointed out that Kenyans should look at the benefits that came out of the trip, instead of scrutinizing it. Omanga, a close ally of President Ruto, said Kenyans should not lose the sight of an antelope for the squirrel. \"I think we are missing the point. In as much as it's within Kenyans' rights to scrutinize the president's state visit to the U.S, the focus shouldn't be on the cost of the visit but the benefits that accrued to Kenya. We shouldn't lose the sight of the antelope for the squirrel,\" she posted. I think we are missing the point. Inasmuch as it's within Kenyans' rights to scrutinise the president's state visit to the U.S, the focus shouldn't be on the cost of the visit but the benefits that accrued to Kenya. We shouldn't lose the sight of the antelope for the squirrel. President Ruto has been on the receiving end after he chartered a private jet for his trip to the US. Ruto left the country on Sunday, May 19, 2024, aboard a chartered Boeing 737-700 that was said to be operated by the Royal Jet of Dubai. The jet costs approximately Ksh98 million for a single trip from Nairobi to Atlanta, USA. A round trip could, therefore, surpass the Ksh200 million mark as the president also used the same jet to travel from Atlanta to Washington DC, a trip spanning two hours. Rarieda MP is among those who criticized the trip's cost, terming it extravagant. \"Mr President, let it be said clearly! Your USA trip was extravagant! Many heads of state travel cheaper! Worst of all, you then drag a limping KQ into it!\" the lawmaker posted on his official X account on Monday, May 27, 2024. Ruto, however, defended the cost of his trip, saying it was cheaper to charter a plane compared to using Kenya Airways. “Fellow Kenyans, I have noted concerns on my mode of transport to USA. As a responsible steward of public resources and in keeping with my determination for us to live within our means and that I should lead from the front in so doing, the cost was less than travelling on KQ,” Ruto said on May 26, 2024. Ruto's remarks sparked a debate, with a section of Kenyans criticizing him for justifying his expensive US trip. : :",

        "content": "The Covid-19 pandemic raged between 2019 to 2021, following which small waves of the virus were witnessed across the . As the world is just getting over Covid-19 after four years, a top British scientist warned that another pandemic is “absolutely inevitable”. The former chief scientific adviser to the British government, Sir Patrick Vallance, urged the UK government to prioritise preparations for the pandemic and emphasized that the country is “not ready” for it yet, reported. According to the report, Vallance, speaking at a panel event at the Hay Festival in Powys, stressed that the UK government must implement “better surveillance” to detect the threats of the virus. He also recommended some measures to prevent drastic steps during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments. The top scientist believes that such measures could be implemented, however, it would require some coordination. “We know we have to have an army, not because there's going to be a war this year, but we know it's an important part of what we need as a nation. We need to treat this preparedness in the same way and not to view it as an easy thing to keep cutting back when there's no sign of a pandemic – because there won't be a sign of a pandemic,” he said, as quoted by The Guardian. According to the report, Vallance also said that by 2023, G7 had “sort of forgotten” his points about the pandemic preparations in 2021. “You can't forget about it,” he said. The British scientist, during the panel event, mentioned the World Organization's (WHO) pandemic accord, calling it a “positive step”. However, he also criticised its “lack of focus and urgency”. Last week, the WHO said that Covid-19 has cut global life expectancy by almost two years, wiping out a decade of progress. According to the UN health agency's world health statistics study, global life expectancy fell 1.8 years to 71.4 years – the same level it was in 2012. The study said that the amount of time an average person can expect to live in good health fell 1.5 years to 61.9 years in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic raged between 2019 to 2021, following which small waves of the virus were witnessed across the world.",

        "content": "Michael Vi Nokia ( NYSE: NOK ) is set to secure a deal to supply 5G radio equipment to Portugal-based telecom operator MEO, Reuters reported, citing an internal company blog post and two people with knowledge of the matter. Nokia is geared up to secure the contract despite China's Huawei Technologies having being MEO's only supplier of 2G, 3G and 4G Radio Access Network, or RAN, equipment, the report added . The agreement has received a greenlight but has not yet been signed, and an announcement could be made as early as next month, as per the report. MEO, which was formerly known as Telecom Portugal and now a unit of France's Altice, is one of Portugal's leading mobile operators. \"In recent years, MEO ... has been supplied in RAN only by Huawei. In other words, Huawei has had a 100% market share in 2G/3G/4G. We have now been selected to replace Huawei in some of the key markets in Portugal,\" wrote Tommi Uitto, president of Nokia's mobile networks, in the internal company memo. The agreement would mark Nokia's return to Portugal's RAN market after it lost market share to Chinese tech giant Huawei several years ago and has not supplied any communications service providers with RAN in the nation since then, Uitto noted in the blog. RAN tools have generated the majority of telecom sales for companies such as Huawei, Nokia and Sweden-based Ericsson ( ERIC ) ( OTCPK:ERIXF ), however a decline in demand for new tools from telcos since last year has impacted Nokia and Ericsson, pushing them to cut thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, Huawei — which was banned in the U.S. and certain European countries over security concerns — still has some presence in the EU and is a major player in the telecom market in China.

Police in the area are appealing for information after parts of Tofthill Farm in Inchyra were damaged in a vandalism incident. Officers say the damage must have taken place between 5pm on Friday 24 May, and 10 am on Saturday 25 May. Those responsible for the overnight attack have yet to be traced, after the damage left 2,000 bees dead and multiple fresh strawberry plants ruined. The owners of the farm have released a statement saying how disappointed they are with the attack on their property, especially after an ‘incredibly difficult winter’ and during a time when food production in Scotland is becoming harder every year.

Aside from jumping on our equipment and damaging it, the most heart-breaking aspect of it is that some 2,000 bees were killed and dozens of fresh strawberry plants were maliciously damaged. “Bees are truly the most magnificent and efficient pollinators on any farm and it’s thanks to them that we all get fed. “After an incredibly difficult winter for farming, where it is getting harder and harder to produce food, we only have utter contempt for the individuals who have caused thousands of pounds worth of damage’.

        "content": "Judi Dench has suggested she has retired from acting because of her worsening eyesight. Asked by a reporter over the weekend at the Chelsea flower show if she had plans for future roles, Dench responded: “No, no, I can’t even see!” Representatives for the actor, 89, have indicated that there is nothing further to add. In Chelsea, Dench continued by saying she did have other projects in the pipeline, saying: “Our book has come out [ Shakespeare: The Man Who Pays the Rent ], we’re going to Cheltenham book fair and then I’m going to do three shows with Gyles Brandreth.” Dench lives with age-related macular degeneration, which affects more than 700,000 people in the UK. She has been open about her diminishing vision, telling Louis Theroux in 2022: “I don’t want to retire. I’m not doing much at the moment because I can’t see. It’s bad.” She added: “I have a photographic memory so a person saying to me, ‘This is your line ...’ I can do that.” Last year, she told the Sunday Mirror she was still continuing to try to find workarounds, but “I can’t see on a film set any more” ... “and I can’t see to read. But you just deal with it”. She continued: “It’s difficult if I have any length of a part. I haven’t yet found a way.” Dench has long been frank about the effects on her professional life of her condition, and the need for her to memorise lines orally before going on set. In 2021, she received an an Oscar nomination for her role in Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast , and appeared in a key role in Allelujah , Richard Eyre’s adaptation of the Alan Bennett play. Her last screen role was a cameo in 2022’s Spirited . ‘We fetishised being young – it’s just stupid!’: Judi Dench and Richard Eyre on ageing, Covid and saving the NHS Read more Dench has said she continues to work because “I have an irrational fear of boredom. That’s why I now have this tattoo that says carpe diem. That’s what we should live by.” Other key big screen roles include eight James Bond films and Shakespeare in Love, for which she won an Oscar. Dench has also had a sustained and highly successful stage career, winning a Tony and eight Olivier awards. Key TV shows include the sitcom As Time Goes By, with Geoffrey Palmer, and A Fine Romance, with her late husband, Michael Williams. Dench was at the Chelsea flower show being presented by a primary school pupil with the first seedling from the Sycamore Gap tree that was illegally felled last year. “I’ll be naming him Antonius,” she said, “the adopted son of the Emperor Hadrian.”",

        "content": "On Tuesday, UBS has downgraded stock of Asahi Intecc Co Ltd (7747:JP) (OTC: AHICF) from Buy to Neutral, significantly lowering the price target to ¥2,220 from the previous ¥3,660. The revision reflects concerns over the anticipated slow progress in new U.S. market fields and the unlikely improvement in valuation multiples due to substantial quarterly sales volatility in China. According to UBS, the slower-than-expected ramp-up of Asahi Intecc's new fields in the U.S. is due to the prevalence of bundled marketing strategies by leading companies, which may hinder Asahi's market share growth. Consequently, the firm has adjusted its forecast for the operating profit before goodwill amortisation for the fiscal year ending June 2026 to ¥26.9 billion, down from ¥30.9 billion. This figure falls below the IFIS consensus of ¥29.5 billion. In addition to the challenges in the U.S., Asahi Intecc's performance in China is also causing concern. Sales in China have been highly inconsistent, primarily due to the reliance on distributor-based marketing. This erratic sales pattern has led to a lack of earnings visibility, which UBS believes negatively impacts the company's valuation multiple. To align with these projections, UBS has also revised the price-to-earnings ratio (PER) estimate for Asahi Intecc, reducing it from 46.6X to a more conservative 29.6X. This adjustment is a direct reflection of the anticipated difficulties in the U.S. and China markets, which are key factors behind the lowered price target for the company's shares.

        "description": "Рафаел Надал, прослављени шпански тенисер, одиграо је можда свој последњи меч у каријери на Ролан Гаросу. Његов пораз од Саше Зверева пратио је и Новак Ђоковић кога како каже није приметио у публици. Осим што је истакао да ни сам није сигуран да ли се враћа у Париз, Надал је причао и о наставку сезоне и тако открио да неће играти на Вимблдону.",
        "content": "Прави спектакл приредили су Рафаел Надал и Саша Зверев у првом колу Ролан Гароса, али Шпанац је био предалеко од тога да угрози немачког тенисера који је у одличној форми. Међутим, упркос поразу „краљ шљаке“ задовољан је што је успео да се врати на париску шљаку. С обзиром на то да је најавио да би ово могао да буде његов последњи меч „Бика са Мајорке“ са трибина су гледали Новак Ђоковић , Карлос Алкарас као и Ига Швјонтек, али их он није приметио. Када је прошле године причао о повратку Надал је рекао да ће ове године играти последњу сезону у каријери. Тојош увек ниј потврдио, а једино је сигурно да ћемо га гледати још на Олимпијским играма, док се на Вимблдону готово сигурно неће појавити. „Тешко да ћу играти на Вимблдону, не могу то да потврдим, посебно због промена, иде трава, па Олимпијске игре на шљаци. Морам да причам са тимом, да направимо анализу. Сматрам да не би било паметно за моје тело да тако нешто урадим. Осећао сам се добро на терену, али ништа не могу да потврдим. Чак и ако се пријавим за Вимблдон, морам да размислим да ли ћу да играм“, истакао је Шпанац. Још увек не зна када ће оставити рекет. „Тело није давало добре сигнале у прошлости, али не знам шта све може да се промени за годину дана. Било је дана када нисам могао да уживам ни у чему. Зато не могу да кажем ништа, не знам шта може да се деси. Није тема стрпљење, него реалност. Биће тешко, недеље пролазе. Немам чисту слику. Идем полако, као што сам стално радио. Ако не буде било енергије, снаге и свега што иде уз то, онда ће бити крај“, поручио је „краљ шљаке“. Због тога што постоји шанса да се врати у Париз Надал није желео омаж после меча са Немцем. „Не желим омаже. Хоћу да мислим на тенис и ни на ста друго. Ако то желе, бице времена. Ако дође време за крај онда могу да ми дају омаж. Париз није далеко, могу да дођем. Не треба ми данас омаж. Нисам рекао са сигурношћу да цу се вратити догодине само да сам захвалан на томе сто су хтели да ураде. Нормалан сам човек, ствари иду полако. Не могу јасно да кажем Све иде полако. Свашта може да се деси. Уживао сам ове недеље. Хтео сам да победим овде, урадио сам све, није било могуће и то је то“, закључио је Надал.",

        "content": "Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said he is prepared to stay in his current role after the election and urged the country to choose stability over “chaos” by voting for the African National Congress. “If I am asked to serve I will serve,” he said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television with Jennifer Zabasajja. “What these elections are about — are about stability and chaos — and the ANC provides that stability.” South Africans vote on Wednesday, with Godongwana’s ruling ANC facing its toughest election fight since taking power in 1994. Opinion polls show ANC support dipping below 50%, which would force it into a coalition with a smaller rival. But recent rand strength suggests investors see it doing well enough to form a government without hooking up with parties to its left, which could push the country in a more populist and less market-friendly direction. Godongwana voiced confidence that the party will get over the line. “The ANC is working on the assumption that we’re going to have 50 plus one.”",

        "content": "It is \"very unlikely\" more survivors of Papua New Guinea's deadly landslide will be found, a UN agency warned on Tuesday, as thousands at risk from further slips were ordered to evacuate. Some 2 000 people are feared buried by a massive landslide that entombed a remote highland community in the early hours of 24 May. Since then, locals have been picking through a hellscape of metres-deep churned-up earth, uprooted trees and car-sized boulders in the search for loved ones - often using little more than their hands, shovels and digging sticks. But hopes are dimming that anyone is alive underneath the mountain of rubble. \"It is not a rescue mission, it is a recovery mission,\" Unicef Papua New Guinea's Niels Kraaier told AFP. \"It is very unlikely they will have survived.\" READ | 'We are racing against time': Fears of another slide as 670 bodies found in Papua New Guinea Full-scale rescue and relief efforts have been severely hampered by the remote location, the only road link being severed, heavy rainfall and nearby tribal violence. The Papua New Guinea Defence Forces have struggled to access the site with heavy earth-moving equipment. Early on Tuesday, Enga provincial administrator Sandis Tsaka warned the disaster could worsen further, as clumps of limestone, dirt and rock continue to shear off the side of Mount Mungalo. Tsaka told AFP authorities were now trying to coordinate the evacuation of almost 7 900 more people. He said: \"Every hour you can hear rock breaking - it is like a bomb or gunshot and the rocks keep falling down.\" Aid officials said many residents were refusing to leave at-risk areas because they were holding out hope of finding loved ones. Satellite images show the enormous scale of the disaster. A vast smear of yellow and grey debris can be seen cutting through once verdant bushland and severing the region's only road. \"This was an area heavily populated with homes, businesses, churches and schools, it has been completely wiped out. It is the surface of the moon - it is just rocks,\" said Tsaka. \"People are digging with their hands and fingers,\" he said, expressing anguish at the under-resourced government's inability to meet the enormity of the disaster. \"I am not equipped to deal with this tragedy,\" Tsaka admitted. Overwhelmed Papua New Guinea authorities held an online emergency meeting with United Nations agencies and international allies Tuesday, hoping to kickstart the relief effort. Papua New Guinea's national disaster centre has told the United Nations that the initial \"landslide buried more than 2 000 people alive\". According to a letter obtained by AFP, the slide also \"caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country\". The scale of the catastrophe required \"immediate and collaborative actions from all players\", it added, including the army, and national and provincial responders. Australia has announced millions of dollars' worth of aid, including emergency relief supplies such as shelters, hygiene kits and support for women and children. China's President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden - more accustomed to scrapping for influence in the strategically located country - both offered assistance. More than 1 000 people have already been displaced by the catastrophe, aid agencies have estimated. UN Development Programme official Nicholas Booth said up to 30 000 people could have been cut off by the disaster across several villages. These communities had enough supplies for the coming weeks, but opening up that road remained essential, he said. \"This landslide has blocked the road westward, so not only are there challenges in accessing the village itself, but it does mean the communities beyond that are also cut off.\" Locals said the landslip may have been triggered by recent heavy rains. Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world, and research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could exacerbate the risk of landslides. The estimated death toll has climbed significantly since the disaster struck, as officials reassess the size of the population. Many people fleeing tribal violence have moved into the area in the past few years. The area is located about 600km from Port Moresby.",

        "content": "NIKKEI 225 (N225) Elliott Wave Analysis Trading Lounge Day Chart, NIKKEI 225 (N225) Elliott Wave technical analysis Counter Trend. Corrective. Orange Wave C. Navy Blue Wave 4. Navy blue wave 5. Orange wave B of wave 4 looking completed, now orange wave C is in play. Wave Cancel invalid level: 41239. The NIKKEI 225 Elliott Wave Analysis on the daily chart focuses on understanding the current market dynamics through the lens of the Elliott Wave Principle. This analysis identifies the function as a counter trend, indicating that the market is currently in a phase that moves against the prevailing trend. The mode of this movement is corrective, meaning it is a temporary retracement or consolidation within the larger trend. The primary wave structure under scrutiny is orange wave C, which is positioned within navy blue wave 4. This suggests that the market is in the fourth wave of a larger wave sequence, and specifically, within the third sub-wave of this fourth wave. The direction for the next higher degree is towards navy blue wave 5, which indicates that once the current corrective phase is complete, the market is expected to resume its primary trend direction in the fifth wave. Details from the analysis highlight that orange wave B of wave 4 is likely completed, setting the stage for orange wave C to come into play. Orange wave C is part of the corrective pattern and represents the final leg of the correction before the trend resumes. The completion of orange wave B signifies a pivotal point in the market, where the correction is likely moving towards its end phase, preparing for the continuation of the main trend. An invalidation level is set at 41239. This level is crucial because if the market price reaches or exceeds this point, it would invalidate the current wave count and necessitate a reevaluation of the wave structure. This invalidation level acts as a safeguard for traders, ensuring they can adjust their strategies if the market behaves unexpectedly. In summary, the NIKKEI 225 Elliott Wave Analysis on the daily chart provides a detailed outlook of the market's corrective phase within a counter trend. With orange wave B of navy blue wave 4 likely completed, the focus is now on orange wave C. Traders should be aware of the invalidation level at 41239, which serves as a critical point for reassessing the wave count. This analysis aids in making informed decisions by anticipating the next phase of market movement within the Elliott Wave framework. NIKKEI 225 (N225) Elliott Wave Analysis Trading Lounge Weekly Chart NIKKEI 225 (N225) Elliott Wave technical analysis Counter Trend. Corrective. Orange wave C. Navy Blue Wave 4. Navy Blue Wave 5. Orange wave B of wave 4 looking completed, now orange wave C is in play. 41239 The NIKKEI 225 Elliott Wave Analysis on the weekly chart provides insights into the market's current behavior using the Elliott Wave Principle. This analysis identifies the market function as a counter trend, indicating that the current movements are against the primary trend. The mode is corrective, suggesting a temporary retracement or consolidation phase rather than a continuation of the main trend. The primary wave structure being analyzed is orange wave C, which is part of a larger corrective pattern. This wave is positioned within navy blue wave 4, indicating that the market is in the fourth wave of a broader wave sequence. Following the completion of this corrective phase, the market is expected to proceed to navy blue wave 5, resuming the primary trend direction. The analysis details that orange wave B of navy blue wave 4 appears to be complete. This completion signals a critical point in the corrective pattern, as it suggests the market has finished the preceding segment of the correction and is now transitioning into orange wave C. This wave represents the final leg of the correction before the market resumes its main trend. A key aspect of the analysis is the invalidation level set at 41239. This level is crucial for traders and analysts because if the market price reaches or surpasses this point, the current wave count would be invalidated. This means the expected wave structure would no longer be valid, necessitating a reassessment of the market's wave patterns. The invalidation level serves as a safeguard, ensuring that strategies can be adjusted if the market does not behave as anticipated. In summary, the NIKKEI 225 Analysis on the weekly chart outlines a corrective phase within a counter trend. With orange wave B of navy blue wave 4 likely completed, the focus shifts to the development of orange wave C. This phase is critical as it marks the final part of the correction before the market resumes its primary trend towards navy blue wave 5. The analysis highlights the importance of the invalidation level at 41239, which helps in validating the current wave count and adjusting accordingly. Malik Awais.

Cheshire Police issued an appeal for information from members of the public after a 43-year-old man absconded from HMP Thorn Cross. He was last seen at the Appleton Thorn prison at around 6.30pm last Wednesday, May 22. The force said that the Arley Road prison inmate had links to Preston, but officers believed he could be further afield. However, Cheshire Police has today, Tuesday, confirmed that the prisoner was arrested in Lancashire last night, Monday. In its appeal, a force spokesman previously said: “Officers are currently carrying out a number of enquiries in a bid to trace him. “We are urging anyone with information as to his whereabouts to get in touch. “Anyone who sees him, or knows of his whereabouts, is urged not to approach him, but to call Cheshire Police immediately on 999.”",

        "content": "Conservative ministers and MPs are failing to \"get behind\" general election campaigning, a leaked memo from Tory headquarters sent days into the campaign has revealed. Rishi Sunak shocked the nation, and many of his party colleagues and supporters, by announcing the election would take place on July 4. It has reportedly led to consternation within the ranks with some candidates still to be selected. In Wales, there are still not candidates for every seat with less than six weeks to go to the election. The Conservatives have selected a number of seats as their priorities for the campaign. They are the Vale of Glamorgan, where Alun Cairns is MP; Ynys Mon, represented by Virginia Crosbie since the last election; Mid and south Pembrokeshire where Stephen Crabb is the candidate and Wrexham , where Sarah Atherton has been MP since 2019. For the latest Welsh news delivered to your inbox sign up to our newsletter READ MORE: The people in the running to replace Huw Edwards for the BBC's general election coverage READ MORE: How to vote in the General Election - deadline for registering and how to get a postal vote The memo had two attachments. One was a constituency breakdown with what appeared to be sanitised comments. The other had the unvarnished thoughts of Conservative staff. The email was later recalled. The \"key theme\" identified in the document was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign, with some on holiday or refusing to knock on doors. The email, reported by The Times , said Sarah Atherton, the MP for Wrexham, was accused of “refusing to engage” in the note, which said: “Wants to cancel this week’s campaigning sessions and stop CM [campaign manager] from running pre-scheduled campaigning sessions over weekend.” Ms Atherton, who shared a picture of herself on the campaign trail in Gwersyllt on May 24, has been contacted for comment. Her colleague Craig Williams, who represents Montgomeryshire, said on BBC Radio Wales: \"These internal memos come out from all parties all the time. I know Sarah, she is a class act and has been a terrific MP for Wrexham. I know for a fact, because I'm going up there to help her, that she's campaigning every single day. Whether she's engaging with one person or another person, I think that's immaterial.\" Join our General Election WhatsApp community by clicking on this link , and selecting 'Join Community'.

        "content": "La stagione di Demba Seck , giocatore classe 2001 di proprietà del Torino, non poteva andare peggio di così. A gennaio era stato mandato in prestito al Frosinone di Di Francesco. I ciociari domenica sera, sono retrocessi in Serie B, mentre è stato l’Empoli di Nicola a salvarsi. Prestito fallimentare per lui al Frosinone. Ha giocato poco e la storia è sempre la stessa: 0 gol e 0 assist. In Europa, nei top 5 campionati europei, è uno degli attaccanti che non ha segnato nemmeno 1 gol in stagione, ma con non pochi minuti giocati tra Torino e Frosinone. Inoltre, non ha giocato la Coppa d’Africa con il Senegal e le vicende extracampo lo hanno di certo condizionato. Ora farà rientro al Torino: Vagnati dovrà cercare di cederlo. Si trattava infatti di un prestito secco. Arrivato a metà stagione, ha preso il numero 8. 11 partite giocate per lui, ma solo le prime 3 da titolare. Le ultime 5, decisive per la salvezza, le ha passate in panchina (le ultime 2 in tribuna per la precisione). 0 gol e 0 assist. Contro il Napoli al Maradona (partita finita 2-2), ha sbagliato un gol a porta vuota clamoroso. Se si contano anche le presenze al Toro, quest’anno in Serie A ne ha fatte 20. Al suo arrivo il ds del Frosinone Angelozzi era molto contento. Aveva parlato di un giocatore fantastico, che poteva fare sia la punta che l’attaccante esterno. “Più di un giocatore con un solo giocatore” , aveva detto. Ora Vagnati dovrà cercare di cederlo. A prescindere da chi arriverà come nuovo allenatore, sembra finita l’era di Seck al Torino. Arrivato nella stagione 2021/2022 dalla Spal, non ha mai fatto 1 gol o fornito 1 assist in Serie A. Le vicende fuori dal campo non sono piaciute ai tifosi del Toro. La società non ha mai preso una posizione, ma quello che è successo è grave, molto grave. Il suo contratto scade nel 2025. Quest’anno si è parlato di lui più per quello che ha combinato fuori dal campo, pensare che doveva essere il sostituto di Miranchuk... Vagnati cerchi una sistemazione, al più presto.",

Македонските претставници се одлучија за вокално-инструментален ансамбл со хорот и оркестарот, како и соло настапи на пет вокали солисти и еден соло инструмент – гитара. Старата македонска песна “Учи ме мајко карај ме” беше изборот на Ангеловска за хорот и оркестарот. Оваа музичка дружина, која брои 49 члена, од кои 39 вокали, осум флејтисти и двајца гитаристи, ја “стресе” бината. Под диригентската палка на Верче, кузмановци блеснаа на отворената сцена, а за комплетен впечаток се погрижи прекрасната кореографија со автентични македонски предмети, како и рецитирањето строфа од македонската љубовна песна Дениција. „Публиката задоволна, жирито исто така. Кузман и овој пат ги освои срцата на присутните. Освоеното второ место, пехарот, медаљите и дипломите ќе останат да сведочат за овој огромен успех на ООУ ‘Кузман Јосифовски – Питу’. Паричниот ваучер ќе биде само мотив повеќе да се продолжи со работа до следното претставување на голем музички настан. Во оваа конкуренција немаше освоено прво место “, велат од училиштето. За дефилето пред завршната вечер македонија беше одбрана од страна организаторот да ја предводи долгата редица натпреварувачи низ улиците на Јесоло па ечеа македонски песни и се вееја македонски знамиња. Солистите освоија едно прво место, две втори и две трети места, како и една пофалница. Македонските претставници велат дека добиле и ексклузивна покана за прием кај градоначалникот на Јесоло, Кристофер Де Зоти, кој ги поздравил и им посакал уште поголем успех во иднина на музичките таленти од Македонија.",

        "content": "LAGOS – Mr. Olaniyi Adigun, the Chairman, Aviation Ground Handling Association of Nigeria (AGHAN), has been conferred with the 2023 Aviation Personality of the Year award. The award was bestowed on Adigun at the 10th edition of the Nigeria Transport Lecture, organised by Nigeria Transport Award, publishers of the Transport Day, held on Thursday at Raddison Blu Hotel, Government Reserved Area (G.R.A), Ikeja, Lagos. The glamorous ceremony convened by Mr. Frank Kintum, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Transport Day, is an annual event where eminent personalities who have distinguished themselves in professional excellence and service to humanity in the private and public sectors are honoured. According to Kintum, Adigun was conferred with the special award in recognition of his huge contribution to the development of the aviation industry, especially the ground handling sub-sector where he has made a huge milestone in over three decades. Kintum explained that Adigun was selected for the award by the board and management of Transport Day after emerging tops in the polls conducted by the team. He specifically said that since Adigun was appointed the Chairman of AGHAN, he had been able to reposition the ground handling companies in the sector and worked endlessly to ensure a review of the former handling rates, which had been in existence in the last three decades. He said: “Mr. Olaniyi Adigun, the President of AGHAN was nominated for this honour after a rigorous exercise, which focused on his activities and achievements in the Nigerian aviation industry, spanning over three decades. Adigun through his works, has consistently promoted safety, which is the hallmark of the global aviation industry. “We want to use this medium to call on Adigun to continue to do more for the growth and development of the Nigerian aviation industry. To whom much is given, much more is expected from him.” In his speech, Adigun thanked the organisers of the event for finding him worthy to be selected for the honour. He also expressed delight at the achievements of AGHAN, but maintained that the association and the successes recorded were not about him, but its entire members. He added that the award had thrown AGHAN up for more good work. He said: “I feel very elated, appreciated and privileged to be awarded as the Aviation Personality of the Year 2023 after a long effort that we put into the sector, especially in the ground handling sector of the industry. “It is unfortunate that the ground handling sub-sector of the aviation industry has not been given fair deal and attention by the government and its agencies, but some organisations in the sector have realised the enormous work that we do and awarded me the honour. “Like I do say, the government and its agencies are always losing money because of unfair competition in the handling sub-sector of the industry, especially between the two major ground handling companies. AGHAN as a body, has been trying to bring the major competitors together for the enhanced Nigerian economy and we pray this will work out very soon and for the betterment of the industry and the country at large.” He regretted that the airlines were taking full advantage of the unhealthy competition between the two major ground handling companies, but said since AGHAN came onboard a few years ago, such unwholesome practice had reduced to the barest minimum. Adigun came into the aviation industry in 1993 as a staff of the defunct national carrier, Nigeria Airways. At the Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO), he rose through the ranks to become its Executive Director, Sales & Marketing from 2018- 2024. During his stay, the department was able to implement various sales and marketing strategies that increased the company’s revenue significantly, while its number of clienteles increased tremendously. Adigun was also appointed the pioneer Chairman of AGHAN in 2021.",

        "content": "Op 24 mei kwam een delegatie van Fairtrade Ambacht op de bezoek in oudheidkamer Den Brommert. Ze had voor het Historisch Genootschap een certificaat bij zich. Hierop wordt vermeld dat het Genootschap zich vanaf heden Fairtrade organisatie mag noemen. In het cadeauwinkeltje Den Brommert worden tegenwoordig ook bepaalde Fairtrade producten verkocht. De nieuwe voorzitter van het Genootschap, Herman Jonker, verwelkomde de delegatie in Den Brommert. Hij memoreerde de steeds belangrijker plaats die de oudheidkamer met het winkeltje de laatste tijd in de Ambachtse samenleving inneemt. De vereniging wordt gedragen door ongeveer 70 vrijwilligers, die zich allen Pro Deo voor bepaalde werkzaamheden in de organisatie inzetten. Ook het cadeauwinkeltje in het monumentale pand wordt door steeds meer Ambachters ontdekt en gewaardeerd. Met de verkoop van bepaalde artikelen hoopt het Genootschap de doelstellingen van de Fairtrade organisatie te bevorderen. Floor van de Velde dankte het Genootschap dat ze ook Fairtrade organisatie wil worden. Veel winkels en horecabedrijven zijn het Genootschap al voorgegaan. Binnenkort zijn er in ons dorp al zoveel certificaten afgegeven zodat Ambacht zich thans Fairtrade gemeente mag noemen. Ooit begonnen met de bekende Max Havelaar koffie heeft de organisatie zich ontwikkeld tot een brede wereldwijde organisatie, die steeds meer erkenning en waardering krijgt. Het gaat daarbij om eerlijke handel, waardoor boeren en producenten een eerlijke prijs voor hun producten krijgen en kunnen werken onder gezonde en veilige omstandigheden. Milieudoelstellingen krijgen de laatste jaren steeds aandacht. Van de Velde memoreerde ook dat zich in het cadeauwinkeltje Den Brommert vroeger een wereldwinkel gevestigd was, Via de verkoop van veel producten werd dus al een aantal jaren geleden vanuit dit gebouw de Fairtrade gedachte in ons dorp uitgedragen. Die situatie is weer terug. Historisch Genootschap Arie Verhoeven",

        "content": "It has been almost two years since Joaquin Domagoso became a father to his son, Scott. In his interview on Tuesday's \"Fast Talk with Boy Abunda,\" the Sparkle star shared that the little boy has started schooling. \"I'm happy where my son is. He started school officially, so congrats to little Scott. Every day, new memories are being made,\" Joaquin said. The young actor said that he stands by the decisions he made. \"My career won't stop itself because of my decisions because my will is as strong as my love for my son,\" he said. When asked what he discovered about himself as he goes through fatherhood, Joaquin said, \"That I can work harder than I think I can't. There are things na before, I feel like, 'Hindi, kaya ko 'yon, pabayaan na, 'wag na.'\" Now that he is already a dad, Joaquin said that he has also become a role model. \"Kumbaga if I don't do these things, my son won't—'di niya ako susundan,\" he said. \"And there are other things na, kumbaga, work. Working a 9-5 job, realizing it how other people would go through it. 'Yung tipong you wake up for your son, you do all these things. Tapos 'yung at the end of the day, uuwi ka, hinihintay ka pa rin. All the joys. 'Yung purpose ko sa buhay, nabuo.\" Joaquin did not share much about his current relationship status. \"Sa aking love life ngayon po, I don't want to say anything too much, but right now, I'm in a very happy place,\" he said. Joaquin's dad, Isko Moreno , first revealed in July 2022 that Joaquin had welcomed a baby boy with Raffa Castro . In a previous interview on the show, Joaquin admitted that he felt scared of becoming a father , but his father was supportive about it. \"He was dancing. Sumasayaw si Papa,\" he said. \"Nawala 'yung stress ko 'cause I was so scared to tell them like what is my dad gonna say? Baka magalit. Magagalit sila.\" Joaquin currently appears in GMA Afternoon Prime series \" Lilet Matias: Attorney-at-Law ,\" which airs weekdays at 3:20 p.m. after \"Abot-Kamay Na Pangarap.\"",

        "content": "Не, ова не е класичното благо ривалство помеѓу браќата и сестрите. Знаците кои се љубоморни на своите блиски можат да одат чекор понатаму. Дури и кога се млади, овие хороскопски знаци се однесуваат прилично лошо со своите браќа и сестри. Тие се љубоморни, конкурентни и бараат внимание од родителите само за нив. Нивните родители секојдневно мораат да се справуваат со расправии и викање низ дома, а често има моменти кога мораат да носат и мировен шлем. Ако Овенот е првото дете во семејството, тогаш проблемот е уште поголем. Тие ги гледаат своите браќа и сестри како закана и конкуренција. Претставниците на овој знак се многу себични и сакаат се да биде нивно. Не знаат да ги споделат работите и доколку нивните помлади роднини не се послушни, тоа ќе биде голем проблем што ќе треба да го решат на свој начин. Што секако нема да биде одлично решение. Шкорпиите се многу љубоморни и посесивни. Сакаат се за себе. Поточно, тие сакаат се или ништо. Ќе направат се за да земат се од нивните браќа и сестри затоа што се разбира, тоа (што и да е) им припаѓа само нив. Ќе станат злобни и ќе им постават стапица на своите роднини. Тие се посесивни дури и кога се во прашање нивните родители и веруваат дека му припаѓаат нему и не сакаат да ги делат со никого. Биковите функционираат на сличен начин како и Шкорпиите. Тие се и многу посесивни и љубоморни и сакаат се за себе. Ним им треба целото внимание, без разлика дали се работи за игра, музичка изведба или само соба во куќата. Тоа е доволно само за нив и ништо друго не им треба. Иако се на крај, немојте да мислите дека тие се помалку конкурентни или љубоморни од другите знаци. Особено, ако се првородени. Тогаш тие се за нијанса позлобни кон своите роднини. Тоа е затоа што чувствува дека неговиот престол е дома. Зошто дојдовте во семејството и зошто сите одеднаш се загрижени за вас? Ова е особено проблематично ако другото дете се гледа како слатко и привлекува внимание.",

        "description": "Donderdag 23 mei vond de jaarlijkse Bedrijvenroute Zwijndrecht plaats. Dan brengen tweedejaars leerlingen van het voortgezet onderwijs een bezoek aan verschillende bedrijven ter oriëntatie van hun profielkeuze.",
        "content": ". Leerlingen kiezen een beroepsprofiel in hun tweede leerjaar van het voortgezet onderwijs. Dat dit doorgaans geen gemakkelijke keuze is weet ook Esther Smit, de gemeentelijke accountmanager van Zwijndrecht Onderneemt: ”De Bedrijvenroute is jaarlijks en komt vanuit de Ondernemersvereniging Zwijndrecht. Tweedejaars leerlingen van het Develstein College, Loket Zwijndrecht, Het Walburg College en twee vierdejaars klassen van de Sprong doen eraan mee. Dus alle Zwijndrechtse scholen van het voortgezet onderwijs zijn vertegenwoordigd. Per bus bezoeken leerlingen met hun docent diverse bedrijven en instellingen in Zwijndrecht, die aansluiten bij hun interesse. Dit helpt hen om hun uiteindelijke keuzerichting te definiëren. Want een beroepskeuze maken op die jonge leeftijd is niet eenvoudig. Eigenlijk kun je het zien als een taart met diverse lagen: de leerlingen snuffelen aan alle facetten van het bedrijfsleven. Daarom is deze tour ook zo’n succes. We organiseren dit met een heel team, waarin Menno Hooimeijer van de Ondernemersvereniging Zwijndrecht een belangrijk aandeel heeft. Bedrijven kunnen zichzelf ook aanmelden. Het is een forse logistieke uitdaging, maar het is het zeker waard. Zo weet ik dat een leerling van 12 jaren geleden meeging met de route en nu bij een van die bedrijven werkzaam is.” “De leerlingen bepalen van te voren de richting van hun voorkeur. De keuze bestaat uit een pakket van bedrijven die ze kunnen bezoeken. Ze kunnen dan terecht komen bij de brandweer, een nagelstyliste of bij een mondhygiëniste. Sommige leerlingen hebben een scherper beeld van hun beroepskeuze dan anderen. Om te toetsen hoever ze in hun proces zijn krijgen de jongeren een werkboekje met opdrachten mee. Zo moeten zij bijvoorbeeld een interview houden met een werknemer van de bedrijven die ze bezoeken. Een aantal reacties die betrokkenen achterlieten op de website van de bedrijvenroute geven blijk van een succesvolle strategie: “Aan de hand van mijn vragen, ontdekte ik of dit bedrijf bij mij zou passen. Het was een mooi gesprek en zeker een leuk bedrijfsbezoek” , vindt een Develstein College-leerling. De office manager van Yellow Works had ook een positieve indruk: “ Voor mij was het de eerste keer dat ik meedeed aan de route. Als bedrijf vind ik het belangrijk dat jongeren kunnen zien waar ze in de toekomst kunnen werken.” En een begeleidend docent van Loket geeft een voorbeeld van een gestelde vraag: “Het was een soort speurtocht door het bedrijf heen en leerlingen konden hun vragen stellen. Een van de vragen was: ‘Met welk product uit jullie bedrijf maken jullie de meeste winst?’. Als docent ben ik super trots op mijn leerlingen”. De Bedrijvenroute wordt jaarlijks mogelijk gemaakt door Ondernemersvereniging Zwijndrecht, daarbij geholpen door de accountmanagers van Zwijndrecht Onderneemt in het zoeken naar matches en financieel mogelijk gemaakt door het Ondernemersfonds Zwijndrecht en de Gemeente Zwijndrecht.",

        "content": "Here we bring you the latest news from across League One and Two for Tuesday May 28. Join the debate on our social media channels Manager Martin Paterson has left Burton Albion after the club narrowly avoided relegation from League One, BBC Radio Derby reports. The role at Pirelli Stadium was the 37-year-old former Swansea City, Barnsley and Inter Miami assistant manager's first job in charge of a senior side. Thoughts? “It’s been in the works for a while. I’m really looking forward to getting started. “I had positive chats with the manager and it’s a club with real potential with the project and the plans that he has got in place. “The run the club went on towards the end of last season made everyone pay attention. It’s a good club with a good manager and I’m hoping we can do good things.” League Two champs Stockport County have a new man. Jay Mingi has joined from Colchester. Notts County have signed Bradford City defender Matty Platt on a two-year contract - the League Two club's first summer signing. Platt, 26, moves to Meadow Lane on a free transfer following two years with the Bantams. He moved to Valley Parade after three years at Barrow, who he helped win promotion back to the Football League Two in 2020. \"Jay had a fantastic back end of the League Two season at Colchester,\" \"He showed his versatility and intelligence, switching from a familiar central midfield role to wide centre-back, right-back and right wing-back at times. “We believe he has real potential to develop, whilst immediately having the physical characteristics of being on the front foot, aggressive and quick, which will allow him to flourish in League One.\" \"It became apparent during the review that the club and Pete had different perspectives on the way forward,\" \"So it was mutually agreed that this was the best and most appropriate way to proceed. \"We wish Pete well in his future endeavours.\" What do you make of Pete Wild’s sacking?

        "description": "A landslide that occurred in Papua New Guinea is believed to have buried over 2,000 people. Experts are attributing this disaster to massive tectonic forces, tribal conflicts, and the presence of mosquitoes, trying to understand the severity of the situation. Papua New Guinea is known as one of the most disaster-prone nations globally.",
        "content": "PORT MORESBY: A landslide in Papua New Guinea is feared to have buried more than 2,000 people, with experts pointing to colossal tectonic forces, tribal clashes and mosquitoes to make sense of the crisis. One of the most disaster-prone nations in the world, Papua New Guinea occupies a slice of the southwest Pacific that is frequently battered by earthquakes, flooding and volcanic eruptions. But even by these volatile standards, the emergency unfolding in the highlands of Enga province could rank among the country's most lethal natural disasters . Here's why: The bustling highlands community on the shoulder of Mount Mungalo was destroyed when a landslide struck in the early hours of Friday morning. Scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them were buried beneath an avalanche of boulders, mud and uprooted trees. Papua New Guinea sits atop the seismic Ring of Fire, an arc of intense tectonic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin. \"Papua New Guinea sits right on a plate boundary, where these large, rigid parts of the earth plough into each other,\" University of Adelaide geologist Alan Collins told AFP. \"This creates mountains, steep slopes and other extreme topography. \"You have these steep slopes located in an area of heavy rainfall, and this can rot the minerals in the rocks, and gradually weaken them.\" Human influences, such as the clearing of native forests, made the slopes of these highland mountains even more precarious. \"You put all of those things together, and you can create a very unstable environment,\" Collins said. Lying just south of the equator, Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world. Research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could further exacerbate the risk of landslides. As disaster workers entered the remote disaster zone, they realised population estimates failed to account for dozens of families seeking sanctuary in the area. Serhan Aktoprak, chief of the United Nations ' migration agency in Papua New Guinea, said the \"internally displaced\" Tulpar people had moved into the village \"as they escaped from another tribal conflict elsewhere\". Highland clans have fought each other in Papua New Guinea for centuries, but a recent influx of mercenaries and automatic weapons has inflamed tensions. The Red Cross estimates as many as 30,000 people are displaced by tribal violence in Papua New Guinea every year. Papua New Guinea has one of the least concentrated urban populations in the world. Some 40 percent of people are thought to eschew its coastal cities in favour of highland regions in the country's interior. The highlands are a mix of rolling jungle mountains, dense tropical rainforests and twisting river valleys. Nestled amongst this unforgiving terrain are some of the fastest growing and most densely packed communities in the country. There are myriad factors that could explain this, including high rates of polygyny, falling death rates and long-formed attachments to ancestral homelands. Most highland communities occupy a kind of \"goldilocks zone\", sitting at altitudes between 1,400 metres (4,600 feet) and 2,600 metres high. Researchers have found this helps them stave off the risk of malarial infections that run rampant through lower-lying areas. Reliable census figures are notoriously difficult to get in Papua New Guinea, hampered by the difficult terrain, severe weather, and remoteness of many communities. While the country's official population is given as 10 million, some demographers suggest the number of citizens could be almost twice as high. Enga provincial administrator Sandis Tsaka said officials had first gauged the size of the disaster-struck community using an outdated electoral roll that only counted those 18 and older. These initial underestimates of the community's population helped to explain why death toll figures have jumped around so much. Early estimates in the immediate aftermath of the landslide suggested a death toll between 100 and 500 people. Days later these figures would be drastically revised by the country's National Disaster Centre -- which stated \"more than 2,000 people\" were feared to be \"buried alive\". It could take weeks before anything near a definitive number emerges. Papua New Guinea's northern coast was swamped by a 10 metre (30 foot) tsunami in 1998, killing more than 2,200 people in one of the country's worst natural disasters.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email In the world of finance where new changes are occurring at a very fast pace, investments through conventional finance and the incorporation of technology like artificial intelligence are not just a trend but a revolution. This fusion is empowering the investment ecosystem for transparency, open access, and future-readiness bringing financial opportunities closer to everyone. At the center of this process, there are two key areas – artificial intelligence and blockchain, which are actively getting involved in the recreation of people’s vision of investments. Big data, through the use of artificial intelligence and other predictive analytical tools, is enhancing the opportunities for making sound investment decisions while blockchain is the godsend for truly secure financial transactions. In parallel, the mentioned technologies are providing the foundation for new trends like tokenized assets, decentralized finance (DeFi), and relatively a new approach – DeFi or Regenerative Finance, based on the investment in social and environmental initiatives. Thus, Tokenized assets with the help of blockchain technology, it is a step forward. In essence, through the tokenization of physical assets using blockchain, investors can own a fraction of the asset because the technology subdivides the ownership rights to the underlying asset into smaller portions. This democratization of assets applies to various fields of the economy and have started with real estate assets, artworks, and even unique rarities. Furthermore, AI occupies a crucial place in this environment because it offers the instruments for the precise analysis of the great amount of information and anticipating market behaviors. For instance, using AI algorithms is possible to detect attractive investments’ options in real-time and thus maximize investment outcomes. We observe this symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain in such areas such as digital coins and tokens that have become fashionable. These digital assets usually have initial and/or subsequent rewards where more or new coin holders are bestowed with free tokens making the cryptocurrency investment more attractive and easily accessible. This though creates the potential of making huge profits through these unique financial entities. _algoic trading strategies are capable of making trades in a very short time and exploiting gaps in the overall market that may not be apparent to a human trader. While the above mentioned transactions have a lot of possibility of being fraudulent or manipulated, with the use of blockchain, it maximizes the security and transparency as well. This high-performance, high-speed, highly effective system is a significant improvement and will be of tremendous help to experienced investors and newcomers alike. Moreover, establishing ReFi as the trend of investment with an aim is proving to be rather popular. As integrated AI and blockchain solutions, ReFi projects work to create positive social and environmental impacts alongside solutions for money. Such projects may involve climate change solutions like energy generation from natural sources, efficient farming, and social justice products, which give individuals an opportunity to invest in the future and generate profits. Another work in progress key feature of the evolution of the investment landscape is decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. These platforms utilize blockchain technology to dispose of the middlemen and cut the costs but at the same time improved efficacy. DeFi puts people in the position of providing and requesting funds, goods, or services, with others and often presents artificial intelligence solutions to perform the necessary operations. Due to this transparency, all transactions made and captured in the block chain are traceable by the public thereby minimizing on cases of disputations and increasing trust among the players involved. Furthermore, the usage of airdrop has evolved as a vital strategy for attracting the community and involving the users in the DeFi ecosystem. It explains how through providing a variety of tokens users with free tokens DeFi projects can gain popularity very quickly and encourage people to engage in activities within their platforms. Integrating AI into Defi platforms enhances some of the functionality of DeFi platforms in the following ways. AI can be applied to identify users’ behavior and patterns, market trends and fluctuations, and provide recommendations on which investments should be made, how they should be distributed, and which direction the market is likely to take nex so you can make moneyt. Such level of customization and idea of future in financial aspect was beyond the boldest scenario in traditional finance.

        "content": "El Salvador, the smallest and most densely populated country in Central America, is experiencing a significant economic transformation. With over 80 companies establishing their operations in the nation, it’s becoming a hub for diverse business activities. This surge in corporate presence is a testament to the country’s strategic efforts to diversify its economy and create a more conducive environment for business growth. Historically, El Salvador’s economy was heavily reliant on agriculture, with coffee exports being the primary source of revenue. However, the turn of the century marked a pivotal shift as the country adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency, paving the way for increased trade and financial links. This move, coupled with the expansion of the manufacturing sector, has reduced the nation’s dependence on coffee and positioned it as an attractive destination for international businesses. The list of companies operating in El Salvador is diverse, ranging from financial institutions like the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador to telecommunications giants such as Claro El Salvador and Tigo El Salvador. The country also boasts a vibrant media landscape with entities like El Faro and La Prensa Gráfica, reflecting a robust mass media sector.

These startups not only contribute to the economy but also bring fresh ideas and technologies to the forefront. The retail sector in El Salvador is not left behind, with companies like SIMAN and Supermercados Super Selectos providing a wide range of consumer goods. The Unicomer Group, a retailer of durable goods and electronics, signifies the growth potential in the consumer services industry. El Salvador’s commitment to nurturing a business-friendly environment is evident in its support for these companies. The government’s initiatives to streamline business operations, enhance legal frameworks, and invest in infrastructure have played a crucial role in attracting and retaining businesses. The influx of companies in El Salvador is a positive indicator of the country’s economic health and its potential for future growth. It’s a narrative of resilience and strategic adaptation, showcasing how a nation can pivot from traditional economic models to embrace globalization and technological advancements. Moreover, El Salvador’s adoption of the U.S. dollar as its official currency has streamlined financial transactions and bolstered investor confidence. This economic stability, coupled with the government’s efforts to diversify the economy, has made the country an attractive destination for foreign investment. The presence of these companies signifies a positive shift in El Salvador’s economic landscape, promising a future of prosperity and opportunity. As El Salvador continues to welcome businesses from around the globe, it stands as a testament to the resilience and entrepreneurial spirit of its people. As El Salvador continues to welcome businesses from various sectors, it stands as a beacon of economic opportunity in Central America. The country’s journey is a compelling story of transformation, one that other nations looking to revitalize their economies can learn from. El Salvador’s progress serves as a reminder that with the right policies and a focus on innovation, even the smallest countries can make a significant impact on the global economic stage.",

        "content": "DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — The weakening tropical storm Remal flooded dozens of coastal villages and left nearly 30 million people without power Monday in southern Bangladesh and eastern India. At least 10 people died in Bangladesh. About 3.7 million people along the coast were affected, said Bangladesh's junior minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibbur Rahman. More than 35,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 115,000 were damaged. Nearly 800,000 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas on Sunday. Bangladesh, a delta nation of nearly 170 million people, has a history of violent storms. Disaster preparedness programs have upgraded the capacity to tackle natural disasters, resulting in fewer casualties. Changing climate patterns have increased storms' intensity, making preparations more urgent. Remal weakened after making landfall in Bangladesh's Patuakhali district early Monday, with sustained winds of 111 kilometers (69 miles) per hour. India's Meteorological Department said it was likely to weaken throughout the day, but warned of heavy showers over Assam and other northeastern states for the next two days. India's Kolkata airport reopened after being shut Sunday. Bangladesh shut the airport in the country's second largest city, Chattogram, and canceled all domestic flights to and from the coastal district of Cox's Bazar. Loading and unloading at Chittagong seaport was halted. Strong rain and winds battered the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. Many roads were submerged. Authorities ordered all government officials to stay at their stations until the situation improved. Aid agencies said they deployed thousands of volunteers in Rohingya refugee camps and other affected areas to provide emergency support. Bangladesh has sprawling camps housing more than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in Cox's Bazar. In India's West Bengal state, thatched roofs on houses were blown away and electric poles and trees were uprooted in some coastal districts. Heavy downpours inundated streets and homes in low-lying areas of Kolkata. All schools in the region were closed until further notice. ___ AP video journalist Al-emrun Garjon contributed to this report.",

        "content": "EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Tuesday urged countries to balance fear of escalation against Ukraine's need to defend itself, saying Kyiv had the right to use Western arms to strike in Russia. \"According with the law of war, it is perfectly possible and there is no contradiction. \"I could retaliate or I could fight against the one who fights against me from his territory,\" Borrell said at the start of a meeting with European Union defence ministers. \"You have to balance the risk of escalation and the need for Ukrainians to defend.\" Ukraine has been pressing its Western backers to allow it to hit targets in Russia using the longer-range weaponry Kyiv's supporters are supplying. Key backers including the United States and Germany have been reluctant to permit Kyiv to strike over the border out of fear that it could drag them closer to direct conflict with Moscow. Borrell's assertion was backed up by several other defence ministers at the gathering in Brussels. Dutch minister Kajsa Ollongren said The Netherlands had no restrictions and that she hoped \"other countries that have different positions will change that\". \"It is quite feasible that they have to strike also inside Russia,\" Ollongren said. \"My perspective is that should not be the debate.\" Estonia's Hanno Pevkur said he \"truly hopes that all the countries who have these assets will also give the permission to Ukraine\". \"It cannot be normal that Russia is attacking from very deep into Ukrainian territory and the Ukrainians are fighting with one hand behind their back,\" he said. The calls came after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday \"the time had come\" for allies to reconsider their restrictions, especially as Russia is pounding the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv from its own territory. The debate over Ukrainian strikes inside Russia comes as NATO countries are struggling to come up with air defence systems desperately needed by Kyiv. Stoltenberg said last month that allies had agreed to give more air defences but since then there have been no new systems pledged. Dutch minister Ollongren said The Netherlands was now working on an initiative to assemble a Patriot air defence system in close cooperation with several partners to send to Ukraine. \"We will deliver, from our own capabilities, several parts of the system so that we can assemble the whole system and deliver it to Ukraine,\" she said.

        "content": "PORT MORESBY — Papua New Guinea authorities say nearly 7,900 people living near the site of a deadly landslide are \"at risk\" as rock and debris continue to move down the hillside. An alert for potential evacuation has been put out, with a province official saying the mountain remains \"very active\". Rescuers say it is increasingly unlikely that victims will be found alive in the rubble. The country's disaster agency says it fears about 2,000 people were buried when a mountainside collapsed last Friday. This is much higher than the UN's estimate of about 670 victims. The UN says it has been difficult to establish an exact death toll as access to the site and those buried under the mass remain difficult. Part of that is due to complications around the search and recovery mission, which has now largely turned into a retrieval operation of bodies, various UN officials have said. \"It is not a rescue mission, it is a recovery mission,\" Niels Kraaier from Unicef Papua New Guinea told news agency AFP. \"It is very unlikely they will have survived.\" Only six bodies had been recovered as of Tuesday, according to local officials. Villagers have been using using shovels, sticks and their bare hands to try and remove huge rocks and rubble amid hold-ups in the arrival of heavy machinery, and also cultural sensitivities around the use of such machines like excavators near bodies. Standing in a crowd of mourners on Monday, local resident Jiman Yandam said people would keep digging manually to try and recover victims. \"We don't know where the bodies are buried, but we will not give up, we will keep going,\" the former community leader told Reuters news agency. One woman, standing in the wreckage, described feeling helpless. \"I have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I am standing on, and a lot more family members in the village I cannot count,\" Evit Kambu said. \"But I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.\" The terrain remains dangerous as rocks continue to fall. Videos taken during the day have shown rocks tumbling down the mountain. “It’s still very active. The mountain is breaking up, \" Sandis Tsaka, Enga Provincial Administrator told the BBC. \"There’s continuous movement of rock and debris which is making our search and rescue and recovery operations a challenge,\" he added. The rubble remains 10m deep in some places and the mass of debris is still moving down the hillside, prompting authorities to alert nearby communities to the risk and issuing evacuation notices. \"Because of the landslide, the impact area of the landslide is gradually increasing. So the homes and properties that were not affected by the original landslide area are growing every day,\" Mr Tsaka said. Another village close to the first-hit Yambali village was now also in danger, he said. There is also growing alarm over the risk of infection and disease in the area as the mass of bodies trapped under the rubble begin to decay. The UN had warned that currents were flowing down the hillside under the rubble. \"The water that is stuck between the ground and the debris is flowing - and the bodies are starting to decay. Can you image [the impact] on more than 2,000 bodies buried under this land- unable to be removed,\" UN migration agency official Serhan Aktoprak told the BBC on Tuesday. Amid the treacherous conditions, aid groups say they are focusing on the immediate task of getting basic supplies like food, water and hygiene kits to residents. But there have been several barriers- including the highway to the village being blocked and damaged by the landslide. ​On Tuesday, it was reported that a bridge south of the landslide area, connecting province centers Hagen and Wabeg, had also collapsed making it more difficult for humanitarian groups delivering relief. Australia has pledged an airlift of supplies which is expected to arrive on Wednesday. Local officials say about 3,800 people had been living in the hillside village prior to the landslide, which took place around 03:00 on Friday morning and flattened more than 150 homes. The mountain's collapse has been attributed to weeks of heavy rain and other wet conditions in the area. Prime Minister James Marape had earlier in the week sent his condolences and directed national response teams to the region. The disaster comes as Mr Marape faces political pressure - parliament was expected to vote on a no-confidence motion against him on Tuesday. — BBC < Previous Page Next Page >",

        "description": "Cancer Research UK said around 17,000 melanoma cases every year are preventable",
        "content": "Melanoma skin cancer cases are at an all-time high, with 20,800 people expected to be diagnosed this year in the UK. Analysis by Cancer Research UK shows rates of melanoma have increased by almost a third over a decade, from 21 to 28 per 100,000 people between 2007-09 and 2017-19. Among those aged over 80, there was a 57% rise, while among those aged 25 to 49 there was a 7% increase. Cancer Research UK said around 17,000 melanoma cases every year are preventable, with almost nine in 10 caused by too much ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV from the sun can damage DNA in skin cells and cause skin cancer. The charity advises people spend time in the shade, especially between 11am and 3pm; cover up with clothes, a wide-brimmed hat, UV-protection sunglasses and a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and 4 or 5 stars, applied often. Cancer Research UK's chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, said: \"Survival from cancers including melanoma continues to improve, demonstrating the substantial progress made possible by research. But it's vital that people try to reduce their risk of getting the disease in the first place. \"Make sure to take care in the sun and contact your GP if you notice any unusual changes to your skin whether a new or changing mole, a sore that doesn't heal, or an area of your skin that looks out of the ordinary. Spotting cancer early can make all the difference.\" According to the charity, younger people are more aware of the link between the sun and skin cancer than those who are older, who may have taken advantage of the \"cheap package holiday boom\" from the 1960s onwards. Other factors driving up cases include a growing and ageing population and improved awareness of the symptoms of skin cancer. Figures show, however, that more people are surviving melanoma, with deaths expected to continue to fall. Almost nine in 10 adults diagnosed with melanoma in England will now survive their disease for a decade or more. Dr Claire Knight, senior health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: \"Getting sunburnt just once every two years can triple the risk of developing skin cancer, compared to never being burnt. Whether you are enjoying the good abroad or here at home, it's important to protect yourself from too much sun, especially if you burn easily.\" \"Remember that sunburn doesn't only happen when it's hot it can happen on cooler or cloudier days too. The best way to protect your skin when the sun is strong is to use shade, clothing and sunscreen together. \"Seek shade in the middle of the day, cover up with a shirt that covers your shoulders, a hat and sunglasses and wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and 4 or 5 stars. Make sure you put plenty on and reapply it regularly.\" Last month, experts told how the world's first personalised mRNA cancer jab for melanoma which also has the potential to stop lung, bladder and kidney cancer is being tested in British patients. The \"gamechanger\" jab, which offers hope of a cure, is custom-built for each person in just a few weeks. A stage 2 trial of the jab, involving pharma firms Moderna and MSD, found it dramatically reduced the risk of the cancer returning in melanoma patients. A final phase 3 trial is now running, led by University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH).",

        "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya, May 28 – The Council of Governors have lauded Members of Parliament for reaching a consensus to allocate Sh400 billion to devolved units following protracted battles between the two houses on the shareable revenue allocation. The County Bosses expressed their gratitude to Senators for remaining adamant to push the shareable revenue to counties upwards by Sh9 billion in the incoming financial year 2024/2025 which commences in June. “Devolution is sacrosanct in the constitution and adequately resourcing functions that counties are mandated to deliver is progressive and a welcome move,” COG chairperson Waiguru stated. The mediation team of the two houses reached a consensus following differing proposal as the Senate initially pushing to have Counties allocated Sh415 billion while the National Assembly wanted the counties allocated Sh391 billion. The stalemate on the matter was ironed out after the Senate and National Assembly reached an agreement over the allocation for shareable revenue in the financial year 2024/2025 following days taken in lengthy deliberations. National Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Ndindi Nyoro who co-chaired the talks exuded confidence that progress had been made. “The Senate has agreed to reduce their figure by Sh15 billion while the National Assembly has agreed to push up its earlier figure by Sh9 billion in the spirit of give and take so that we can resolve this matter and allow Counties to get their increased allocation from Sh385 billion in the last financial year,” Nyoro stated. Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi who co-chaired committee called upon county bosses to ensure championing of development in their respective counties through prudent use of resources. “We have held lengthy deliberations and we are all in agreement that devolution I’d working and that it should be supported by ensuring that counties get sufficient funds to carry out the devolved functions,” Murungi said. Senate Speaker Amason Kingi and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula appointed nine members each to join the mediation team so as to iron out the stalemate that would have affected the counties. Murungi and Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro were elected as the co- chairmen for the mediation committee. Wetangula appointed Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Teso South MP Mary Emase, Ugenya MP David Ochieng, Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi, Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto,Kitutu Chache North MP Japheth Nyakundi,Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda, Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu, and Garsen MP Ali Wario to be members of this team. Kingi appointed Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi, Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna, Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago, Machakos Senator Kavindu Muthama, Marsabit Senator Mohammed Chute and Migori Senator Eddy Oketch to be members of the committee.

        "description": "I carri armati di Israele sono stati avvistati vicino alla moschea Al-Awda, un punto di riferimento nel centro di Rafah. La situazione è sempre più delicata",
        "content": "I carri armati delle Forze di difesa israeliane (Idf) hanno raggiunto il centro di Rafah . I mezzi di Israele sono stati avvistati nei pressi della moschea di Al-Awda, a tre settimane dall'inizio di un'operazione di terra nella città più meridionale di Gaza. Tel Aviv continua a martellare quest'area, come dimostrano gli ultimi blitz realizzati all'alba. Sono stati infatti segnalati bombardamenti dell'artiglieria che hanno preso di mira i minareti di diverse moschee nei quartieri Al-Saudi e Tal Al-Sultan. Al dossier militare si aggiunge il dramma umanitario che non sembra conoscere fine. I video pubblicati da attivisti palestinesi sui social media hanno mostrato l'inizio dello sfollamento di un gran numero di famiglie palestinesi dalla zona di Tal al-Sultan. Le scene mostravano un gruppo di donne, uomini e bambini che trasportavano i loro bagagli e camminavano verso le zone centrali della Striscia. Cosa succede a Rafah Le Idf hanno inviato una nuova brigata che si unirà alle altre 5 che sono penetrate a Rafah, secondo quanto annunciato dalla radio dell'esercito israeliano. Si tratta di una mossa considerata un'espansione dell'operazione militare in corso dal 6 maggio scorso. La Brigata Bislamach è entrata nella città lunedì, ed è la sesta brigata che combatte in quella zona. Conosciuta localmente come la scuola dell'esercito israeliano per le professioni di fanteria e i capisquadra in tempo di guerra, questa brigata è stata fondata nel 1974; i suoi soldati avevano precedentemente partecipato a combattimenti a Khan Yunis, nel sud di Gaza, e in altre località della Striscia. La notizia dei tank entrati nel centro di Rafah è arrivata mentre le truppe dell'Idf, come detto, hanno continuato a operare nell'area durante la notte (e non solo). I soldati israeliani hanno operato lungo la Philadelphi Route, conducendo operazioni chirurgiche basate su informazioni di intelligence che indicavano obiettivi terroristici. Al momento i media israeliani riferiscono che non ci sono commenti da parte dell'Idf: i militari affermano che rilasceranno una dichiarazione sull'operazione a Rafah nel corso della giornata. Sul web circolano tuttavia vari filmati di Al Jazeera che mostrano i carri armatidi Tel Aviv avanzare verso il centro della città. Il dramma umanitario Nelle ultime tre settimane un milione di palestinesi ha lasciato la città di Rafah. Secondo quanto comunicato dall'Agenzia delle Nazioni Unite per il soccorso e l'occupazione dei profughi palestinesi nel vicino oriente (Unrwa), ciò è accaduto senza un posto sicuro dove andare, tra bombardamenti, carenza di cibo e acqua e cumuli di rifiuti. L'agenzia scrive inoltre che \"fornire assistenza e protezione è diventato quasi impossibile\" nella Striscia di Gaza. In mattinata, intanto, è stato segnalato un attacco israeliano nella zona di Al-Hashashin . Fonti locali riferiscono di 7 persone uccise e altre 6 ferite nel corso di un bombardamento. Un uomo palestinese che ha assistito all’attacco ha riferito ad Al Jazeera : \"E ra una zona sicura che si era riempita di tende e sfollati. Improvvisamente, un missile è caduto sull'edificio, che era stato costruito usando alcuni blocchi e tubi metallici.",

Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters A woman was left gobsmacked after scooping an incredible £20million in the lottery - after being given the lucky ticket as a gift. The winner, from the Melbourne suburb St Albans, hadn't rushed to check the QuickPick Powerball results after being given the present, but when she did, her life changed forever. The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, ended up splitting the jackpot with another lucky player, with them both walking away with a whopping A$40million (£20.8m), The Mirror reports. Speaking after her win in May 2022, she said that she was \"still shocked\" by the stunning turn of events and revealed plans to buy her dream home , support her loved ones, and do some globetrotting . She said: \"I've barely slept since I discovered the win. It's hard to put the feeling of knowing you've won $40million into words. I don't think it's truly hit me yet. \"The ticket was a gift, but I didn't check it immediately. When I did check it though, I immediately called out to my family and they were just as shocked as I was. \"There were definitely plenty of cheers and tears. First and foremost, I'll be looking to help my family and share it with them. \"I'll need some time though to think about what else to do. I'll obviously buy a home, and I'd love to travel to Japan and the United States. I'd love to go everywhere. \"You always wonder about what you would do if something like this were to happen, and now it has happened, I have no idea what to do.\" Yen Le-Mai, the owner of Sunshine Marketplace Lotto where the winning ticket was sold, expressed her delight at the surprising win. She said: \"I was oblivious to it until a friend of mine contacted me to congratulate me on selling the winning ticket. At that moment, I felt I'd personally won. I was so excited and overwhelmed by the news.\" Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

        "content": "A Queensland MP who alleges she was drugged and sexually assaulted has described the ordeal as “indescribably tough”. Brittany Lauga alleges she was victimised during a night out in Yeppoon in central Queensland in her electorate of Keppel on April 28. In her first television interview since the incident, she told 7NEWS that the incident would not end her political career and her recent return to work was a welcome distraction from the ordeal. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today “It’s been a tough couple of weeks. Indescribably tough,” she said. “But it’s good to be back. I love my work and I get a lot out of it. Being back at work is actually a really great distraction “I had to recover physically and mentally. I still am. “(But) I’m not ready to be done yet. I’m not ready to hang my boots up. I still have a lot more in the tank and work to finish. “I’m determined not to let this get me down. Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Lauga, the state’s assistant health minister, said in a social media statement on May 4 that hospital tests revealed “the presence of drugs in my body which I did not take”. Those drugs “impacted me significantly,” she claimed. She declined to talk specifically about the night in question in the interview with 7NEWS on Tuesday. Queensland police have confirmed they are investigating her sexual assault complaint. Lauga again thanked the community for its “amazing” support, also saying that “many, many people” have told her of having their drinks spiked “in this region”. “I do think we should be able to enjoy socialising in our towns without this kind of rot happening,” she said.",

The firm directly informed the media following the incident, after it failed to do so previously. To address the breach and mitigate the damage, the firm has brought in cybersecurity experts from Sygnia. Currently, a thorough investigation is underway to determine the full extent of the breach and assess its potential consequences. 2 View gallery ( Photo: Shutterstock ) \"Sygnia, the company handling the cyber incident, is conducting the necessary checks to examine the possible attack. We've instructed them to invest all required resources to complete the investigation as soon as possible,\" the firm said in an email to clients. \"Although the attack isn't confirmed at this point, we found it appropriate to notify our clients.

        "content": "BBC is reporting that Pope Francis has used extremely derogatory language in an incident that could have a profound impact on the way his attitude towards gay people is perceived. When asked at the Italian Bishops’ Conference if gay men should now be allowed to train for the priesthood as long as they remained celibate, Pope Francis said they should not. He is then believed to have continued by saying in Italian that there was, in the Church, already too much of an air of frociaggine , which translates as a highly offensive slur. Although it was a meeting that happened behind closed doors, the Pope’s reported comments were first conveyed to the Italian tabloid website, Dagospia. Other Italian news agencies have since confirmed the Pope’s words citing numerous sources. There has been shock at the Pope’s reported language at this private meeting, particularly as he has often talked publicly of being respectful towards gay people. Progressive supporters of the Pope have long argued that while little has tangibly changed in terms of gay rights in Catholicism, Pope Francis has changed the tone of the Church’s attitude. When asked about gay people early in his papacy, he hit the headlines by responding, “Who am I to judge?” He recently created consternation among Catholic traditionalists by saying priests should be able to bless same-sex couples in some circumstances and has frequently talked of gay people being welcome in the Church. Some had started to feel that he was laying the groundwork to ultimately permit gay men to train for the priesthood, as long as they remained celibate like other priests. He not only shot that down in no uncertain terms at the conference, but some news agencies report that he used derogatory language on more than one occasion The Spanish-speaking Pope’s defenders point out that he does sometimes make mistakes in Italian colloquialisms and suggest that he did not appreciate the level offence he might have caused, even though he did grow up in an Italian-speaking household in Argentina. Nevertheless, some outlets report that the Pope also said that gay people needed kicking out of seminaries whether they acted on their sexual tendencies or not. The Vatican has yet to comment on the matter. Sharing is caring!",

По словам источника агентства ТАСС, претензии возникли не к тексту и автору, а к иллюстрациям сборника",
        "content": "Прокуратура в Красноярском крае потребовала убрать из продажи в одном из местных магазинов детскую книгу «Вредные советы» Григория Остера из-за иллюстраций. Об этом сообщает ТАСС со ссылкой на источник, знакомый с ходом прокурорской проверки. 27 мая журналист Андрей Кравченко (псевдоним — Антон Орехъ) опубликовал в своем Telegram-канале копию письма прокуратуры Каратузского района Красноярского края от 14 мая, которую прислали подписчики. В документе говорилось, что в книге Остера, которая продается в магазине «Бриз» села Каратузское, «изображены описания жестокости, физического и психологического насилия, антиобщественные действия, вызывающие у детей страх, ужас или панику». В то же время, как отмечали в прокуратуре, на книге не была указана возрастная маркировка, что противоречит требованию закона «О защите детей от информации, причиняющей вред их здоровью и развитию». В том же письме сообщалось, что прокуратура постановила «рассмотреть вопрос» об изъятии из продажи и с прилавка магазина и уничтожении тиража. Источник ТАСС ранее уточнял, что в продаже в магазине в Каратузском районе Красноярского края была всего одна книга «Вредные советы» и претензии у прокуроров возникли не к тексту или к автору произведения, а к иллюстрациям в издании. «По мнению прокуратуры, они содержали сцены жестокости и могли вызвать у детей чувство страха», — заявил собеседник агентства. Позже владелица магазина Любовь Дерюшева подтвердила в комментарии ТАСС, что «Вредные советы» убрали из продажи. В разговоре с изданием «Коммерсантъ» она добавила , что приобрела указанную книгу, которая была выпущена издательством АСТ в 2022 году, у алтайского поставщика в единственном экземпляре. По ее словам, у проверяющих возникли вопросы к иллюстрациям, на которых якобы были изображены сцены с оружием, например, летящий в спину педагога нож. Автор изображений в тираже «Вредных советов», выпущенных в 2022 году, — карикатурист Николай Воронцов, использующий псевдоним «дядя Коля Воронцов». Он уже иллюстрировал книгу Остера в 2007 и 2015 годах, а также другие произведения писателя. Представители АСТ в комментарии РБК сообщили , что издательство не получало официальных обращений от прокуратуры Каратузского района Красноярского края по поводу «Вредных советов» Остера. «Произведения Остера издаются более 30 лет, сложно поверить в то, что от прокурора может исходить требование об изъятии и уничтожении книги без соответствующего судебного решения и ссылки на него», — заявили в издательстве. «Вредные советы» — сборник ироничных стихотворений писателя Григория Остера, в которых он описывает ситуации, происходящие с детьми, и дает им шуточные рекомендации, а также показывает, что может случиться в случае их непослушания. Например, «Никогда не мойте руки, / Шею, уши и лицо. / Это глупое занятье / Не приводит ни к чему. / Вновь испачкаются руки, / Шея, уши и лицо, / Так зачем же тратить силы, / Время попусту терять. /Стричься тоже бесполезно, / Никакого смысла нет. / К старости сама собою / Облысеет голова».

        "content": "ONE of the stars from EastEnders has slammed his house builder after being left in an 'unsuitable home'. The soap actor posted a comedy video onto social media as he pranced about in his unfinished new home. Liam Hatch, 27, is one of the newest cast members of the long-running BBC soap. He recently joined the square as bad-boy Logan in a recent storyline where he bullied Amy Mitchell (Ellie Dadd). His group also beat up both Denzel Danes ( Jaden Ladega ) and Yolande Trueman ( Angela Wynter ) in horrific scenes. However, it seems the EastEnders actor and personal trainer had a huge drama of his own at his new home. He took to social media in an attempt to raise attention, after he failed to get adequate answers by the building company. Liam recently moved into a new-build home, but he claims he was left with no flooring and wonky windows. He also claimed that he cannot house his household appliances and that loose screws dug into his feet. The star posted a sarcastic dancing video to the track 'Faith' by George Michael from his abode. The unfinished flooring and lack of furniture was clearly seen as he jokingly praced around the kitchen and garden of the property. In the captions he wrote a long essay which read: \"Bought a new house... 🏡 *CUT THE CELEBRATION* 🎉 ❌. \"We have floors unsuitable to lay on, we have screws digging into my feet, we have wonky windows and a cupboard not straight to fit my washing machine in, and to top it all off they ain’t answering the emails....but...we have faith.\" \"I have seen many negative comments with no reply... I’m here to make sure people’s voices are heard. @taylorwimpey 👀\" After tagging the company, he finished the post with a string of sarcastic hashtags as he lamented the seemingly unfinished job. The Sun has approached Taylor Wimpey for comment. This comes after fans were recently shocked after they discovered Liam's real age and his racy Instagram account . Despite appearing as a teenager in a school uniform in the soap, making him no older than 16, Liam is in fact 27 in real life. When he isn't working as an actor, he has a side hustle as a personal trainer and online coach. Aside from this new video, the rest of his Instagram account is full of shirtless pictures of him working out at the gym. He's also partial to showing off his rear end as A number of pictures on his profile page show him posing outside, facing away from the camera totally naked.",

        "content": "Brooks will stay at Weymouth for a 10th campaign in claret and blue, meaning he could reach the 350-game landmark next term. The Weymouth vice-captain currently has 337 appearances, with 31 goals and 30 assists for the Terras. Brooks made just 25 appearances last season before a serious knee injury put paid to any involvement for the remainder of the campaign. He has undergone surgery after electing to continue playing and confirmed to Echosport last November that he would prefer to finish his career with Weymouth . In a club statement, Weymouth said: “We are delighted to confirm the signature of Calvin Brooks to continue in claret and blue for the 24/25 season. “A man who needs little introduction to the Terras’ faithful, Calvin has become a great part of the club and surrounding community. Originally made his debut back on 27th September 2014. “Marking this upcoming season as his 10th for the club. Impressively, only eight players have featured in more campaigns at the club since World War Two. “Calvin unfortunately missed a large part of the end of last season through injury and has since undergone surgery to aid his recovery. His return is anticipated closer than those may think. “With 337 appearances currently under his belt, 31 goals and 30 assists, it gives a continuation of consistency to this ever-growing new-look Weymouth as we approach the new season.” Brooks is the 10th Weymouth player to commit for the 2024/25 season, with Ezio Touray, Brandon Goodship, Jordon Thompson, Leo Hamblin, Charlie Rowan, Gerard Benfield, captain Tom Bearwish, Keelan O’Connell and Josh McQuoid all pledging allegiance to the Terras.",

        "content": "May 28 2024 iDenfy , a Lithuanian-based RegTech company offering ID verification and fraud prevention solutions, has partnered with Henoscene , a blockchain-based enterprise-first SaaS platform pioneering systematic participatory frameworks for corporations, nonprofit foundations, and their stakeholders. iDenfy’s identity verification solution will enhance data protection and user trust while streamlining Henoscene clients’ onboarding process. Environmental crime is one of the world’s most profitable organized criminal activities and has a major impact not only on the environment but also on human health ranking as the third largest criminal activity with a growth rate of 5-7% and causing losses ranging from $110 to $281 billion annually due to increased pollution, degradation of wildlife, water, air pollution, and chemical exposure. To address this critical issue, Henoscene’s platform needed a verification platform that could measure the companies that look untrustful, stopping them from using the platform for money laundering and other fraudulent activities. Henoscene specializes in providing a systematic campaign framework for mapping, planning, reporting, and analyzing long-term goals for businesses and their clients. Through the use of blockchain technology, the platform empowers brands to conduct impactful campaigns that co-create products, services, and stories while fostering positive social, environmental, economic, political, and cultural outcomes. According to Henoscene, using their platform, brands can create customizable campaigns linked to a chosen project, ensuring clear transparency to consumers regarding fund allocation as real-time metrics allow for tracking and measuring campaigns. Henoscene offers brands full transparency in their impactful campaigns, enabling them to build trust. Despite that, Henoscene has noticed that in their industry and lion of work, privacy and transparency have often been pegged against one another. For this reason, they needed an extra layer of security for building an even more secure ecosystem, with verified known players who are all working toward shared, positive social and environmental goals on a peer-to-peer framework like their blockchain-backed platform. Consequently, to combat the growing risks of financial crime and boost its internal Trust and Safety program, Henoscene was looking for an identity verification provider and chose iDenfy’s service due to its alignment with the company’s business model, offering a cost-effective approach focused only on successful verifications, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently towards actual conversions and active community members. iDenfy accepts more than 3000 types of ID documents from 200 countries, which now helps Henoscene confidently verify new users while enhancing its defenses against fraud. It’s worth mentioning that iDenfy’s AI-powered software completes 96% of ID document verifications in under a few minutes on average, guaranteeing a smooth and compliant Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Leveraging iDenfy’s solution, Henoscene aims to further enhance its mission of promoting positive impact and accountability in both the corporate and nonprofit sectors. “Privacy and transparency are fundamental to our approach. We aimed to automate the onboarding process and reduce costs while still promoting collaboration among verified stakeholders. iDenfy’s verification solution enabled us to meet these objectives effectively,” — commented X, the CEO of Henoscene. “We’re excited to partner with Henoscene to drive positive impact and accountability in the corporate and nonprofit sectors. Through our automated ID verification solution, our partner can create a more transparent and trustworthy ecosystem for all stakeholders involved,” — added Domantas Ciulde, the CEO of iDenfy.

        "content": "Listen to Story A Delhi court has summoned Delhi minister and AAP leader Atishi in connection with a defamation case filed by Delhi BJP's media head Praveen Shankar Kapoor. Atishi has been asked to appear before the court on June 29. This case relates to allegations made by Atishi that the BJP attempted to bribe and poach AAP legislators. Kapoor, who had also named Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the defamation case, claimed the allegations damaged his and his party's reputation. Taking cognisance of the allegations, the court identified Atishi as an accused and ordered her to appear on June 29. The BJP leader had filed the defamation case on April 30, alleging that AAP leaders failed to furnish any material to substantiate their poaching claims. In his application in the court, Kapoor cited a social media post by Arvind Kejriwal in which the AAP supremo alleged that the BJP had contacted seven AAP MLAs and was offering Rs 25 crore to switch sides. He also cited Atishi's claim that she had received an offer to join the BJP to \"save\" her \"political career\", failing which she would be arrested by the Enforcement Directorate. \"The BJP has approached me through someone very close. They have asked me to join the BJP and said this will save my political career. They have threatened that if I don't switch over, ED will arrest me within a month,\" Atishi said at a press conference in April. The AAP leader also claimed that she, along with party colleagues Saurabh Bharadwaj, Raghav Chadha, and Durgesh Pathak, would be arrested in the next two months. In his petition, the BJP leader sought the withdrawal of the remarks made by Atishi and an apology on TV and social media.",

        "content": "BRITISH households are saving hundreds of pounds each year by introducing efficient upgrades to their home. A poll of 2,000 adults responsible for paying the bills found 63% have invested in home energy efficiencies, with a quarter doing so in the last year. The average household estimates this has made an annual saving of £283.90. Motivations behind these upgrades have been reducing energy bills (49%), making their home more sustainable (36%), and adding value to their property (23%). The most popular home improvements that have been made include draught proofing, boiler upgrades, and insulation. And 3.3 million smart meters were installed in British homes in 2023. The study, commissioned by Smart Energy GB, found that in addition to making savings on their energy, the average bill payer believes they have increased their average house value by £2,934.60 by making certain improvements. Smart Energy GB has teamed up with property website, Rightmove, to reveal this data. It shows that improving a home’s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating from F to C could increase its value by up to 15% - which for the average home means an extra £55,848. Tim Bannister, Rightmove’s property expert, said: “We know upfront costs are the biggest barrier to people making green improvements in their home, especially when it can take time to see the return on investment and lower bills. “Our analysis shows that there’s a green price premium on top of the local house price growth when people sell homes that they’ve been able to make green improvements to, and in the coming years a home’s energy efficiency rating is likely to become an even bigger factor when choosing a home to buy or rent .” The study found exactly three quarters would consider the EPC rating of a property when looking to buy, compared to only 38% who would’ve said the same a decade ago. It also emerged the average adult in charge of household bills would be willing to pay an additional £6,360 for a home equipped with sustainable features, according to the OnePoll.com data. While 26% think making home upgrades to improve energy efficiency are now more important than aesthetic ones. Victoria Bacon, director at Smart Energy GB, said: “Smart home investments can be very good for the bank balance in the long run, but not all upgrades have to be costly. “Smart meters are installed at no extra cost by your energy supplier and are a tool that more and more Brits are using to help them find ways to reduce their energy use day to day, which can have a noticeable positive impact on energy bills over time. “They also open up access to reward schemes which offer money off energy bills for reducing energy use at certain times.” The research also revealed 36% have made eco upgrades to make their property more sustainable, and create energy efficient homes for younger generations (31%). ENERGY bills remain relatively high leaving many worrying over the thermostat. Energy experts have revealed the exact temperature to set it at so that you can save cash and still keep warm. When it comes to your thermostat, the Energy Saving Trust recommends you should set it to the \"lowest comfortable temperature\". For the majority of us, this is between 18 and 21 degrees Celsius. It's just the right balance between keeping your home warm, and keeping those energy bills as low as possible. If you have your thermostat set at a higher temperature you can probably afford to turn it down and still keep cosy. Of course, there are exceptions like anyone who is in ill health , and there is support available to cover extra costs . Just by turning down the temp by a single degree, you could save as much as £100 a year. If you cut it by more you will obviously make even bigger savings. The Energy Saving Trust also says that you don’t need to turn your thermostat up when it is colder outside, the house will still heat up to the set temperature. While 62% claim they think more about how their energy usage around the home will impact the environment than they did 10 years ago. It also emerged 23% of those polled plan to make certain green changes to where they live this year. Steph McGovern, broadcaster and consumer finance expert, said: “I know first-hand how difficult it can be to decide the best way to future-proof a home and make smart investments. “But with so many options out there, it’s reassuring to know that you don’t have to spend a huge amount of money to add value to a property and save on energy bills.” Smart Energy GB has partnered with MoneyMagpie to share tips for people looking to make energy efficient upgrades to their home: Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Sabrina recently opened up about her 'fun' and 'messy' love life as she gave an insight into her romance with Barry. The singer and Dunkirk actor were first linked in September 2023, but made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala earlier this month. Sabrina has now said she 'really connects with people who are in touch with their emotions' as discussed her romance with Cosmopolitan magazine. When it comes to dating, Sabrina said: 'A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. 'The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it's fun and it's messy.' The songstress revealed she is 'attracted' to someone who becomes her 'best friend' and can bring a lot of 'energy and humour' to a relationship. Discussing her type, Sabrina added: 'I'm super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends because I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humour and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.' Sabrina was first linked to Barry last September but they didn't make their first public appearance together until the December. In February, the couple confirmed their romance as they posed at a Grammys afterparty together after posing separately next to each other on the red carpet. Earlier this month, Barry threw Sabrina a lavish 25th birthday party complete with an hilarious meme birthday cake of Leonardo DiCaprio. The singer enjoyed a party with 100 of her friends thrown by the Saltburn actor at DUMBO House in Brooklyn. Barry has also supported Sabrina at a number of her gigs including her first at Coachella music festival. Barry was previously in a relationship with Alyson Kierans, who he welcomed a son with called Brando in August 2022 . The pair are thought to have broken up over the summer of last year. When Barry was asked about the split in GQ early this year, he said only that Alyson had 'done a great job and she’s an incredible mother.' Sabrina, meanwhile, saw her dating life become a hot topic during the summer of 2020, when she was rumoured to be in a love triangle with Joshua Bassett and his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series co-star Olivia Rodrigo . The following year, Olivia poured fuel on the fire by releasing her runaway smash hit single Driver's License, which was widely thought to be about Joshua and Sabrina. 'And you're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me,' sang Olivia, who is nearly four years younger than Sabrina. In the interim, Sabrina has at various stages been linked to such names as pop act Shawn Mendes, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien and YouTuber David Dobrik.

        "description": "Britain's Got Talent fans were left confused during the first live semi-final of the 2022 series, as a number of Golden Buzzer acts took to the stage to perform",
        "content": "enthusiasts were left scratching their heads during the show's first live semi-final. The stage was graced by a medley of acts including Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, and Stardust, with Innocent Massuki wrapping up the evening with a stellar act. But what really threw viewers was the number of Golden Buzzer performers that took to the stage in one night. Traditionally, each judge - , , , as well as show hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly are allowed just one Golden Buzzer pick each. Yet, this time around, it seemed the rules were tossed aside as multiple judges hit the buzzer more than once. The line-up of Golden Buzzer acts like Ssaulabi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, and Duo Stardust all performing in the same semi-final had fans flocking to Twitter with their bewilderment. One fan tweeted: \"Are they doing all the golden buzzers tonight? Seems odd #BGT #BritainsGotTalent,\" while another posted: \"What's with so many golden buzzer acts tonight? #BritainsGotTalent.\" Comments continued to pour in, with one saying: \"May aswell rename it the Golden Buzzer show at this rate, featuring a man in a bag #britainsgottalent,\" and another noting: \"Most of the golden buzzers are on tonight I noticed,\" reports . \"Haven't watched the auditions. How many golden buzzers are there? ! Last time I watched they had one each and out one in each semi-final? ! #BritainsGotTalent,\" a viewer tweeted, clearly puzzled by the number of golden moments this season. Another chimed in with: \"Every act tonight is a golden buzzer act? ? This show is silly #BritainsGotTalent.\" And it didn't stop there, as another fan pointed out: \"Why are they putting all the golden buzzer acts on tonight? There's only meant to be 4 and I'm sure I've seen 3 already #bgt britainsgottalent.\" This year's has upped the ante with a whopping nine Golden Buzzers. Simon Cowell explained his decision, saying: \"Well, the truth is, honestly, when I watched the yes tapes back, I thought there were about another 17 acts who easily could have had a golden buzzer. \"That's how good the talent is this year. But look, I think eight or nine is the absolute limit. I don't think you could ever really go beyond nine, well, maybe 10 at a push! But I always listen to the audience and the feedback I got was they enjoyed seeing more golden buzzers.\"",

        "content": "The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants President Cyril Ramaphosa to pay a fine and the African National Congress (ANC) to be docked a percentage of the national vote. This, they claim in court papers, is because Ramaphosa allegedly abused his office for political gain following his recent “national address”. Opposition parties have lashed out at Ramaphosa over his address to the nation on Sunday night accusing him of campaigning for the African National Congress (ANC) in a last pitch to voters before the polls on 29 May. During his family meeting, Ramaphosa highlighted the “achievements” of the sixth administration, including tackling corruption, handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, tackling corruption and gender-based violence and reducing load shedding, among other issues. Relief sought The DA approached the Electoral Court over the matter. In an application, the DA said Ramaphosa’s Presidential address delivered on Sunday violated Section 94 of the Electoral Act 73 of 1998, read with Item 9(2)(e) of the Electoral Code of Conduct; Section 87(1)(g) of the Electoral Act; and Sections 19(2) and (3) of the Constitution. It asked the court to “direct the first respondent (Ramaphosa) in terms of s 96(2)(b) of the Electoral Act, to pay a fine of R200 000”. It also called for the ANC’s votes in the national election to be reduced by 1%. “Any additional or alternative sanction authorised by s 96(2) that this Court considers just and equitable,” the notice of motion read. The DA also wants Ramaphosa and another respondent that opposes the application, to pay the party’s costs. ALSO READ: DA hauls Ramaphosa to court for ‘abusing office’ in national address Punish wrongdoing In the party’s 36-page founding affidavit, the DA’s Helen Zille said by the time the court was able to adjudicate the dispute, the elections would be over. Zille emphasised that a court must punish the wrongdoing, seek to undo the impact of the abuse of public power and public funds and deter future wrongdoing. “It is, of course, impossible to determine with any degree of certainty how many votes the ANC may have gained as a result of Mr Ramaphosa’s abuse of power. The DA submits that a reduction of 1% of the total votes the ANC received would be a fair reduction. “If the ANC receives 10 000 000 votes, it will lose 100 000 votes. Once the reduction is made, the commission will have to recalculate the number of seats awarded in the National Assembly,” Zille said. Ramaphosa’s “unlawful conduct” Zille argued that the purpose of Ramaphosa’s “unlawful conduct” was to increase the number of votes the ANC received. “Given how close it occurred before the election, it is impossible to unscramble the egg and remedy the unlawfulness by, for example, affording all other parties a similar opportunity. The proper remedy to redress the wrong is to reduce the number of votes. Zille said section 96(2) of the Electoral Act affords this court a range of powers if it decides that Ramaphosa and the ANC breached the Code or s 87(1)(g).

Bir süredir araştırmacılar, sosyal medyadaki bazı kişilerin yanlış bilgi yaymaya diğerlerinden daha yatkın olduğunu fark ettiler. \" Süper yayıcılar \" olarak adlandırılan ve sürekli olarak orantısız derecede yüksek miktarda yanlış bilgiye dayalı içerik yayan kullanıcılar, bu sorunun asıl kaynağı olarak görülüyor. Pandemi sırasında da, sırasıyla Facebook ve Twitter tarafından doğrulanan popüler sayfalar ve hesaplar tarafından, COVID-19 ile ilgili düşük güvenilirliğe sahip bilgilerin çoğalmasına ilişkin bir analiz paylaşıldı. Daha da endişe verici olanı, 2021'de Dijital Nefretle Mücadele Merkezi'nin, sosyal medyadaki aşı karşıtı iddiaların neredeyse üçte ikisini yaymaktan sorumlu olan \"Dezenformasyon Düzinesi\" adı verilen 12 hesabı tespit etmesiydi. Birleşik Krallık'taki Indiana Üniversitesi Sosyal Medya Gözlemevi ve Exeter Üniversitesi Bilgisayar Bilimleri Bölümü'nden araştırmacılar tarafından yürütülen bu son çalışmada da bilim insanları, Ocak ve Ekim 2020 arasında 448.103 kullanıcı tarafından gönderilen ve \" orijinal olarak düşük güvenilirliğe sahip veya güvenilmez kaynaklar tarafından yayınlanan içerik \" olarak tanımladıkları 2.397.388 tweet'i analiz etti. Analizlerine göre, bu gönderilerin üçte birinden fazlası yalnızca 10 hesaptan gelirken, %70'e yakınından ise sadece 1.000 hesap sorumluydu. Yani doğru şekilde tasarlanmış yalan yanlış içeriklerle 10 kişilik bir trol ekibi, isterse tüm dünyayı etkisi altına alabilir. Bu yüzden sosyal medya okur yazarlığı büyük önem taşıyor. Sosyal medya platformları bu tür yanlış bilgi yayan hesaplara karşı farklı önlemler alıyorlar. Kimi platformlar bu hesapları banlıyor, kimileri paylaşımların altına \"bu bilgi yanlıştır\" uyarısı koyuyor ama sonuçta bir gerçek var: 10, 100 veya 1.000 hesaplık bir trol çalışmasıyla, tüm dünyayı etki altına mümkün. Sosyal medyada okuduğunuz bir şeye inanıp gaza gelmeden önce bu haber de aklınızın bir köşesinde dursun...",

Our team's thoughtful approach toward programming indoor and outdoor amenity spaces will bring a unique residential experience to this submarket. This site has unique, irreplaceable attributes – including a creek-side walking trail on Big Fossil Creek that runs year-round and adjacency to the newly constructed Haltom High School .

        "description": "Arsenal could bolster their squad this summer after missing out on the Premier League title but sporting director Edu has urged for patience as they try and get their targets in",
        "content": "Edu has admitted Arsenal have to be patient in the summer transfer window and cannot be signing players for the \"sake\" of it as they prepare to do some business. The Gunners are looking to improve their squad after agonisingly missing out on the Premier League title for the second successive season. Mikel Arteta's side were still firmly in the race going into the final day of the campaign but ended up finishing second, two points behind winners Manchester City . Unlike the 2022/23 season, Arsenal had a much better go at winning the title this time around and were unfortunate to come up against an unstoppable City, who had won their last nine league matches. In an attempt to try and win the title next term, the Gunners are hopeful of strengthening their ranks. A new centre forward has been touted with Alexander Isak and Victor Gyokeres among those linked. But Edu has called for patience from supporters as he goes in search to acquire players who represent their first-choice options. Man Utd and Arsenal eye wonderkid that team-mates claim is 'best they have seen' Arsenal transfer news: Star confirms Gunners exit as Joshua Zirkzee drops hint on future When asked about their transfer plans, Edu said: \"You can’t sign for the sake of signing. This has to be a process that takes weeks and weeks. \"On my table, I have reports with over 180 pages of a player. It is really detailed. Physical, technical, mental profile – if you have experience of Premier League, if you will be able to adapt. It has it all. \"We analyse our shortcomings, where we can improve, where we can invest and from there we go in search of this new name. What I am going to do now, we have been discussing since January. It is not my decision or Mikel. It’s from a whole group.\" Arsenal sporting director Edu is planning for a busy summer window ( Image: Getty Images) After their victory over Everton on the last day of the Premier League season, Arteta hinted that the Gunners will do more business this summer having been asked about taking them to the next level. He said: \"It’s the only way, so now we are sitting there and they took it away from us. \"It is the second season so there’s only one way to do it, you have to be more determined, you have to be more ambitious, you need to have a lot of courage and push every limit and everything that we have, because that’s the next step.\" When asked about the plans for the summer, he said: \"Rest, have a beautiful holiday - that’s what we need first, because everybody has put every single drop of energy and passion that we had and now we need to rest. While we decompress, and rest and think we will have to start to think with more clarity.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Speaking with The Mirror, commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said that the Sussexes were accused to have gone “rogue\" after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey and Harry’s memoir Spare exposed secrets of royal life. As a result, the Prince of Wales, and the monarch no longer trust the Harry and Meghan, the expert said, adding that it was their “biggest casualty.” \"After the Oprah interview, the Harry and Meghan Netflix documentary and the publication of Harry's memoir Spare, as well as the interviews he gave promoting it, the popularity of the royal family suffered and the Sussexes were considered to have gone rogue,” the expert said. \"The biggest casualty was trust.

Travis's recent fashion statement is under scrutiny after being photographed in a heavily-ripped jeans on Sunday. The NFL player was spotted outside next to Patrick Mahomes and Marquise Brown during Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. However, his unique pants stole the limelight as netizens were intrigued by his pants with rips all over when the photos emerged on social media. One witty X (formerly known as Twitter) user proposed that perhaps Taylor Swift's cats were responsible for the look. “What the f*** did taylor cats do with his jeans?” @thisisvertrying quipped alongside a photo of the torn jeans. The joke caught Jason's attention who also endorsed it by reposting it with the caption, “Now that’s funny!” Travis paired the tattered jeans with sunglasses and a white shirt with an apple print. Travis was all smiles as he made the Rock On sign with his hands.",

On Friday, May 24 which also marked Dylan's 83rd birthday, the rare body of artwork was sold for $196,156 at an auction by RR Auction, announced in a news release. People magazine reported that Dylan painted the artwork over 50 years ago, approximately in 1968. At the time the pop icon collaborated with The Brand in Woodstock, New York. Later on, the recorded work was released in 1975 on The Basement Tapes and The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete in 2014. As per the description mentioned on the auction house’s website, Bob Dylan’s painting is a “colorful and energetic abstract composition featuring the large central outline of a bull.” The detailing of the artwork continued, “The canvas is filled in with captivating abstract shapes and patterns combined with recognizable imagery, including music notes, bow ties, animals, and segmented features.” “At the top is the red outline of a man in a brimmed hat—mirroring his own style during his Woodstock days,” the website further noted. The RR Auction site also mentioned that Dylan exchanged his painting to Woodstock’s resident Sandy Lepanto for an astrology chart.",

He said the ordinance was utilised for shameful political purposes and many innocent people fell victim to it. The NAB Ordinance has been amended, under which the period of remanding accused in the NAB cases has been extended from 14 days to 40 days. Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani Monday signed two new ordinances, NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and the Elections Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024. He signed the ordinances on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as President Asif Zardari is currently in Dubai. The promulgation came after federal cabinet’s approval of the amendments to the ordinances. Under the amended NAB law, the sentence duration for an officer, convicted for framing cases based on ill will, has been reduced to two years from five years. After the promulgation of the Elections Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, the election tribunals will have retired judges as its members, besides the serving jurists.",

        "content": "SHANGHAI: Chinese stocks closed down on Tuesday as traders awaited key inflation data from major economies this week for clues on the path for interest rates , and weighed the effectiveness of China's latest housing policy . The US core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday and will be the biggest focus for the market. Expectations are for the index to hold steady on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, China's commercial hub Shanghai lowered the minimum downpayment ratios for home buyers and relaxed some home purchase restrictions, after the country lowered the national level in a market stabilising effort earlier this month. \"Though it's in a good direction, the overall sentiment channel checks suggest that the recovery in tier-1 cities (except in Shenzhen) is not as strong as it was in last September where the four cities relaxed mortgage restriction,\" UBS analyst John Lam said in a note. At the close, the Shanghai Composite index was down 0.46% at 3,109.57 and the blue-chip CSI 300 fell 0.73%. The financial sector sub-index, consumer staples real estate and healthcare sub-index declined between 0.55% and 2.42%. The Hang Seng index edged down 6.19 points or 0.03% at 18,821.16. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index slipped 0.03% to 6,686.13. The smaller Shenzhen index ended down 1.08% and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was weaker by 1.35%. The CES CN Semiconductor Index edged up against a broadly weak market after China set up its third planned state-backed investment fund to boost its semiconductor industry. The sub-index of the Hang Seng tracking energy shares rose 1.3%, while the IT sector rose 0.2%, the financial sector ended 0.18% lower and the property sector fell 1.04%. Around the region, MSCI's Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.1%, while Japan's Nikkei index closed down 0.11%.",

        "content": "A couple enjoying a \"picturesque\" walk snapped photos of their wander around a gorgeous UK trail and accidentally found an X-rated detail in the process. The pair saw the funny side of their sighting in the Brecon Beacons, Wales, and shared it in a post on Reddit's r/CasualUK forum. User SenorBigbelly wrote: \"Took the missus to Wales for the first time and went walking in the Brecon Beacons. Wonderfully picturesque photo completely ruined by a giant penis-shaped pothole that I only noticed now.\" Fellow forum users flooded in with hilarious comments. Some tried to Photoshop the cheeky pothole out, whereas others made it larger. One user who chose to edit the penis-shaped pothole out of the picture wrote: \"Did a quick fix, not the cleanest but didn't take long either.\" Residents' fury as local beauty spot 'ruined' by tourists leaving their poo behind The original poster thanked them for the edit, writing: \" Ok that's pretty genuinely excellent thank you. Part of me was kinda expecting an actual penis photoshopped in there.\" Another user joked: \"I thought they were going to photoshop out your missus.\" The original poster wrote elsewhere in the thread: \"I appreciate people's genuine wholesome corrections of the photo. Tbh I really just posted it because I find it funny (and got plenty of other good photos).\" Other users made cheeky jokes suggesting they had left the penis-shaped imprint themselves while walking through the Brecon Beacons. One said: \"Sorry lads, tripped over here back in 2018. Been a lot more careful since.\" Another person said: \"The really noticeable part is the the pothole has been filled. Wouldn't happen here in England!\" However, a Welsh Reddit user chimed in, revealing this isn't always the case in Wales either. They wrote: \"Doesn't happen in Wales either! Usually if a local pothole has been filled, it's because someone got fed up with waiting for the council to do it and found some spare tarmac or gravel. I've seen potholes filled with bricks on their sides to reduce the depth of said holes. A bit like the old brick roads or a driveway. If it works, it's better than f**king up your exhaust.\"",

        "content": "The Philippine Heart Association (PHA) on Tuesday called on lawmakers to expedite legislation that would allocate automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places, such as government facilities and schools. In a forum, PHA President Dr. Ronald Cuyco emphasized that AEDs should be in tandem with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order save lives of those suffering from cardiac arrest. An AED is a portable device that helps those experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. It is used to counteract fibrillation of the heart muscle and restore normal heartbeat by delivering a brief electric shock to the heart. “We are praying that this gadget should be available and will be available in public places. That’s what we’re pushing in the Congress. Hopefully, a lot of people will help us, even convince the executive branch to support this,” Cuyco said. In the Philippines, there is already a CPR Law (Republic Act 10871), seeking to make lifesavers out of the youth by making CPR training part of the basic education curriculum. However, bills on mandating AEDs in public areas remain stuck in Congress. At the House of Representatives, several measures have been filed, including House Bill No. 1393 and 7783 that would require the provision of AEDs in places open to the public like schools, workplaces, government offices, and similar establishments. A counterpart measure was also filed in the Senate in 2022 during the 18th Congress, but remained pending at the committee level. Pending the law, Malasakit at Bayanihan Rep. Anthony Golez Jr. recommended the PHA to encourage President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to sign an executive order to institutionalize the placement of AEDs in these public places to help save more lives. He said that the PHA could further suggest adding AEDs in public hospitals and barangay health centers, depending on the budget that could be allocated for such. “When you have that, then it means to say that it’s a priority of this government and the chances of having a Republic Act will be higher,” Golez said. The PHA welcomed the recommendation of the congressman, vowing to be proactive in pursuing other alternatives to push their advocacy. Cuyco said that he is also constantly lobbying to start the deliberations on the said measure in the Senate to the office of Senator Bong Go, who chairs the Committee on Health and Demography. Ischaemic heart disease or cardiovascular disease remains to be the number one killer of Filipinos, with a total of 100,848 cases recorded from January to November 2023. This accounted for 19% percent of the total deaths in the Philippines, based on data by the Philippine Statistics Authority. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Delhi's Karkardooma court on Tuesday rejected the bail application of former JNU student leader Umar Khalid in larger conspiracy of Delhi riots case . Khalid, who is an accused in UAPA case related to 2020 Delhi riots, sought a regular bail in the matter on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons. It was his second bail application. He has been in custody since September 2020 in a case under UAPA. The Delhi police alleged that Umar Khalid pre-planned protests at 23 sites in 2020, which culminated in riots. After withdrawing his bail plea from the Supreme Court in February, Khalid moved to the trial court seeking bail based on a change in circumstances and parity with other accused. Senior advocate Tridip Pais, defending Umar Khalid, had questioned the Delhi police's submissions, asking, \"Is sharing messages a criminal or terror act?\" He responded to earlier submissions by the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP), who claimed that Khalid was amplifying his narrative as part of a conspiracy by sharing certain links with people in politics and others on social media. Pais argued that Khalid was sharing the \"correct narrative.\" He also claimed that a vicious media trial was taking place against Khalid, referring to statements from various news anchors who were reading charge sheet all the time. Pais argued that no terror case is made out against Khalid and that the police have no material to this effect. He pointed out contradictions in the statements of prosecution witnesses. Pais also noted that other accused persons, namely Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, and Asif Iqbal Tanha, who had similar roles to Khalid, were granted bail by the high court. Opposing the bail application, Delhi police had said that Khalid's chats revealed a habit of creating narratives on media and social media to influence bail hearings.",

        "description": "Six Indian-origin men of Canada vehicle-theft gang arrested",
        "content": "Listen to Story At least six Indian-origin men have been arrested in Canada as part of a major crackdown on stolen vehicle trafficking. Peel Regional Police concluded Project Odyssey, a seven-month investigation that targeted a large-scale network responsible for stealing vehicles, transporting them across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and shipping them out of the Port of Montreal. The operation resulted in the recovery of 369 stolen vehicles, valued at $33.2 million. The investigation led to the arrest of 16 individuals and the laying of 322 Criminal Code charges. Among those arrested are Beerpal Singh, 29, Harmeet Singh, 34, Valbir Singh, 49, Guljinder Singh, 29, Gurpreet Dhillon, 41, and Jagmohan Singh, 57. These men face numerous charges, including trafficking in stolen goods over $5000 and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. Some also face firearm-related charges. Canadian police identified a company based in Peel Region that was facilitating the transport of stolen vehicles from a trucking yard in Brampton, Ontario. During the operation, police recovered 369 stolen vehicles valued at $33.2 million, with 255 vehicles found in the Peel Region and 114 recovered at the Port of Montreal. Additionally, three transport trucks and two bobcats were seized under the forfeiture of offense-related property. Chief Nishan Duraiappah of Peel Regional Police commended the investigative work of the Commercial Auto Crime Bureau, noting the significant expansion of the unit in 2023. \"In the last 18 months, we have arrested nearly 200 individuals, laid approximately 1,600 auto theft-related charges, and recovered close to $100 million in stolen vehicles,\" said Duraiappah. The investigation has also led to the issuance of 10 additional arrest warrants. The families of the arrested individuals are seeking legal counsel as they prepare for the legal proceedings.",

The 71kg Belfast native, who won a bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, secured a 4-1 victory to seal his place in the last 16 of the Olympic World Qualifiers. The 27-year-old needs two more wins to qualify for the semi-finals, which would ensure his place at this summer’s Olympic Games in Paris. If he’s beaten in the quarter-finals, Walsh could still qualify by prevailing in a four-man box-off for the final Olympic place.

        "description": "The One Show was plunged into chaos as Harry Hill threw an item at presenter Jermaine Jenas during an appearance on the BBC programme to discuss his upcoming tour",
        "content": "The One Show host Alex Jones scolded Harry Hill after mayhem erupted live on air. The 59-year-old comedian was on the BBC programme to chat about his tour 'New Bits and Greatest Hits', with host Jermaine Jenas probing him about the fresh content. Harry shared: \"For the first time I'm going to do some old bits..\" Jermaine asked: \"So there is going to be something for everyone.\" In a playful jab, Harry responded: \"Not everyone,\" followed by laughter. The ex-footballer pressed: \"Who are you excluding here?\" Harry quipped back: \"Hopefully, for everyone.\" The conversation took a quirky turn when Harry requested Jermaine to \"say quack\", leaving the presenter baffled. \"Say quack again,\" Harry persisted, leading Alex to interject: \"This is going down a dodgy road.\" Harry ended up throwing bread at the hosts ( Image: BBC) Amidst the quacking, Harry ducked down, emerged with a slice of bread, and started tossing pieces at Jermaine as Alex exclaimed: \"No, thank you!\" Harry teased, \"How do you like it? \" while continuing his bread barrage. Long-time fans might remember this gag from Harry's past gigs, including a memorable moment at the Hay Festival in 2007. Back then, he had an audience member quack before bombarding him with bread. He said: \"It means stop throwing bread at me, that's what quack means. Why would a duck like bread? Where would a duck get a taste for bread? \". Viewers flocked to Twitter to share their thoughts on the comedian's stint on the BBC show, with one posting: \"This Harry Hill interview feels very awkward #theoneshow.\" Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' Alex and Jermaine didn't seem too impressed ( Image: BBC) Another chimed in with: \"Harry Hill looking utterly bewildered #theoneshow.\" Earlier this month Harry announced his comeback tour to mark his 60th birthday. Speaking about his joy at getting back on stage to celebrate his 30 years in show business, Harry said: “I’m looking forward to celebrating my diamond jubilee - 60 years of fun - by going round the country and thanking all the people that have supported me over the years. I’ve had a word with the badgers and they’ve agreed that for one last time the parade’s on!” He started his self-penned comedy series on BBC Two and Channel 4 . Harry went on to create the hit, multi-BAFTA-winning ITV series Harry Hill’s TV Burp, which ran for 10 years. The comedian has been the longstanding voice of ITV’s You’ve Been Framed, and is the presenter of Channel 4’s Junior Bake Off. Last year, it was reported the star's iconic You’ve Been Framed show had been axed after 33 years on air. The long-running ITV hit, which compiled home videos of mishaps and funny moments, was launched in 1990. It originally had Jeremy Beadle as the narrator, before Harry took over and fronted an impressive 341 of the 701 episodes.

        "content": "Luciano Benetton, co-founder of the iconic apparel brand, has decided to step down as chairman, he revealed in an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera. He has decided to leave his role after he discovered losses of 100 million euros ($108.5million) last year, which he attributes to the current team. At 89, Benetton returned to his role as chairman in 2018 after initially stepping down in 2012, only to find himself disappointed by a chief executive and management team appointed in 2020, whom he blames for the financial downturn. \"In short, I trusted them, and I made a mistake,\" Benetton confessed, noting that he first noticed the accumulating losses last September. The brand, headquartered in Veneto and famed for its vibrant knitwear and bold advertising, has faced stiff competition from fast-fashion outlets. Since 2013, unions have reported losses totaling around 1 billion euros despite several attempts at creative and managerial overhauls to reclaim market relevance. Benetton is set to leave his post in June, aligning with the expiration of the board term at Edizione SpA, the Benetton family's holding company led by his son Alessandro. Edizione, with interests spanning transport, infrastructure through Mundys, and food and beverage retail including Autogrill via Dufy, is poised to usher in new leadership. The family holding company offloaded its shares in Autostrade per l'Italia SpA, following intense political scrutiny after the tragic collapse of a Genoa highway bridge it operated in August 2018, which resulted in the death of 43 people.",

        "description": "'Iron Mike' has recently worried fans about his health ahead of the showdown.",
        "content": ", 57, just months before his comeback fight against social media sensation . 'Iron Mike' will take on the social media star on the 20th of July at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The bout will be screened on Netflix, making it the platform's first move into live boxing. The co-main event will see and Amanda Serrano . The Irish star famously beat the Puerto Rican two years ago in New York in what was one of the biggest fights ever in women's boxing. Tyson, who'll be 58 by the time the fight takes place, suffered a medical emergency during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday, according to magazine. The former heavyweight world champion became nauseous and dizzy - which forced flight staff to ask passengers on board if there was a doctor to provide assistance. Since the news broke, it's sparked concerns about whether or not the fight should go ahead in July. Here, we take a look at six potential replacements for the American should he pull out of the showcase. defeated Paul in Saudi Arabia last year thanks to a after an intriguing battle played out in front of thousands of fans in the Middle East. 'The Problem Child' is keen to stage a rematch with the former Love Island star - but has claimed his rival 'fears' another meeting between the two fighters. The American tweeted the following back in December: \"Had a call with Tommy and his dad John about a month ago. It was clear their main concern was money and not about actually getting the fight done. \"After offering him the largest guarantee on the biggest stage he'd ever receive they have gone silent. I smell fear. Real fighting man would jump at the chance to make his biggest payday ever and actually live up to his claim that he's going to KO me.\" Given how tight the first encounter was, a rematch between the pair makes sense. Fury hasn't fought since he defeated KSI back in October last year. There's no doubt that the Brit will be looking to settle the score once and for all against Paul should the opportunity arise. A fight between and Paul is one that would certainly interest many hardcore fans. The Brit and the pair have been going back and forth over a potential fight since 2018. The popular YouTuber called out Paul in the ring after he defeated fellow YouTuber Joe Weller. KSI ended up fighting Jake's brother Logan instead (twice). The 30-year-old last stepped foot inside the ring back in October, to Tommy Fury in Manchester. While the loss to the Brit was the first of KSI's career, from a marketing point of view, a showdown with Paul still makes sense and will have fans chomping at the bit to witness the bout. 'The Problem Child' back in October 2022 when he defeated legend in Arizona. But the former Disney star did take some punishment from the former UFC middleweight champion, in what was possibly the toughest test during his short boxing career so far. The Brazilian retired from the sport in 2020 but has gone on to have three boxing matches since. In his three boxing matches, Silva was successful in two against and , but was beaten in his most recent match against Paul - as aforementioned. It was announced recently that Silva and will on the 15th of June. Providing 'The Spider' can come away from the bout unscathed and with a win, confidence will no doubt be at an all-time high and will be itching to avenge his loss to Paul. A few days before his clash with Ryan Bourland earlier this year, footage of the former Disney star being pulled up on in a car park went viral online. Indian boxer Neeraj Goyat put his money where his mouth is and face to face. In a clip that has garnered millions of impressions, Goyat steps out of his car, seemingly located at where Jake Paul trains, and makes himself known, shouting: \"I'm here, I'm in your country, I'm in your town.\" Paul dismisses Goyat immediately by claiming he doesn't want to fight, with the Indian boxer returning fire by saying Jake Paul is \"abusing the Indian language.\" Paul, in his typical cocky bravado, asks Goyat if he \"can't handle a little s*** talk, your feelings are hurt. Did I hurt your feelings?\" Paul tells Goyat that he respects him for showing up \"man to man\" before the pair come to blows and the verbal confrontation turns physical. Goyat boasts a record of 18-4, having made his debut in 2011, and with two of those losses coming during his first two years of boxing, he has had a pretty successful decade since. Most of his fights have been in or around Asia, with his fights typically taking place in India, Thailand, and China, but he has stemmed out into the western world of boxing, having fought in Canada and Mexico, with his Mexican fight ending in a loss to the 36-3 Jose Zepeda. Yet to have his breakout moment, it might be that a potential Jake Paul and Neeraj Goyat fight down the line is finally the fight that he needs to break out into the boxing world. Following the recent news about Tyson, boxing star took the opportunity to insert himself into the conversation of replacing 'Iron Mike.' The American is currently in hot water after his drugs test B-samples from his showdown with Devin Haney have . According to boxing journalist Dan Rafael, the American's B sample and A sample both tested positive for Ostarine - which is a banned substance, after tests were conducted by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA). Last month, Garcia shocked the world by knocking Haney down three times in their epic super-lightweight title fight in New York before going on to . He recently said he'd be if need be. Taking to X - formerly known as Twitter - the American uploaded a picture of his Instagram messages to Paul, which read: \"If you down to fight. If Mike can't do it. Let me know I will fill in.\" With everything that's going on with Garcia at the moment, as well as the major weight gap between 'King Ry' and Paul, it seems doubtful that this fight will happen. Former boxing world champion Sakio Bika has put himself forward as an alternate for Tyson and Paul's fight in July. The 45-year-old has not fought a professional contest since 2021 - when he defeated Sam Soliman. Bika, who has a professional record of 35-7-3, recently told : “I can fight Jake Paul at any weight he wants. At the moment, I am staying in shape and ready if the right offer comes my way. \"I have reached the top of the sport, becoming a multiple-time world champion and winning the prestigious Contender series. I have nothing more to prove to anyone, but I would like to have one more big fight.\" British boxing fans may be familiar with the name as he once challenged for Joe Calzaghe's world titles back in 2006 - but lost on points. He added: \"If someone like Jake or his brother would really like to test himself against a recent world champion, I am always ready to fight. Mike Tyson is an all-time great boxer; he was a hero of mine growing up, and even though he looks in great shape, he is almost 60 years of age! If Jake is serious about fighting a former champion, look for someone a lot younger or active within the last decade.\"",

        "content": "A MUM has found herself brutally lunch-shamed after proudly showing off the elaborate meals she prepares for her kid, nine. Alexia Gallegos, from the USA , is a mum-of-three, but it's the eldest daughter's school lunches that have taken the internet by storm. The foodie , who is a proud stay-at-home mum , insists that '' school lunches don't have to be cold and boring'' and regularly shares her lunch-packing routine. One such video posted on her page saw the mother whip up a jacket potato , topped with scrumptious steak bites, some shrimp, broccoli, grated cheese and a sprinkle of herbs to top it off. ''Baked potato for the win,'' Alexia wrote in the caption of the video , all chuffed with her cooking skills. Once she had packed the main dish into a pink lunchbox, Alexia - who's won more than 132k followers - went on to cram in an array of snacks for her nine-year-old daughter. These included the following: a container of delicious pistachio nuts, Haribo Goldbear candy, a packet of chocolate-covered dried strawberries, a packed of roasted seaweed with some sea salt sprinkled on too, as well as a packet of ''Veggie'' straws. Alexia didn't stop there, as she then also added more snacks for the kid, including two Ferrero Rocher chocolates, a Kinder Joy chocolate, a tub of jellied fruit and beef jerky. That little girl is still sitting in the cafeteria eating her lunch The elaborate lunch box for the day was completed with a gummy Pizza candy box and strawberry and cream Tic Tacs. Once she had packed all the food, Alexia included the viral Stanley flask filled with ice cubes in the shape of adorable butterflies, water, as well as a cute handwritten note that read: ''Hey beautiful, you are worth it ALWAYS! Keep being you! Love Mommy.'' But despite the mum's best intentions, thousands of fellow Instagram users have expressed utter shock, mainly criticising the portion sizes and the nutritional value of the sugary snacks. One person said: ''Sorry I feel bad saying it because you look so happy and made all with love... but this is so much food... also so much sugar for one day...'' Another agreed, adding: ''All the plastic waste ... and wouldn't one kind of sweets be enough? No apple, no banana....'' Someone else chuckled: ''Is she going to school or building it?!'' A fourth penned: ''That little girl is still sitting in the cafeteria eating her lunch.'' ''Not sure if we are trying to k**l her with diabetes , or room temperature shrimp,'' a critic wrote. Find all the recipes here , on the NHS website. Keep them fuller for longer As advised by the experts at the NHS , parents should base the main lunchbox item on foods like bread, rice, pasta and potatoes - this will keep the tummies fuller for longer. Choose wholegrain where you can. Cut back on fat Where possible, go for lower-fat fillings, such as lean meats (including chicken or turkey), fish (such as tuna or salmon), lower-fat spread, reduced-fat cream cheese and reduced-fat hard cheese. Another great way to cut back on fat is avoiding using mayonnaise in sandwiches. Ever green If possible, always add salad to sandwiches and wraps too – it all counts towards your child's five-a-day! Always add veggies Cherry tomatoes, sticks of carrot, cucumber, celery and peppers - these are all great options that count towards their five-a-day. Adding a small pot of reduced-fat hummus or other dips may help with getting kids to eat vegetables. Cut down on crisps If your child really likes their crisps see if you can reduce the number of times you include them in the lunchbox. Another great option is swapping crisps for homemade plain popcorn or plain rice cakes instead.",

        "content": "МОСКВА, 28 мая — ПРАЙМ. На российском рынке появился китайский кроссовер Jetour T2. Модель представлена с исключительно c полным приводом и двухлитровым турбомотором Мотор SQRF4J20 на 245 лошадиных сил. Эксперт издания \"За рулем\" протестировал эту машину и поделился своими впечатлениями. Его удивило долгое подключение задних колес на ровной дороге. На старте передние колеса из-за этого могут заметно буксовать. При выборе одного из заложенных в машине внедорожных режимов проблема исчезает. Эксперт отметил, что задний дифференциал блокирует бортовая электроника и остается лишь наблюдать за ее действиями на приборной панели. Также он был удивлен отсутствием буксировочных проушин и сообщил, что, согласно ОТТС, буксировка прицепа для Jetour T2 не предусмотрена, поэтому любой фаркоп на этом авто посчитают за незаконный тюнинг. По словам эксперта, мощность мотора варьируется от 197 до 249 лошадиных сил. Устройство включает в себя алюминиевый блок, чугунные гильзы, цепной привод газораспределительного механизма и непосредственный впрыск. Ресурс мотора составляет примерно 250-300 тысяч километров. При этом, хотя и разрешается заправка бензином АИ‐92, требуется небюджетное масло 0W‐20. Но объем его заправки всего 4,2 литра. Отмечается наличие у машины динамики при езде на любом режиме. Однако расход топлива составляет 9,3 литра на 100 километров, причем в городе он может возрасти до 11,6 литра. Но при езде по трассе можно в среднем уложиться и в восемь литров. Эксперт также подчеркнул \"всеядность\" подвески, похвалил заводскую шумку, состав комплектаций и наличие почти полутора десятка электронных помощников (в максимальной комплектации). Кроме того, он назвал неплохой работу адаптивного круиз-контроля и добавил, что при заявленной максимальной скорости 180 км/ч он способно поддерживать не более150 км/ч, объяснив разницу возможностями машинного зрения. По данным издания, цены на полноприводный Jetour T2 у дилеров в РФ стартуют с отметки в 3 759 000 рублей. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_640x0_80_0_0_26b95f166ca8591545483e7af399df25.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_640x0_80_0_0_26b95f166ca8591545483e7af399df25.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_640x0_80_0_0_26b95f166ca8591545483e7af399df25.jpg\" } , { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_283:0:3012:2047_640x0_80_0_0_7943dd9a3181ebb4fc1851aa1c5a1e74.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_283:0:3012:2047_640x0_80_0_0_7943dd9a3181ebb4fc1851aa1c5a1e74.jpg\" } , { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_624:0:2671:2047_640x0_80_0_0_317defdbf990725b520478fb4f0f3b47.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_624:0:2671:2047_640x0_80_0_0_317defdbf990725b520478fb4f0f3b47.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 360 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_1280x0_80_0_0_83e962b88b48aa6c2167a429e291ecc1.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_1280x0_80_0_0_83e962b88b48aa6c2167a429e291ecc1.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_1280x0_80_0_0_83e962b88b48aa6c2167a429e291ecc1.jpg\" } , { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_283:0:3012:2047_1280x0_80_0_0_659549b3ad6290c4531509a01207975d.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_283:0:3012:2047_1280x0_80_0_0_659549b3ad6290c4531509a01207975d.jpg\" } , { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_624:0:2671:2047_1280x0_80_0_0_e8448314ff17270b67989d771237bb9b.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_624:0:2671:2047_1280x0_80_0_0_e8448314ff17270b67989d771237bb9b.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 720 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_1920x0_80_0_0_eb42d22f82b2cc48fa0cd09f6a32c6ad.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_1920x0_80_0_0_eb42d22f82b2cc48fa0cd09f6a32c6ad.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_0:97:3295:1950_1920x0_80_0_0_eb42d22f82b2cc48fa0cd09f6a32c6ad.jpg\" } , { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_283:0:3012:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_37e58ac07a4037488566886f019f5cb5.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_283:0:3012:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_37e58ac07a4037488566886f019f5cb5.jpg\" } , { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_624:0:2671:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_e9b2558a14f7ed791cc57ce1042d9c5e.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdnn.1prime.ru/img/84029/96/840299687_624:0:2671:2047_1920x0_80_0_0_e9b2558a14f7ed791cc57ce1042d9c5e.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 1080 } Китай увеличил поставки легковых авто в Россию 23 мая, 05:22",

This collaboration aims to deliver affordable 5G mobile broadband services across Ghana. The Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC) has been awarded 5G license and expected to launch 5G services across Ghana within the next six months, followed by expansion to other parts of Africa. Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC) will be the first 5G Mobile Broadband Shared Infrastructure Entity to build a nationwide 4G/5G network. The company will also work with MNO partners to launch affordable 4G/5G-enabled FWA CPEs and smart phones in Ghana within this calendar year. The partnership aims to enhance the lives of Ghanaians by introducing digital services in education, healthcare and digital payment transactions through P2P (peer-to-peer), P2M (peer-to-merchant) and M2M (merchant-to-merchant) systems, thereby reducing digital divide and promoting financial inclusion. Additionally, the multiplayer partnership will support NGIC in the entire deployment of network infrastructure and associated services, as are looking to address enterprise and consumer markets with enhanced digital services. To achieve this, Tech Mahindra will build a Cloud Native Core Network powered by OEM (original equipment manufacturer) platforms. NGIC plans to adopt India’s model of affordable handsets, digital platforms and localised content and applications. The goal is to replicate this high-speed mobile data model across Africa, beginning with Ghana. Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, Minister for Communications and Digitalisation for the Republic of Ghana, said, “The creation of a shared 5G Mobile Broadband Infrastructure is critical for delivering affordable, high-speed data access to the people of Ghana and help achieve our Digital Ghana vision. The creation of NGIC as a neutral, shared platform, accessible to all mobile network operators and tower companies, will help to expand 5G services rapidly across the country. We are inspired by India’s digital infrastructure and low-cost mobile data usage and keen to replicate it in Ghana.” Mikko Lavanti, the senior vice president of Middle East and Africa at Nokia, said, “Ghana holds immense potential for mobile broadband growth on the back of an unmet demand for connectivity. Establishing an Open Access Network like NGIC will foster innovation and create numerous opportunities across various sectors. We are proud of our partnership with NGIC in helping Ghana realise its digital vision and unlock its full potential. Arun Bhikshesvaran, the CEO of Radisys, said, “Connectivity for all, through the use of open and disaggregated multi-access solutions, is a key component of Radisys’ initiatives to bridge the digital divide. By bringing Fixed Wireless Access alongside 4G and to help drive economic growth and digital inclusion, Radisys looks forward to helping Ascend and NGIC build a disruptive and affordable shared broadband infrastructure across Ghana. In addition, our communications platform and digital applications will help create new digital experiences that empower the Ghanian community and foster sustainable and inclusive development.” Manish Mangal, the chief technology officer, telecom and global business head, network services at Tech Mahindra, said, “Our partnership with Next Gen Infra Co. is based on a shared vision for digital connectivity and providing Network-as-a-Service to innovate and bring cost efficiency to the telecom market in Ghana and Africa. Echoing our promise to scale at speed, we aim to rapidly advance operations by building a Cloud Native Core Network with leading OEM platforms combined with Tech Mahindra’s automation platform, netOps.ai. Together with NGIC, we will support the complete network infrastructure deployment and introduce high-speed in the region.” Harkirit Singh, the CEO, ascend digital and executive director at NGIC, said, “NGIC intends to launch its wholesale 4G/ 5G Network as a Service and make it available to all mobile network operators within the next six months.

        "content": "Внимание грузинского общества и западных партнеров приковано к грузинскому парламенту. «Грузинская мечта» намерена сегодня на пленарном заседании преодолеть президентское вето на законопроект «О прозрачности иностранного влияния», который называют «российским законом». Накануне заседания парламента в соцсетях распространяются заявления и призывы к депутатам парламентского большинства не преодолевать президентское вето на закон об «иноагентах». Писатель Давид Горгиладзе на своей странице в Facebook пишет, что прошедшая ночь имела библейскую окраску: «Христос знал, что его предаст один. Грузия знает, что ее предадут 84». Именно 84 депутата в третьем чтении 14 мая проголосовали за принятие закона об иноагентах. Лектор университета Ильи Майя Хеладзе обращает внимание, что всего 10 депутатов из «Грузинской мечты», смогут изменить ход событий в лучшую сторону: «10 ответственных депутатов из 83 осквернителей смогли бы написать историю Грузии». Фотограф Гоча Чанадири обратился к депутатам «Грузинской мечты»: «Не преодолевайте вето. Прислушайтесь к европейским друзьям, а не к врагам из России. Членство в парламенте и правительстве не вечно. Когда вас не будет у власти , и вы пойдёте по улице или окажетесь в застолье, вас пристыдят из-за этого дня!» «Видимо этот день станет одним из позорных дней в истории страны. Не стоит его встречать дома или на работе. Если ты сегодня жив и живешь здесь, лучше находиться на проспекте Руставели. Вблизи того здания где свершится акт предательства . Сегодня это - минимум минимума, а потом мы должны сделать все, чтобы этот день остался в истории одним из позорных дней, а не трагических. Для этого у нас будет 5 месяцев», – пишет Зураб Джапаридзе, лидер «Гирчи – больше свободы», подразумевая предстоящие парламентские выборы 26 октября. Очень многие грузинские пользователи соцсетей напоминают о 78-ой статье грузинской Конституции, обязывающей все ветви власти сделать все возможное для интеграции страны в ЕС и НАТО, и обвиняют парламентское большинство «Грузинской мечты» в нарушении Конституции. Утром на своей странице в Х глава внешнеполитического ведомства ЕС Жозеп Боррель написал: «Закон об иностранном влиянии не соответствует ценностям ЕС. Если закон будет принят, это повлияет на путь Грузии в ЕС. Мы обсудим реакцию ЕС и примем решение на июньском заседании Совета по иностранным делам. Октябрьские выборы станут проверкой приверженности Грузии своему будущему в ЕС». Германский политик, глава комитета по внешним связям Бундестага Михаэль Рот обращается к грузинским коллегам из правящей партии: «Для нас, политиков, крайне важно внимательно слушать наших людей. Послание грузинского народа кристально ясно: остановите закон об иностранных агентах! Уважаемые коллеги Парламента Грузии, воспользуйтесь шансом сегодня! Верните свою великую страну в нужное русло». Ранее спикеры парламентов семи стран-членов ЕС [Чехия, Эстония, Латвия, Литва, Франция, Нидерланды, Польша] призвали парламент Грузии отозвать закон об «иноагентах». В их заявлении, адресованном спикеру парламента Шалве Папуашвили, говорится, что последние решения, принятые в Грузии, «тревожны», а действия правительства противоречат ценностям и принципам, которыми Грузия обязалась руководствоваться.",

        "content": "The Met Office is predicting a pretty miserable June. According to the UK’s national forecaster, it could be even wetter than it is in May. It comes after a tumultuous May, which has seen periods of sun as well as torrential downpours in the capital. This is very bad news for those hoping for a warm and sunny summer. On its website, The Met Office says “on balance, it is probable that a continuation of variable, slow moving weather patterns are likely through much of June, similar to that which has been experienced through May. READ MORE: Forgotten London water park left derelict for a decade where kids used to spend 'unforgettable' summers “However with potentially slow moving weather systems there is still a chance that longer-lived drier, or even wetter, spells are entirely possible too.” The Met Office predicts that today (May 28) will be ‘cloudy to start with some patchy light rain in the south. During the morning all parts will see some rain which will turn heavy at times. Turning drier and brightening up a little later this afternoon. Maximum temperature 18C’. Whereas tonight will be ‘partly cloudy overnight perhaps with the odd shower, most likely before midnight. Many parts remaining dry with long clear spells and mist patches forming later. Minimum temperature 10C’. Tomorrow (May 29) will see ‘variable amounts of cloud with scattered showers and some bright or sunny spells. Showers locally heavy, thundery and prolonged during the afternoon. Breezy near the south coast. Maximum temperature 21C’. And from Thursday (May 30) through to Saturday (June 1) there will be ‘further heavy showers on Thursday, prolonged and thundery at times. Showers much less frequent on Friday and Saturday with lengthy dry sunny periods. Temperatures near normal. Rather breezy at times’. Got a story?

        "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for May 27 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Chicago man convicted of murder a decade ago based in part on testimony from an eyewitness who is legally blind is suing the city and the police department. Darien Harris was convicted by a judge in 2014 in connection with a 2011 fatal shooting at a South Side gas station. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was released in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he was freed from prison. In April, Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit accusing police of fabricating evidence and coercing witnesses into making false statements, according to The Chicago Tribune. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back on track. 6 MEN CHARGED WITH STAGING STRING OF CHICAGO-AREA ROBBERIES TO GET IMMIGRATION VISAS Darien Harris, who was convicted of murder a decade ago based in part on testimony from an eyewitness who is legally blind, is suing Chicago and its police department. (Chicago Tribune via Getty Images) \"I don't have any financial help. I'm still (treated like) a felon, so I can't get a good job,\" he said. \"It's hard for me to get into school. I've been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.\" Harris, an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested, was picked out of a police lineup and identified in court by the legally blind eyewitness. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and observed a person aiming a handgun, adding that the shooter bumped into him.

He said yes but claimed he did not have vision problems. The eyewitness' doctor determined he was legally blind nine years before the incident, according to court records. A gas station attendant also testified in court that Harris was not the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Cook County, where Chicago is located, in 2023 alone.

        "content": "The Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) reports that domestic and foreign portfolio transactions in Nigeria’s equity market totaled N346.23 billion in April 2024. The News Chronicles was provided with a statement from the NGX that included this information. The Exchange reports that as of April 30, 2024, overall transactions at the country’s exchange had dropped from N538.54 billion (about $404.69 million) in March 2024 to N346.23 billion (around $260.24 million). This is a 35.71% fall. The decrease could also be linked to the generally negative attitudes of investors, who have demonstrated cautious actions due to the ongoing volatility in the Nigerian market. A substantial fall in the market value of N3.57 trillion was suffered by the NGX All-Share Index in April as a result of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) policy pronouncements that tended to favor fixed-income assets. A more thorough examination of all the transactions carried out in April 2024 compared to March 2024 showed that there was a 49.27% drop in total domestic transactions from N444.28 billion in March to N225.40 billion in April 2024. However, between March 2024 and April 2024, the total amount of foreign transactions climbed by 28.19%, from N94.26 billion (about $70.83 million) to N120.83 billion (around $90.83 million). Retail and institutional investors Institutional investors outpaced individual investors by 10%, according to the NGX. Retail sales dropped by 54.89% from N223.37 billion in March 2024 to N100.77 billion in April 2024, according to a comparison of domestic transactions. The institutional makeup of the domestic market also declined, going from N220.91 billion in March 2024 to N124.63 billion in April 2024, a 43.58% drop. Performance in more than ten years Domestic transactions plummeted 10.94% between 2007 and 2023, from N3.556 trillion to N3.167 trillion, while international transactions fell 33.28% between 2007 and 2023, from N616 billion to N411 billion. About 89% of all transactions in 2023 were made within the country; only 11% of all transactions during that time were made outside of the country. Things To Note The NGX All-Share Index saw a significant downturn in April, which cost the market value of N3.57 trillion. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) various policy decisions had an impact on the index’s notable decline. The new recapitalization plan for commercial banks, which intends to generate an estimated N4 trillion in extra capital over the next two years, was a noteworthy announcement. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN decided to raise the benchmark interest rate by 200 basis points, from 22.75% to 24.75%, and the market responded to this announcement as well. The local stock exchange saw a 6% fall as a result of the significant rate hike, which sparked stronger sell-offs. The benchmark index closed at 98,225.63 points. Notably, the NGX All-Share Index closed at 98,225.63 points, below the 100,000-point mark. This is a sharp contrast to the index’s peak of 104,562.06 points at the end of March 2024.

        "content": "If you don’t want to buy a new mattress, but you’re looking for a more supportive and luxurious bedtime experience, then a mattress topper could be just the ticket. Memorial Day might now be behind us but some of the best mattress deals deals are still live — but you'll have to act fast. One of our favorite mattress topper deals still live from the weekend is Viscosoft's Select High-Density Mattress Topper, with savings reaching up to $80 off. Choose between a depth of 3\" or $\" inches to make your soft mattress feel firmer. This sale means you can buy a queen size Viscosoft Select High-Density Mattress Topper for just $199.95 (was $269.95) Like some of the best mattresses of 2024 , this topper is made from high-density, gel-infused memory foam, and offers a wide range of benefits. As well as boosting your comfort, it’s designed to promote spinal alignment, relieve pressure points and eliminate motion transfer – all of which should improve your sleep. This Memorial Day mattress sale is due to end any time now, so act fast if you want to save big on this mattress topper. Viscosoft Select High-Density Mattress Topper Was: From $214.95 Now: From $159.95 Saving: Up to $80 Summary: Viscosoft’s the brand behind one of the best mattress toppers of the year (the Viscosoft Active Cooling Mattress Topper). The Select High-Density is another best-selling mattress topper, and is an excellent choice for anyone wishing to improve their sleep without shelling out on a brand-new mattress. Made of high-density memory foam that (according to Viscosoft) weighs twice as much as competitors’ foam, it provides superior comfort and support – especially for people who suffer from back, hip and neck pain. Indeed, it won the Sleep Foundation’s 2024 Best Mattress Topper for Back Pain award. What’s more, this product features a removable, washable cover, enabling you to keep your topper clean and fresh at all times. Price history: Unlike some mattress companies, Viscosoft sale events are usually on the conservative side. It usually takes part – you just might need to visit the Viscosoft website to see what discounts the company is offering, as buyer’s guides often tend to focus on your Emmas and Tempur-Pedics of this world. Will you ever see this mattress topper cheaper than what it’s going for right now? Possibly, although it was the exact same price in February’s Presidents’ Day mattress sales, so this appears to be Viscosoft’s go-to deal at the moment. Benefits: 90-day money back guarantee, free delivery, five-year warranty",

        "description": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Torrential rain brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's remote northeastern state of Mizoram, killing at least 10 people, while harsh weather hampers efforts to rescue those trapped, authorities said on Tuesday.",
        "content": "Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, killing at least 16 and cutting power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighboring Bangladesh. Bitter weather was holding up rescue efforts in Melthum, the site of the quarry outside the state capital of Aizawl, a state disaster management official said. \"There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse,\" the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. There were no immediate details of the number trapped. The heavy rain in Mizoram, which borders Bangladesh, also unleashed landslides in the region. Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity lines in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees. It is the first of the frequent storms expected to pound the low-lying coasts of the South Asian neighbors this year as climate change drives up surface temperatures at sea.",

Compartir Copiar enlace WhatsApp Facebook X LinkedIn Telegram El Pleno del Ayuntamiento de Salamanca ha aprobado este martes de forma definitiva el dictamen de la Comisión Municipal de Policía, Tráfico y Transportes que modifica la Ordenanza municipal reguladora de la instalación de terrazas en terrenos de uso público, de manera que se habilitan las denominadas Zonas de Especial Interés Gastronómico (ZEIG). El concejal de Policía Administrativa, Fernando Carabias , explicó durante el pleno que superada la pandemia, titulares de establecimientos que nunca antes habían podido tener la posibilidad de instalar terrazas solicitaron fórmulas para poder seguir disponiendo de veladores en la calle, ocupando vía pública. También muchos ciudadanos demandaban esa posibilidad, después de haber adquirido o modificado sus hábitos y costumbres en relación con el uso de los servicios que ofrecen los establecimientos de hostelería. Esta situación se regula con las Zonas de Especial Interés Gastronómico, que además de proporcionar cobertura y seguridad jurídica a la actividad económica hostelera (frente a otras propuestas de la oposición sin soporte legal), generan riqueza y puestos de trabajo. «Con esta modificación se añade una alternativa para el sector hostelero y a sus diferentes proveedores, como carnicerías, pescaderías, fruterías, panaderías y muchos otros relacionados con la distribución, los servicios y fundamentalmente la alimentación, pero sobre todo a muchas familias salmantinas, en las que alguno de sus miembros logrará un puesto de trabajo o consolidará el que ahora tiene», añadió el edil. Al mismo tiempo, queda sobradamente motivado y justificado que esta modificación de la Ordenanza no compromete la estabilidad presupuestaria ni la sostenibilidad financiera porque no tiene ninguna repercusión en el gasto público, pero sí en sus ingresos en concepto de las nuevas tasas por ocupación de terrenos de uso público. Tampoco tiene repercusión ni lleva consigo incidencia significativa en las cargas administrativas. Todo ello sin perjudicar el tránsito peatonal ni la accesibilidad de las personas con discapacidad o movilidad reducida. Así, Fernando Carabias fue tajante al argumentar que se imponen condiciones muy restrictivas para esta posible autorización y que no sea algo generalizado en toda la ciudad, como ocurrió durante la pandemia, y «no en cualquier lugar ni de modo aislado o desordenado», sino propio de una zona concreta por cumplir una serie de característica de tradición hostelera. Para garantizar el cumplimiento de la normativa de manera estricta, continuó Carabias, «pondremos todo nuestro empeño» y «estaremos muy vigilantes también en el control del ruido, que es una lucha en la que el Ayuntamiento está y estará siempre al lado de los vecinos, para lo que llevaremos a cabo todas las acciones que sean necesarias para garantizar el descanso y la tranquilidad de todos». De hecho, la instalación de estas terrazas no se podrá realizar frente a ventanas de viviendas de planta baja. En el caso de la pérdida de plazas de aparcamiento reguladas por la ORA durante la temporada en la que se instalen las terrazas, los vecinos de esas calles podrán disponer de más plazas próximas a sus viviendas «porque buena parte de la zona cero cercana a ellas formará parte de la zona de residentes. Es decir, se les amplían las posibilidades de aparcar donde hasta ese momento no podían a pesar de tener el distintivo de residente. Atendemos así una petición de números vecinos». Para finalizar, el concejal de Policía Administrativa recordó que el Equipo de Gobierno del Partido Popular «pretende en todo momento tomar decisiones e implantar medidas con un objetivo muy concreto: ayudar a las personas, ayudar a los salmantinos, y por ello, apoyar al tejido productivo de Salamanca, en este caso la hostelería, que es un motor económico clave en nuestra ciudad, con la consiguiente e importante generación de empleo que de ello se deriva».",

        "description": "South African National Taxi Council announced on X that taxi-related protests in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, are indefinitely suspended.",
        "content": "Taxi-related protests in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, have been indefinitely suspended, according to a post by the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) on X formerly known as Twitter. The protests, which brought Mthatha to a standstill on Monday, saw taxi operators block major exits, severely impacting local activities. Protests had an effect on the Independent Electoral Commission The protests had a significant effect on the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) , preventing 455 voting stations from opening by 9:00. The blocked roads initially stopped IEC Presiding Officers from accessing storage sites to collect voting materials. However, by midday, the South African Police Services (SAPS) managed to clear some roads, allowing the casting of special votes to resume in several areas. By 13:00 on Monday, an IEC update revealed that 108 of the initially affected 455 voting stations were still closed. The disruption was most severe in Port St. Johns, where 81 out of 135 voting stations remained non-operational. The unrest also saw an IEC officer stabbed during community protests. Medical services were also disrupted The Eastern Cape Health Department reported that the protests also disrupted medical services. Ambulances could not access Mthatha, leaving patients in need of urgent medical care stranded. Spokesperson Mkhululi Ndamase noted that hospital staff from Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, Mthatha Regional Hospital, and St. Barnabas Hospital were unable to commute due to the blocked roads. Consequently, hospitals operated with minimal staff. Ndamase assured that as soon as the roads reopened, staff would resume their duties. “As soon as roads reopen, those who are supposed to be on duty will go to work to relieve those who worked the night shift. “In emergency cases, the department will use aeromedical services to transfer patients,” said Ndamase. The protests in Mthatha began on Monday morning when aggrieved taxi operators hijacked trucks to block the N2 entry and exit points to the town. This action followed a crackdown on the taxi industry due to a surge in violence, which appeared to violate a recent peace agreement. As previously reported by The South African , additional Public Order Policing units were deployed in KwaZulu-Natal and Mthatha to bolster existing crime combatting efforts. General Masemola emphasised the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment for the upcoming elections. He tasked the officers with preventing and combating criminal activities including protests while ensuring that South Africans can exercise their right to vote in peace. “We are sending you off to maintain law and order. No disruptions and acts of criminality should take place under your watch. We are sending you out there to protect the constitutional right of South Africans and the integrity of the election process,” said General Masemola.",

О драке между двумя 10-летними российскими школьниками стало известно 23 мая. Мальчики возвращались вместе из школы. В пути они повздорили и начали выяснять отношения на кулаках. Один из третьеклассников заранее подготовился к конфликту — он обмотал руку проволокой, которую нашел, гуляя с отцом. Позже мальчик рассказал родителям, что набросился на ровесника неспроста. По его словам, тот со своим другом часто над ним издевались, запирали в кабинете. Последней каплей для ребенка стало то, что товарищ якобы вымогал у него 500 рублей. После этого третьеклассник решил мстить. Его обидчика госпитализировали. Оба участника драки пока не ходят в школу. Семья нападавшего мальчика предпочла не общаться с социальными педагогами, они решили отвечать через классного руководителя. Родственники пострадавшего ученика потребовали наказать обидчика. Ранее сообщалось , что в Красноярском крае школьники на видео подрались перед толпой сверстников.",

        "description": "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag's future is uncertain at the moment, and Mark Ogden has provided the latest update.",
        "content": "manager Erik ten Hag has come under pressure this season after a disappointing campaign, and journalist Mark Ogden has suggested that the situation could be resolved by the end of the week. The future of ten Hag as manager of United has become a subject of intense speculation and debate in recent months. As the 2023-2024 season concluded with the Red Devils securing an eighth-place finish in the Premier League but winning the FA Cup, the club finds itself at a crossroads regarding ten Hag's tenure. In his first season, the Dutch tactician guided the team to a third-place finish in the Premier League and won the Carabao Cup, so there's no doubt they've failed to progress this term. Speaking on the Back Pages podcast, journalist . \"Yeah, Erik ten Hag has known, probably since February, that his position was on the line. INEOS and Manchester United haven't really distanced themselves from the stories that many of us have written, saying they've been assessing other candidates. Gareth Southgate, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Frank, Kieran McKenna, Mauricio Pochettino - all these names have been put to United and they've not really been knocked back. So there's been a process going on to to identify whether there's a manager out there who can do a better job than ten Hag. Now I think that process will probably be resolved at some point this week.\" United's victory in the FA Cup final against Manchester City was a significant achievement, especially with it being against their local rivals, but INEOS might be looking at the bigger picture. The trophy might have papered over the cracks of what has been a disappointing campaign, and the fact that the hierarchy appear to be speaking to a host of different managers isn't a good sign for the former Ajax coach. Erik ten Hag's Manchester United record Matches 114 Wins 68 Draws 15 Losses 31 Points per match 1.92 According to a report from The Times, before the FA Cup final, with talks already being held with representatives. With INEOS heading into their first full campaign as partial owners of the club, they might be considering bringing in their own manager to steer them in the right direction. Erik ten Hag has averaged 1.92 points per game during his time at Manchester United. Ipswich Town manager McKenna has done an excellent job with the Tractor Boys, helping them gain back-to-back promotions from League One up to the Premier League. The 38-year-old has previously spent time at Old Trafford as a coach, and he was on United's list to take over from ten Hag. Despite the Manchester club's interest in McKenna, , according to The Athletic's David Ornstein. It's a major statement from the newly promoted side as they look to solidify themselves as a Premier League club next season.",

        "description": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations.",
        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel have nosedived with the diplomatic recognitions by two EU members , and Madrid insisting on Monday that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to rethink their position. Slovenia’s Prime Minister Robert Golob said Monday his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries, including stops in Oslo and Dublin, to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively. “The recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries,\" Norway's top diplomat said. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . ___ Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel and Jan M.

Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to rethink their position. Slovenia’s Prime Minister Robert Golob said Monday his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries, including stops in Oslo and Dublin, to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively. “The recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries,\" Norway's top diplomat said. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . ___ Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel and Jan M.

        "content": "Инсектицидни сапуни Инсектицидните сапуни са популярен и ефективен вариант за борба с акарите по доматените растения. Тези сапуни действат, като разрушават външния защитен слой на акарите, карайки ги да се дехидратират и да умрат. Когато използвате инсектициден сапун, е важно да покриете добре растението, като се уверите, че спреят достига до долната страна на листата, където често се намират акарите. Може да се наложи повторно прилагане на всеки 5-7 дни, докато популацията на акарите бъде овладяна. Отглеждане на домати - всичко, което НЕ знаете За още любопитни и полезни статии - очакваме ви във Viber канала ни! Последвайте ни тук! Масло от нийм Маслото от нийм е естествен пестицид, получен от семената на дървото нийм. То има многобройни начини на действие, включително като средство за борба с болестите, репелент и смутител на растежа. Маслото от нийм е ефективно срещу широк спектър от вредители, включително паяжини. За да използвате маслото от нийм, смесете го според инструкциите на производителя и го напръскайте по всички части на доматеното растение, като обърнете особено внимание на долната страна на листата. Маслото от нийм може да се прилага на всеки 7-14 дни, ако е необходимо. Градински масла Тези масла, често получени от петрол или растения, могат да задушат акарите и техните яйца. Градинските масла трябва да се използват с повишено внимание, особено в горещо време, тъй като могат да причинят фитотоксичност (увреждане на растенията), ако се прилагат неправилно. Следвайте внимателно инструкциите на етикета и осигурете добро покритие на растението. Градинските масла могат да бъдат добър вариант за справяне с акарите, без да се прибягва до по-сурови химикали. Митициди При тежки заразявания с акари може да се наложи използването на специфични митициди (пестициди, насочени към акарите). Продукти, съдържащи активни съставки като абамектин, спиромезифен или бифеназат, могат да бъдат ефективни. Винаги следвайте инструкциите на етикета и вземайте предвид интервала преди беритба (времето между последното приложение и момента, в който плодовете могат да бъдат безопасно прибрани), когато използвате химически средства за контрол. Кога е най-подходящото време за засаждане на домати? Домашно приготвени средства за защита Прост домашен спрей може да се направи от съставки като вода, сапун и растително масло. Смесете една супена лъжица мек сапун за съдове и една супена лъжица растително масло с един галон вода. Този разтвор може да се напръска върху доматените растения, за да се справи с популацията на акарите. Той обаче може да не е толкова ефективен, колкото търговските продукти, и трябва да се използва внимателно, за да не се повредят растенията. Биологичен контрол Въвеждането на естествени хищници на акари, като божии котки, хищни акари (като Phytoseiulus persimilis) и ларви на дантела, може да бъде ефективна дългосрочна стратегия за борба с акарите. Тези полезни насекоми могат да помогнат да се контролира популацията на акарите, без да е необходимо да се използват химически пръскания. Културни практики Наред с пръскането, прилагането на добри културни практики може да помогне за предотвратяване на заразяването с акари. Редовно преглеждайте растенията, отстранявайте и унищожавайте силно заразените листа и поддържайте градината свободна от отпадъци, където акарите могат да презимуват. Правилното поливане и избягването на стреса за растенията също могат да направят доматите ви по-малко податливи на нападения от акари. Като комбинирате тези методи и поддържате бдителна грижа за доматените растения, можете ефективно да се справите и да предотвратите нападенията от акари, осигурявайки здрава и продуктивна реколта от домати.

        "description": "Two historically cheap high-octane dividend stocks that have consistently raised their payouts for a quarter of a century are ripe for the picking by opportunistic income seekers.",
        "content": "Over the last century, Wall Street has been a virtually unstoppable wealth creator for patient investors. Although other asset classes have helped build nominal wealth, such as oil, gold, bonds, and housing, none comes close to the annualized average returns over the last 100 years that stocks have brought to the table. With thousands of publicly traded companies and exchange-traded funds to choose from, there's an investment strategy that fits the goals and risk tolerance of just about every investor. But among these countless strategies, few can hold a candle to the juicy returns delivered from buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks over an extended period. Last year, the investment researchers at Hartford Funds released a detailed report (\"The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future\") that examined the many ways dividend-paying companies have outperformed non-payers over the long run. In a collaboration with Ned Davis Research, recently updated data from this report finds that dividend-paying companies have more than doubled the annual average return of public companies that don't pay a dividend over the last 50 years (1973-2023): 9.17% vs. 4.27% . Further, the dividend payers were, on average, 6% less volatile than the S&P 500 , while the non-payers were 18% more volatile. Perhaps the best thing about investing in dividend stocks is that value can always be found -- even with Wall Street's major stock indexes hitting fresh all-time highs. The real challenge is deciding which dividend stocks to invest in, because not all dividend payers are created equally . Companies with the ability to increase their dividend payouts year after year are typically time-tested, recurringly profitable, and capable of providing transparent long-term growth outlooks. In other words, they're just the type of companies we'd expect to increase in value over the long run. At the moment, two magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- \"ultra-high-yield\" stocks have yields that are four or more times higher than the S&P 500s yield -- that are working on base annual payout increase streaks of at least 25 years are ripe for the picking by opportunistic income seekers. Realty Income: 6.04% yield The first high-octane dividend stock with an extensive streak of increasing its base annual payout that's begging to be bought right now is the premier company among retail real estate investment trusts (REITs), Realty Income ( O -0.25% ) . Realty Income has increased its monthly distribution for 107 consecutive quarters. O Dividend data by YCharts . Less than two weeks ago, Realty Income declared its 647th consecutive monthly dividend and has increased its payout in each of the past 107 quarters (that's nearly 27 years). Based on its newly announced monthly distribution of $0.2625 per share, Realty Income's forward dividend yield has, once again, topped 6%. The primary reason the last two years have been challenging for Realty Income's stock is the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. The steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades sent short-term Treasury bill yields soaring to around 5%. Treasury bills offer effectively no risk to an investors' principle, and have thus been more attractive than higher-yielding REITs in recent quarters. But at some point, the value proposition of REITs begins to outweigh this risk/reward scenario -- and I'd strongly argue we've hit that point with this leading retail REIT. Following the completion of its Spirit Realty Capital acquisition in January, Realty Income ended the first quarter with 15,485 commercial real estate (CRE) properties in its portfolio. It estimates that approximately 90% of the total rent that it collects from these CRE properties is resilient to an economic downturn and the pressures from e-commerce . The secret? Realty Income prominently rents to stand-alone retailers that sell basic necessity goods or provide basic need services. Grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, home improvement stores, drug stores, and automotive service locations make up nearly 42% of its annualized contractual rent. These are businesses that are going to generate predictable cash flow in pretty much any economic climate. The real advantage of leasing to high-quality, stand-alone businesses in basic necessity industries is not having to worry about finding new tenants or getting paid. Since the start of this century, the median S&P 500 REIT has enjoyed a respectable 94.2% occupancy rate. Realty Income's median occupancy rate is 98.2% over the last 23 years and change. It's easy to raise the company's dividend for 107 consecutive quarters when tenants generate predictable cash flow and pay their bills. In addition to its top-tier retail CRE portfolio, Realty Income has been expanding into new verticals . It's completed two deals in the gaming industry over the last two years, purchased Spirit Realty Capital to diversify its revenue stream, and formed a joint venture with Digital Realty Trust to develop build-to-suit data centers for lease. Yes , this means Realty Income can benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution over the long run. Best of all, Realty Income's stock is cheaper than it's been in more than a decade . The 11.6 multiple to forward-year cash flow Realty Income closed at on May 24 represents a 33% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the last five years. Enterprise Products Partners: 7.3% yield The second ultra-high-yield dividend stock sporting a 25-year payout increase streak is energy juggernaut Enterprise Products Partners ( EPD ) . Enterprise doles out its dividend quarterly and has been increasing its base annual distribution since becoming a public company in July 1998. Its forward yield, based on its current distribution, is an S&P 500-crushing 7.3%, and it's returned an aggregate of $53.2 billion to its investors, including buybacks, since going public. To be fair, oil and gas stocks aren't going to be everyone's cup of tea. The fossil fuel industry is viewed a \"sin\" industry by some investors. Further, the historic drop-off in crude oil and natural gas demand four years ago during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns is still fresh in the minds of many investors. Drilling companies were absolutely clobbered when crude oil futures briefly crashed to negative $40 per barrel. Enterprise Products Partners has increased its base annual distribution in each of the last 25 years. EPD Dividend data by YCharts . But if you can overcome this recency bias and have no qualms about investing in the U.S. fossil fuel industry, Enterprise Products Partners has the necessary tools to make patient income seekers notably richer. The reason Enterprise has been such a phenomenal investment for so long is because it's not a driller. It's a vital energy middleman for the U.S. fossil fuel industry. It operates more than 50,000 miles of transmission pipeline, 26 fractionation facilities, and can store 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas and in excess of 300 million barrels of petroleum/refined liquids. The beauty of being one of North America's largest midstream operators is that it's able to secure long-term, fixed-fee contracts with drilling companies . Most of the company's contracts are fixed-fee, which removes spot price volatility from the equation. Being able to transparently and accurately forecast cash flow a year or more in advance is what's given Enterprise Products Partners' management team the confidence to raise its distribution, undertake new projects, and make earnings-accretive acquisitions. In terms of major projects, the company has green-lit nearly $7 billion in spending. Most of these projects, which are focused on expanding the company's natural gas liquids (NGLs) segment, are slated to come online before the end of 2025. Capital spending should decline by $1 billion (or more) in 2026, likely leading to even faster earnings growth. Meanwhile, a steady diet of bolt-on acquisitions has expanded the reach of Enterprise's pipelines and fattened its cash flow. Three months ago, Enterprise Products Partners agreed to pay $375 million to Western Midstream Partners for the remaining 20% interest in the 620,000-barrel-per-day Whitethorn pipeline it didn't already own, as well as the remaining 25% equity interest in two NGL fractionators it didn't own. There's plenty of incentive for Enterprise to add on pipeline and NGL interests in the future. Enterprise Products Partners should also be a clear-cut beneficiary of reduced capital spending by energy majors following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Years of reduced spending has constrained the global supply of oil and helped to boost its spot price. A higher sustained price for crude oil is liable to encourage more domestic drilling and help Enterprise secure more lucrative contracts. Enterprise Products Partners looks like a screaming bargain at roughly 7 times forward-year cash flow and just shy of 10 times forward-year earnings .",

        "content": "Der Preisanstieg für Ferienwohnungen in den Berggebieten ist zunächst aber weiter gegangen: Im ersten Quartal 2024 kletterten die Immobilienpreise für Zweitwohnungen im gehobenen Bereich laut dem «UBS Alpine Property Focus 2024» um knapp 4 Prozent im Vergleich zum entsprechenden Vorjahresquartal. «Im Schnitt kostet eine Ferienwohnung in Schweizer Berggebieten damit 13'000 Franken pro Quadratmeter», sagte Maciej Skoczek, Immobilien-Ökonom bei der UBS, am Dienstag an einer Medienkonferenz anlässlich der Vorstellung der Studie. Damit seien die Preise mittlerweile im Vergleich zu vor der Pandemie um rund 30 Prozent gestiegen. Die Preisdynamik hat sich seit 2022 aber etwas abgeschwächt. Im Jahr 2023 legten die Immobilienwerte in den touristischen Regionen noch um 6,2 Prozent zu. 2022 waren es sogar 7,9 Prozent. Dabei vergleicht die UBS jeweils die Durchschnittspreise im ersten Quartal eines Jahres mit dem entsprechenden Vorjahresquartal. Der «alpine Ferienboom» seit der Pandemie treibt die Preise also immer noch an, wenn auch nicht mehr so stark, so das Fazit. An der Spitze der teuersten Destinationen hat derweil Verbier den bisherigen Spitzenreiter St. Moritz abgelöst. Eine Zweitwohnung im gehobenen Segment kostet in Verbier mittlerweile im Schnitt 21'500 Franken pro Quadratmeter. Gefolgt von St. Moritz mit einem Quadratmeterpreis von 21'200 Franken. Zermatt belegt mit 19'900 Franken pro Quadratmeter den dritten Rang. Den höchsten Preisanstieg registrierte die UBS in Arosa mit 18 Prozent. Aber auch insgesamt legten die Preise in Graubünden mit knapp 6 Prozent durchschnittlich am stärksten zu im Vergleich zum Startquartal 2023. Im Berner Oberland war die Entwicklung am schwächsten, dort stagnierte das Preisniveau im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum. Dieser Trend dürfte sich nun auch in weiteren Regionen abzeichnen, wie Skoczek erklärte. Denn derzeit spreche vieles gegen eine Fortsetzung des aktuellen Preisbooms: «Die konjunkturelle Schwächephase wird die Nachfrage nach Zweitwohnungen dämpfen», so der UBS-Ökonom. Zudem dürften Kaufinteressenten die geforderten Preise vermehrt kritisch hinterfragen. Die Experten rechnen in diesem Jahr mit stagnierenden Preisen auf dem Zweitwohnungsmarkt.",

        "content": "Für beide Seiten ist es die letzte Gelegenheit, die zwölf Geschworenen zu überzeugen: Im Schweigegeldprozess gegen den früheren US-Präsidenten Trump ist heute der Tag der Schlussplädoyers. Es ist ein entscheidender Tag im ersten Strafprozess gegen einen ehemaligen US-Präsidenten. Für Ankläger und Verteidigung sei es die letzte Chance, die zwölf Geschworenen auf ihre Seite zu bringen, sagt Strafverteidigerin Brandi Harden im Sender CNN. Die Anwälte müssten den ganzen Prozess der vergangenen Wochen so zusammenschnüren, dass daraus ein überzeugendes Paket werde. Die Jury muss nun urteilen, ob die Staatsanwaltschaft zweifelsfrei nachgewiesen hat, dass Ex-Präsident Donald Trump die Geschäftsunterlagen seines Unternehmens gefälscht hat, um Enthüllungen über seine Fehltritte zu unterdrücken - weil diese ihm während seines Präsidentschaftswahlkampfs 2016 hätten schaden können. Schweigegeldzahlung an sich nicht strafbar Zunächst wird die Staatsanwaltschaft das Wort haben. Sie beschuldigt Trump, dass er einer ehemaligen Pornodarstellerin über seinen damaligen Anwalt Michael Cohen 130.000 Dollar Schweigegeld gezahlt hat. So habe er verhindern wollen, dass Stormy Daniels über ihre Affäre auspacken würde. Schweigegeldzahlungen sind in den USA nicht strafbar - wohl aber, sie vorsätzlich falsch zu deklarieren, erläutert Jury-Beraterin Melissa Gomez. \"Die Anklage will das große Bild darstellen. Sie wollen ein Verhaltensmuster von Trump zeigen, in das Michael Cohen passt. Es wäre für die Anklage sehr gefährlich gewesen, den Fall allein auf Cohens Aussage aufzubauen. Und deshalb gab es auch die anderen Zeugen\", so Gomez. Details über Begegnung mit Trump Neben Trumps Ex-Anwalt gehörte deshalb auch Ex-Pornodarstellerin Daniels selbst zu den Hauptzeugen. Sie berichtete so detailliert, dass es selbst Richter Juan Merchan zuviel geworden war. Daniels beschrieb jene Begegnung, die Trump stets geleugnet hat, bis zu dessen Genitalien. Trump streitet allerdings nicht ab, dass er das Schweigegeld über seinen Ex-Anwalt damals habe zahlen lassen. Und Gomez sagt: Trumps Verteidiger würden sich in ihrem Plädoyer vermutlich darauf konzentrieren, Cohen als Lügner darzustellen. Im Zeugenstand hatte der vormals wegen Steuerhinterziehung und Falschaussagen verurteilte Cohen zugegeben, dass er Trump damals auch bestohlen habe. Dessen heutiger Verteidiger Todd Blanche wird nicht müde zu betonen: Cohen müsse wieder ins Gefängnis. Zwölf Geschworene entscheiden über Trumps Schicksal Über Trumps Schuld oder Unschuld werden die zwölf Geschworenen entscheiden. Sie sollen voraussichtlich schon am Mittwoch ihre Beratungen beginnen. Das kann Tage oder Stunden dauern. Oder sie einigen sich gar nicht auf ein Urteil - wie es manche Beobachter für möglich halten: Das wäre dann eine \"hängende\", also eine uneinige Jury. Dann wäre der Prozess geplatzt. Anhänger stehen weiter zu Trump Sollten die Geschworenen Trump schuldig sprechen, dann legt Richter Merchan das Strafmaß fest. Trump könnten dann mehrere Jahre Haft drohen - auch auf Bewährung. Oder aber eine Geldstrafe. Das Urteil dürfte sich schließlich auch auf den laufenden Präsidentschaftswahlkampf auswirken. Beobachter rätseln jedoch selbst: Wie stark und zu wessen Vorteil? Trump inszeniert sich als Opfer einer politischen Hexenjagd. Präsident Biden scheint andererseits bislang nicht erkennbar vom Prozess zu profitieren. Biden sei weise genug, das Verfahren nicht für seine politische Kampagne auszuschlachten, sagt der demokratische Stratege Keith Boykin. Egal, wie das Urteil am Ende ausfalle - es werde Trumps Anhänger nicht von ihm abbringen.",

'רקנאטי, גרי דה מרסלאן', שמיוצר בכל שנה החל משנת 2013, מגיע משתי חלקות כרם ברמת הגולן. האחת בקדמת צבי, שנטועה בגובה 500 מטרים מעל פני הים, על אדמה בזלתית, והשנייה בתל פארס בגובה 750 מטרים, בנטיעה צפופה יותר של כ-300 גפנים לדונם. לדברי היינן: \"השילוב בין שני הטרוארים האלה מספק חוויה שלמה של רעננות פרחונית וגם עושר פרי ומורכבות\". \"בדיוק. קודם כל, רוזה הוא אחד היינות המאתגרים טכנית לייצור. לייצר רוזה אפילו מאתגר יותר מאשר לייצר אדום סינגל ויניארדס , במיוחד כשהמטרה היא לייצר אותו טוב ולא מה שנקרא ביי-פרודקט. \"בעולם, לא כל החלקות נועדות מלכתחילה להיות רוזה, הרוזה שאנחנו מייצרים ברקנאטי הוא מחלקות שניטעו כדי להיות רוזה ומגודלות כרוזה\". עד כמה מקדישים תשומת לב ייחודית לרוזה? אחד היינות המובילים של היקב, 'מרסלאן רזרב', מיוצר מענבי חלקה קטנה שהיא למעשה תת-חלקה בתוך החלקה המיועדת לייצור 'גרי דה מרסלאן'. \"החלקה הקטנה של המרסלאן הזני שאנחנו מיצרים, היא חלקה קטנה ומופרדת של 8 דונם שאנחנו מטפלים בה בנפרד\". אומר קובי. \"דווקא בגלל הפרופיל הפרחוני, לטובת 'גרי דה מרסלאן' אני מגדל אותו בגידולים קצת יותר גבוהים, גודל גרגר גדול יותר, בשונה מהאדום שאותו אני מכניס לקצת סטרס ולא נותן לו יותר מידי מים כדי לשמור על גרגרים קטנים.\" \"במקרה של הגרי כאמור, זה הפוך. למעשה את לא חווה בגרי בכלל אלמנטים טאניים, כשבאדום זה יכול להגיע בקלות, מכיוון שקליפת המרסלאן עבה וזה גם זן עם חרצנים. בגרי אני מקפיד על השרייה קצרה ביותר עם הקליפות ותסיסה בטמפרטורות נמוכות במכלי נירוסטה בלבד כדי לשמר את הרעננות.\"",

        "content": "אחרי ארבעה וחצי חודשים, 80,000 תושבים מפונים, אלפי טילים ונזק במיליארדים לרכוש, סוף סוף אישרה הממשלה אתמול את תכנית \"צפונה\" לחיזוק ושיקום רצועת הביטחון הנטושה בתוך שטח ישראל. \"זאת בשורה לתושבי הצפון\", כתב ראש הממשלה בנימין נתניהו בהודעה החגיגית שהפיץ לתקשורת. \"אנחנו ניתן פתרון לצפון - גם כלכלי, גם חברתי וגם פתרון ביטחוני רחב\". אלא שעיון בתוכנית שאושרה משרה תחושה מדכדכת: אין בה פתרון כלכלי - הכסף התוספתי שהוקצב לה מסתכם, במקרה הטוב בכמה עשרות מיליונים בודדים, שברובם זכה משרד ההתיישבות של אורית סטרוק, עבור צרכים שלא ברור איך הם קשורים לצפון. אין בה פתרונות חברתיים אמיתיים - בטח כשחלק מיישובי קו העימות לא נכללים בה משום מה, ופתרון ביטחוני, מצומצם אפילו, לא נראה באופק. מה שיש בה ללא ספק, זאת הזדמנות מעולה של נתניהו וסמוטריץ' לעשות על תושבי הצפון המוכים סיבוב יח\"צ שינסה להלבין את חוסר העניין, שלא לומר, השעמום, שהם מטילים עליהם ועל בכירי ממשלתם, שלא סופרים אותם גם עכשיו, בבואם לתת להם פתרונות. ההבטחה ל-3.5 מיליארד שקלים לטווח קצר שעליה הצביעה הממשלה ועוד 3 מיליארד לטווח הארוך, היא עבודה בעיניים. בעיקר, כי שני מיליארד שקלים מתוכה כבר תוקצבו בעבר במסגרת תכנית \"מגן לצפון\", בסך 5 מיליארד שקלים על פני עשור. אגב, אם התכנית היתה מיושמת במלואה, עד היום אמורים היו להיות מושקעים בבניית מיגון לתושבים 3.5 מיליארד שקלים, בדיוק בגובה התקציב לטווח הקצר, אבל למה לא למחזר תקציבים ישנים. זה ירוק ותורם לאיכות הסביבה. חוץ מזה, אף אחד לא יעמוד הרי לדין על זריקת סכומים מופרכים לאוויר, ולכן לא היתה לאף אחד בעיה להצביע על סכום כולל בגובה 6.5 מיליארד שקלים. מה שבטוח יקרה, הוא הקמת המטה היעודי במשרד רוה\"מ שיקדם את ההחלטה ויתוקצב ב-10 מיליון שקלים. מטה זה ג'ובים ולזה יש כסף. הרשויות יצטרכו להסתפק ב-200 מיליון שקלים לצרכים השוטפים, שזה כלום ושום דבר כשמחלקים אותם בין 42 רשויות. כל היתר הוא גבב של הצהרות עמומות בלי כיסוי, כך מתוך ההודעה הרשמית למענים לטווח קצר, לא נגענו: \"הגברת הוודאות והבהירות עבור האזור, היישובים והאוכלוסייה המאוימת, תוך יצירת מוקד ברור לקשר עם הציבור. סיוע לשמירה ואיחוד היישובים המאויימים ואוכלוסייתם שפונו וקירוב האוכלוסייה צפונה, תוך שמירה על החוסן והשלומות ברמת הפרט, המשפחה והקהילה. \"הגברת הרציפות החינוכית, צמצום פערי למידה וסיוע לשיפור ההישגים הלימודיים של התלמידים. סיוע בשמירה על רציפות תפקודית של עסקים וחיזוק הביטחון התעסוקתי, לרבות שמירה על ענפי התיירות והחקלאות, הבטחת הפעילות העסקית וחיזוק העסקים המקומיים באזור המאוים. חיזוק ותגבור הרציפות התפקודית של רשויות ההחלטה לרבות תגבור פעולות ורציפות השירותים המוניציפליים, ושימור ושיפור החוסן הארגוני, איסוף והאחדת מידע עבור קבלת החלטות ויישומן\". התכנית לטווח הארוך נשמעת כמו פנטזיה תלושה, עם שלל מונחים מגניבים כמו, \"יצירת אקו-סיסטם לתחום הפודטק\", \"חוסן אנרגטי, לרבות מתקנים פוטולואים, ביו-גז ואגירה\", וגם \"הקמת מכללה לאיתנות ומרכז שיקומי לאומי\". כסף לממ\"דים אתם לא מוצאים, אז מאיפה יבוא התקציב ל\"שדרוג לחיזוק תעשיית התיירות בצפון?\". אקורד הסיום של ההכרזה על \"צפונה\" נראה כאילו מישהו שם החליט לקחת קילו מלח ולפזר אותו לאט לאט על הפצעים הפתוחים של חברי פורום קו העימות, שחלקם לא זכו להיכלל בצ'ופרים המדומיינים של \"צפונה\": \"גיבוש המתווה יבוצע תוך שיתוף הציבור ועבודה מלאה מול נציגי הרשויות, תושביהן וקהילותיהן\". רובו של המתווה שאושר היום, שאפשר לקרוא לו בקיצור \"הצהרת כוונות בלי כיסוי\", נעשה מעל ראשי הקהילות והתושבים ובלי להתייעץ עם ראשי הרשויות. שיפסיקו לבלבל את המוח ויילכו לאכול משהו בחדר האוכל של המלון.",

        "content": "Charles Oputa aka Charly Boy, a Nigerian artist and activist, has taken aim at Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka. The activist expressed this in response to the novelist’s recent statement opposing former Anambra governor Peter Obi from running for president in the 2027 elections. He argued that Soyinka’s current statements and behaviour reflect deteriorating brain condition, and so he should not be taken too seriously. Charly Boy remarked that it is normal for someone over the age of 80, such as the playwright, to experience some degree of brain ageing. READ MORE: Junior Pope: Police Prosecute Blogger For Defamatory Video Against E-Money In a post shared on his Instagram page on Monday, CharlyBoy wrote; “Prof. Wole Soyinka is aged over 80yrs, even tending towards 90yrs. For his age, some level of brain deterioration is not unexpected. His rhetorics and actions in recent times is suggestive of deteriorating brain disease, and as such he shouldn’t be taken too seriously. What we should be worried about as well meaning Nigerians, is how come his family and close friends can’t ward off agents of desperate politicians who are bent on exploiting his medical situation to their advantage, no matter how low it sinks the once respected Nobel Laureate.” SEE POST:",

        "description": "While rumours of ‘peace talks’ circulated last year, the latest Brangelina divorce update tells another story. It’s just the latest complication in their eight year divorce case",
        "content": "Lifestyle Once the most loved-up couple in Hollywood , borne like a phoenix from the ashes of Brad and Jennifer Aniston ’s world-rocking break up, Brangelina has taken quite the tumble. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced their split in 2016, just two years after they tied the knot in Miraval, south east France, where they also co-owned a successful vineyard. Since then, there’s been allegations of abuse, claims of forced NDAs, a revolving door of legal professionals and more than a little crying over spilt rosé. In some of the latest court filings around the ongoing legal battle dubbed “War of the Rosés” Jolie’s lawyers allege that Pitt was abusive toward her prior to the 2016 plane incident that led to her leaving him and filing for divorce. Pitt has denied allegations of abuse and no charges were filed after an FBI investigation. It has also recently emerged that one of the couple’s children, Vivienne, has dropped Pitt’s name from her surname. In the playbill for a new Broadway musical, The Outsiders, produced by Angelina Jolie, the teenage “production assistant” is listed as Vivienne Jolie instead of Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, according to People magazine. From the couple that couldn’t keep their hands off each other to embittered exes, where did it all go so wrong for Brad and Ange? First, let’s go way back. The two actors first met on the set of action comedy Mr & Mrs Smith in 2004. Chemistry between the pair — playing a married couple who both turned out to be assassins hired to kill the other — was said to be palpable. At the time, Brad was married to Jennifer Aniston, making him one half of the most adored celebrity couple. Brad and Jen’s Malibu wedding in 2000 was no small affair (if you’ll pardon the phrasing), it reportedly cost $1 million and was attended by the entire cast of Friends, including David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc. He was the biggest movie star in the world and she was the Rachel Green. People from all across the world were obsessed and ate up every available inside detail on the pair’s relationship. Like, for instance, their wedding vows: he promised to split the thermostat bill and Jen pledged to always make Brad his favourite banana milkshake. Their approach to marriage was charmingly liberal. “Neither of us wants to be the spokesman for a happy marriage, for coupledom,” Brad told Vanity Fair. “I’ll tell you what I despise: this two-becomes-one thing where you lose your individuality. We don’t cage each other with this pressure of happily ever after. You figure it out as you go along. We feel it out, rather than setting policies and rules.” Adding: “Jen and I always made a pact; that we’ll see where this thing is going. I’m not sure it really is in our nature to be with someone for the rest of our lives, just because you made this pact. You keep going as long as you keep growing. When that dies, we do. We still have that friendship; we still have a good laugh, which can go in and out depending on the dynamics and outside influences. It’s complicated, but that’s what keeps it interesting.” Enter Angelina, who came with a wild image (kissing her brother on the lips at the Oscars , reportedly wearing a vial of her partner’s blood around her neck, etc) and described herself as having had a ‘dark and dangerous’ youth. She was twice divorced when she met Brad — having been hitched first to British actor Jonny Lee Miller, of Trainspotting fame, and then Billy Bob Thornton, aka Bad Santa and the sleazy American President from Love Actually. During her marriage to Billy Bob, the couple adopted a child, Maddox, from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. US judge denies Alec Baldwin’s bid to throw out manslaughter case ‘We look forward to our day in court’, says Alec Baldwin’s lawyers ‘Mesmerising’ Tom Holland praised in mixed reviews of Romeo and Juliet Enter the AXA Startup Angel competition to win £25,000 Speaking about her divorce , she told Vogue at the time: “It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.\" After seven years together, and mid-way through the filming of Mr & Mrs Smith, Brad and Jennifer announced their separation on January 7, 2005. A tidal wave speculation was unleashed. Both the media and the general public whipped up a frenzied Team Jen and Team Angelina rivalry, with brands even selling t-shirts for people wanting to pledge their allegiance. Angelina was pitched as the mistress, but both have always strenuously denied their relationship started as an affair. \"To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive,” Angelina said. “I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.\" Not long after their divorce, Jen gave a candid interview to Vanity Fair, saying “I’m not interested in taking public potshots. It’s not my concern anymore. What happened to him after the separation—it’s his life now. I’ve made a conscious effort not to add to the toxicity of this situation. I haven’t retaliated. I don’t want to be a part of it. I don’t have a halo that I’m polishing here; everyone has their personal thoughts. But I would much rather everyone move on. I am not defined by this relationship. I am not defined by the part they’re making me play in the triangle. It’s maddening to me...” In January 2006, Angelina confirmed to People that she was pregnant with the couple’s first child. It was the first time she’d publicly acknowledged their relationship. The pair then started assembling their ‘rainbow’ family, as she called it, at pace. That year, Brad became the adoptive father of Maddox and Angelina’s second child, Zahara. Both of the children's surnames were changed from \"Jolie\" to \"Jolie-Pitt\". Angelina gave birth to daughter Shiloh Nouvel in Namibia, in May 2006. In the spring of the next year, Angelina adopted three-year-old Pax Thien from an orphanage in Vietnam and Brad adopted Pax in the United States about a year later. “We spent a lot of time contemplating and thinking and talking about what we both wanted in life and realized that we wanted very, very similar things,” Angelina said to Vogue in 2007. “And then we just continued to take time. We remained very, very good friends—with this realization—for a long time. And then life developed in a way where we could be together, where it felt like something we would do, we should do.\" At the Cannes Film Festival in 2008, Angelina confirmed that she was expecting twins, and Knox Léon and daughter Vivienne Marcheline were born in July that year. A few years later, speaking to The Telegraph, Jolie said: \"I am very lucky with Brad. He is a real gentleman, but he is also a real man's man. He's got the wonderful balance of being an extraordinary, great, loving father, a very, very intelligent man and physically he's a real man.\" Meanwhile, Brad told Esquire in mid 2013: “I have very few friends. I have a handful of close friends and I have my family and I haven't known life to be any happier. I'm making things. I just haven't known life to be any happier.\" They got married after ten years together with an intimate ceremony at the chapel of their French home and vineyard, Château Miraval, in southeast France. Angelina wore Versace with a veil that the couples’ children had doodled all over. \"It does feel different. It feels nice to be husband and wife,” Angelina told Vanity Fair at the time. Two years later and it was over. In September 2016, Angelina filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. The FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services then confirmed they were investigating Brad for alleged child abuse following an incident on the family’s private jet. The actor was accused by an anonymous person of getting physical with one of his children. According to TMZ at the time, “the details of precisely what happened” were “murky.” But it was reported that Maddox had stepped in to verbally stand up for his mother during a fight with Brad — and that the latter lost his temper. A source close to Brad told People he was “was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,” said the source. “There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.” Brad has since been cleared of all allegations. The actor hasn’t made any comment about the allegations but has been open about his drinking and drug use. In a May 2017 GQ interview, Brad revealed he had quit drinking and smoking cannabis. “I can't remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn't boozing or had a spliff, or something. And I'm running from feelings. I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family. But even this last year [...] I was boozing too much,” Brad told the magazine. “It's just become a problem. You either deny them all of your life or you answer them and evolve.” Brangelina had been wrangling over the split through legal proceedings in California privately and quietly, but in February 2017, Angelina spoke out about the divorce for the first time saying \"we will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it”. According to court documents, Brad had been failing to give her “meaningful support” financially since the split. Brad countered that he had actually loaned her $8 million plus $1.3 million for bills. The next year it was revealed that Angelina had given Brad access to the children — but they were still working towards a full settlement. In an interview with Vogue in 2021, Angelina said she split from Brad for the “wellbeing” of her family. “It was the right decision,” she said. “I continue to focus on their healing. Some have taken advantage of my silence, and the children see lies about themselves in the media, but I remind them that they know their own truth and their own minds. In fact, they are six very brave, very strong young people.” In December 2020, court proceedings had begun in Los Angeles over child custody for the five youngest children, as Maddox was already over 18 and therefore an adult in the eyes of the law. Pax is now 20, while Zahara is 19, Shiloh, 17 and twins Vivienne and Knox are 15. Brad was granted joint custody of his children with Angelina. A source close to the case told PA the judge’s ruling would “significantly increase” Oscar-winner Brad’s time with the children. The decision is said to have been based on “extensive testimony” from those involved with the case, including professionals who had spent time with the children. It marked a major breakthrough for the couple, but as they say: two steps forward, three steps back. It took nearly seven years and millions in legal fees to get to the point that the pair began splitting up their combined assets, including the French vineyard and estate, Chateau Miraval, they bought together for $60 million. In an extra twist, Brad sued his ex-wife for, according to the lawsuit, selling her stake in their co-owned vineyard to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler without his knowledge. Court papers submitted by Brad alleged that Angelina intentionally “sought to inflict harm on” him by selling her stake in the business. He said they had agreed to never sell their respective interests without the other’s consent. He also claimed the wine company grew “into a multimillion-dollar global business and one of the world’s most highly regarded producers of rosé wine” through his work and that Jolie had contributed “nothing to Miraval’s success.” In a revised complaint filed in summer 2023, the Fight Club actor insisted he had first refusal on his ex-wife's share of their idyllic winery, situated in Correns, in the South of France. Pitt’s later submitted legal papers said: “As will be demonstrated at trial, Jolie’s actions were unlawful, severely and intentionally damaging Pitt and unjustly enriching herself.” Jolie denied these allegations. But the dispute, which was dubbed the “War of the Rosés”, raged on. Just a week after Pitt’s revised complaint was filed, Vanity Fair dropped the bombshell accusation that talks about the vineyard sale broke down after Pitt attempted to persuade Jolie into signing an NDA — which would prevent her from speaking about the infamous 2016 private jet incident — in return for her being able to sell her stake. The magazine spoke to the couple's former head of security, real estate brokers and others with intimate knowledge of the couple's time in the south of France to attain this information, but representatives for Pitt claimed that it was actually Jolie who first broached the idea of an NDA. They also claimed that the NDA was purely related to the sale of the winery, “to ensure the seller doesn’t damage the value of the asset after being paid for it.” The Vanity Fair piece claimed to shed a little more light on the private jet incident as well, with the couple’s ex-head of security telling Vanity Fair that Pitt was “drinking quite a bit” at the time it happened. Another source claimed: “Brad was drinking, and the confrontation got out of hand. He was absolutely wrong in how he behaved but immediately apologised and acknowledged that he had crossed a line. He will always regret [it], and right away took steps to address this and try to make amends.” Pitt apparently quit drinking immediately after the incident. Pitt’s lawyer said: “Thankfully, the various public authorities the other side has tried to use against him [Brad Pitt] over the past six years have made their own independent decisions. Brad will continue to respond in court as he has consistently done.” And to top it all off, the Vanity Fair article ended by noting that since September 2016, nobody from either Pitt or Jolie’s family have returned to stay at the French property. In July 2023, Jolie’s legal team accused Brad Pitt of acting like a “petulant child” over the sale of her stake, with claims that Pitt has engaged in a “blatant money grab,” and has spent more time on vanity projects around the site, like building a recording studio and renovating the swimming pool, than on the vineyard and winemaking process. The filing alleges that Pitt “deals in illusions, not dirt and grapes.” “During the years that he allegedly 'built' the business,” the filing reads, “he filmed and appeared in dozens of movies, not to mention making countless promotional appearances, jetting-setting around the world for movie premieres, and attending Hollywood parties. “While he no doubt visited the vineyards to admire the work of the French laborers who actually made the business successful,” it continues, “Pitt is no vigneron.” “Pitt wasted the company’s assets, spending millions on vanity projects, including more than $1 million on swimming pool renovations, building and rebuilding a staircase four times, and spending millions to restore a recording studio.” Pitt did not respond to these claims. Legal documents were then obtained by TMZ which said that Brad and Angelina had agreed to mediation, rather than settling in court, regarding their long-standing vineyard dispute. According to Daily Mail, Jolie has reportedly said she was willing to take part in a settlement conference, while Pitt appointed a ‘provisional administrator’ in a bid to hopefully help negotiations. As you may expect in a situation like this, both Brad and Angelina are represented by highly esteemed LA-based divorce lawyers, who they’ve been working with for years. But it took a while to get here — both Brad and Ange have made changes to the legal teams they initially hired back when the divorce proceedings first began. Brad was initially working with celebrity specialist lawyer Lance Spiegel, who has represented the likes of Charlie Sheen, Michael Jackson, Heather Locklear and Eva Longoria. Angelina was originally represented by lawyer-to-the-stars Laura Wasser , who previously worked with Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian during their divorces. Jolie then ditched Wasser for another lawyer, Samantha Bley Dejean, in 2018, because she felt Dejean had more experience in the “protection of children.” At the time, Jolie's spokesperson, Mindy Nyby, told People: “Angelina has decided to change counsel to Samantha Bley Dejean, as Samantha's expertise is the protection and best interest of children. Angelina appreciates Laura’s cooperation in transitioning the case of the past several weeks.\" For his part, Pitt has transitioned to primarily using the legal expertise of Anne C Kiley (it’s unclear if Spiegel is still involved, though he was initially Pitt’s primary counsel). Kiley even addressed the private jet incident in a statement to The Times in 2022 saying: “Brad has owned everything he’s responsible for from day one — unlike the other side — but he’s not going to own anything he didn’t do. He has been on the receiving end of every type of personal attack and misrepresentation.” There was also beef between Pitt and Jolie’s lawyers when Jolie’s team allegedly attempted to subpoena Pitt at the 2022 SAG awards (where a legal team demands someone’s presence in court by handing them legal papers) à la Olivia Wilde, only to find that Pitt wasn’t present. Representatives of Jolie and Pitt have never responded to these subpoena claims. Pax also became closely linked to the messy divorce battle due to resurfaced comments in late 2023 about Pitt from Father's Day 2020. \"Happy Father’s Day to this world class a**hole,\" he wrote on Instagram under a photo of Pitt receiving an Oscar, seen by MailOnline. \"You time and time again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. \"You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence,\" MailOnline reports the private post as saying. \"You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you are incapable of doing so. \"You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, Happy Father’s Day, you f*****g awful human being!!!” Pitt did not publicly respond to his son's comments, but was cleared of all allegations of abuse. The actor also made a concerted effort to be seen to be bettering himself — he began a public wellness journey, marked by his cashmere company, gender-fluid skincare line, sobriety and foray into sculpture work. Jolie on the other hand eluded to a difficult past few years in an interview with Vogue in 2023, where she said that her children “saved” her. “Having children saved me and taught me to be in this world differently,” she told the publication. She is currently based in Los Angeles (at the former home of Hollywood legend Cecil B DeMille which she bought for $25 million), but appears keen to eventually move away. “I would love to live abroad and will do so as soon as [all of] my children are 18,” she told Harper's Bazaar in 2019. “Right now I'm having to base where their father chooses to live.” In an April 2024 court filing as part of the ongoing battle over Château Miraval, Jolie alleged that Pitt was abusive toward her prior to the 2016 plane incident that led her to filing for divorce. The actress's legal team filed a motion asking to release communications they claim would prove that Brad wouldn’t allow her to sell her share of the winery to him unless she agreed to a \"more onerous\" and \"expansive\" NDA. The topic of the NDA first caused a back and forth last year in court and now it’s rearing its head again with new allegations coming to light. The lawyers claim that, \"While Pitt's history of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family’s September 2016 plane trip from France to Los Angeles, this flight marked the first time he turned his physical abuse on the children as well. Jolie then immediately left him.\" Pitt hasn’t commented in response as yet, though a source reportedly close to him told PEOPLE,\"This is a pattern of behaviour — whenever there is a decision that goes against the other side they consistently choose to introduce misleading, inaccurate and/or irrelevant information as a distraction.” Though conversely, Jolie's lawyers claim that she \"never pressed charges as she believed the best course was for Pitt to accept responsibility and help the family recover from the post-traumatic stress he caused.\" Her attorney Paul Murphy said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE earlier this week, \"Mr. Pitt refused to purchase Ms. Jolie’s interest when she would not be silenced by his NDA. By refusing to buy her interest but then suing her, Mr. Pitt put directly at issue why that NDA was so important to him and what he hoped it would bury: his abuse of Ms. Jolie and their family. After eight months of delays, this motion asks the Court to force Mr. Pitt to finally produce that evidence.\" The team claim that Jolie’s sealed filing which includes emails, summaries of the family’s expected testimony and other evidence, caused Pitt to worry it would become public, meaning that they feel he wanted to \"contractually bind” her to staying silent about his \"personal misconduct, whether related to Miraval or not.\" It remains to be seen if the motion will lead to a trial. Now, further fuel has been added to the fire with the revelation that one of Pitt’s children, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, has chosen to drop his name from her surname, making her Vivienne Jolie. However, it is not clear if Vivienne has legally changed her name. But this is not the first time reports have emerged claiming that members of the Jolie-Pitt family have dropped “Pitt” from their surnames. Eldest daughter Zahara is said to have introduced herself as “Zahara Marley Jolie” when joining a sorority at Spelman College in Atlanta, according to a video of her induction from last year. Elsewhere, people have noticed that Shiloh’s Instagram name refers to themselves as “Shiloh Jolie” with no mention of Pitt.

        "description": "The promising Free to Play penguin-based party game is coming to Steam June 6.",
        "content": "We've already talked a bit about Sneak Out on these here pages . The multiplayer stealth game has been anything but quiet on the internet, making all kinds of noise as top streamers like Annie Fuchsia and PEGTV have been putting it through its paces in the super-successful stress tests. We've already seen giddy streamers running around a haunted castle hiding and sneaking away from a pursuant Hunter, but let's dig into some of the unique mechanics that make these monsters so threatening. The premise of Sneak Out is simple: at the start of a match, six players (who are Penguins, because why not?) initiate a ritual in one of the many eclectic rooms of a haunted castle, with one of the players getting transformed into a Hunter. The other players must then run, hide, and set traps—whether for the Hunter or each other—as they seek to escape the level. It's very easy to pick up and play, but there's a boatload of tricks to master for the three unique Hunters (otherwise known as Seekers) you can play as. First up, there's the matter of movement. Hunters are pretty oafish creatures, leaving footprints and kicking up a racket wherever they go. Thankfully, you can use the 'Sneak' action to offset these giveaways, helping you catch those hapless Penguins off guard. Each Hunter also has a basic attack to deliver the final blow to their victims. So what does each Hunter bring to the table? First up, there's the Reaper, eager to swing his deadly scythe to accelerate a Penguin's path into the afterlife. The Reaper has an excellent 'Blink' ability which teleports him several metres—perfect for springing nasty surprises on your victims. His Death Run, meanwhile, is a speedy sprint that closes the distance when those pesky birds are flitting just out of scythe's reach. Next up is the Scarecrow, who can plant and throw Pumpkin Bombs to turn Penguins into pingu stew. Up to three can be planted around the map at any one time, so try setting them up near breakable walls, tasks, and other spots that your victims might be tempted to traverse. His second skill is his Crow pal, who increases your range of vision and can spot players through walls. Last but not least is the Vampire, the most agile of the Hunters. His Blood Lust ability gives him a temporary speed boost as he ravenously seeks to feed, and he can also transform into a bat, flitting over walls and other obstacles before swooping down on his victims. Within each match, you'll get to upgrade your Hunters with a mini-progression system too. Every time you eliminate a penguin, you'll level up, getting a choice of two randomised upgrades to improve your hunting ability—be that better vision of penguins' footsteps, or a reduction in negative effects caused by traps and other penguin machinations. Then, when just one Penguin is left on the map, your levelling bar will slowly but constantly fill, building your momentum as you bolster yourself with upgrades while your final victim frantically scrambles for the exit. So there are many routes to success for monstrously minded players. There's plenty to do between matches, as you kick back in the village hub where you can gather resources, goof around with fellow players in mini-games, and show off the swag, characters, and outfits that you can buy using the game's card currency. Sneak Out is creeping onto Steam June 6, so wishlist it now if you want to be among the first to set foot in its spooky corridors.",

        "description": "The Bear season 3's latest teaser brings the heat ahead of the acclaimed show's return on Hulu and Disney Plus.",
        "content": "Full spoilers follow for The Bear season 2. The Bear season 3 is less than a month away, so it's high time that someone said \"Yes, chef!\" to our request to see some footage from the hit show's next entry. Last Friday (May 24), FX – the studio behind the acclaimed comedy-drama – duly obliged, with the Disney subsidiary delivering a spicy 30-second trailer to tide us over until the show returns. Given its brief runtime, there's not a lot we can glean from The Bear season 3 's latest teaser but, based on the fast-paced clips we see, it'll serve up another tension-filled mix of melodrama and comedy that threatens to boil over at any moment. This isn't the first teaser we've eaten up ahead of The Bear 's third season being released. Over two weeks ago (May 10), FX revealed The Bear season 3's first trailer , albeit it was one that offered no clues about where the story was heading. Instead, it simply showed Carmen 'Carmy' Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) preparing to cook up another food-based storm at the titular restaurant, which officially opened in the Hulu and Disney Plus show's season 2 finale. The Bear season 3's dual teasers come three months after its June 27 release date – and confirmation that all eight episodes will drop on launch day – was announced. That reveal came three months after The Bear was renewed for a third season . Given the number of plaudits and awards it's received since its June 2022 debut, plus its popularity among general viewers, it was inevitable that one of the best Hulu shows and best Disney Plus shows would re-open its doors to the public. The Bear season 3 might not be the end of the line for the Christopher Storer-developed series, either. First reported by Reel Chicago and later circulated by Deadline , rumors abound that FX has greenlit a fourth installment of the culinary drama, which is apparently being filmed back-to-back with the forthcoming season. An FX spokesperson declined to comment when approached by Variety for confirmation on whether a fourth season was in the offing. It's possible, though, that we'll get an announcement once season 3 has been released on two of the world's best streaming services . Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Regardless, it's a wise move for FX to shoot two seasons of its most popular show – I'm sure Shōgun will argue against that, mind you – simultaneously. Just as Ted Lasso 's cast became sought-after names following the hit Apple TV Plus show's explosion in popularity, some of The Bear 's talented cast have similarly found themselves as some of the hottest prospects in the entertainment industry. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who some viewers might have also know from Andor , is in line to play The Thing in Marvel 's live-action reboot of The Fantastic Four . Ayo Edebiri voiced April O'Neil in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem , will voice another animated character in Pixar 's Inside Out 2 , and was in line to appear in Marvel's Thunderbolts film before scheduling conflicts scuppered those chances. As for White, he recently starred in A24's The Iron Claw (out now on Max ), Apple's Fingernails movie, and was also coveted by Marvel at one point. With some of The Bear 's most notable names becoming hot commodities in Hollywood circles, it's unclear how their increasingly packed schedules might impact development on future installments of the wildly successful show. Shooting two seasons back-to-back, then, makes sense if some of them will be unavailable for long stretches throughout the rest of 2024. Nobody outside of Storer knows how long The Bear will run for, either, so it's possible that its fourth season could be its last. If it is, at least we'll have been treated to a tasty, four course meal, rather than the increasingly common three-season arc that most series deliver. The Bear season 3 debuts on Hulu (US) and Disney Plus (internationally on June 27.",

        "content": "The President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Joe Ajaero , has advocated better pay and better welfare for journalists in the country. He said apart from better salaries, journalists should also enjoy insurance cover and pension. The NLC president made the call during a courtesy visit to the President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo , in Abuja. Ajaero described journalists as a group of professionals fighting for everyone, but who, unfortunately, have nobody fighting for them. He said he recommends the review of the minimum wage for journalists every two years adding that it is unfortunate some of them are begging for their salaries to be paid. The labour leader pointed out the critical role of journalists in nation-building as people who do not have the luxury of enjoying weekends, public holidays or festive seasons because they have to constantly be at work. “The welfare of journalists is being underplayed. While journalists are a group of professionals fighting for everyone, nobody is for them, they are not even for themselves. “Journalists do not have weekends, public holidays or festive seasons. They work and report activities of people that are enjoying weekends, public holidays and festivities. “Even when a journalist is sacked or not paid for one year, other journalists will not write a story on such injustice. “I am advocating for a consultative machinery that we should hold every two years, to have a negotiation with all media employers in the county to fix minimum wage for journalists. “Also, there should be a pension that all journalists should enjoy after retiring from the job. Insurance cover is another thing that Journalists should enjoy to make them work better,” the NLC President said. While acknowledging the difficult terrains in which publishers work, he stressed the importance of timely payment of salaries for workers, adding that non-payment should be treated as a criminal offence.",

        "content": "shared a stunning carousel of family photos this Memorial Day weekend - and the mother-of-four has never looked better. The cookbook author, 38, joined husband and their four kids – Luna, eight, Miles, six, Esti, one, and Wren, 11 months – at their local Natural History Museum for a fun-filled family outing. Proving she's just like the rest of us, Chrissy shared the good and the bad, including an outtake of her tossing her hair over one shoulder, eyes shut, as she prepared to be camera-ready. \"Beautiful, chaotic hour at the natural history museum!,\" she captioned the post. Chrissy looked unbelievable in a pair of high-waisted jeans and a white lace bralet. The tiny top boasted a halterneck cut and was perfectly paired with her flared mom jeans. She slung a suede, fringe-embellished bag over one shoulder, adding a bohemian edge to her look. The photos showed Chrissy and John sharing special family moments with their kids, with their youngest two Esti and Wren – who was born via a surrogate – taking on a starring role. John was every inch the doting dad in the sweet snaps, which saw him carrying little Wren on his shoulders as they toured the museum and grounds. The couple raise their four kids in their Beverly Hills home. The spacious, 10,700 square foot property, features six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, offering ample space for their whole family. The outdoor area is equally impressive and boasts a 100-foot saltwater infinity pool with panoramic views of the city. John and Chrissy's fans were surprised when the couple last year, just months after Chrissy had . While Chrissy was pregnant with their daughter Esti, Wren was born via surrogate to a woman named Alexandra. Describing the unique experience, the video model said: \"We ate hot pot to celebrate, watched Vanderpump Rules with our growing bellies, our families blending into one for the past year. \"Just minutes before midnight on June 19th, I got to witness the most beautiful woman, my friend, our surrogate, give birth amidst a bit of chaos, but with strength and pure joy and love.\" The kids aren't far off developmentally as a result; it won't be long until Wren joins his sister Esti at daycare, a milestone the family celebrated this month.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON, May 28 — The US government unveiled today its policy for using voluntary carbon credits that seeks to put “guardrails” to boost confidence in a nascent market after some high-profile offset projects failed to deliver the promised emissions reductions. The heads of the Treasury, Energy and Agriculture Departments as well as President Joe Biden’s top climate and economic advisers announced a joint statement of policy and principles to guide participation in voluntary carbon markets as part of its broader efforts to encourage their development. “Voluntary carbon markets can help unlock the power of private markets to reduce emissions, but that can only happen if we address significant existing challenges,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “The principles released today are an important step toward building high-integrity voluntary carbon markets.” Many companies “offset” their own greenhouse gas emissions by buying voluntary carbon credits, which represent the avoidance or removal of emissions via projects largely located in developing countries. But a series of high-profile controversies has shaken confidence in the market for carbon offsets, with several large companies that buy carbon credits retreating from the market as recent studies found that several large forest protection projects failed to deliver their promised emission reductions. Voluntary carbon markets shrunk for the first time last year in at least seven years. The principles for “responsible participation” in offset markets outlined by US officials on Tuesday include strict standards to ensure that projects deliver real and quantifiable emissions reductions, monitoring to ensure projects do not harm local communities and that corporate buyers prioritize decarbonising their own supply chains before opting for credits. The move by the US to ensure “integrity” in voluntary carbon markets comes as several organizations, such as the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets, have started to publish principles to define high-quality offsets. The Energy Department announced last year that it would purchase credits from projects that will remove carbon dioxide from the air in a bid to bolster that technology. The Agriculture Department has also created a program to help farmers, ranchers and forest owners to participate in carbon markets by helping them to identify high-integrity carbon offset programs for generating carbon credits. Meanwhile, the State Department set up the Energy Transition Accelerator, a carbon offset program that aims to help developing countries transition away from coal, as well as the LEAF coalition, which aims to stem tropical deforestation. — Reuters",

        "content": "A TEENAGE DJ who aims to make a splash on the music scene down south in the future is hosting an event in Trondra next month as he looks to inspire more of his generation into dance culture. Kieran Black, who goes by the name Shamsul, will perform at the Trondra Hall on Saturday 8 June. It will be open to anyone aged 17 and above, and the event is receiving support from local youth-led charity OPEN which will help create a “safe environment” at the gig. Black, who is aged 17, said his set will feature techno, hardgroove and some of his original music. “This is kind of a debut of some of my music – I’ll be playing unreleased music that I’m working on at the moment,” he said. Black said there is also some reggae influence in his music, as well as 90s rave. He does not feel there is a lot of interest in electronic dance music in Shetland but is looking to influence his generation to get more into the scene. Black has been making music since he was around 14, and with a move to Glasgow on the cards for university he is looking to take some further steps up the DJing ladder down south. His ultimate aim is to make a “full career” out of music, and also plans to move to Toronto in Canada later down the line. Tickets for the Trondra event are available from High Level Music and will also be on the door on the night, with the music running from 10pm to 1am.",

        "description": "Orlando Pirates are set to reward their prolific striker, Tshegofatso Mabasa with a new contract extension and a significantly high buyout clause, the Siya crew investigates.",
        "content": "Following , the latest development comes after the striker's outstanding performance as the season's top goal scorer, where he netted a total of 16 goals. The sources have added that the new contract may include a significant R50 million buyout clause, which will apply to both local and international clubs interested in acquiring Mabasa's services. This clause is indicative of Mabasa's high value to the team and is seen as a protective measure to ensure that the club is adequately compensated should he be sought after by other teams, considering his incredible form in recent months. \"All the parties involved are happy about the upcoming new deal. Yes, it's of course an improved contract because the player has proven himself that he could be the best striker in the league and that warrants an improved contract,\" said the Siya source. \"It's not yet 100% done but the club has exercised that option which they had of keeping him for another two seasons as his contract ends in June 30 this year. But now it means he won't be going anywhere. The team exercised the two-year option plus the new two-year contract which means it runs until June 2028,\" the source told Soccer Laduma. Mabasa's goalscoring prowess is undisputed, as he is the reigning DStv Premiership top goal scorer. He demonstrated his talent by scoring six goals in 13 appearances for Moroka Swallows at the start of the season until December, and after returning from his loan spell, he added another 10 goals, this time in 13 games for Pirates. A second Siya source also discussed Mabasa's buyout clause and contract at Pirates. \"It's not just an improved contract but also with a buyout clause of R50 million. That means whichever team wants him have to meet Pirates' demands, they won't let him go for cheap. He is the best striker currently and with interest from local teams as well as Europe it's only fair to have that buy out clause,\" the second source stated. The Siya crew contacted Pirates for comment but the club had not responded by the time this story was published. You must be to read and post comments.",

        "description": "The Federal Government had instituted a legal action against the 36 state governors at the Supreme Court over alleged misconduct in the administration of Local Government Areas.The post Professor Of Law, Samuel Dike Faults FG Approach On LG Autonomy appeared first on Channels Television.",
        "content": "A Professor of Law, Samuel Dike has faulted the Federal Government’s decision to sue the 36 states of the federation in its bid to institutionalise local government autonomy. Professor Dike who stated this while delivering the keynote address at the first South-South Leadership Conference of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) held in Port Harcourt, argued that it is proper to solve the fundamental problem from the root, by ammending the relevant section of the constitution, rather than seeking a judicial interpretation on the matter. On the protracted discussion about resource control, Dike who is a Professor of Energy and Environmental Law, advocated that individuals be allowed to manage oil and gas resources found in non-commercial quantities in their domain, like in the United States of America where resource exploitation can be managed by landowners who pay taxes. Samuel Chisa Dike is currently Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Law at Rivers State University. He is also a Professor of Energy Law and Comparative Environmental Law. The Federal Government had instituted a legal action against the governors of the 36 states of the federation at the Supreme Court over alleged misconduct in the administration of Local Government Areas. The suit filed by the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, is seeking full autonomy for all local government areas in the country. In suit, the Federal Government specifically prayed the court to issue an order, prohibiting state governors from embarking on unilateral, arbitrary and unlawful dissolution of democratically elected local government leaders. The governors of the 36 states were sued through their respective Attorneys General. The suit is also asking for an order permitting the funds standing in the credits of local governments to be directly channelled to them from the federation account in line with the provisions of the constitution as against the alleged unlawful joint accounts created by governors. The Federal Government also prayed to the Supreme Court for an order stopping governors from further constituting caretaker committees to run the affairs of local governments as against the constitutionally recognized and guaranteed democratic system. It equally applied for an order of injunction restraining the governors, their agents and privies from receiving, spending or tampering with funds released from the federation account for the benefit of local governments when no democratically elected local government system is put in place in the states. In the 27 grounds it listed in support of the suit, the Federal Government argued that Nigeria, as a federation, was a creation of the 1999 Constitution as amended, with the president as head of the federal executive arm, swearing on oath to uphold and give effects to provisions of the constitution. The Federal Government told the apex court that the governors represent the component states of the federation with executive governors who have also sworn to uphold the constitution at all times. It holds that the constitution of Nigeria, recognises federal, states and local governments as three tiers of government, and that the three recognised tiers of government draw funds for their operation and functioning from the federation account created by the constitution. “That by the provisions of the constitution, there must be a democratically elected local government system and that the constitution has not made provisions for any other systems of governance at the local government level other than the democratically elected local government system. “That in the face of the clear provisions of the constitution, the governors have failed and refused to put in place a democratically elected local government system even where no state of emergency has been declared to warrant the suspension of democratic institutions in the state. “That the failure of the governors to put democratically elected local government system in place, is a deliberate subversion of the 1999 constitution which they and the president have sworn to uphold. “That all efforts to make the governors comply with the dictates of the 1999 constitution in terms of putting in place, a democratically elected local government system, has not yielded any result and that to continue to disburse funds from the federation account to governors for non-existing democratically elected local government is to undermine the sanctity of the 1999 constitution. That in the face of the violations of the 1999 constitution, the federal government is not obligated under section 162 of the constitution to pay any state, funds standing to the credit of local governments where no democratically elected local government is in place.” The Supreme Court has fixed May 30 for hearing.",

        "content": "Royal fans are convinced that one royal family member looks \"exactly like\" Prince William as they enjoy throwback snaps of the family as teenagers. Every family tree has it's lookalikes and the monarchy are no different. Many of the royals are the spitting image of their parents or elder siblings, while some look more similar to ancestors from much older generations. Princess Beatrice has often been compared to Queen Victoria because of both of their uniquely shaped eyes and striking lip shape. Plus pictures of Prince Harry have often shown him looking a lot like his father, King Charles. Over the years, as Princess Kate and Prince William have welcomed their children Prince George , Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, and many have often compared them to the late Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Diana, and the Middletons. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle warned they must make a choice if they want to be popular Hundreds of fans have been enjoying looking at throwback snaps of some of the most beloved royals from when they were in their teenage years, thanks to a Reddit forum names 'Royals Gossip'. Photographs include images of Queen Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret, Princess Ann, Princess Diana, King Charles, the Prince and Princess of Wales , as well as Prince Harry and Megan. Many thought William looked like Philip in the photo ( Image: Rex) While others saw Diana ( Image: Getty) The shot of a young Prince William shows him with a luscious long blonde locks, a shy smile, and wearing a blue check shirt. A number of people pointed out his similarity to a royal who has now passed.

I've always seen his mum in him but that picture of Philip is William all over.\" Another said: \"I remember when that photo of William came out. He was so cute as a teenager.\" However, others think he looked just like his mum, with one person saying: \"Prince William looking just like Diana at 15.\" People think William looks just like Charlotte in the picture ( Image: The Prince and Princess of Wales/Kensington Palace/PA Wire) Not only do they think William looks a lot like Philip and his mum, but they also have noticed a striking resemblance between William and Prince Charlotte. One individual said: \" Prince William looks so much like Diana but I somehow see so much of Charlotte too in the photo.\" \"Charlotte is her dad in girl form,\" wrote another. \"Charlotte looks so much like William,\" said another.

        "description": "The company said the Nightcap offer would not work as it was 'highly conditional'",
        "content": "The embattled hospitality group Revolution Bars has dismissed a takeover bid from its competitor Nightcap, stating the offer is \"incapable of being delivered\". Tameside-based Revolution, which operates the Revolucion de Cuba and Peach Pubs brands, initiated a sale process and significant restructuring efforts last month as it battles to stay afloat. As part of its survival strategy, the company has announced plans for a £12.5m capital raise and the shuttering of 18 establishments. Revolution has critiqued Nightcap's earlier proposal this month for not incorporating the planned £12.5m fundraising, suggesting instead that Nightcap would need to conduct two separate rounds of financing. The company has confirmed that funding for its proposed capital injection is already in place, with commitments from investors including ex-Pizza Express chairman Luke Johnson, pending approval from shareholders at an upcoming general meeting. Revolution has labelled the Nightcap proposition as unfeasible due to its \"highly conditional\" nature, reliance on assumptions about support from Nightcap's financiers, and the associated time and cost implications. However, Revolution maintains that it \"remains open\" to reviewing any new offers from Nightcap or other interested entities. The company stated: \"Without the additional funding proposed to be raised in connection with the fundraising and without the cost savings delivered through the proposed Restructuring Plan, the Board anticipates that the group will face liquidity pressures from Q1 (July, August and September 2024) onwards.\" Nightcap owns 46 UK bars such as the Cocktail Club and Dirty Martini brands.",

        "content": "Der dritte gesamtdeutsche Titel ist nur noch Formsache. Nun peilt der Weltpokalsieger Magdeburg nach dem DHB-Pokal die Titelverteidigung in der Königsklasse an - mehr geht nicht. An ein deutsches Handball-Wunder glaubt keiner mehr. Der hat die Meisterschale fest im Griff. Vor dem letzten Auswärtsspiel der Bördestädter am Donnerstag bei den Rhein Neckar Löwen (20.30 Uhr/Dyn) ist der Vorsprung von vier Punkten und 84 Toren auf die Füchse so groß, dass er nicht mehr einzuholen ist. Das sagen zumindest alle Experten. Und auch der sonst so besonnene und zurückhaltende SCM-Trainer Bennet Wiegert ließ sich nach dem knapp gewonnen Heimspiel am Sonntag gegen den SC DHfK dazu hinreißen, die Feierlichkeiten beginnen zu lassen. \"Ich muss mal schauen, wie wir die Woche strukturieren und Seriosität reinbringen. Die Jungs sollen das jetzt erst einmal richtig genießen und feiern\", sagte Wiegert der Magdeburger \"Volksstimme\". Der SC Magdeburg ist momentan das Nonplusultra in der Bundesliga, in und wohl auch in der ganzen Handballwelt. Der Club könnte nun etwas schaffen, das sehr selten ist: das Quadrupel. Den Weltpokal hat der Club in der Tasche, den DHB-Pokal auch, die Meisterschale bekommt er am Sonntag nach dem letzten Spiel gegen die HSG Wetzlar. Jetzt fehlt nur noch der Pott für den Champions League-Sieg. Im Final Four in am 8. Juni treffen die Magdeburger zunächst auf Aalborg AB und hoffen darauf, am 9. Juni den Titel verteidigen zu können. Einsatzzeiten für Bankdrücker? Deshalb kommt dem Team die frühe Meisterschaftsentscheidung sehr gelegen. \"Wir können uns jetzt ganz auf die Champions League konzentrieren, haben keinen Druck mehr. Jetzt gehen wir all in, wollen alles\", sagte Nationalspieler Lukas Mertens nach dem Leipzig-Spiel. Trainer Wiegert ist sich aber sicher, dass er und seine Kollegen auch die beiden letzten Bundesliga-Partien siegreich gestalten wollen. \"Ich werde jetzt keinen Druck aufbauen. Aber wir wissen, dass die Jungs auch dieses Spiel gewinnen wollen\", sagte der Erfolgscoach. Gut möglich, dass er seinen großen Stars wie Felix Claar, Omar Ingi Magnusson und Gisli Kristjansson eine Verschnaufpause gönnt und dafür ein paar Bankdrückern Zeit gibt, sich zu präsentieren. Denn auch dort steckt viel Potenzial: Welcher Trainer kann es sich schon leisten, Nationalspieler wie Philipp Weber oder Michael Damgaard kaum einzusetzen. Was passiert auf der Torhüterposition? Wiegert ist der Macher des SCM-Erfolgs. Stück für Stück hat er im Laufe der vergangenen Jahre sein Team zusammengestellt, gezielt Spieler verpflichtet, die von ihren Qualitäten und vor allem menschlich in sein Konzept passen. So kann er einen Handball spielen lassen, dem derzeit kaum ein Gegner gewachsen ist. Es ist eine Mannschaft, die sich auch von Rückschlägen nicht aus der Ruhe bringen lässt. Die Unruhe, die nach dem Dopingfall Nikola Portner im Umfeld entstand, überspielte die Mannschaft grandios, holte den DHB-Pokal und zog ins Champions League-Final-Four-Turnier ein. Sollte der Schweizer Torhüter tatsächlich gesperrt werden - seine Erklärfrist endet am 30. Mai - wird sich Wiegert genau überlegen, ob er Nationaltorhüter an die Elbe lotst. Der steht noch in Kielce unter Vertrag. Die Polen sollen dem Vernehmen nach 1,2 Millionen Euro Ablöse verlangen - eine Summe, die im Handball zumindest unüblich ist. Und sie würde etwa ein Zehntel des SCM-Etats bedeuten. Beim sehr sparsam und überlegt wirtschaftenden SC Magdeburg wird man genau rechnen. Aber vielleicht ergeben sich durch die Erfolge zusätzliche Einnahmequellen, die einen solchen Transfer ermöglichen. (dpa) Zwei Wahlkämpfer der Linken sind bei einer Wahlkampfaktion am Lindenauer Markt in Leipzig von einem Unbekannten angegriffen worden. Wie die Polizei am Dienstag mitteilte, wurde ein 46-Jähriger nach... Der Meistertitel ist dem SC Magdeburg nur noch theoretisch zu nehmen. Nach dem Derbysieg gegen Leipzig hat der SCM zwei Spieltage vor Schluss vier Punkte und 84 Tore Vorsprung auf die Füchse Berlin. Die schlechten Nachrichten aus der Wirtschaft im Erzgebirge reißen nicht ab. Diesmal trifft es knapp 85 Beschäftigte in Elterlein. Wie es dazu gekommen ist.

        "content": "Donna Leon lädt literarisch wieder nach Venedig ein: In Commissario Brunettis 33. Fall trifft man auf die altbekannten Figuren, aber trotzdem ist alles anders. Scharfzüngige Kommentare über Touristen, humorvolle Blicke auf das Menschliche und nachdenkliche Betrachtungen der Welt an sich: Pünktlich wie seit 33 Jahren legt Donna Leon ihr neues Buch über Commissario Brunetti in vor. Sie sind alle da: der seit gut 30 Jahren nicht alternde Brunetti, seine Frau Paola und die Kinder, der nervige Chef Patta, die kluge Kollegin Griffoni und die umtriebige Polizeiassistentin Elettra. Und doch ist \"Feuerprobe\" anders als frühere Bände. Es gibt eigentlich weder eine mysteriöse Leiche noch ein Verbrechen, das Brunetti aufklären soll. Donna Leon über den Inhalt \"In diesem Buch geht es um mehrere Dinge: Was wir für die Vergangenheit halten, ist nicht unbedingt die Vergangenheit, die war\", sagt Leon im Gespräch der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. \"Es geht auch darum, was in einem Krieg passiert ist. Und um etwas, das zurückkommt, um dich zu verfolgen. Und es geht um \"Baby-Gangs\".\" Gemeint sind Jugendbanden, die sich in den Straßen Venedigs aus Langeweile gegenseitig an die Kehle gehen. Ein Held und Abgründe Es beginnt alles mit einer Mutprobe unter zwei sogenannten Baby-Gangs, die auf dem Polizeirevier landen. Der Vater eines der Beteiligten war einst bekannt als Held, der Kameraden bei einem Einsatz im Irak-Krieg das Leben rettete. Er taucht zufällig in einem anderen Zusammenhang im Dunstkreis von Brunetti auf, und der beginnt, seine Vergangenheit zu beleuchten. \"Schlichte Neugier\", wie Signoria Elettra richtig feststellt. Seite 108, immer noch kein Verbrechen. Aber Brunetti entdeckt Abgründe, die ihn erschüttern. Die beiden Männer treffen am Ende des Buches auch noch in einem dramatischen Finale zusammen, bei dem es um Leben oder Tod geht. Viel Venedig, wenig Verbrechen Wer einen Krimi sucht, in dem sich alle Details später als Puzzleteile eines Kriminalfalls entpuppen, ist bei Brunettis 33. Fall fehl am Platz. Vieles bleibt einfach als Facette des Lebens in Venedig hängen. Eine reiche Amerikanerin spaziert durchs Bild, ein schmieriger Anwalt, der einer Polizistin Verführung eines Minderjährigen anhängen will, ein einsamer Kollege Brunettis, der Bronzestatuen sammelt und in Gefahr gerät. Die Fäden zum eigentlichen Fall sind denkbar dünn. Das sei Absicht, sagt Leon. Es spiegele die Veränderung der italienischen Gesellschaft wider. Kontinuität schwinde. \"Die Italiener werden immer amerikanischer, große Individualisten.\" Aber die klug beobachteten und elegant beschriebenen Facetten des Lebens in Venedig sind ja genau das, was Donna-Leon-Fans so schätzen an den Brunetti-Büchern. \"In meinen Büchern geht es eher um Menschen und ihre Gedanken\", sagt Leon. \"Die Atmosphäre, die Gespräche und die Interaktionen sind wichtiger als die Handlung.\" Krimi-Zutaten wie Grusel und Horror sind ohnehin nicht Donna Leons Metier. Brunetti als Donna Leons Alter Ego Da sinniert Brunetti nachdenklich über den Frühling, der ihm \"das Gefühl oder die Hoffnung, dass wir noch eine Chance bekommen\", gibt. Da wundert er sich, dass in \"Männerköpfen zu wenig Platz ist für ein Nebeneinander von Liebe und Wut\". Natürlich darf Brunettis Liebe zu den Klassikern nicht fehlen. Es sind dieses Mal die Memoiren des Marquis de Custine, die Leon selbst gerade zum zweiten Mal gelesen hat. In dieser Hinsicht sei Brunetti ihr Alter Ego, nicht seine ebenfalls belesene Frau Paola, sagt Leon: \"Er liest, was ich lese. Er ist mitfühlender als sie, ich mag dieses Sanfte an ihm.\" Touristen und ihre iPhones Donna Leon (81) bringt hier und da auch die Moderne in die eigentlich zeitlose Brunetti-Serie, erwähnt Instagram und Speichern in der Cloud, aber dass sie selbst aus einer anderen Welt stammt, wird nicht nur an der Liebe zu den Klassikern deutlich. Zur Gemütslage der \"Baby-Gangs\" heißt es an einer Stelle: \"Nichts Spannendes im Fernsehen, warum also nicht ein bisschen Randale\" - als ob die jungen Leute noch Fernsehen schauten. Leon tuts nicht, wie sie sagt. Und natürlich bekommen die Touristen, die Leon aus Venedig vertrieben haben, wieder ihr Fett weg: \"Boote vom Lido brachten Touristen, die sich auf ihren iPhones anschauten, wie Venedig aussah\", ätzt Leon schon auf den ersten 25 Seiten.

        "content": "\"Müslüman doğunun ilk demokratik cumhuriyeti\" olarak kabul edilen Azerbaycan'ın bağımsızlığı, 28 Mayıs 1918'de Azerbaycan Milli Şurası tarafından ilan edildi. Mehmet Emin Resulzade başkanlığındaki Milli Şura'nın kabul ettiği \"İstiklal Bildirisi\"nde ülkenin cumhuriyet sistemiyle yönetileceği belirtildi. Bağımsız Azerbaycan'da kısa sürede ekonomi, eğitim, din ve vicdan özgürlüğü alanında reformlar yapıldı, tüm yurttaşlara eşit haklar, kadınlara seçme hakkı tanındı. Azerbaycan hükümeti, Bakü Ermeni ve Bolşevik çetelerinin işgali altında olduğu için bir süre ülkenin ikinci büyük kenti Gence'de faaliyet gösterdi. Azerbaycan'ın bağımsızlığını ilk tanıyan Osmanlı devleti oldu. İki devlet arasında 4 Haziran 1918'de anlaşma imzalandı. Bu kapsamda dönemin Harbiye Nazırı Enver Paşa, kardeşi Nuri Paşa (Killigil) komutasında bir ordu kurarak Azerbaycan'a yardım gönderdi. \"Kafkas İslam Ordusu\" ismi verilen ordu, 15 Eylül 1918'de Bakü'yü kurtardı ve hükümet buraya taşındı. Kafkas İslam Ordusu, Bakü'nün kurtuluşu için yaptığı savaşlarda 1130 şehit verdi. Azerbaycan'da kısa sürede ekonomi, eğitim, din ve vicdan özgürlüğü alanında reformlar yapılarak ülke tarihinde ilklere imza atıldı. Irk, din, mezhep ve cinsiyet farkı gözetmeksizin tüm yurttaşlara eşit haklar tanındı. Azerbaycan, Müslüman doğuda kadınlara seçme hakkı tanıyan ilk ülke oldu. Ülkenin kendi para birimi ve posta pulları tedavüle girdi, Devlet Bankası ve Bakü Devlet Üniversitesi kuruldu. Dış tehditlere karşı 26 Haziran'da Azerbaycan kendi ordusunu kurdu ve bu ordunun oluşumunda Osmanlı subayları önemli rol oynadı. Hükümetin 27 Haziran 1918'de aldığı kararla, Türk dili, devlet dili olarak ilan edildi. Daha önce çoğunda Rusça eğitim yapılan ortaokullarda, Türkçe eğitim yapılması zorunlu kılındı. 7 Aralık 1918'de 120 sandalyelik parlamento faaliyete başladı. Ülkedeki tüm siyasi parti ve etnik grupların temsil edildiği parlamento, faaliyet gösterdiği 17 ay süresince 230 yasa tasarısını kabul etti. Bağımsızlığını 23 ay sürdürebilen Azerbaycan Cumhuriyeti, 28 Nisan 1920'de Sovyet ordusunun ülkeyi işgaliyle son buldu. Hükümet yöneticileri ve aydınların çoğu ülkeyi terk etti fakat hepsi Azerbaycan davasını hayatlarının sonuna kadar yaşattı. Azerbaycan'ın kurucusu olarak kabul edilen Mehmet Emin Resulzade'nin, \"Bir kere yükselen bayrak bir daha inmez\" sözleri, yıllar sonra tüm Azerbaycanlılar için slogan haline geldi. Azerbaycan, Sovyetlerin dağılmasının ardından tekrar bağımsızlığını ilan etti. Bağımsızlık bildirgesinde, ülkenin, 1918-1920 döneminde faaliyet gösteren Azerbaycan Cumhuriyeti'nin varisi kabul edildiği belirtildi. Cumhurbaşkanı Yardımcısı Cevdet Yılmaz, Azerbaycan'ın Bağımsızlık Günü'nü kutladı. Yılmaz, sosyal medya hesabından yaptığı paylaşımda, \"Can Azerbaycan'ın 28 Mayıs Bağımsızlık Günü'nü tebrik ediyor, sevinci sevincimiz, kederi kederimiz olan Azerbaycanlı kardeşlerimizin coşkusunu gönülden paylaşıyorum.

        "content": "Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) y la división Onshore Wind de GE Vernova anunciaron la firma de u n acuerdo por valor de más de 700 millones de euros para la entrega, instalación y puesta en marcha de 125 aerogeneradores GE Vernova 6.1-158 en el proyecto eólico Teruel que CIP viene promoviendo a través de contratos con un desarrollador en esa provincia y que se espera comience la fase de construcción en breve. El acuerdo también incluye un contrato de servicio completo de 15 años . Los 125 aerogeneradores serán destinados al proyecto Teruel que , con una potencia instalada conjunta de aproximadamente 760 MW, s e espera que se convierta en el mayor parque eólico de España , contribuyendo significativamente a la aceleración de la transición energética y a la descarbonización del sistema eléctrico nacional reduciendo las emisiones de CO2 en 320 mil toneladas anuales. CIP tiene prevista una inversión de cerca de 1.000 millones de euros para la construcción de este parque eólico, a la que se sumarán 1.400 millones de euros más en gastos de operación y mantenimiento durante toda la vida útil del proyecto de acuerdo con el informe de impacto socioeconómico del proyecto realizado por una consultora independiente. El pedido anunciado, uno de los mayores contratos para proyectos eólicos en España, se espera que suponga un importante impulso a la industria eólica española , y aprovechará la fuerte presencia de GE Vernova en España, donde GE Vernova ya tiene más de 4,3 GW en funcionamiento, un centro de ingeniería de excelencia en Barcelona, y dos fábricas de producción de palas de aerogeneradores para su negocio LM Wind Power. En concreto, se espera que las palas de los 125 aerogeneradores se fabriquen en su planta de Les Coves de Vinromà, en Castellón . Las torres de los aerogeneradores se espera que también se fabriquen en plantas españolas de otras compañías ubicadas en Albacete , Burgos y Galicia . El contrato se basa en acuerdos anteriores a través de los cuales GE Vernova ya ha proporcionado 490 MW a CIP de energía eólica terrestre en Aragón, España. Vic Abate, consejero delegado de GE Vernova Wind, dijo que están \"encantados de poder apoyar de nuevo a CIP en sus objetivos de poner en línea más energía eólica para cumplir con los ambiciosos objetivos de energía renovable de España y seguir contribuyendo a la industria eólica española. Este acuerdo refuerza cómo podemos utilizar nuestra estrategia de productos workhorse para proporcionar a nuestros clientes tecnología probada que les permita construir flotas de alta calidad y alto rendimiento a escala para satisfacer las demandas de la transición energética.\" Nischal Agarwal, socio de CIP afirmó que \"el clúster Maestrazgo se espera que tenga un impacto socioeconómico muy positivo en la creación de empleo y en la economía aragonesa y valenciana, pero también en la cadena de valor de toda la industria eólica española. La fabricación de los aerogeneradores se realizará en plantas de producción ubicadas en España, como la de GE Vernova en Castellón y otras de distintos proveedores en Albacete, Burgos y Galicia, donde se espera que se fabriquen las torres. Las cifras de inversión y creación de empleo convierten al Proyecto Teruel en un referente para el sector en Europa”. El proyecto, se encuentra únicamente a la espera de la Autorización Administrativa de Construcción (AAC) para poder comenzar las obras de instalación , habiendo CIP comprometido ya la totalidad de los fondos necesarios para acometer la construcción. El proyecto permitirá a CIP, quien viene desarrollando desde hace 5 años uno de los principales portfolios de proyectos de renovables en España, acelerar la consecución de los ambiciosos objetivos de transición energética. En junio de 2023, el Ministerio español para la Transición Ecológica y el Reto Demográfico (MITECO) anunció que su objetivo es producir 62 GW de energía eólica para 2030, frente al objetivo anterior de 50 GW, como parte de un plan más amplio para maximizar la cantidad de electricidad del país generada a partir de fuentes renovables. Además, el proyecto se espera que contribuya al mantenimiento de más 3.540 puestos de trabajo, unos 400 millones de euros en impuestos, y electricidad equivalente al consumo de 570.000 hogares al año. El negocio eólico terrestre de GE Vernova cuenta con una base total instalada de más de 56.000 turbinas y casi 120 GW de capacidad instalada en todo el mundo . Comprometida con el éxito de sus clientes desde hace más de dos décadas, su cartera de productos ofrece tecnología probada de nueva generación que lidera con turbinas de gran potencia para permitir una escala de alta calidad e impulsar la descarbonización a través de la generación más asequible y sostenible de energía renovable. Esto incluye más de 1.200 unidades operativas de su plataforma de 6 MW, la turbina eólica terrestre más extendida entre todos los fabricantes de equipos originales que ofrecen placas de características superiores a 5 MW.

        "description": "The Scottish Police ­Federation is among those calling for a weapons amnesty for the first time in three decades.",
        "content": "The Scottish Police ­Federation and the Law Enforcement Action ­Partnership (LEAP) are calling for measures to remove firearms from circulation and make the streets safer. They say new technology, the dark web, the threat of terrorism and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine mean illegal weapons remain a danger to communities. It comes after two guns produced by 3D printers were recorded by police in Scotland for the first time in the middle of last year. Scottish Police Federation chairman David Threadgold, 49, believes an amnesty – also covering blades such as swords and knives – could make neighbourhoods across the country safer. He said: “There are people that will take a legally held firearm and use it for criminal activity. Experts warn the guns are cheap and easy to produce although unlikely to be an increased risk to the public. “We have got to get that balance right, of course, and the impact on the police is that they do not potentially have to deal with that type of crime. “The impact on the police and community could be significant. “If everything else is in place, bearing in mind that the SPF is the voice of every police officer in Scotland, I don’t think you would have a single cop who would not advocate against potentially making our community safer.” There were almost 20,000 offensive weapon crimes recorded by police in Scotland between 2021 and 2023, data revealed. Any country-wide amnesty would need the approval of the Crown Office and Police Scotland. David Kennedy, general secretary of the group, said that if weapons are not taken off the streets the way Police Scotland operate could change significantly. He said: “If we don’t get guns off the streets the reality is that we are moving closer to police officers in Scotland carrying firearms.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "description": "How tech billionaires Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Eric Schmidt ran efficient meetings.",
        "content": "Billionaires are known to be ruthless with their time. But even people running the world's biggest tech companies have to endure meetings , which have a bad reputation for wasting time and money . Mark Cuban even said they were a \"last resort.\" The rest of us have to do our best to use them to generate ideas, investigate details, and focus on a single issue. These are some of the tips household names in business have had for stopping unproductive meetings. Meetings with Amazon cofounder Jeff Bezos started with employees studying a memo. One employee might spend two weeks pulling together a six-page memo for a specific meeting. After 30 minutes of silent reading, attendees were invited to ask questions and start a discussion about the memo. \"I like a crisp document and a messy meeting,\" Bezos said in a conversation with podcaster Lex Fridman in December. Allowing attendees time to read a memo and prepare their thoughts enables employees to ask more productive questions in the meeting, he said. Bezos said he didn't like slideshow presentations, which can hide \"sloppy thinking\" in bullet points. He also maintained a \"two-pizza\" rule : If two pizzas can't feed everyone in the room, there are too many people. Microsoft founder Bill Gates would use meetings to quiz attendees, said Chris Williams, the former VP of HR at Microsoft, who worked closely with Gates for eight years. Williams said he'd never forget his first meeting with Gates in 1992. Microsoft had just bought the company Williams worked at. Gates wanted to meet its employees to find out why one of its products ran faster than Microsoft's equivalent. He grilled a developer with \"rapid fire\" and \"detailed\" questions, Williams recalled. By the end, the pair were discussing \"the movement of single bits and the size of the Intel 80386 instruction cache,\" he added. Gates \"was always curious, always wanted to understand, always drilling for more detail,\" Williams wrote for BI in 2023. \"As he got older, his passion for detail never left, just his method for getting there mellowed,\" Williams added. Steve Jobs was meticulous about keeping meetings small, according to Ken Segall, who worked closely with Jobs as creative director of Apple's ad agency. After Jobs died in 2011, Segall wrote a book about Apple's work culture, \" Insanely Simple .\" In it, he described how Jobs once noticed someone new had joined a weekly meeting. \"He stopped cold,\" Segall wrote. \"His eyes locked on to the one thing in the room that didn't look right. Pointing to Lorrie, he said, 'Who are you?'\" After she explained who she was and that she was working on related marketing projects, Jobs said, \"I don't think we need you in this meeting, Lorrie. Thanks,\" Segall recalled. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said meetings need leaders to make decisions. In \"How Google Works,\" the 2014 book Schmidt wrote with former SVP of products Jonathan Rosenberg, the pair said each meeting needed a designated \"decision-maker\" to have the final say. They wrote that when companies have meetings where everyone present is equal, there's a risk of compromising instead of finding a clear resolution. Schmidt and Rosenberg added that this person should set the purpose and structure of the meeting and summarize decisions and tasks for participants afterward.",

        "content": "Latest News In the Indian mutual fund space, Zerodha Fund House, the country's 38th largest fund house with Rs 1,236 crore in assets under management, has announced two new mutual fund schemes. The launch, which took place on May 27, introduces the Zerodha Nifty 100 ETF (ZN100) and the Zerodha Nifty Midcap 150 ETF (ZM150) to the market. These additions reflect Zerodha's ongoing strategy to expand its portfolio and offer investors a diverse range of investment options. The Zerodha Nifty 100 ETF (ZN100) and Zerodha Nifty Midcap 150 ETF (ZM150) cater to different segments of the market. The ZN100 is a large-cap scheme, focusing on the 100 largest stocks by market capitalization, while the ZM150 targets the next 150 largest companies, categorized as midcap stocks. Both schemes are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), meaning they can be bought and sold only on the stock exchanges. Direct transactions with the fund house are possible only if you hold 7.55 lakh units or more. Since its inception in November 2023, Zerodha Fund House has been steadily building its suite of investment options. Initially, it launched a tax-saver index fund and a large and midcap fund. Earlier this year, Zerodha introduced its liquid ETF and gold ETF. The latest launch of ZN100 and ZM150 continues this trend of creating foundational investment schemes. The launch of ZN100 and ZM150 taps into both established and emerging categories within the mutual fund market. There are currently about 91 passively managed large cap schemes, making ZN100 a relatively common offering. However, the midcap passive scheme category, where ZM150 fits, is still developing, with only 16 existing funds. One aspect that could set ZN100 and ZM150 apart is their expense ratio. In the space of large cap oriented passive funds, expense ratios average around 0.40%, with some ETFs charging as little as 0.03 to 0.04%. While low expense ratios can be appealing, it's essential to consider them within the context of regulatory standards and overall fund performance. ETFs, by their nature, tend to have lower expense ratios compared to actively managed funds. Given that active fund managers have struggled to consistently outperform benchmark indices in recent years, many experts advocate for passive funds for large cap exposure. This trend bodes well for ZN100, which can serve as a reliable addition to a diversified portfolio. On the midcap front, passive funds have shown promise. There are three main types of midcap passive funds: those tracking the top 50 midcap stocks in the Nifty 150 midcap index, those tracking 100 midcap stocks, and those tracking the full Nifty 150 midcap index, like ZM150. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios with midcap exposure, ZM150 offers a compelling option. Despite their potential, ZN100 and ZM150 do not bring anything particularly groundbreaking to the table. As basic schemes, they face stiff competition from numerous existing funds with established track records and varying expense ratios. Moreover, the nature of ETFs presents a limitation: they do not support Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). SIPs are a popular investment strategy in India, allowing investors to regularly invest small amounts. The lack of SIP availability with ZN100 and ZM150 could deter potential investors who prefer this methodical approach to investing. Zerodha Fund House's introduction of the Zerodha Nifty 100 ETF and Zerodha Nifty Midcap 150 ETF marks another step in its ongoing expansion and diversification strategy. While the schemes are basic and face significant competition, their success could hinge on competitive expense ratios and the growing appeal of passive investment strategies. For investors, the choice to include ZN100 and ZM150 in their portfolios will depend on individual financial goals, risk tolerance, and the desire for large cap or midcap exposure.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email You have an idea for a piece of custom-printed clothing that fits your style and personality perfectly. These days, there are so many ways to customize things that it can be hard to find the right print shop to make your ideas come to life. In this article, you will delve into six invaluable tips to help you find the right Custom Print Clothing shop for your needs. 1. Number of T-Shirts to Print Before choosing a custom print clothing shop, consider the quantity of T-shirts you need. Some shops specialize in small orders, while others cater to bulk printing. If you only need a few shirts, look for a shop that accepts low minimum orders. This ensures you don’t pay for more shirts than you require. Conversely, if you need a large quantity, opt for a shop equipped to handle bulk orders efficiently. By aligning your needs with the shop’s capabilities, you can ensure a seamless printing process without unnecessary expenses or delays. 2. Check Printing Quality Before committing to a shop, thoroughly assess the printing quality of their past work. Request samples or browse through their portfolio to evaluate the clarity, color vibrancy, and durability of prints. Look for crisp lines, vibrant colors that don’t fade easily, and smooth application of designs. Additionally, consider the printing techniques used, such as screen printing or direct-to-garment printing, and choose one that best suits your preferences and budget. By prioritizing printing quality, you can ensure your custom T-shirts look professional and withstand repeated washings without deterioration. 3. Know the Printing Costs Understanding the printing costs upfront is crucial for budgeting and avoiding unexpected expenses. Inquire about the shop’s pricing structure, including any setup fees, per-shirt costs, and additional charges for design services or special requests. Compare quotes from multiple shops to gauge the average price range and identify any discrepancies. Additionally, consider factors that may affect pricing, such as shirt quality, printing technique, and complexity of the design. While it’s tempting to opt for the cheapest option, prioritize value and quality to ensure satisfactory results. 4. Look For A Dependable Customer Service When selecting a custom print clothing shop, prioritize one with dependable customer service. A reliable shop will communicate promptly, answer your questions, and address any concerns throughout the printing process. They should be attentive to your needs and guide design options, printing techniques, and order specifications. 5. Check The Return Policy While rare, mistakes or discrepancies in printing may occur, and it’s essential to know the shop’s procedures for addressing such situations. A clear and fair return policy provides peace of mind, allowing you to request corrections or replacements if necessary. Pay attention to any conditions or limitations, such as timeframes for returns, acceptable reasons for returns, and procedures for initiating a return. 6. Go Through The Reviews Prior to finalizing your decision, take the time to read reviews and testimonials from past customers of the custom print clothing shop. Reviews offer valuable insights into the shop’s reliability, quality of work, and overall customer satisfaction. Look for patterns in feedback, paying attention to both positive and negative comments regarding communication, printing quality, timeliness, and customer service. Additionally, consider the shop’s response to any negative reviews, as it reflects their commitment to addressing customer concerns and improving their services. Find the Perfect Custom Print Clothing Shop You Need Armed with these expert tips, you’re now equipped to find the perfect custom print clothing shop to bring your vision to life. So, don’t hesitate.

        "content": "STOCKHOLM, Sweden, May 28 2024 (IPS) - Immigration policies are among the most hotly debated topics in Europe. Xenophobia, combined with curbing immigration, have become the main reason to why ever-increasing large crowds of voters are supporting populist parties. A visit to World War I French war cemeteries might provide a different perspective on import and exploitation of labourers from poor countries in the South, indicating what their suffering have meant to European wellbeing. For hundreds, even thousands of years, Europe has been dependent on a forced and often badly treated labour force – slaves, serfs, indentured labourers, prisoners of war – people who have been captured, or hired, and then transported from areas outside Europe, a practise especially evident during World War I. In Noyelles-Sur-Mernot , we find a Chinese cemetery, not far from the blood-soaked battlefield of Somme, where in 1916 approximately one million soldiers, during less than four months, lost their lives, or went missing. Here rests some of the 100,000 coolies who in China and Vietnam had been contracted by British and French armies to work, fight and die in the mud of the trenches. Coolies , in Chinese written as 苦力, meaning ”bitter labour” or “bitter strength”, went everywhere, from the Arctic to the southern ends of the world. They built railways in the USA, in Alaska, in the jungles of Amazonia, in the Middle East and Siberia. They worked in Peruvian silver mines and the diamond mines of Natal (South Africa), in guano fields in Peru and on sugar plantations in Trinidad, Cuba, and the German Samoa. Chinese workers were hired for pitiful amounts by professional contractors, obtaining advances from their customers and assuming the responsibility for discipline, travel, control, and supervision. After being sprayed head to foot with disinfectants and having their characteristic ponytails cut of, Chinese coolies were shipped off towards harsh work and/or battlefields. A long sea voyage, that could last more than four months, with diseases and insufficient food, killed many of them. Since Westerners found it difficult to distinguish one worker from another and to learn Chinese and Vietnamese names, coolies were deprived of their names and assigned numbers instead. Outside working hours coolies were not allowed into military canteens, or to mix with civilians, most of them lived in guarded and wired camps. Coolies were generally considered to be replaceable and often treated in an inhuman manner. In the 1890’s, a Swedish foreign legionnaire, Bertil Nelsson, described a crossing of a mountain range in Tonkin (Vietnam): Not far from the cemetery of Noyelles-Sur-Mernot we find the cemetery of Chapellete , one of six Indian War cemeteries around Somme and Amiens. The British considered the Indian continent as an integrated part of their empire, recruiting 800,000 Indian soldiers and 500,000 coolies , bringing them to various war zones of World War I, at least 73,000 of them died. This was not only a wartime procedure. Between 1896 and 1901, some 32,000 Indian, indentured labourers constructed a railway linking Uganda to the sea port of Mombasa, 2,500 labourers died during its construction. In the British colony of Natal approximately 200,000 Indians arrived as indentured labourers to work in mines and plantations. Between 1838 and 1920, 230,000 indentured Indian labourers arrived in British Guyana, mainly to toil in the plantations. During the same period more than 135,000 Indians arrived in Trinidad-Tobago. At the same time, the French contracted 30,000 Indians for work in Martinique, 20,000 to work in French Guyana, and no less than 500,000 were destined to Mauritius, whose descendants now constitute more than 65 % of the island’s population. These were just a few examples to indicate how the colonial powers of France and Great Britain spread Indian and Chinese workers around the globe. The great majority of this generally harshly treated labour force remained where they had been brought, in spite of the fact that contracts and enforcement had stipulated they were supposed to be transported back to China and India. Many Chinese, Indian and African coolies , as well as some Europeans, were “indentured labourers”. Since the sixteenth century an indentured servant was usually a labourer contracted to work, without pay, three to seven years in exchange for the cost of transportation, food, clothing, and a place to live. Indentures were quite common in Colonial America and different from slaves in the sense that their captivity was temporary and could be ended if they paid off the debts incurred for food and housing. An indenture could be sold. After arriving at their destination indentures were generally sold to the highest bidder. Like prices of slaves, their price went up or down depending on supply and demand. Indentured labour could also by authorities be used as a punishment, something that befell many European “vagrants” and minor criminals, who were sent off to the “colonies”. Another French cemetery, this one from World War II, situated just outside Lyon, might also remind us of sacrifices endured by people subdued under colonialism. Two days after Marshal Pétain had announced France’s surrender to the Nazis, the 25th regiment of Tiralleurs Sénégalais tried in the small town of Chasselay to hinder the German army from entering Lyon. Tiralleurs Sénégalais was the all-encompassing denomination of sub-Saharan recruits, of whom most came from Senegal. During the days that followed, the Germans experienced heavy losses, before the French and Africans surrendered. Prisoners were divided into two: The French on one side, the Africans on the other. The latter were machine-gunned. During World War I, 200,000 African troops were recruited by the French Army of whom 135,000 were deployed to Europe, where 30,000 were killed. During World War II, approximately the same number of Africans were recruited by France, of whom 40,000 were deployed to Europe. During World Wars I and II, approximately, 4,500,000 African soldiers and military labourers were mobilized by the Brits and French, about 2,000,000 of them died. Inside Africa, during and before these wars several hundreds of thousands of porters were used to transport goods through an often roadless terrain. These porters were often recruited by force and compelled to carry their burdens far from home, harassed by diseases, the cruelty of their leaders and an unhospitable terrain. Furthermore, they were often infected by diseases, previously unknown to them, while spreading sickness themselves. During World War I, 95,000 African porters died while in British service, 15,650 under the Belgians, and 7,000 under the Germans. French and Portuguese porter deaths are unaccounted for, but assumed to be at least 20,000. Also unaccounted for are deaths among “civilians” caused by the spread of diseases and mass migration. A work force similar to indentured labour made its appearance after World War II. During its aftermath several countries were in dire need of a numerous and effective labour force. As an example, in West Germany foreigners were allowed to work for a period of one or two years, before returning to their home country, making room for other migrants. For Turks, Tunisians and Moroccans, special rules applied – only unmarried persons could be recruited; family reunification was not allowed, a health check, and an aptitude test had to be passed. A Gastarbeiter , guest worker, could after two years not be allowed any extension. These harsh rules were mitigated over time and now more than 4 million persons with a recent Turkish migrant background live in Germany. Communist East Germany also had a Gastarbeiter system, with workers arriving from Poland, Vietnam and Cuba. Contact between guest workers and East German citizens was extremely limited. After work, Gastarbeiter were usually restricted to their dormitories, or an area of the city which Germans were not allowed to enter. Furthermore, sexual relations with a German led to deportation. Women Gastarbeiter were not allowed to become pregnant during their stay. If they did, they were forced to have an abortion. Similar systems have been used in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Workers from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan generally pay agents in their own countries, for travel and sponsorship during a limited time period. However, the receiving governments have currently begun to implement reforms to increase labour protection and remove elements of the Kafala (sponsorship) system, although these reforms have so far been insufficient to dismantle the system entirely. Currently, approximately 88% of the UAE population consist of expatriates, most of them migrant workers. Not all migrant workers, i.e. persons engaged in remunerated activities in a state of which they are not nationals, have been recruited through systems similar to the Kafala , some are undocumented workers, but many continue to suffer from uncertainty and an overhanging threat of being expelled from work and livelihood. The number of international migrant workers is currently totalling 170 million. They constitute 4.9 % of the labour force of destination countries with the highest rate at 42 % in the UAE. Among international migrant workers, women constitute 41.5 % and men 58.5 %. Whatever European anti-immigration parties may claim, the immigration of non-European labour is far from a new phenomenon. European war cemeteries, might serve as just one example testifying to the fact that Europeans have a lot to thank such “foreigners” for. Furthermore, Europeans also have reason to be ashamed of the misery their ancestors have caused such “alien workers”, as well as the fact that some are still exploiting and devaluing their contribution to the host countries’ economy and wellbeing.

        "description": "History says buy these stocks on the dip.",
        "content": "Starbucks ( SBUX 0.72% ) and Lululemon Athletica ( LULU 1.09% ) are top brands with a lot of growth left in the tank. However, both stocks recently sold off following weak sales guidance by both companies. Both stocks are currently down about 37% from their previous peak. While these stocks have delivered massive gains for investors over the last few decades, they haven't moved up in a straight line. Lululemon shares have fallen 30% or more off their high six times in the last decade. A dip of this magnitude is rarer for Starbucks shares, which have fallen this much only four times in the last 20 years. Here's why these stocks are worth buying on the dip. 1. Starbucks Starbucks is one of the most iconic consumer brands around. It has more than 38,000 stores worldwide, but management is planning to expand that number to 55,000 by 2030. Starbucks didn't get to where it is today without hitting some bumps in the road. Since 1971, the company has experienced several economic recessions but has kept on growing. It's currently experiencing another rough patch, with weak consumer spending trends sending revenue down 2% year over year last quarter. The issue isn't pinned down to a single geography. Management reported weakness in North America and the Middle East and a slower-than-expected recovery in China. Management still expects to report positive sales growth this year, just not as much as previously estimated. It now calls for full-year revenue to grow at a low-single-digit rate, down from previous guidance for growth between 7% to 10%. Nothing has changed the company's long-term goals. International is still a big opportunity for the brand, which outperformed the North American market last quarter. There's a great opportunity in India, where management is planning to operate 1,000 stores by 2028. The bad news in the near term means the stock is now trading at its best value in years. Investors can buy the stock at a discounted forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22, which is attractive against Wall Street's long-term projection for double-digit annualized earnings growth . 2. Lululemon Athletica Similar headwinds are hurting Lululemon, but it's a testament to this athletic brand's strength that, in a soft-demand environment, the company is still capable of growing revenue at double-digit rates. It posted a revenue increase of 16% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter last year, and management expects this year's revenue to grow 11% to 12% year over year. Lululemon was built from the ground up. Since opening its first store in Vancouver more than 20 years ago, it has used local marketing strategies, such as in-store classes, marathons, and other events, to win loyal customers. This strategy has turned it into a global growth phenomenon. Lululemon can grow for a long time, given that the athletic wear industry is estimated to be worth more than $350 billion, according to Statista, and still growing. There are a lot of places around the world that still don't know about the brand yet. The company plans to open 30 new stores outside of North America this year. The recent sell-off in the shares is undervaluing the brand's long-term opportunity. On the recent earnings call in March, management mentioned that there is a relative lack of brand awareness in most markets. Lululemon has an expanding assortment of products covering a range of activities, including the recent introduction of its first footwear line, that can appeal to a large customer base. The shares trade at an attractive forward P/E of 21, with Wall Street analysts projecting earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 13% per year.",

        "description": "And how President Biden can make that goal a better campaign theme",
        "content": "In 2020 and 2021, under Presidents Trump and Biden, Congress passed more than $5 trillion in COVID relief funding in six separate bills. The March 2020 CARES Act alone, at $2.2 trillion totaling about 10 percent of one year’s GDP, was the largest non-wartime federal stimulus ever. Without that funding, unemployment in the COVID recession would have easily reached 20 percent, as the economy spiraled into a 1930s-style self-deepening depression. Entire industries, such as airlines and restaurants, would have collapsed. The COVID stimulus, which dwarfed the $831 billion stimulus approved under President Obama in 2009 (now widely acknowledged to be inadequate), is a good illustration of government spending sufficient sums to avert an economic disaster. But if you take a good look at where that money went, much of it was money needed for long-deferred, everyday public needs. And 2024 is the year when . For instance, under the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund, the nation’s schools got $190 billion. As that money is exhausted, public schools face a massive teacher shortage, deferred maintenance expenses, and a fiscal cliff. Philadelphia has a budget gap of $407 million. New York’s is at least $700 million. Across the country, there are potential teacher layoffs and program cuts. COVID relief also provided funding of . After decades of chronic underfunding and operating deficits, that emergency money was a godsend. The pandemic sent many transit agencies into a death spiral. Reduced ridership meant reduced income from fares, but increasing fares only reduced ridership further. This downward spiral continues, as the federal funds are depleted. Deferred maintenance and unreliable service also pushed more riders into Uber. Likewise, more people working at home. In California, the relatively modern and efficient Bay Area Rapid Transit system has only 43 percent of its pre-pandemic riders. New Jersey’s state system faces a $1 billion budget shortfall by 2026. In Boston, where the antiquated subway and trolley system dates to the 19th century, the budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year, which begins July 1, is projected at between $567 million and $652 million. COVID relief under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act included . In exchange, states had to maintain continuous coverage, even if an enrollee’s income status changed. Now, states are disenrolling people who no longer qualify, and national enrollment will decline by 8.6 percent in 2024. The good news is that the strong economy lightened the blow that was feared on some of these fronts. For example, the expected “child care cliff” , as labor force participation of mothers of young children is larger than ever, and child care sector jobs remain strong. But the damaging rollbacks of the pop-up COVID safety net still have a significant impact in many areas. pulled back the curtain on public services that are strapped for funds, day in and day out. Biden’s original , blocked by the Republicans with the assistance of Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), would have provided about a trillion dollars more money for public needs, including free and universal pre-kindergarten for all three- and four-year-olds. The refundable Child Tax Credit, which was really a universal child allowance for all kids under 18, was allowed to lapse after one year. During the year it was in effect, it reduced child poverty by over 40 percent. Build Back Better proposed to make it permanent. Next year, Manchin and Sinema will be gone. If the voters return Biden and a Democratic Congress, Biden can take another stab at providing the level of public support that our threadbare public services need. This goal—of better ongoing support for popular public services—also provides Biden with much better talking points. Republicans oppose good public services. They’d rather have tax cuts for the rich. As part of the 2023 deal to increase the national debt ceiling, Republicans demanded and got a “clawback” of unspent COVID relief funds for the states totaling $27 billion. Biden has made a mistake in campaigning on how great the economy is. Though it certainly has improved in many respects since 2022, the economy just isn’t all that great for lots of working people. Build Back Better also proposed expansions in affordable housing and child care, and much more. It would be far better for Biden to campaign on what he could do with a working majority in Congress than brag about how much he has done. Nothing better illustrates the divide between the two parties.",

        "content": "Norway and Spain on Tuesday morning announced their official recognition of the State of Palestine, while Ireland is scheduled to follow suit later today. Before the Spanish government approved a decree recognizing the State of Palestine, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albarez said in a speech, \"recognizing the State of Palestine is a historic step that allows the Palestinians and Israelis to achieve peace.\" \"The adoption of the decision to recognize the State of Palestine is in line with UN resolutions and is not directed against any party,\" stressing that his country will not recognize any change to the 1967 borders, without the agreement of the Israelis and Palestinians, and the only path to peace is the two-state solution. The Spanish Prime Minister reaffirmed Spain's commitment to security in the region, and to working with Arab countries to hold a peace conference. He stressed that the priority now is to put an end to the unprecedented crisis in Gaza, open the crossings, and called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the entry of humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, Norway officially recognized the State of Palestine. \"Norways official recognition of Palestine as a state has entered into force,\" the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The statement added, \"a number of other like-minded European countries will officially recognize Palestine on the same date.\" The three European countries announced this step simultaneously last week, with their leaders saying they hoped other countries would join the initiative, stressing that it would enhance the prospects for peace. With Spain, Norway and Ireland, the number of countries recognizing the State of Palestine rises to 147, out of 193 member states in the United Nations General Assembly.

        "description": "Suffolk Chamber of Commerce is calling for fairer revenue funding for the county and infrastructure upgrades in its 2024 general election \"manifesto\".",
        "content": "Suffolk Chamber of Commerce has drawn up a 15-point list of demands for the county ahead of the general election - including rail upgrades and fixing A14 pinch points. The business group is calling for the Treasury to sign off on Ely-Haughley rail junction improvements as a priority - and for A14 road upgrades including the Orwell Bridge and the Junction 55 Copdock Interchange in 2025-30. Business rates should be replaced by a sales or turnover tax for companies, it said. It wants to see fairer revenue funding for Suffolk and infrastructure upgrades to unlock private sector activity and investment as part of its plan for sustainable economic growth for the county. Chamber chief executive John Dugmore pointed out that its most recent Quarterly Economic Surveys showed many key business indicators such as sales, orders, investment, cash flow, turnover and profitability are generally lower than at any time since the start of the pandemic. “That is why Suffolk’s business owners and management teams need clarity as to what to expect from their local Parliamentary representatives over the next four or five years,” he said. But the county's business community was \"incredibly resilient\", he added. \"As proven over the years since the last General Election, companies across the county have weathered the storms of Covid19 lockdowns, labour and skills shortages, inflation, excessive business taxation and low growth,\" he said. Among the chamber's manifesto asks are \"lower and smarter taxes, reliefs and legislation that incentivise and don’t penalise risk-taking and innovation\". It also wants businesses to be empowered to be at the centre of positive economic and social changes. It calls for public debt to be cut and bureaucracy and supply-side blockages to be streamlined. Devolution of central government functions should be \"deepened\" to maximise an \"agile partnership working between Suffolk Chamber and the public sector\", it said. Other key asks include equal per capita national funding across all key departments for Suffolk - including for adult education, special educational needs and police. Employers should remain at the centre of skills pipeline planning after the end of the Norfolk & Suffolk Norfolk & Suffolk Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP), it said. The chamber's head of public affairs Paul Simon said the election would be pivotal for the county. “Let’s be crystal clear - without a strong and consistent pro-business voice in Westminster in the next Parliament, Suffolk will never be able to boost household incomes, attract investment and maximise its contributions to national prosperity. “This is a county with a strong concentration in key twenty first century sectors such as renewable energy, ports and logistics and the land-based economy that has been hobbled for far too long with out-of-date rail, road and communications infrastructure and a corporate tax and state funding system that penalises rather than encourages growth and investment. Suffolk Chamber will be conducting a survey of all Parliamentary candidates standing in the county to find out the extent to which they are in agreement with its 15-point programme. The research results will be shared with its members initially and then the whole of the county’s business community to help them make informed electoral decisions, it said. It is also hoping to host a number of hustings bringing together candidates with local business leaders - including one in Ipswich in partnership with the University of Suffolk.",

        "description": "Daniel Ricciardo wist de chaos net te ontwijken tijdens de Grand Prix van Monaco, al bracht het akkefietje tussen Alpine-coureurs Pierre Gasly en Esteban Ocon wel de nodige herinneringen met zich mee.",
        "content": "Daniel Ricciardo had ongetwijfeld op een beter weekend gehoopt. De Australiër kwam vlak na de start al achter Fernando Alonso terecht en vanaf dat moment kon hij het scoren van punten wel op zijn buik schrijven. Op het stratencircuit in Monaco is het sowieso al lastig om in te halen en een twaalfde startpositie werkt dan niet in je voordeel. Ricciardo had al vanaf het eerste moment door dat het een lastig karwei zou worden om de top tien te bereiken, dus zat er niets anders op dan genoegen te nemen met de zoveelste puntloze race van dit seizoen. Dat teamgenoot Yuki Tsunoda wél punten scoorde in Monaco maakte het alleen nog maar vervelender voor de goedlachse Australiër, die na acht races al veertien punten achter zijn teamgenoot ligt. Ondanks het gebrek aan punten heeft Ricciardo toch een enigszins enerverend weekend achter de rug, al was dat niet helemaal in zijn voordeel. Hij werd vlak na de start bijna meegenomen in het Alpine-akkefietje, maar wist zichzelf net uit de problemen te houden. Dat is maar goed ook, want de Australiër weet als geen ander hoe zo'n teamgenoten-incident af kan lopen. In gesprek met onder meer RacingNews365 kwamen de herinneringen weer naar boven. \"Het scheelde echt niet veel! Lance (Stroll, red.) zat er zeker dichter achter dus ik had wat langer de tijd om te reageren, maar mijn hemel... Ik denk dat er echt wel twee of zelfs drie keer spraken was van een touché, inclusief die laatste klapper. Het deed me echt denken aan Bakoe 2018, waar Max Verstappen en ik elkaar natuurlijk tegenkwamen. Toen raakten we elkaar ook een keer of drie voordat het incident echt ontstond.\" Ricciardo zag vrijwel meteen dat de Alpine-coureurs een soortgelijk lot stond te wachten. \"Ik zag het echt gebeuren en ik weet nog dat ik vrijwel meteen dacht: 'Oké, de spanning stijgt wel heel snel zo.' Als teamgenoten wordt die spanning soms nog veel groter, dus het verbaasde me eigenlijk niet dat dit gebeurde, omdat ze allebei niet echt bereid leken om veel toe te geven. Ik weet wel hoe dat gaat, dus ik weet ook wel dat het team echt niet blij is nu.\"",

Wash and randomly chop the mushrooms. Fry them in butter for 20 minutes. Add salt. When the liquid forms, put the mushrooms in a saucepan. 2. Meanwhile, chop and fry the onion in butter until golden brown. When ready, add to the mushrooms. Add spices and salt. 3. Mix sour cream and water in a deep bowl. Add to the mushrooms. 4. Dissolve the flour in the water, and stir to avoid lumps. Pour over the mushrooms. 5. Put the pan on the fire and simmer for 20-30 minutes. If the gravy is too thick, you can add water.",

'It is a challenge and we must not get this wrong,' French transport minister Patrice Vergriete told aviation executives, warning 'serious operational problems' could create queues of tourists at airports and lead to the 'disruption' of public order. Mr Vergriete said last week preparations for the summer Olympics in Paris were still taking priority, despite alerting the interior minister to concerns. 'We have little visibility and are doubtful about police numbers and technology,' he lamented. From October, British and non-EU passport holders will have to go through fingerprint checks and face scans under the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES). The system will check each passenger's name and biometric data when they enter an EU country. It will replace the stamping of passports, which began after Brexit when the UK became a 'third country' to the bloc – meaning it is not a member state and does not have the right to free movement within the EU. French transport minister Patrice Vergriete (pictured) said he was 'worried' about the new automated border measures which are set to come into force from October British and non-EU passport holders will have to go through fingerprint checks and face scans under the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES). (File photo) 'I cannot say that we are not working hard to ensure that we are as operational as possible,' he told the French National Federation of Aviation and its Trades (FNAM) conference. 'I cannot say that collaboration with the Ministry of the Interior is going badly, that would be lying... but I fear problems.' The transport minister said he had asked the EU for a delay to the new system being rolled out but he fears this is unlikely. It had been scheduled to come into force before the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, but this has since been delayed. 'I'm even going to ask for a further postponement, but it seems difficult to me to get it from the European authorities,' Mr Vergriete added. 'We will do our utmost to be on time, and we are all aware that things are not going to run totally smoothly'. Mr Vergriete is not the first minister to raise concerns over the new e-gate system. Lord Cameron, James Cleverly and Mark Harper have all raised concerns about the new system with French ministers, noting that the changes could lead to travel chaos, the Telegraph previously reported. Queues at the Port of Dover - one of the locations where the new border checks will be in place People queue for Eurostar train services at St Pancras International station as they make their Easter getaway in London, Britain, 29 March 2024 Each time visitors try to cross into the continent, they will have to show a facial image and provide four fingerprints One senior Government source familiar with the discussions on the new checks told the newspaper: 'The main risk is that we are in the hands of the French in those places where there is going to be disruption on UK soil.' Lord Cameron previously said he was 'really worried' about delays and said the technology 'still needs testing and improving' as he pointed to 'choke points' at Dover and St Pancras. Airlines are set to be concerned that tourists will face severe delays in both departures and arrivals. Meanwhile Eurotunnel estimate that the average time of processing a car at Dover will rise from less than a minute to up to seven minutes - partially because visitors will not be able to have their passports checked at windows and will instead need to exit vehicles and use the e-gates.

        "content": "Majorca tourists have been hit with fresh protests from locals who have told Brits to \"go home\" snd \"get out\". Protesters are demonstrating over the lack of affordable housing in the Balearic Islands, with Majorca the centrepoint for fresh tension following similar protests and movements in the Canaries earlier this year. 15,000 have taken action over UK holidaymakers, chanting \"Go home\" and brandishing banners saying Salvem Mallorca, guiris arruix\", which means \"Let's save Majorca, foreigners out\" in Catalan. Polly Taylor, who was dining with three friends, said that she initially had no idea what the crowd were doing until they started to come closer to the restaurant as armed police began to show up on the scene. \"It was like a storm was coming but we didn’t know what the storm was about....then the noise from the protestors just got louder and louder and we were swamped with them,\" she said. She went on: \"At that point, between the sea of people and..., it felt very intimidating to the point we discussed trying to leave and get out in case it turned nasty. READ MORE Brits in Spain and Portugal told to prepare for 'dramatic' shift starting today \"We eventually managed to move into the restaurant to get off the street before any trouble could start.\" She went on: \"I will take my money elsewhere until they sort this all out. I understand their cause, being priced out of their own country owing to tourism, but they were targeting the wrong people.' \"They never to target their government and the huge holiday companies. We were simply contributing to their economy by holidaying for a few days.\" Following Saturday's protest, Banc del Temps spokesman Javier Barbero issued a chilling warning. \"This is just the start of things. If measures aren't taken we will continue taking to the streets until we see action,\" he said. \"You are heroes and you have made history. Now our government should open its doors wide open to you and call you to a meeting so that you can present your and our demands. \"With 25,000 people behind you, you are an organisation that should be received this week by Balearic Islands' government president Marga Prohens. She should take note and put urgent measures in place.\"",

        "description": "XDefiant has breathed new life into the FPS genre, but for some players who have jumped into the game, one weapon is ruining the game and making it difficult to enjoy the action: Sniper rifles. While reviews for the game have generally been positive, like any new game, there have been complaints. While the slow weapon progression is probably the most frustrating issue right now, if you've been playing XDefiant, the odds are pretty high that you've been demolished by a sniper rifle. That's certainly been the case for me, and now players have gone to Reddit to complain about the snipers, calling them \"ridiculously overpowered,\" while also suggesting what Ubisoft needs to do to fix them. Getting sniped at close range isn't fun. Image via Ubisoft\"Snipers are ridiculously overpowered,\" wrote The_Stiffmeister. \"Even at close range they can scope in and shoot while getting drilled in the face with an [assault rifle]. Zero flinch or movement punishment. The sniper lobbies make the game unfun.\"This sentiment was echoed by many, with Snooperal saying their \"only gripe with snipers is the fact that they're better shotguns than shotguns,\" while More_Tackle9491 said they \"would do anything for a no sniping lobby,\" as it's \"impossible to compete.\"As for what's causing the issue, the majority of players agree that the lack of flinch on sniper rifles is problematic. Flinch makes your recoil increase when you're being shot, but as snipers don't have it, you can shoot them while they are scoped in and their aim isn't affected. \"They 100% need more flinch. They're already pretty close to being well-balanced with their slow reloads and slow ADS times, and I don't mind being quickscoped either. If they got the drop on me, I think they rightfully earned it. I also don't mind their one-hit kill,\" wrote Ggun_14. \"However, with the lack of flinch, I lost count of how many times I have dumped 4 to 5 rounds into a person and they still one tap me with zero consequence. If I'm the one that initiates the fight and I'm landing accurate multiple shots faster than they can? I'm the one that should have the upper hand, not them. This isn't a skill issue. It's a clear design flaw.\"There's definitely room for snipers in XDefiant, but the fact that they are more potent at short-range than an SMG like the P90 is problematic. With plenty of patches coming down the line, we can only hope that Ubisoft will address this soon.

        "content": "krblokhin Amazon ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) Web Services is in talks to invest billions of euros in expanding its data center business in Italy to further strengthen its cloud offering in the European region. Talks are still underway between the parties over the scope and location of the investment, and Amazon ( AMZN ) Web Service (AWS) could either create a new facility or expand its existing one in Milan, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. AWS recently revealed a €15.7B (~$17.1B) investment in data centers located in the Aragon region of Spain, replacing its original €2.5B (~$2.72B) 10-year plan announced in 2021. AWS will invest billions in Italy, but that might not be as ambitious as it is for Spain, according to one of the sources cited in the report . More on expanding in Europe: AWS plans to park €7.8B (~$8.4B) through 2040 in Germany. In addition, AWS is developing the infrastructure needed to offer cloud services to telecom clients. In 2020, Amazon ( AMZN ) Web Services originally announced its plans to invest €2B by 2029, including the launch of its first cloud region in Italy. Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Alphabet ( GOOG ) also announced plans for expanding cloud services in Italy in the same year.

        "content": "Productivitatea unui salariat este de trei ori mai mică decât media europeană şi se ridică la aproximativ 15.000 de euro pe an, a declarat Florin Dănescu, preşedintele Asociaţiei Române a Băncilor (ARB). Cele aproximativ 540.000 de IMM-uri existente, la ora actuală, în România ne plasează tot pe ultimul loc în Europa, raportat la mia de locuitori, susține Dănescu. \" Ştim că în România avem un portofoliu de aproximativ 540.000 de întreprinderi şi, aşa cum s-a învăţat la şcoală, ne uităm la acestea mai întâi cantitativ, structural şi calitativ. Cantitativ, spunem că avem 540.000 de companii şi constatăm apoi că IMM-urile, raportat la numărul de locuitori, ne poziţionează tot pe ultimul loc din Europa, şi că în cazul Cehiei există de vreo trei ori mai multe IMM-uri la mia de locuitori. Deci, din punct de vedere cantitativ nu stăm bine, nu avem suficient masă antreprenorială, chiar dacă acesta este motorul principal al economiei româneşti. De ce? Pentru că produce 56% din valoarea adăugată la Produsul Intern Brut, pentru că produce 76% din volumul locurilor de muncă. Ne uităm, apoi, structural şi găsim o structură deficitară, ca să fiu elegant, în sensul în care 35% dintre IMM-uri au un capital negativ, în medie, de zece ani, adică au pierderi. Şi asta denotă o concluzie negativă asupra amplorii structurii, chiar şi calităţii acestui motor economic. Atenţie, nu generalizăm ! Eu nu pun o notă proastă asupra antreprenoriatului, dar totuşi această concluzie structurală este, dacă vreţi, chirurgicală, corectă. Iertaţi-mă dacă pare cinică, dar e sănătos să ni se spună care sunt analizele corpului nostru economic\" , a explicat Dănescu. În viziunea specialistului, din punct de vedere calitativ, productivitatea unui salariat în România se situează la valoarea de 14.500 - 15.000 de euro pe an, mult sub media europeană, de 47.000 de euro. \" Care e productivitatea unui salariat al unui IMM în România timp de un an ? Păi, în jur de 14.500, spre 15.000 de euro, comparabil cu 47.000 de euro la nivel european pe medie, deci mai puţin de trei ori. În concluzie, calitativ stăm rău, cantitativ stăm rău, structural stăm rău... Pe această structură venim cu nişte principii extrem de provocatoare, extrem de dificil de atins şi suprapunem pe această structură a companiilor româneşti aceste cerinţe foarte dure care vin aparent dinspre sistemul bancar şi acele necesităţi de prevenire a spălării banilor, o groază de cerinţe la nivelul clientelei, care pun o perspectivă negativă asupra sistemului bancar. Trebuie să repetăm că acestea sunt, de fapt, externalizări ale statului şi ale statelor oriunde în lume şi mai cu seamă în Europa, prin reglementări prin care băncile sunt folosite ca instrumente de intermediere sau de prevenire a tuturor tipurilor de riscuri. Asta înseamnă că se creează un parteneriat între bănci şi state, din perspectiva în care statele utilizează băncile ca nişte instrumente care nu sunt plăcute la nivel electoral \", a spus şeful ARB. Potrivit sursei citate, în domeniul financiar-bancar, principalul argument, ca etică profesională \" este că vorbeşti doar de meseria ta, nu de meseria altora \". \" În concluzie, dacă noi astăzi credem şi vom susţine sistemele bancare şi sistemul bancar din România, industria bancară din România, cu toate motoarele pe care le avem, aceste principii ale ESG şi Green Deal trebuie să luăm note şi de ce spun cei care sunt folosiţi ca instrumente (...) Grija noastră foarte mare este cum să nu mai adăugăm o percepţie negativă a publicului vizavi de bănci, care vor cere mult mai multe lucruri şi care sunt, de fapt, obligaţii statale, guvernamentale, legale, de reglementare. Mesajul meu este că toţi trebuie să tragem de principiile astea, dacă noi credem în ele\" , a menţionat Florin Dănescu.",

        "content": "(ANSA) - BOLOGNA, 28 MAG - Sono circa 6mila i poliziotti greci mobilitati per la finale di Conference che domani sera, allo stadio di Agia Sofia, casa dell'Aek Atene, vedrà di fronte Fiorentina e Olympiacos. La zona dello stadio, nel quartiere settentrionale di Nea Filadelfia, è già fortemente presidiata, alcune strade sono state chiuse, altre lo saranno domani. A preoccupare le forze dell'ordine greche nono sono tanto i circa 10mila tifosi viola che hanno già cominciato a raggiungere Atene, quanto i rapporti fra le tifoserie delle squadre ateniesi. In Grecia la questione violenza legato allo sport è piuttosto complicata, tanto che da una decina d'anni sono addirittura vietate le trasferte. L'Olympiacos infatti si giocherà la finale nel nuovissimo stadio dei rivali dell'Aek Atene, ma, per disposizioni delle autorità, non si potrà entrare con colori diversi dal viola e dal biancorosso dell'Olympiacos. Si temono scontri e agguati nella zona circostante lo stadio, nei quali, peraltro, potrebbero infiltrarsi anche gli ultras del Panathinaikos, altra squadra ateniese, la cui tifoseria, appena ieri, ha accolto in 100mila la squadra di basket che ha vinto l'Eurolega a Berlino al termine di una final four alla quale era qualificato anche l'Olympiacos. Le due tifoserie ateniesi sono state protagoniste di feroci scontri, con feriti, in Germania. Una combinazione di fattori, insomma, che ha fatto sì che le misure di sicurezza siano state elevate al massimo possibile. (ANSA).",

        "content": "The weather bureau PAGASA's latest track and intensity forecast of Typhoon Aghon (international name: Ewiniar) shows that it has maintained its strength as it accelerates northeastward away from Luzon. As of 10:00 AM, its center was estimated at 455 kilometers east of Aparri, Cagayan, moving northeastward at a 20-kilometer per hour (km/h) pace. 'Aghon' recorded maximum sustained winds of 130 km/h near the center, gustiness of up to 160 km/h, and a central pressure of 970 hectoPascals (hPa). A warning of strong to typhoon-force winds remains, which may extend outwards up to 280 km from the center. As of this writing, no tropical cyclone wind signal has been hoisted. Heavy rainfall outlook PAGASA said Typhoon Aghon is unlikely to directly bring a significant amount of rainfall within the next three days. However, the southwesterly windflow will bring moderate to heavy rains over Western Visayas and the western portions of Northern, Central, and Southern Luzon in the next three days. Track and intensity outlook 'Aghon' is seen to move generally northeastward over the Philippine Sea for the entirety of the forecast period and will likely maintain its strength until Wednesday. PAGASA noted that there is a possibility of a short period of intensification in the next 12 hours. Moreover, 'Aghon' is expected to start waning Wednesday afternoon as it begins to interact with the mid-latitude environment and undergo a post-tropical transition, yet an earlier weakening trend is not ruled out, PAGASA clarified. 'Aghon' is expected to leave the Philippine Area of Responsibility on Wednesday afternoon or evening.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: About 27 lakh complaints of cyber frauds were registered in the country in the last one year and an increasing number of such cases are getting detected due to enhanced vigil, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said. Shah also said that 99.5 per cent police stations in the country are now connected with a central government network (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems or CCTNS ) for the purpose of investigation, data analytics, research, policy making and providing services to citizens. \"About 27 lakh complaints of cyber frauds were registered in the country in last one year,\" he told PTI in an interview over the weekend. The home minister said earlier there was no system to go after cyber frauds but now a toll free number is available for the general public to register their complaints. \"We have made provisions for accounts to freeze. People started registering complaints and within seconds, accounts get frozen (when there is a case of cyber fraud),\" he said. Asked whether cyber fraud cases have gone up in the country, Shah said cases have not gone up but \"frauds are getting detected now. We have also made available a toll free number. That's why it is getting highlighted\". Due to successful resolution of such complaints, people have been calling on that number, he said. Last week, CEO of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) Rajesh Kumar had said that Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and a few other South East Asian countries have become hub of trans-national organised gangs which are increasingly carrying out cyber crimes like financial frauds, digital arrests and ATM card scamming in India. The cyber fraud cases are mostly handled by the I4C, which is a wing under the cyber and information security division of the Union Home Ministry. It is mandated to tackle the burgeoning cyber crimes and attacks in the country in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. The I4C has been \"continuously monitoring and blocking\" cyber crime infrastructure like Skype accounts, advertisements on Google and Meta, SMS headers, SIM cards, bank accounts etc, another official said. Referring to the CCTNS, the home minister said the government has made efforts to bring all police stations under the network for the convenience of policing in the country. \"It is almost complete. About 99.5 per cent police stations are now connected with the network. Just 0.5 per cent are left. That is because of connectivity issues. The police stations which are left out may be located in very interior areas, on a hill top or in a jungle,\" he said. The project was started in 2009. It aims to interlink all police stations under a common application software for the purpose of investigation, data analytics, research, policy making and providing citizen services such as reporting and tracking of complaints, request for antecedent verifications by police etc. The project is being implemented in close collaboration between states and the Centre.",

        "description": "¿Los atletas de élite viven menos o es un mito? Un nuevo estudio determina cómo impacta la actividad física de alta intensidad en la longevidad",
        "content": "Aunque todo el mundo sabe que hacer ejercicio con regularidad es importante para llevar una vida sana, algunos estudios han demostrado que hacer demasiado ejercicio puede tener el efecto contrario. Muchas veces escuchamos que los deportistas de élites tienen peor salud y viven menos por abusar de la actividad física. Incluso que hacer ejercicio de alta intensidad puede ser contraproducente en general, sin reparar en individualidades. Pero ¿es eso cierto? ¿Los atletas de élite viven menos o es un mito? ¿Cómo impacta ejercicio intenso en nuestra longevidad? Un nuevo estudio, publicado recientemente en el British Journal of Sports Medicine , sugiere que las personas que practican ejercicio extremo pueden vivir más tiempo . «En la comunidad existe la obstinada opinión de que se puede hacer demasiado ejercicio », reconoce el doctor André la Gerche, cardiólogo deportivo, director del Laboratorio de Ensayos sobre Corazón, Ejercicio e Investigación (HEART) —respaldado por el Instituto de Investigación Médica St. Vincent y el Instituto de Investigación Cardiaca Victor Chang—, y autor principal de este estudio. «Pensamos que esta creencia era una oportunidad de oro para estudiar una hazaña que, en su momento, se consideró imposible y que podría estresar al organismo más allá de sus límites: recorrer una milla en menos de cuatro minutos», explica. A pesar de que un buen número de personas lo logra, bajar de cuatro minutos al hacer 1.609 metros en pista continúa siendo un reto para muchos corredores y corredoras. «Se especulaba con que intentar tales esfuerzos podría tener un efecto perjudicial en el cuerpo, por lo que era una oportunidad para abordar esta falacia». Así pues, los investigadores hicieron un seguimiento de un selecto grupo de 200 corredores de élite capaces de correr una milla por debajo de los 4 minutos. Procedían de 28 países de Norteamérica, Europa, Oceanía y África. Todos habían nacido entre 1928 y 1955, y tenían una media de 23 años cuando corrieron una milla en menos de 4 minutos. De los 200 participantes, el 30% habían fallecido, por lo que 140 seguían vivos en el momento del estudio . Los investigadores descubrieron que la edad media de fallecimiento de todos los participantes en el estudio era de 73 años, pero que la edad media de los corredores de élite supervivientes era de 77 años. Es decir, los corredores de élite podrían vivir una media de cinco años más que la población general. Y esto, en función de su esperanza de vida prevista en función de la edad, el sexo, el año de nacimiento y la nacionalidad. Así, los que corrieron una milla en menos de 4 minutos durante la década de 1950 vivieron una media de nueve años más que la población general. Los participantes que lo consiguieron en la década de 1960 vivieron unos 5,5 años más, y en la década de 1970 unos 3 años más. El doctor la Gerche afirma que no les sorprendieron estos hallazgos en relación con los corredores de élite, ya que coinciden con otras publicaciones, como la de los ciclistas del Tour de Francia , en los que se ha observado una mayor longevidad. «Nuestro estudio se propuso ver cómo afectaba el ejercicio a los atletas de élite a largo plazo», garantiza. «Sabemos que los deportistas de élite tienen el corazón más grande debido a su esfuerzo aeróbico sostenido. Existía la creencia de que esto podría afectar a su salud y longevidad, pero descubrimos lo contrario», sostiene. «Cinco años de vida extra en comparación con la media es muy significativo, sobre todo cuando comprobamos que muchos de estos corredores no sólo disfrutaban de una vida larga, sino que además estaban sanos. Viven mejor, durante más tiempo», añade. Por supuesto, no todas las personas pueden correr una milla por debajo de los 4 minutos o ser un atleta de élite. Entonces, ¿ cómo puede la población general aplicar estos hallazgos a su propio régimen de ejercicio para, con suerte, alargar su vida ? «Aunque en la ciencia se nos dice que no debemos extrapolar, personalmente uso estos datos como una aspiración para intentar emular tantos factores de estilo de vida de un corredor de 4 minutos: buena dieta, consumo moderado de alcohol , dedicación y ejercicio regular e intenso», afirma la Gerche. «Aunque no puedo compartir necesariamente la predisposición genética que, probablemente, también contribuye a la velocidad de élite, el resto puedo intentar conseguirlo». Así pues, los resultados de este estudio demuestran que este nivel de forma física en una etapa temprana de la vida está relacionado con la longevidad. Al margen de sus limitaciones, es otra prueba más de la importancia del ejercicio , sea cual sea su nivel de intensidad. En general, la actividad física se relaciona con mejoras de la salud cardiovascular y es de esperar que extienda la vida.",

        "content": "Nella giornata di ieri in casa Spezia è andato in scena un colloquio, durato circa tre ore, fra il tecnico Luca D’Angelo e il capo dell’area tecnica Eduardo Macia senza altri dirigenti - i due amministratori delegati Andrea Gazzoli e Nicolò Peri – presenti, per discutere del futuro e trovare i punti d’incontro per proseguire assieme l’avventura all’indomani della salvezza che ha fatto scattare la clausola per il rinnovo automatico dell’allenatore che però vuole garanzie per proseguire l’avventura in Liguria. Lo riporta Il Secolo XIX in edicola sottolineando come solo se si troverà una convergenza di idee sia sui calciatori presenti in rosa sia sul mercato, sulla falsariga di quanto accaduto a gennaio, ci potrà essere la certezza della permanenza di D’Angelo caldeggiata dalla tifoseria. Serviranno però altri incontri dopo quello di ieri con Macia che sa di non potersi permettere, essendo ancora nel mirino della piazza, di perdere quello che sarebbe il punto di partenza principale della prossima stagione. Lo Spezia sembra infatti disponibile a dire sì alla proposta di un biennale con una serie di bonus per trattenere il tecnico abruzzese che chiede una certa autonomia gestionale sul mercato, vorrebbe trattare in prima persona un paio di giocatori che segue da tempo, e sulle scelte di chi trattenere - con il riscatto di Nagy dal Pisa come priorità - e chi lasciare partire e la necessità di una prima punta di peso da inserire in rosa. Oggi potrebbe essere il giorno di Michelangelo Minieri , il procuratore a cui si affida D’Angelo, di far visita alla sede dello Spezia con il quadro che dovrebbe essere chiaro già al termine di questa serttimana.",

        "description": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Aquaman might not mind if the oceans rise, but moviegoers might.",
        "content": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Aquaman might not mind if the oceans rise, but moviegoers might. That's one of the takeaways from a new study conducted by researchers who set out to determine if today's Hollywood blockbusters are reflective of the current climate crisis . The vast majority of movies failed the “climate reality check” proposed by the authors, who surveyed 250 movies from 2013 to 2022. The test is simple — the authors looked to see if a movie presented a story in which climate change exists, and whether a character knows it does. One film that passed the test was the 2017 superhero movie Justice League, in which Jason Momoa's Aquaman character says, “Hey, I don't mind if the oceans rise” to Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne. But most movies fell short — fewer than 10% of the 250 films passed, and climate change was mentioned in two or more scenes of fewer than 4% of the films. That's out of touch with a moviegoing public that wants “to see their reality reflected on screen,” said Colby College English professor Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, lead researcher on the study. “The top line is just that the vast majority of films, popular films produced over the last 10 years in the United States, are not portraying the world as it is,” Schneider-Mayerson said. “They are portraying a world that is now history or fantasy — a world in which climate change is not happening.” Researchers at Maine's Colby College published the study in April along with Good Energy, a Los Angeles-based environmental consultancy. The results were peer reviewed, and the authors are seeking publication in scientific journals. The researchers view the test as a way for audience members, writers and filmmakers to evaluate the representation of climate change on screen. Some results were surprising. Movies that at first glance appear to have little overlap with climate or the environment passed the test. Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach's emotive 2019 drama about the collapse of a relationship, passed the test in part because Adam Driver's character is described as “energy conscious,” Schneider-Mayerson said. The 2022 whodunnit Glass Onion and the 2019 folk horror movie Midsommar were others to pass the test. Some that were more explicitly about climate change, such as the 2021 satire Don't Look Up, also passed. But San Andreas, a 2015 movie about a West Coast earthquake disaster, and The Meg, a 2018 action movie set in the ocean, did not. The authors narrowed the selection of movies by excluding films not set on Earth or set before 2006 or after 2100. They found streaming services had a higher percentage of movies that included climate change than the major studios did. The study is “valuable for marketing purposes, informational purposes, data accumulation,” said Harry Winer, director of sustainability at the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Winer, who was not involved in the study, said it could also help serve as an incentive to connect audiences with climate stories. “The audience will be more open to hearing a dialogue about what is right and what is wrong,” Winer said. “It's a conversation starter.” The study authors said they see the climate reality check as a kind of Bechdel-Wallace test for climate change. Alison Bechdel, a cartoonist, is credited with popularizing that test in the 1980s by incorporating her friend Liz Wallace's test about gender representation in film into a comic strip. The test asks if a movie includes at least two female characters who have a conversation about something other than a man. Bechdel herself spoke highly of the study's climate test, which she described as “long overdue” in a social media post during this year's Academy Awards season. Bechdel said in an e-mail to The Associated Press that “for a movie set in the present to ignore this existential threat just doesn't make sense anymore\" in the age of climate change. “I do worry that screenwriters might do it in a kind of rote way, which could be counterproductive, just like rote ‘strong female characters’ are,\" Bechdel said. \"But injecting an awareness of our communal plight into the stories we ingest seems like a no-brainer.” Patrick Whittle, The Associated Press",

In a video statement posted on Instagram on Monday night, May 27, Palad detailed what went down during the 72nd FAMAS. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sheena Lee Palad (@sheenaleesp) It can be recalled that Darren’s son, Fernando de la Pena, lambasted the award-giving body after his mother never got to go up on stage despite being told that she would present an award alongside Tirso Cruz III. Instead, Cruz was accompanied by an “[up-and-coming] singer,” who had turned out to be Palad. Palad said she was originally just tapped by the organizers to sing during the dinner proper. After her performance, she said she changed into her second outfit and headed backstage. She then said that she was approached by a staff member who asked her to present an award together with Cruz. “ Sabi [ng staff] (The staff said), ‘Sheena, can we ask a big favor from you?’ Sabi ko (I said), ‘Yes, what’s that?’ Sabi niya (They said), ‘Can you present the award?’ Sabi ko (I said), ‘Okay, sige, sige (sure, sure) no problem,'” Palad recounted. Palad also said that she did not know Darren was supposed to present the award. The young singer recalled that she had been so nervous during her stint as presenter that she had even mispronounced the name of the late German Moreno, reiterating that the slip-up was due to the engagement being arranged at the last minute. She said that she also did not have the chance to go over the script before getting on stage. Palad added she was instructed to proceed to the side of the stage, where she would accompany Cruz to present the award. “I was just following instructions. ‘Yun lang. I hope that you are enlightened with the situation,” Palad said. “She’s totally innocent. She was just following instructions. She was just doing her job,” added Palad’s partner Johann Enriquez, who was a host at the awards night’s main stage. Palad also said because of the fiasco that night, she has been bashed online. “I am being harassed, maligned, called names a nd thrown offensive accusations today online and ALL I CAN SAY IS... Buti na lang may Lord Jesus Christ ako sa buhay ko. Honestly, [h]indi ko kaya ‘to! (Good thing I have Lord Jesus Christ in my life. Honestly, I can’t do this!) It’s also a lesson for everybody to not QUICKLY judge a person. And makes me think too that what I’m going through doesn’t even come close to what my Savior had to go through when He suffered and died on the cross for me,” Palad captioned the post. Palad’s statement comes after FAMAS issued a public apology to Darren on Monday, May 27, where the organization claimed that they replaced Darren as a presenter after they supposedly were unable to locate her. – Rappler.com",

        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel and Jan M.

        "content": "After more than a year of deliberation, a task force dedicated to data protection within the (EU) has presented its initial findings on how its data protection rules apply to OpenAI's popular chatbot, . The task force report's key takeaway is that crucial legal matters, such as the fairness and lawfulness of OpenAI's data processing, are still under consideration, leaving decisions pending. Addressing this matter is crucial because penalties for proven breaches of the bloc's privacy regulations could amount to as much as 4% of the company's global annual revenue. According to , regulatory authorities also have the authority to halt any non-compliant data processing activities. Consequently, potentially faces significant regulatory challenges within the region, especially since specific laws governing AI are still scarce, and even within the EU, full implementation is years away. In the absence of clear guidance from EU data protection authorities regarding the application of existing data protection laws to ChatGPT, OpenAI is likely to maintain its regular operations with confidence. Despite facing increasing complaints alleging violations of different aspects of the bloc's , the company is poised to proceed as usual. In a recent development, Poland's data protection authority (DPA) initiated an investigation based on a complaint regarding the chatbot's fabrication of information about an individual and its refusal to rectify the inaccuracies. Similarly, Austria has also recently received a comparable complaint. ChatGPT's operations resumed in Italy after OpenAI implemented alterations to the information and user controls, as requested by the DPA. However, the Italian inquiry into the chatbot, addressing critical matters such as the legal grounds asserted by OpenAI for data processing to train its AI models, remains ongoing. The tool remains entangled in legal uncertainty within the EU. The Irish regulatory body has been recognized for its lenient stance toward enforcing the GDPR on major technology companies. It suggests that \"Big AI\" entities could potentially be the next beneficiaries of Dublin's favorable interpretation of the EU's The GDPR is applicable whenever personal data is gathered and handled, a task that large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT, the AI architecture powering ChatGPT, undeniably perform on a massive scale. They achieve this by extracting data from the public internet for model training, including extracting individuals' posts from social media platforms. Furthermore, the EU regulation grants DPAs the authority to compel the cessation of any processing that fails to comply. Should GDPR enforcers decide to exercise this authority, it could serve as a potent tool in shaping the operational landscape of the AI powerhouse behind ChatGPT within the region.",

        "description": "Пострадалата е се е възстановила напълно, тъй като останали трайни увреждания, които ѝ причинявали болка и до днес",
        "content": "Столичната община е осъдена да плати над 80 000 лева обезщетения на тежко пострадала жена, която се е спънала в стърчащи от тротоара, необезопасени и трудно видими болтове, предназначени за монтаж на кофа за боклук до трамвайна спирка. Новината съобщи правният сайт lex.bg . Инцидентът станал в началото на миналата година на спирка \"Лагера\" в посока пазар \"Красно село\" и при падането жената е счупила китките на двете си ръце и тазобедрената става на левия крак. Лечението ѝ продължило много дълго, като четири месеца била обездвижена и на легло, с много силни болки в първия месец, а още два месеца се придвижвала само с придружител. В крайна сметка жената не се възстановила напълно, тъй като останали трайни увреждания, които ѝ причинявали болка и до днес . Затова тя е завела в Софийския градски съд (СГС) иск срещу общината, като е поискала обезщетение от 80 000 лева за причинените ѝ неимуществени вреди заради необезопасените и стърчащи болтове до спирката, както и още над 3000 лева, които е платила за лечение. Показания по делото са дали съпругът ѝ и нейна позната, която работела до мястото на инцидента. Мъжът разказал, че изпратил съпругата си до спирката, за да отиде да си извади карта. След това тя му се обадила и той заявява, че заварил \"труп на земята\". Веднага я закарал в \"Пирогов\", където останала 10 дни, през които, а и след това, той трябвало да я храни и да ѝ помага в обслужването. Подобрението ѝ започнало едва след наемането на рехабилитатор, който я посещавал 30 пъти, а за всяко посещение му плащали по 50 лева. Съдът е назначил и съдебномедицинска експертиза, според която последиците от уврежданията няма да отшумят напълно и причиняват болки в китките на пострадалата и до днес. Освен това някои от движения ѝ са ограничени и тя трябва да живее с белези от операциите. От общината са оспорили иска с мотив, че жената не внимавала и така е съпричинила инцидента. Аргументът обаче е отхвърлен от съда, който казва, че пешеходците са длъжни да се грижат за собствената си безопасност, но при положение, че няма нечие друго неизпълнение и в случая недоглеждането е на общината, а не на пострадалата. \"Не се предполага, че по тротоарите има стърчащи остатъци от други съоръжения, пешеходците не са длъжни да ги познават и да се съобразяват с тях. Естествено, ако такова несъвършенство се констатира, всеки би го заобиколил, но при инцидент, отговорността е на общината... Въвеждането в експлоатация, без да е взето под внимание лошото изпълнение (т.е. става въпрос за недоглеждане на представляващия общината), не може да ползва ответника, а и по никакъв начин не обвързва ищеца (никой не може да се позовова на собствената си недобросъвестност - nemo auditor turpitudinem suam allegans)\", се казва в решението на съдия Стефан Шекерджийски, който решава, че е справедливо да уважи изцяло иска на пострадалата, а общината е осъдена да плати допълнително 10 000 лева разноски. Решението не е окончателно и може да бъде обжалвано пред Софийския апелативен съд.",

        "content": "PATI ang baguhang singer na Sheena Palad ay nadamay sa galit ng mga netizens sa pambabastos umano ng FAMAS sa veteran actress na si Eva Darren . Si Sheena ang ipinalit sa beteranang aktres para mag-present ng isang kategorya sa naganap na 72nd FAMAS Awards Night nitong nagdaang Linggo matapos ngang magkaaberya sa event. Hanggang ngayon ay mainit pa ring pinag-uusapan sa buong showbiz industry at sa social media ang nagawang sablay ng FAMAS organizers kay Eva Darren. Marami ang kumampi at nakisimpatya sa veteran star nang maglabas ng hinaing ang anak nitong si Fernando de la Pena matapos ang pambabalewala at pambabastos na naranasan umano ng kanyang ina mula sa naganap na awards night. Baka Bet Mo: FAMAS nag-sorry kay Eva Darren matapos magreklamo ang anak Nag-sorry na ang FAMAS kay Eva Darren at sa pamilya nito at tinanggap naman ng anak ng aktres ang public apology ng mga taong nasa likod ng nasabing award-giving body. Pero sa gitna nga ng isyung ito, nadamay din sa pambabatikos ng netizens ang newcomer na singer na si Sheena Palad na kung tutuusin ay wala naman daw talagang kasalanan sa nangyari. Sa mga hindi pa masyadong nakakakilala kay Sheena, siya ang nakababatang kapatid ni Felson Palad, ang asawa ni Donita Rose. Isa siya sa mga grand finalist sa “Tanghalan ng Kampeon” ng Kapuso show na “TiktoClock”. Napanood din siya noon sa talent search ng “Eat Bulaga” na “Bida Next.” Dahil sa natatanggap na batikos, napilitan na ring magsalita si Sheena sa pamamagitan ng isang video na in-upload sa Facebook at Instagram. Mapapanood din sa video si Johann Enriquez, ang boyfriend ni Sheena na isa sa mga naging host ng 72nd FAMAS Awards. Paliwanag ni Sheena, “Just to clear the story lang po siguro, because I’ve been receiving messages and also before anything else, I would like to say thank you to my friends and family who messaged me directly and asked me about the situation, what I am feeling right now. “Salamat po sa inyo. Actually, du’n ako naiiyak, e, kasi nakikita ko yung mga kaibigan ko talaga na talagang caring sa career ko, sa life ko, sa journey ko,” aniya pa. Pagpapatuloy pa niya, “I was chosen. I was called by the organizers to perform for the dinner pleasure. “Yun po yung una, so the dinner pleasure is the entertainment for the dinner time. So I sang two songs nung time po na yun. “And that’s what I’m wearing, the yellow dress. So what happened was, eto na po, nagpalit na po ako ng damit. Nagpalit na po ako, second na damit ko na, kulay itim, glitz and glamour,” sabi ng singer. “And then, dumating po ako doon, naka-standby po kami. Tapos po, nung naka-standby po kami, we were called earlier sa backstage, kami pong tatlo (ng hosts). “And then, nung naka-standby, nakaupo po ako, pinuntahan po ako ng staff. Nu’ng pinuntahan po ako ng staff, sabi niya, ‘Sheena, can we ask a big favor from you?’ “Sabi ko, ‘Yes, what’s that?’ Tapos sabi niya, ‘Can you present the awards?’ Sabi ko, ‘Okay, sige, sige, no problem.’ “That’s it. Yun lang po yung alam ko, at hindi ko po alam na si Miss Eva yung magpe-present po,” paliwanag pa niya. Dagdag pang explanation ni Sheena, “Actually, nu’ng time na yun, I was clueless. Hindi po kasi ako nanonood nung awards night because I was in the holding area, so hindi ko po alam kung paano mag-present. “And if you’re gonna be reviewing the videos, nakakatawa pa nga, we were laughing about it because I mispronounced the name of Kuya Germs. German Moreno, which I said na sa sobrang kaba ko ang nasabi ko, Jerman Moreno. “Siguro yun yung isa sa mga pinakakabado, e, magbabasa lang naman ako, kasi nga I was not prepared. Hindi ko man lang po nabasa yung script. As in, wala po talaga,” aniya. Hindi raw niya magets kung bakit pati siya ay inaaway ng netizens, “Kasi before the production, bumaba na po yung dating presenter, kami na po yung sumunod. “Ang instruction lang po sa akin is, ‘Sheena, you’re gonna present after you sing the production number. So, sabi ko, ‘Okay po, sige po.’ “So sabi niya, ‘Once you’re done with the production, punta ka na du’n sa gilid and Sir Tirso will be with you.’ So, sabi ko naman, ‘Okay, sige po, yun lang. So I was just following instructions,” sabi pa ni Sheena. Ito naman ang mensahe niya sa isyung kanyang kinasasangkutan, “I hope that you are enlightened with the situation. Sana nasagot namin ang lahat ng tanong ninyo. Thank you, guys.”",

        "description": "George Fenlon, 23, died three months after being attacked on a night out. His partner was heavily pregnant at the time of the attack and gave birth to their daughter just weeks before he died",
        "content": "A heartbreaking last photo shows a new dad meeting his baby daughter for the first time in hospital just before his life support machine was turned off. George Fenlon, 23, died three months after being attacked on a night out in Blackpool, Lancashire. His partner Beth Turner, 23, was heavily pregnant at the time of the attack and gave birth to their daughter - named Clara Georgia after her dad - just two weeks before he died. While he never regained consciousness, he was able to meet his daughter in hospital and George's heartbroken mum Melissa captured the touching moment. Melissa, 53, said: \"Looking back now, I'm not sure how we all got through it, the range of emotions we had to go through was horrendous. \"Beth wanted Clara to meet George and have a little bit of time with him so she had a C-section and she had a couple of weeks in hospital with him where she saw him everyday. It was important that she did that because we've got memories, we've got pictures. The hospital did a lot, we've also got little prints of Clara's and George's hands together.\" George Fenlon, 23, with partner Beth ( Image: Melissa Fenlon/SWNS) Police were called at around 2am on August 15 last year to a report of an assault at The Strand in Blackpool. They found George, a bartender at Revolution Bar, had suffered serious head injuries. He was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital and put on a life support machine but tragically died in hospital on November 22. An inquest opening heard George collapsed and lost consciousness after the attack. A post-mortem found his cause of death was complications of blunt head trauma. Rhys Jones, 26, of Cannock, Staffs, has been charged with murder and will stand trial in June. Melissa said of the ordeal: \"We were all in shock, we weren't sure what was happening. \"It was one of his friends who phoned, he said something had happened but no one was sure what. Then we heard George had gone to Royal Preston Hospital and we didn't know why but when we got more information, we found out he had a serious head injury so Preston was the best place for him. \"His girlfriend was six or seven months pregnant at that time so we were all just in shock and when we saw him it was pretty horrific.\" Six months after his death, Melissa is now hoping to create a lasting legacy for her 'fun-loving' son. She has organised a fundraising event in July called 'The Fenlon Football Funday' in Stanley Park in the resort, featuring a football tournament and kids entertainment. George Fenlon with mum Melissa when he was a child ( Image: Melissa Fenlon/SWNS) Melissa said of George: \"He just wanted to make people laugh, he was a fun loving guy and very easy going, nothing really fazed him to be honest. Clara's favourite TV show is Teletubbies and he was like a big Teletubby I suppose, just daft and it's sad that Clara will never experience that. So the fun day is for Clara and all of George's friends, to keep his memory alive. \"George was just so popular that it'll be nice for the youngsters of Blackpool not to be sad, but instead remember George through Clara. If it's a success this year, I'm hoping it will be an annual event. It's just what George was, he was a fun loving guy who loved his football, so it's what George would have wanted - for everyone to have a nice day.\" Revolution Bar, where George worked, are continuing the celebrations in the evening and will be creating a cocktail in his name. All proceeds will go towards Elliot's place, a local charity dedicated to supporting young men with their mental health and well being. Melissa added: \"George's friends have been struggling with his loss so the charity just spoke to me, it made sense.\"",

        "content": "In a significant development, contract negotiations between the governments of India and France in the over Rs 50,000 crore deal for 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets is scheduled to begin on May 30 with the arrival of a high-level French team here. The French side would meet with Indian Defence Ministry counterparts to begin official negotiations in the fighter jet deal for the Indian Navy under which aircraft would be operated from both aircraft carriers operated by the force, defence industry officials told ANI. The French team will include officials from their defence ministry and industry including original equipment manufacturers Dassault Aviation and Thales, the officials said. The Indian side would include members from the defence acquisition wing and the Indian Navy. Sources in the government said that they would try to complete negotiations with France and sign the agreement by the end of this financial year. France had submitted its response to India’s tender for buying 26 Rafale Marine jets for the Indian Navy’s aircraft carriers – INS Vikrant and INS Vikramaditya in December itself. The response to India’s Letter of Acceptance had been submitted by France in New Delhi. The Indian side has carried out a detailed study of the French bid for the Indian deal including the commercial offer or price for the aircraft, along with other details of the contract, they said. India will now go in for tough negotiations in the deal with French government officials, as it is a government-to-government contract. The Navy Chief has directed his team to ensure that the timeframe required for the project is squeezed significantly to ensure early finalisation and induction of the planes in the inventory.",

        "description": "The Biden administration is unveiling a framework for using carbon offsets to drive climate progress, with principles it says are meant to help ensure the trading regimes deliver real emissions reductions — not a green mirage.",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — The Biden administration is unveiling a framework for using carbon offsets to drive climate progress, with principles it says are meant to help ensure the trading regimes deliver real emissions reductions — not a green mirage. The documents being released Tuesday by top cabinet officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, take the controversial step of recommending that companies be able to use carbon credits to offset a portion of their so-called Scope 3 emissions, those generated by their suppliers and customers. In other respects, the guidelines largely align with those developed by prominent industry-led governance bodies. They amount to an endorsement of voluntary carbon markets’ potential to create economic opportunities for farmers and ranchers while helping reduce planet-warming pollution, despite the controversies the systems have sparked in the past. “Voluntary carbon markets can help unlock the power of private markets to reduce emissions, but that can only happen if we address significant existing challenges,” Yellen said. The new US guidelines, detailed in a 12-page joint policy statement and outline of principles, target the trading of credits that are meant to represent a ton of carbon dioxide reduced or removed from the atmosphere. Companies, not-for-profit groups and others can buy the credits — which help finance carbon-reducing but non-lucrative initiatives such as planting trees — as a way to compensate for their own emissions. However, their use has been criticized because some crediting methodologies haven’t fulfilled carbon-cutting claims. Fixing that deficiency is seen as critical to assuring corporations seeking to trim their own emissions and meet sustainability goals. The US government principles “will give confidence to businesses that the rules of the carbon market promote best practice in the use and sourcing of high-integrity, project-based carbon credits,” said Chris Leeds, head of carbon markets development at Standard Chartered. “The guardrails that govern project-based carbon credits are moving closer towards being mandatory.” The market for offsets could soar to $1 trillion by 2050, from about $2 billion currently, if standard-setters ease some rules and expand their use, BloombergNEF forecasts. “We need that finance, and we need those solutions,” said Nat Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. But “we only want that kind of scale if it represents real environmental integrity on both the supply and demand sides.” Ensuring the offsets truly compensate for pollution is a particular challenge, since carbon dioxide pollution persists in the atmosphere for centuries. The activities that underpin most credits today often lack that same longevity. For instance, trees that suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can burn, die or be cut down. Other options — such as injecting carbon dioxide into deep underground rock formations — could offer longer-term promise. The US government envisions the finance sector offering a solution. Insurance mechanisms such as buffer pools and other financial tools can help address permanence shortcomings, said senior administration officials who spoke anonymously to provide key details ahead of the announcement. The government is looking to enable innovation, they said. Read More: Insurers Are Working to Shore Up $2 Billion Carbon Offset Market The US government is recommending carbon credits simply meet their longevity claims, not a specific time frame. That’s a departure from standards developed by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, which sets a minimum threshold of 40 years and could expand that to 100 years. While offsets frequently channel capital to nature-based projects today, under the US vision, they would increasingly support more innovative carbon-removal ventures, such as direct air capture. The US framework insists credit buyers should prioritize making “measurable and feasible emission reductions within their own value chains” and that the offsets should be a complement, not a replacement, for that work. But in cases where it’s “unreasonable” to expect companies to be able to fully abate their supply chain emissions within a given time frame, the use of offsets should be considered, the US says. The United Nations-backed Science Based Targets initiative, the world’s leading arbiter of corporate net-zero plans, has drawn scrutiny for plans to relax restrictions and give companies greater leeway to use carbon credits to offset their Scope 3 emissions. The Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative has proposed a similar approach.",

Both parties decide to end the punch with a final blow. However, Jo pulls out at the last second, wishing he had fought Choji when he started acting out. Jo surrenders, which annoys Sakura even more as he wants to end the fight fairly. Choji gets up on stage and praises Sakura, urging Umemiya to come forward. Togame tries to talk with Choji, but the latter kicks him away. Sakura tries to hit Choji but is blocked by Umemiya. The match starts with him showing off his athleticism and taking the fight to Umemiya. However, Umemiya overpowers him and tells him he won’t lose.

        "content": "Wunderschöne Landschaften, Höhlen und Wasserfälle: in Bayern gibt es zahlreiche Naturwunder und Ausflugsmöglichkeiten zu entdecken. Wie gut kennen Sie sich mit dem Bundesland aus? Wissen Sie, wie diese Orte heißen? Woher stammt der Begriff \"Quiz\"? Das Wort \"Quiz\" stammt aus dem Englischen. Zu der genauen Herkunft des Wortes gibt es unterschiedliche Theorien. Eine eher unwahrscheinliche Theorie geht auf den irischen Theaterdirektor Richard Daly zurück. Dieser soll gewettet haben, der englischen Sprache ein neues Wort hinzufügen zu können und erfand das Wort \"Quiz\". Eine wahrscheinlichere Theorie vermutet, dass der Begriff von der lateinischen Frage \"Qui es?\" (zu Deutsch: \"Wer bist du?\") abstammt. Die wohl gängigste Theorie besagt, dass \"Quiz\" eine Abkürzung des englischen Wortes \"question\" (zu Deutsch: \"Frage\") ist.

        "description": "Marcus Smith plans to stay in Ukraine 'indefinitely' after his friend was killed in a drone strike.",
        "content": "A British volunteer walked more than 300 kilometres to fight for Ukraine after a close friend serving in the country’s military was killed by Russian forces. Marcus Smith had been in Spain learning the country’s language when he received the devastating news that the soldier had died in a drone strike. The 32-year-old cut his long curly hair and flew from Barcelona to Budapest before spending eight days walking to the Ukrainian border after his money ran out. The recruit, from Manchester, was then helped by a Ukrainian border guard to cross by train from Záhony in Hungary to the city of Chop in the western Zakarpattia Oblast. He told Metro.co.uk: ‘I had a really close friend out here in Ukraine. ‘We used to play video games, hang out online a lot and always talk. ‘He used to tell me about his family. His mother rang me and told me about the drone attack, it made me very angry.’ Marcus, who was born in Blackburn, is currently in Uzhhorod, a city in western Ukraine, where he has enlisted and is undergoing military training so he can take arms against Vladimir Putin ’s invasion forces. ‘I’m going to join the military indefinitely,’ he said. ‘I’m looking for a lifelong career. I believe that it would be more beneficial for me to put my heart, mind and soul into something I am very passionate about. I’m disgusted by what I’m hearing about this war, so I’m doing my best to train, be the best of the best, and hopefully we can end this war.’ The Mancunian said he is a professional hunter who has experience of living in mountains and surviving difficult conditions. Between the ages of 14 and 17 he gained some military experience at a boarding school in the UK. The volunteer described himself as having no family but regarding his friends as his family. ‘I believe the skills I have will be useful in this war,’ he said. ‘I served in the cadets, which was a medical corps, and I was trained with assault rifles and received basic medical training provided by the British government. I’ve been trained with basic weapons in England and have earned a marksmanship badge. ‘I’m very proficient with some of these firearms. ‘Depending on where my talents are needed, I’m prepared to take on any position in the army.’ The would-be legionnaire believes that stopping Russian aggression in Ukraine is a matter of critical importance for the free world. ‘I grew up with stories about the devastation caused by World War One and World War Two in my country,’ he said. ‘It affects people, especially children. ‘I would like to live in a world where we are all at peace, but sadly, that is not the case at the moment, and there are conflicts happening on our planet that I would love to stop.’ Marcus plans to join the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine or the International Legion after medical checks and a training programme. His story was first revealed on Facebook by the Zakarpattia enlistment office, which said his 300km trek from Hungary had taken eight days, six hours, 36 minutes and 14 seconds. ‘I’ve just had my blood taken, my weight checked and a chest X-ray,’ Marcus told Metro.co.uk. ‘The doctors and nurses said that I’m in perfect condition, so the choice will be mine regarding which unit to select. ‘I am going to apply for the special forces, and if I don’t get through, I will then join the International Legion.’ British citizens who travel to Ukraine to fight could be prosecuted when they return, according to UK government travel advice. The stance contrasts with the backing given by Liz Truss to those wanting to take up arms with the embattled nation when she was foreign secretary, although she later distanced herself from the comments. Guidance from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office states that ‘British nationals fighting in Ukraine have been killed or captured’. A number of UK nationals have become casualties or prisoners of war, including Aiden Aislen, who was sentenced to death after being captured while fighting for the Ukrainian marines in the siege of Mariupol. Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office has established the International Legion for foreign recruits, although others, including Brits, have joined various units in Kyiv’s military structure, including the Georgian National Legion. Around 20,000 foreigners were reported to have poured in to Ukraine to take up arms for the country in the months after Putin launched the unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022. Numbers are thought to have declined since but an unknown quota of British nationals are understood to be in frontline combat roles away from the media glare which accompanied recruits at the start of the war. Marcus insisted that he is in for the long haul. ‘I am joining the Ukrainian army indefinitely, and I never plan on leaving,’ he said. ‘I have so much respect for all the Ukrainian people who are sadly affected by this war, and I will fight for their freedom.’ The volunteer spoke as Russian forces continued their brutal ground and air offensive in the northern Kharkiv Oblast. The UK Ministry of Defence said that Putin has ‘currently not succeeded’ in his stated aim of creating a ‘buffer zone’ in the border region.

The US think-tank said the likely aim was to ‘fix and draw’ Kyiv’s forces and prepare for ‘offensive operations’ aiming to expand Moscow’s footprint in the north-eastern border region of Ukraine.

        "description": "As Nigeria joins the rest of the World to mark this year’s International Children’s Day, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Children of Africa Leadership and Values Development",
        "content": "As Nigeria joins the rest of the World to mark this year’s International Children’s Day, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Children of Africa Leadership and Values Development Initiative(CALDEV) have expressed willingness to work together to ensure that the rights of Nigerian children are adequately protected. The two organisations made this known when a delegation of CALDEV officials and school children paid a courtesy visit to the headquarters of NHRC on Monday in Abuja. Hon. Bamidele Salam, Founder and President of CALDEV, who led the delegation, said the visit was part of stakeholder’s engagement to rally support for the rights of Nigerian children as they mark the International Children’s Day. According to Salam, who represents Ede North,South/Egbedero/Ejigbo Federal Constituency of Osun State at the Federal House of Representatives, there is a gap on issues affecting children in Nigeria in spite of the Child Rights Act. “One of those gaps is the one that has to do with children’s rights to education, and it is sad that in the whole world, Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children today, according to UNICEF, about 17.5 million children do not have access to education. “Children in Nigeria that are involved in forced labor are over 15 million, according to the last statistics also by the UNICEF, and Children have been victims of violence in their homes, violence in schools, violence even in religious places, violence in several spaces, because there are inadequate measures to protect them from abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional trauma that children face. “These are just some of the issues that affect the Nigerian child, and I believe that an occasion like this should be used to drum up the awareness and ask for the intervention of government at all levels on addressing these problems. “So we are here today to further extend to you our hand of collaboration and readiness to work together with the National Human Rights Commission for the purpose of protecting the rights of Nigerian children, advancing their cause, and progressively removing Nigeria from this very odious record which we have obtained everywhere in the world. “Together we can raise awareness and initiate measures that will ensure that there are consequences for those who abuse the rights of children, because where there are no consequences, impunity is bound to continue,” he said. The CALDEV helmsman added that “If a child wants to take a legal action, he needs a guardian, through which he can take some legal action against those who infringe on his or her rights. “This is where we believe that the National Human Rights Commission should come in to ensure that we protect children and give them a very open space to air their views and to lodge complaints about those abuses that they suffer and those rights which are denied them”,he said. While presenting a formal proposal for a collaborative partnership with NHRC to the Executive Secretary, Salam said,” We are going to work together to ensure that Nigeria provides a very brighter future, a very guaranteed future for our youthful population.” In his remarks, Mr Tony Ojukwu, Executive Secretary/CEO of NHRC commended CALDEV for the initiative and expressed his goodwill to Nigerian Children on the celebration of their day. Ojukwu who was represented by Mr Harry Obe, Director in the Department of Economic,Social and Cultural Rights of NHR, said the commission had a department that was dedicated to issues of children and women. He therefore expressed the commission’s readiness to collaborate with CALDEV in protecting the rights of the Nigerian child. “We all agree that in our present-day generation and the circumstances that surround the world now, there is need for all of us to join hands and pay attention to value re-orientation, development of children, particularly if we must actually ensure that the world is preserved and that the value system that our fathers handed over to us is actually taken forward and better developed for the good of humanity. “The fact that children are vulnerable is not in doubt because of their age and circumstances they find themselves, they are subject to control and possible manipulation by older members of the society. “So there must be a dedicated effort like you have shown and then institutions like the NHRC must work with you to ensure that the children are protected from possible violations or abuses. “Our law envisages that we partner with civil society organisations, and for a civil society organisation that is focusing on a particular area that is within our mandate, we will work with you,” he said. Obe added that, “What we need to do is to, after now, set up a committee that will work together to draw the memorandum of understanding that will be signed between the organisation and the commission to ensure that we further protect and drive the objectives of the organisation.”",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Nigeria Air: Unfair to prosecute Sirika without Buhari – Aisha Yesufu Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Nigeria Air: Unfair to prosecute Sirika without Buhari – Aisha Yesufu Published on May 28, 2024 By Francis Ugwu Social activist Aisha Yesufu has suggested that former President Muhammadu Buhari should be prosecuted together with his ex-Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika. DAILY POST reports that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, had charged and arraigned the former minister alongside his daughter, Fatima, his son-in-law, Jalal Sule Hamma, and a firm – Al Buraq Global Investment Limited. The EFCC accused Sirika of conferring undue advantage on his brother and his company, Enginos Nigeria Limited. The contracts for which the sums were paid for were also said to be undone with no trace of work done to date. Yesterday, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, also described the controversial Nigeria Air unveiled by the Buhari-led administration as a fraud. He added that it remained suspended. The Minister noted that the ‘national carrier’ that was supposed to be an indigenous project and one that was supposed to spark hope for Nigerians, was flawed with a lot of secrecy and fraudulent activities. However, in a post on her X handle on Tuesday, Yesufu said it would amount to selective prosecution if Sirika is prosecuted alone. “Prosecuting Hadi Sirika without prosecuting Muhammadu Buhari is selective prosecution,” she wrote.

        "content": "A MASSIVE treasure hunt on the \"Holy Grail\" of all shipwrecks has finally got underway 300 years after it first sunk by using clever robot technology. The San Jose Galleon plunged over 3,000ft to the bottom of the Caribbean Sea in 1708 with some experts saying the entire value of the wreckage is incalculable. The recovery project is being done by the Colombian government alongside a set of underwater robots , says Colombia's Culture Minister Juan David Correa . He said the robots are being sent to extract items surrounding the shipwreck just off Cartagena, Colombia , to see \"how they materialise when they come out\". The state-of-the-art machines will work at a depth of 600m to extract materials \"without modifying or damaging the wreck,\" according to Correa. Although the robotic equipment will be submerged, it will be connected to a Navy ship that will use cameras to keep an extensive record of every movement. This is just the first stage of a project that is set to cost the government more than £3.5million. Dubbed a \"characterisation phase\" the bots will be deployed alongside remote sensors that generate images of the site. This imagery will then build up a thorough list of all of the archaeological material left on the seabed, the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History said. The next phases of the recovery mission will be dependent on the results from this initial stage but it is hoped experts will gain a greater understanding into how they can recover the remainder of the wreck. In English, the name of the project translates to “towards the heart of the San Jose galleon”. Correa described the expedition as \"unprecedented\". The site will also be labelled as a protected archaeological area meaning it will remain preserved due to its \"high scientific and heritage value\". It is set to be the biggest, most costly, and most complex recovery mission completed underwater of all time. Despite a number of sources debating the exact value of the sunken treasures, it is thought to be worth at least £12.5billion with some guesses catapulting the figure way past £20billion. Navy researcher Captain Alexandra Chadid explained that after three centuries of being submerged in the sea, most of the treasure would have undergone physical and chemical changes. Meaning the primary objective of the mission isn't just to recover the items but to do it safely with them all staying intact. The biggest fears are that due to the chemical differences the items may disintegrate when pulled out of the water. Back in 2017, the Colombian Navy sent a remotely operated vehicle to a depth of 3,100ft to assess the wreckage . Incredible images showed gold pieces, cannons and perfectly preserved Chinese porcelain cups scattered across the San Jose. Trinkets were seen twinkling under the light of the cameras as bronze cannons, swords, and clay vessels were spotted on the seafloor. Historians dubbed it the \"holy grail\" because it was carrying one of the largest amounts of treasure ever lost at sea. The San Jose was part of a fleet carrying jewels, precious metals and 11 million gold and silver coins from Spain’s South America colonies. The cargo was destined to help Spain’s King Philip V fund his war against Britain. But the British weren’t the only ones with their eyes on the galleons. Frequent voyages by Spanish treasure ships had led to a golden age of piracy — with raiders sinking more than 1,000 Spanish ships off the coast of Colombia during three centuries of colonial rule. The San José’s 600-strong crew knew the voyage would be fraught with danger. But they were barely 16 miles out when they were tracked down by English Commodore Charles Wager, in command of four British ships including HMS Expedition. Wager’s plan was to seize the San José, the largest ship in the fleet. But before it could be boarded, something went terribly wrong and the San José blew up. Writing in his log, Wager described an explosion so intense that he could feel the heat from his own ship. He wrote: “I believe the ship’s side blew out, for she caused a sea that came in our ports. “She immediately sank with all her riches.” Despite Colombia working on the ambitious mission to rescue the San Jose now, a fierce debate over who actually deserves the treasures on board has been ongoing for decades. Due to this insane amount of riches sitting untouched a legal battle over who has the rights to the treasure started up. A row between Spain , Bolivia and Colombia sparked fury over who owned the precious booty. Spain claimed it as theirs as the San Jose was one of their ships when it sunk. But Bolivia's indigenous Qhara Qhara nation believes it's theirs as they were forced to mine the precious metals on board by the Spanish. But, Colombia has taken the lead in the race for the gold as they classed it as part of its cultural heritage as it was found in their territorial waters. Another reason why Colombia led the hunt is as they claim to be the only ones who know exactly where it lies. In 1981, US company Glocca Morra claimed it discovered the lost treasure as they gave Colombia its location in return for a big reward. They were allegedly promised half of whatever was found and sold on but in 2015 Colombia announced they had found the wreck in a different spot and kept it quiet. Glocca Morra — now called Sea Search Armada - sued the government as they think they are being unfairly left out of the hunt. Under the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, the company are asking for either half of the treasures or $10billion, according to Bloomberg . The lawsuit values the treasure at anywhere between £3.1-£16billion.",

        "content": "A heart-wrenching story about a six-year-old Chihuahua, found abandoned in a public washroom holding tank at Guelph Lake Conservation Area. The Guelph Humane Society (GHS) says the dog is resting comfortably now, but she was found starved and covered in human urine and feces. “Cleo,” named by the team at the humane society, was found around 10 a.m. Sunday morning. Officials said it isn’t clear how long she was in the bathroom tank, or who left her there. GHS Executive Director Lisa Veit said, “It is very disturbing that a dog could be abandoned in such alarming and dire circumstances .. All of us here at GHS, and we expect the entire community, are extremely distressed as to what may have happened to her had she not been discovered and rescued.” Veit added that pet abandonment is all too common, and stresses anyone who is struggling to take care of their pets should reach out to the humane society. Donations to help with Cleo’s care can be made on the GHS .",

        "content": "Oppo Find X7 Ultra has been awarded the Eye Comfort Display Label and Gold Display Label from DXOMARK. It is the first smartphone to receive the Eye Comfort Display Label, meeting stringent requirements for flicker, brightness, blue light limitation, and color consistency. Oppo Find X7 Ultra has earned both the Eye Comfort Display Label and the Gold Display Label from DXOMARK. The Eye Comfort Display Label is awarded to screens that meet four requirements set by DXOMARK, which takes into account the flicker, minimum brightness achievable, limited blue light, and colour consistency. Notably, the Find X7 Ultra is the first smartphone to receive the Eye Comfort Display Label. Thibault Cabana, DXOMARK’s Display Evaluation Director, highlighted the device’s Bedtime Mode, which efficiently adjusts blue-light filtering based on the time of day. Cabana noted that the device’s circadian action factor, which measures how much artificial lighting disrupts human sleep cycles, reached 0.63, below DXOMARK’s recommended maximum of 0.65. DXOMARK: Eye Comfort Display Label requirement 1) The first requirement is to limit noticeable screen flicker. DXOMARK says the chance of detecting flicker should be below 50% in default or anti-flicker mode. The OPPO Find X7 Ultra has a flicker detection probability of just 10 per cent. 2) For comfortable use in dark environments, DXOMARK sets a minimum brightness of 2 nits. The OPPO Find X7 Ultra can go as low as 1.57 nits, reducing harsh light and making it easier on the eyes, especially in bed. 3) DXOMARK also limits blue light, requiring a circadian action factor of less than 0.65 to reduce sleep disruption. The Find X7 Ultra has a circadian action factor of 0.63, minimizing blue light’s impact on sleep. 4) Lastly, DXOMARK requires at least 95 per cent colour consistency when the blue light filter is on, using the P3 colour space. The Find X7 Ultra achieves 99 per cent colour consistency, maintaining high quality and eye comfort. Oppo Find X7 Ultra: Display features The Oppo Find X7 Ultra features a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 pixels with a density of 510 pixels per inch. The LTPO AMOLED panel supports a refresh rate of 1-120 Hz, for a wide range of smoothness. It has an overall peak brightness of 1,600 nits and a local peak brightness of 4,500 nits. The Find X7 Ultra supports ProXDR for high dynamic range photos and is compatible with Google’s Ultra HDR standard. It also supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG for high dynamic range video. The X7 Ultra display also comes with O-Sync 3.0 for “ultra-low touch latency”, which works even when wet to prevent accidental touches in the rain or when you have wet hands.",

Trending The star previously admitted that she \"hardly ever works out\" but is \"always on the go\". And we can see why Minogue is constantly on the go in the past 12 months, the singer was named Global Icon at the Brit Awards and completed a six-month Las Vegas residency. Meanwhile, she is set to headline the British Summertime Festival in London’s Hyde Park in July as well as the Sziget Festival in Budapest this August. Speaking in an unearthed interview with the Express, she revealed: “I don’t really work out, but I’m constantly on the go”. Despite, going to a Pilates session now and then, her attitude to working out has changed. She recalled: “I loved aerobics and I used to do callanetics. “I would travel everywhere with this home workout on a VHS tape and put it on in hotel rooms.” Despite the singer not being on a strict diet she instead goes for more healthier choices when it comes to eating. Minogue began a low-glycemic index (low-GI) diet several years ago. This is where the foods you eat can affect blood sugar levels and includes items such as nuts, seeds, wholegrains, lentils and beans. These foods release energy more slowly so you'll feel fuller for longer.

        "description": "On Thursday, June 6, 2024, the nation will come together to remember the tens of thousands of allied forces who gave service on D-Day eighty years ago and helped secure the peace we in the UK enjoy today.",
        "content": "From early morning when the sun rises to evening as night descends, church bells will ring out, special flags will be flown, schoolchildren will learn stories about their great grandparents, town criers will proclaim the victory, the haunting sound of bagpipes will fill the air and, in a final gesture of homage, beacons and Lamp Lights of Peace will be lit to signify the light that emerged from the dreadful darkness of war. Reverend Neil Redeyoff will be joining hundreds of others from across the world, wanting to remember the brave men and women who took part, not only from our country, but from America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand , Belgium, Norway, Greece, France, Czechoslovakia, Rhodesia, and Poland too. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Doncaster Free Press, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Reverend Neil from St Saviour’s Church in Auckley will be reading a tribute to the D-Day heroes at a commemoration event organised by Auckley Parish Council. Neil says to be able to play even a small part in paying tribute is humbling and a great honour. “I feel privileged to be participating in this event because I believe it is so important that we honour the service of those thousands of men and women who sacrificed so much, that we can enjoy the freedoms we have today.” Auckley Parish Council are very grateful to the 4th Doncaster Finningley Scout Group for hosting a bonfire and Lamp Light of Peace lighting ceremony at the scout hut on Hurst Lane in Auckley. Local residents are invited to join them from 8.30pm onwards. Entry is free but to manage numbers, attendees need to book by contacting the Parish Clerk on 07857 568268 or emailing [email protected] Bruno Peek CVO OBE OPR Pageantmaster of D-Day80, said: “In 1944 Allied forces mounted the largest amphibious invasion the world has ever witnessed. Advertisement Advertisement “Operation Overlord, D-Day, saw over 5,000 ships and landing craft set down more than 150,000 troops on the five Normandy beaches that would bring about the liberation of north-west Europe from Nazi occupation. “In order to commemorate the peace and freedom given to us through the bravery and ultimate sacrifice of so many thousands involved in the D-Day landings, and throughout the whole of WW11, beacons and Lamp Lights of Peace will be lit across the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories - and in a very poignant and unique gesture, special Lamp Lights of Peace lamps will be lit on each of the five beaches in Normandy, at 9.15pm local time that night, to coincide with the lighting of beacons at that time too. “However, at 9.10pm, as night descends - and just before the beacons ignite – the resonant sound of bagpipes will be heard across the capital cities of London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Cardiff. We will also have a presence in the capital cities of the Allied nations that took part. From Washington DC to the distant shores of New Zealand’s Auckland, from Ottawa to Paris, and from Canberra to Brussels, Athens and Amsterdam, Oslo, Warsaw, and Prague. “The light from the flames from the lamps and the beacons will represent the ‘light of peace’ that emerged from the darkness of war, with the lamp providing a very simple, safe, unique and cost effective way of taking part in this important 80th anniversary occasion, especially as once used, can be lit again at 11am on every Remembrance Sunday thereafter, in tribute to the many millions that sacrificed their lives during WWII.” More details about the plans for D-Day80 can be found on the website www.d-day80beacons.co.uk",

        "content": "أظهرت نتائجأعمال العديد من الشركات المصرية التي خضعت للاستحواذ الخليجي والأجنبي بالسنواتالماضية تحقيقها أرباحا هائلة، ما اعتبرها البعض مكاسب تصب لصالح سياسة رئيسالنظام عبد الفتاح السيسي ، ببيع الأصول الحكومية والشركات العامة، وتؤكد أن تلكالسياسة حل مباشر لتقليل الخسائر وإنقاذ الاقتصاد الوطني. وفي رصد لـ \" عربي21 \"،لنتائج الأعمال الربع سنوية لبعض الشركات المصرية التي خضعت للطرح أمامالمستثمرين، حققت شركة \" بلتون \" القابضة، إيرادات تشغيلية مجمعة بقيمة1.33 مليار جنيه خلال الربع الأول من العام الجاري، بزيادة 812 بالمئة على أساسسنوي، وفق بيان للشركة الأحد الماضي. وتستحوذ شركة\"شيميرا للاستثمار\" الإماراتية على حصة أغلبية في \"بلتون\"القابضة منذ تشرين الأول/ أكتوبر 2022، وعينت الرئيسة التنفيذية لها الوزيرةالسابقة للاستثمار في مصر داليا خورشيد، زوجة محافظ البنك المركزي المصري السابقطارق عامر. وفي بيان لهاالأحد أيضا، أعلنت شركة \" مدينة مصر \" عن تضاعف أرباحها بنحو 3 مرات فيالربع الأول من 2024، فيما تعد \"بى آى جى إنفستمنت جروب\" أكبر مساهممنفرد في الشركة بحصة تبلغ 19.9 بالمئة، وتمتلك \"بى إنفستمنت\" القابضة7.5 بالمئة، وتسيطر مؤسسات أجنبية أخرى على حصة قدرها 20.4 بالمئة. أيضا، وفي 19أيار/ مايو الجاري، أعلنت شركة \"موبكو\" المصرية للأسمدة والتي تستحوذالإمارات والسعودية على نحو 45 بالمئة من أسهمها منذ العام 2022، مكاسب صافية وصلت95 بالمئة في الربع الأول من العام، من فروق أسعار العملة المحلية مقابل الدولارالأمريكي. اظهار أخبار متعلقة وفي 16 أيار/مايو الجاري، كشفت مجموعة \" إي فاينانس \" للاستثمارات المالية والرقمية،عن ارتفاع صافي الربح بنسبة 65.4 بالمئة إلى 472.26 مليون جنيه خلال الربع الأولمن العام الجاري. وكانت الشركةالسعودية المصرية للاستثمار، ذراع صندوق الاستثمارات العامة في مصر، قد استحوذت في2022 على نحو 24.9 بالمئة من أسهم \"إي فاينانس\"، المتخصصة بتطوير وإدارةالبنية التكنولوجية للمعاملات المالية والرقمية منذ عام 2005 في مصر. وفي السياق، وفي15 أيار/ مايو الجاري أعلنت مجموعة \" أغذية \" الإماراتية عن نمو صافيالإيرادات بنسبة 22.6 بالمئة ونمو صافي أرباح المجموعة بنسبة 32.0 بالمئة خلالالربع الأول من العام الجاري، مشيرة في بيانها إلى أن الاستفادة من منصة\"أغذية\" المصرية عزز النمو في إيرادات الصادرات من مصر لتصل إلى 24.4مليون درهم إماراتي في الربع الأول من العام. أيضا، وفي 13أيار/ مايو الجاري، أعلنت \" فوري \" أكبر شركة تكنولوجيا مالية في مصروالتي تستحوذ عليها شركة \"ألفا أوريكس ليمتد\" التابعة للقابضة (اي ديكيو) الإماراتية منذ نيسان/ أبريل 2022، ارتفاع صافي أرباح عملاق التكنولوجياالمالية بنسبة 149.1 بالمئة على أساس سنوي في الربع الأول من العام الحالي. كذلك، وفي 9أيار/ مايو الجاري، أعلنت شركة \" طاقة عربية \" ارتفاع صافي أرباحها بنسبة16 بالمئة خلال الربع الأول من العام الجاري، ليصل إلى 102.7 مليون جنيه، مقابل88.3 مليون جنيه للربع المماثل من 2023. اظهار أخبار متعلقة تم طرح\"طاقة عربية\" في تموز/ يوليو الماضي، بالبورصة المصرية ليسيطر الأجانبمن الإمارات والبحرين وبريطانيا على 98.6 بالمئة في النسبة المشاركة برأس المال،بينما تأتي النسبة المتبقية بنحو 1.32 بالمئة لصالح المصريين. \"تبرير ودعم سياسات الخصخصة\" وفي قراءته لتلكالوقائع الاقتصادية قال الخبير الاقتصادي والمسؤول المصري السابق بوزارة التجارةوالصناعة الدكتور عبد النبي عبد المطلب: \"بداية فإن سياسة طرح الشركات العامةوالأصول الحكومية كما هو معروف جاءت استجابة للتعهدات المصرية لصندوق النقد الدولي\". وكيل وزارةالتجارة والصناعة للبحوث الاقتصادية سابقا أضاف لـ \" عربي21 \": \"ومنهنا فهي قرارات أُجبرت الدولة المصرية على اتخاذها، وليست وليدة سياسة وضعتهاالحكومة لأجل رفع كفاءة عمل هذه الشركات أو إعادة هيكلتها\". وتابع:\"ومن هنا وفي ظل البحث عن جذب المزيد من الاستثمارات سواء العربية أو الأجنبيةالمباشرة وُجد أن طرح هذه الشركات قد يكون بداية لإغراء عدد من الشركات العربيةوالعالمية للقدوم إلى مصر\". اظهار أخبار متعلقة وفي إجابته علىالسؤال: هل تكشف نتائج أعمال بعض الشركات بعد بيعها عن وجاهة سياسة طرح الأصولالعامة أمام المستثمرين العرب والأجانب؟، قال إن \"مسألة تحقيق عدد من هذهالشركات أرباحا أو أنها تحولت من الخسارة إلى الربح أعتقد أن ذلك يمكن اتخاذهمبررا أو داعما لسياسات الخصخصة\". وأكد أنه\"عندما ننظر إلى نتائج أعمال بعض تلك الشركات نلاحظ الآتي: أولا أن أغلب هذهالشركات رفع قيمة وسعر الخدمات التي يقدمها، ولا أريد أن أتحدث عن شركات بعينها،ولكن المصريين لاحظوا أن بعض الشركات قامت برفع مقابل الخدمة بنسبة تقترب من حوالي66 بالمئة\". \"سياسات عادلة للاستخدام\" وفق رؤيتهالاقتصادية لأسباب تحقيق تلك الشركات أرباحها المهولة، وهل نتيجة أعمال جادةوتطوير وضخ أموال واستثمارات ونجاح إداري إثر فشل الإدارات الحكومية في كل ما سبق؟أم لوجود تلاعب وسياسات خاطئة أفادت الملاك الجدد؟، أشار لتغيير بعض السياسات معالإدارات الجديدة. وأوضح أنه\"إذا أخذنا بعض الأمور التي لا تخفى على أحد عندما تم خصخصة بعض الخدمات، لاأقول إنه كانت هناك كفاءة أكثر، ولكن أقول على الأقل تم وضع سياسات عادلةللاستخدام، وانخفض عدد المستشارين وانخفض ما يتم دفعه من هذه الشركات لعدد منالجهات بدون فائدة معينة\". اظهار أخبار متعلقة وواصل:\"أصبح هناك إلى حد ما كفاءة في الإدارة، بالتأكيد ساهمت في تحقيق أرباح؛ ولكنالأرباح الحقيقية أتت من جيوب المواطنين، حيث أن أغلب هذه الشركات رفعت مقابل أداءالخدمة أو أسعار سلعها\". ولكن، هل تشيرتلك النتائج إلى أن البيع هو الحل الأمثل للتخلص من خسارة بعض الشركات العامةوإنقاذ البلاد من الإفلاس؟ وفي رده، أكدالخبير المصري، أن \"الحديث عن أرباح الشركات التي تم خصخصتها في اعتقادي أنهيحاول أن يوصل الرسالة للمواطن أن الخصخصة قد ترفع كفاءة الشركات وأن البيع قديؤدي إلى أرباح رغم أن الجزء الأكبر من هذه الأرباح لم يعود للخزانة العامةالمصرية\". ولفت إلى أن\"البعض يقول إنه سوف يتم الحصول على ضرائب، وأن رفع كفاءة تلك الشركات سوفيجذب المزيد من رؤوس الأموال، وأنها رسالة إيجابية عن الاقتصاد المصري\". واستدرك:\"لكن في النهاية تم الاستحواذ على قيم أكبر من جيب المواطن نتيجة سياسة رفعالأسعار، سواء نتحدث هنا عن شركة موبكو التي تقدم الأسمدة ورفع أسعارها أو شركاتتقديم الخدمات المالية والتي رفعت قيمة خدماتها من 60 إلى 66 بالمئة\". وحول ما يروجهالبعض من أن \"أسلوب الخصخصة أو نقل ملكية الشركات سواء للقطاع الخاص المصريأو القطاع الخاص العربي هو الحل\"، يرى عبد المطلب، أن \"هذه التجارب لمتؤدي إلى تحقيق تنمية أو رفع معدلات النمو\". اظهار أخبار متعلقة وأضاف:\"وفي اعتقادي أيضا، أن البيانات المتاحة حتى الآن لم تساهم في زيادة عرض فرصالعمل للمصريين، لكن لننتظر نهاية العام المالي ثم نبدأ في قياس أثر هذه التجربةعلى التنمية في مصر\". وختم بالقول:\"ولو أنني شخصيا أعتقد أن مثل هذه الطروحات وهذا النوع من الخصخصة والاستحواذلا يصب ولا يؤدي في مصلحة تنمية الاقتصاد المصري على المستوى القريب أو البعيد\". \"بيع بخس وآثاره السلبية قادمة\" وفي تعليقه قالالخبير الاقتصادي الأردني هاشم الفحماوي: \"للأسف الشديد فإن الحكومة المصريةتبيع بعض الأصول في جلسات بيع بأقل من قيمها الحقيقية، وعلى سبيل المثال شركةالإسكندرية للحاويات\". المحللالاقتصادي للأسواق العربية والعالمية أوضح في حديثه لـ \"عربي21\" أنها\"باعت هذا الأصل بسعر 8 جنيهات تقريبا وكان سعر الدولار حينها نحو 19.65،بينما قيمة هذا الأصل الحقيقية حينها أكثر من 25 جنيه\"، متسائلا: \"فكيفباعته بـ8 جنيهات، ولحساب من، ومن هم المتنفذين خلف هذا البيع؟\"، معتبرا أن\"هذه نقطة سلبية كبيرة\". وأشار إلى أن\"شركة الشرقية للدخان طرحت للبيع بـ 51 جنيه في عام 2011 عندما كان سعرالدولار تقريبا 6 جنيها، ليتم بيعها بسعر 24 جنيهات وبقرابة سعر صرف 35 جنيهامقابل الدولار \". خبير المالوالأعمال أعرب عن تعجبه من \"بيع أصول حكومية تحقق عوائد عالية جدا\"، متسائلا:\"كيف تبيعها بأسعار زهيدة ومتدنية؟\"، موجها حديثه للحكومة المصرية:\"هذا خطأ كبير جدا ترتكبه\"، مبينا أنه \"المفروض أن تقوم بتأسيسصناديق لدى البنك المركزي أو تقوم الصناديق الموجودة لديه بشراء هذه الأصول أوأطرحها أمام شركات خاصة بنظام العطاءات وأبيع جزءا منها\". اظهار أخبار متعلقة وعاد الفحماوي،للاستعانة بالأمثلة متعجبا من \"تصفية الحكومة المصرية لشركة الحديد والصلبحتى تستحوذ على أراضي الشركة المقدرة بـ8 مليارات جنيه ثم إعادتها للتداول، وبدلامن دعم صناعة الحديد والصلب الاستراتيجية تقوم بتصفيتها\". وواصل تساؤلاته:\"هل يعقل أن تبيع سعر السهم بين 8 و10 و15 جنيها؟\"، معتبرا أن \"هذاأمر غير منطقي\"، معربا عن قلقه من \"استمرار الحكومة في بيع الأصول بغيرأسعارها الحقيقية\"، مضيفا: \"أين لجنة التقييمات في الحكومةالمصرية؟\"، مؤكدا أنها \"غائبة وليس لها دراسات حقيقية\"، ومشددا علىأن \"عمليات بيع الأصول الحكومية بأسعار زهيدة يترتب عليها آثار سلبية خلالعام 2025 وعلى النمو الاقتصادي المصري\". وتابع:\"هناك أيضا شركة مدينة مصر، كيف تبيع هذا الأصل بينما يحقق لك إيرادات عاليةجدا؟، وكذلك شركة موبكو أكبر وأعرق شركات الأسمدة، كيف تبيعها وهي تحقق لك عوائدعالية جدا\". وعاد للتساؤل:\"من يبيع الأصول بأسعار زهيدة؟، ثم لمصلحة من؟\"، معربا عن أسفه من أن\"السياسة الاقتصادية المتبعة حاليا في مصر سياسة فاشلة، لعدم وجود الخبرة،وغياب لجان التقييمات\". وأكد أن\"كل ذلك يقدم مؤشرات سلبية تؤثر على سعر صرف الجنيه مقابل الدولار ما يظهرنهاية 2024، ويؤثر على نمو الاقتصاد المصري أيضا عام 2025\"، متوقعا\"حدوث تعويم جديد للجنيه قد يكون إلى 57 أو إلى 60 جنيها مقابلالدولار\"، وفق قوله. اظهار أخبار متعلقة ويرى الباحثالأردني، أن \"الاقتصاد المصري في العام 2024 سوف يواجه أوضاعا صعبةجدا\"، مشيرا في حديث مع \"عربي21\"، إلى أن \"هناك مجرم يحكممصر، وهذا المجرم وُضع لتنفيذ مخطط وضع عام 2014، لتدمير اقتصاد مصر، ومن ثمالهروب من مصر\". وقال إن\"الشعب المصري لو عرف المخطط الحقيقي لهب ضد نظام السيسي\"، مضيفا:\"لكنهم لا يعلمون أن القادم أسوأ مما يتوقعون\"، مؤكدا أن \"المصريينإن لم يلحقوا بأنفسهم قبل شهر أب/ أغسطس المقبل، فلن يكون لمصر أي أصول عامةوحكومية، فكل شيء تم بيعه\" ولفت إلى أن\"الاقتصاد المصري قبل 7 تشرين الأول/ أكتوبر الماضي كان على مشارف الانهيار،طوفان الأقصى أنقذتهم\". \"كرفانات تل أبيب\" وعبر صفحتهبـ\"فيسبوك\"، قال الخبير الاقتصادي عبدالنبي عبدالمطلب عن تحقيق فورىأرباحا بلغت 150 بالمئة بعد بيعها: \"لم يتحدث أحد عن رفعهم (فوري) تكاليفالخدمة، ولم يتحدث أحد عن تخفيض سعر الجنيه بنسبة 45 بالمئة\"، معتقدا أنالرسالة هي أن \"البيع يحقق مكاسب\"، ملمحا إلى أنها تعطي الحكومة مبررالمواصلة عمليات بيع الأصول. وأشار معلقونإلى أن \"المستحوذ الحقيقي والفعلي هو تل أبيب، وأن شركات الإمارات والسعوديةما إلا كرفانات للتعمية على الشعب وعدم استفزازه بشكل عمدي ومباشر لو تم البيعللصهاينة مباشرة\". وتحدث معلقونآخرون عن أن البيع واستمراره ومواصلة حكومة السيسي ذات سياسة التفريط \"خطوةمهمة جدا ومحكمة للغاية لتركيع مصر وإفقارها وتجويعها وتخريدها وتخريبها لصالحالعدو الصهيوني\". وألمحوا إلى دورالسيسي، قائلين: \"الموضوع ليس الحكومة، ولكنه إيلي كوهين الذي يلتزم حرفيابتنفيذ مخطط صهيوني محكم للغاية، ومنضبط بالمازورة، تم وضعه في أضابير الموسادلتدمير مصر وتجويعها وتعطيشها وإفقارها وإفلاسها، والمخطط يسير بنجاح\".",

الغربلمناقشة عدم التمييز ضد المسلمين في سوق العمل، وفي مشاركتهم السياسية، وفي تعبيرهمالثقافي والديني بالساحة العامة، حيث يلزم اتخاذ إجراءات ضرورية خلال الفترةالمقبلة\". وأشار حافظ، في مقابلة خاصة مع \"عربي21\"، إلى أن \"المسلمينفي أوروبا ضعفاء سياسيا، وهم المجتمع الأكثر تهميشا، ولا أحد يريد تبني قضيتهمالعادلة، ومن الصعب على أي شخص أن يقوم بالدفاع عنهم\"، مُشدّدا على أهمية معاملة المسلمينعلى قدم المساواة مع باقي المواطنين الآخرين. وأوضح أن \"هناك محاولة من بعض الدول الإسلامية لتصدير فكرتها عن الإسلامالذي تسيطر عليه الدولة إلى الدول الأوروبية والغربية، وهذا يتعارض كثيرا مع فكرة العلمانيةوفصل قوة الكنيسة عن الدولة\". وذكر الأكاديمي النمساوي أن \"هناك نقص بشكل واضح في رغبة أوروبا في معالجةالإسلاموفوبيا؛ فعلى سبيل المثال، لدينا قرار ضد معاداة السامية في البرلمان الأوروبيمنذ عام 2017، ولكن ليس لدينا شيء مشابه فيما يتعلق بالإسلاموفوبيا\". وأكد أن \"هناك مبادرات لوضع تعريف للإسلاموفوبيا لتكون لدينا قدرة علىإصدار قرار مثل القرار ضد معاداة السامية، لكن لا يزال الطريق طويلا جدا، خاصة أنهناك تضاربا وتنازعا في المواقف الأوروبية بخصوص الموقف من قضية الإسلاموفوبيا\". وتاليا نص المقابلة الخاصة مع \"عربي21\": لماذا قمتم برفع دعوى قضائية ضد جامعة جورج واشنطن الأمريكيةوضد الباحث لورنزو فيدينو؟ يتم التشهير وإلحاق الضرر بسمعة الأفراد مثلي الذين كانوا يدافعون ضد الإسلاموفوبيا، ونتيجة لذلك، شعرت بأنني مُضطر لرفع دعوى قضائيةلمحاسبة كل من جامعة جورج واشنطن ولورينزو فيدينيو على أفعالهم. هذه القضية تهدف إلىمعالجة الظلم الذي لحق بي وبالآخرين الذين تم استهدافهم بشكل مشابه، والبحث عن تعويضعن الأضرار التي لحقت بسمعتي المهنية والشخصية جراء إطلاق حملات التشهير ضد الأشخاص مثلي إلى جانبأكثر من ألف آخرين في أوروبا. لهذا السبب قمت برفع دعوى قضائية فيدرالية جماعية تستند إلى القانون المعروفباسم قانون المنظمات المتأثرة والمفسدة (ريكو)، ودعواي القضائية تكشف أساسا عن فيدينو وخدماتشركة الاستخبارات \"ألب سيرفيسز-AlpServices\"، التي نفّذت عمليات استخباراتية وتجسّسية في أوروبا، فضلاعن برنامج التطرف في جامعة جورج واشنطن، وتوضح القضية أنهم أسّسوا مُخططا للاحتيالعلى الجمهور واستغلال الأفراد مثلي بتصويري كمتطرف ومُتشدّد من أجل الحصول على تمويلغير مُعلن من دول أجنبية. والفكرة الموجودة لدى البعض بأن المسلمين يُشكّلون تهديدا للمجتمعاتالأوروبية هي فكرة عنصرية مقيتة ومرفوضة، وليس كل المسلمين إسلاميين كما يزعمالبعض؛ فمعظم المسلمين الذين يتعرضون للهجوم هم أناس عاديون، بل إن هناك في أوروبامَن يرى أن الإسلام السياسي أخطر من القاعدة، وأن جماعة الإخوان المسلمين أخطر من \"داعش\"،وللأسف نجحوا إلى حد كبير في وصم كل شخص مسلم ناشط في السياسة بأنه يجب أن يكون منالإخوان المسلمين. هل ساهمت حرب غزة في تصاعد \"الإسلاموفوبيا\"في الدول الغربية؟ أعتقد أن حرب غزة تُفسّر بحد ذاتها إلى جانب عوامل أخرى من خلال الإسلاموفوبيا،لأن تجريد الفلسطينيين من الإنسانية يتم بشكل كبير من خلال تأطير هذا الصراع على أنهحرب بين حركة حماس وإسرائيل بدلا من كونها حربا بين إسرائيل وفلسطين، وهذا يساعد فيتجريد المسلمين من الإنسانية، خاصة وبشكل مكثف بسبب الحرب العالمية على الإرهاب، وهذا حقا يساعد أيضا في تجريد الشعب الفلسطينيمن الإنسانية؛ لأن كل القضية الفلسطينية تُؤطَر ليس كسؤال حول الهوية الوطنية، وليسكسؤال حول الأرض والسيادة، ولكن تُؤطر كصراع حضارات ديني، ولذلك هناك تغذية كبيرة للإسلاموفوبيا في الطريقةالتي نفهم بها الحرب الحالية في غزة. هل تستغل الجماعات اليمينية المتطرفةحرب غزة لزيادة العداء ضد المسلمين في الغرب؟ أعتقد أنك تعلم، في الصورة الأكبر، أنه لا يوجد فرق كبير بين ما نشهده في العديدمن البلدان الغربية للأسف، وما نشهده أيضا في البلدان المسلمة؛ فهناك حملة قمع شديدةعلى حرية التعبير، وحرية التجمع، والعديد من حقوق الإنسان الأساسية الأخرى. بعض الناس حقيقة لا يمكنهم السفر من مكان إلى آخر لأنهم يُعتبرون مؤيدين للقضيةالفلسطينية، والتي تُعتبر بعد ذلك عملا داعما للإرهاب، وقد قلّص ذلك بشدة من الحريات الأساسية في أوقاتناالمعاصرة. لذا، نعم، أعتقد أن الجماعات اليمينية المتطرفة تستغل حرب غزة لزيادة العداءضد المسلمين، وهذه هي المشكلة الأكبر التي نراها هنا حاليا، وهي مرتبطة بالقضيةالفلسطينية، ولكن بطريقة ما قائمة بذاتها. كيف ترى الجهود الرسمية في الغرب لاحتواء ظاهرة \"الإسلاموفوبيا\"؟وهل هذه الإجراءات كافية أم لا؟ على المستوى الأوروبي، هناك بشكل واضح نقص في الرغبة في معالجة الإسلاموفوبيا،ويمكنك رؤية ذلك جليا؛ فعلى سبيل المثال، لدينا قرار ضد معاداة السامية في البرلمانالأوروبي منذ عام 2017، ولكن ليس لدينا شيء مشابه فيما يتعلق بالإسلاموفوبيا، وهذايشير إلى وجود نقص على المستوى الأوروبي فوق الوطني. وفي نفس الوقت، هناك، في دول مختلفة، محاولات من قِبل عدد من البيروقراطيينوالأشخاص لمحاولة احتواء الإسلاموفوبيا، وللقيام بشيء حقيقيحيال ذلك توجد مبادرات من مجلس أوروبا، على سبيل المثال، لوضع تعريف للإسلاموفوبيالتكون لدينا قدرة على إصدار قرار مثل القرار ضد معاداة السامية، لكن لا يزال الطريقطويلا جدا جدا، خاصة أن هناك تضاربا وتنازعا في المواقف الأوروبية بخصوص الموقف منقضية الإسلاموفوبيا. وهناك أجزاء كبيرة من المعسكر السياسي الأكثر تحفظا اختارت بوضوح أجندةاليمين المتطرف للغاية، والذين يُقدّمون أنفسهم على أساس أنهم المنقذون لأوروباالمسيحية البيضاء، بينما في المقابل نجد المعسكر اليساريالعلماني المنقسم على ذاته، يقول أحدهم إنه ينبغي منح المسلمين مساحة أكبر للمشاركةبناءً على أفكارنا وقيمنا الديمقراطية والمساواة، لكن يرد عليه آخر قائلا: لكنهممتدينون، والدين يُمثل مشكلة بالنسبة لنا؛ فنحن نحارب الكنيسة منذ مئات السنين، وعلينامواصلة هذه المعركة ضد المسلمين الذين يُشكّلون خطرا على دولنا العلمانيةالليبرالية. وماذا عن رؤيتكم للدور الذي تلعبه الأمم المتحدة في مواجهةجرائم الكراهية ضد المسلمين؟ الأمم المتحدة تلعب دورا مهما بشكل واضح، ولدينا الآن يوما دوليا لمكافحة الإسلاموفوبيا،في الخامس عشر من آذار/ مارس، والذي أُنشئ قبل عامين من قِبل الجمعية العامة للأممالمتحدة، وهو خطوة رمزية مهمة، ومع ذلك، لا يزال الطريق طويلا جدا أيضا. لماذا؟ لأن الإسلاموفوبيا في العديد من الدول الوطنية مشكلة حقيقية، وهي جزء لا يتجزأمن الإطار المؤسسي. لذا، علينا أن نأتي بأكثر من قرار رمزي لمحاربة الإسلاموفوبيا. في الأساس، الأمر يتعلق إلى أي مدى، خصوصا فيالغرب، نريد للمسلمين أن تكون لديهم نفس إمكانية المشاركة في البلاد. ما هو برأيكم الأسلوب الأمثل الذي يمكن أن تتبعه الحكوماتالعربية والإسلامية لمحاصرة ظاهرة \"الإسلاموفوبيا\"؟ هناك محاولة من بعض الدول الإسلامية لتصدير فكرتها عن الإسلام الذي تسيطر عليهالدولة إلى الدول الأوروبية والغربية، وهذا يتعارض كثيرا مع فكرة العلمانية وفصل قوةالكنيسة عن الدولة، والتي أعتقد أنها أكثر فائدة لأي مجتمع مدني وأي نوع من التدينالإسلامي أن لا تكون تحت سيطرة أي مؤسسة حكومية أو ما شابه، ولكن أعتقد أنه من حيث الضغط الثقافي والدبلوماسيالذي يمكن أن تمارسه الدول الإسلامية، فإنها بالطبع قوة عظيمة. والسؤال الحقيقي هو هل تريد الدول الإسلامية فقط فعل ذلك عندما تكون هناك بعضالمضايقات المتعلقة بالرموز الأكثر أهمية في الإسلام، مثل أزمة الرسوم الكاريكاتوريةأو حرق القرآن؟، وعندها تكون هناكمظاهرات هائلة في الدول الإسلامية، ويشعر بعض المسؤولين الحكوميين الغربيين بالإجبار على فعل شيء حيال ذلك أم أننا بحاجة فعلا إلى حوار إستراتيجي بين الدولذات الأغلبية المسلمة وشركائها في الغرب لمناقشة عدم التمييز ضد المسلمين في سوق العملوفي مشاركتهم السياسية وفي تعبيرهم الثقافي والديني في الساحة العامة، وهذه هي المجالاتالأكثر أهمية حيث يلزم اتخاذ إجراءات ضرورية خلال الفترة المقبلة. هل تلعب المؤسسات الإسلامية في الغرب دورا رئيسيا في معالجةهذه الظاهرة؟ أعتقد أن الطريقة التي تنظم بها الكثير من المؤسسات الإسلامية والطريقة التيتتصرف بها تجاه المؤسسات الحكومية، تتأثر غالبا بسياسة الخوف، وسياسة محاولة تأمينوحماية عنق الشخص، وبدلا من تحسين الأمورحقا للأفضل يمكنك أن تفهم من ناحية أنه بالنسبة لهم المهم هو مسألة البقاء الديني،ولكن من ناحية أخرى أعتقد أنه من أجل إحداث تغيير فيما يتعلق بالإسلاموفوبيا المفهومةعلى أنها عنصرية ضد المسلمين، وهذا الأمر يحتاج إلى تغيير سياسي بدلا من مجرد تغييرفي الخطاب الديني أو ما شابه. ما هو مطلوب أساسا هو أن يُعامل المسلمون على قدم المساواة، وهذا بالطبع شيء تحاول العديد من المؤسسات الإسلاميةالنضال من أجله وتحقيقه، ولكن في الوقت نفسههو شيء لن تحصل عليه إلا إذا قمت أيضا بممارسة الضغط السياسي والاقتصادي على أحد ما، وهذا ما تضعف المؤسسات الإسلامية لتحقيقه؛ فالمسلمينفي أوروبا ضعفاء سياسيا، وهم المجتمع الأكثر تهميشا، ولا أحد يريد تبني قضيتهمالعادلة، ومن الصعب على أي شخص أن يقوم بالدفاع عنهم. هل «الإسلاموفوبيا» شوّهت صورة المسلمين في الغرب؟ نعم تماما هناك صورة من جانب واحد لما يمثله المسلم. هناك صورة مشوّهة من حيثارتباط المسلمين بالعنف في كثير من الأحيان، رغم أنهم على نطاق عالمي هم على الأرجحالذين يتعرضون للعنف من قِبل الدولة وغير الدولة بشكل أكبر مقارنة بالمجتمعات الغربية،وهذا بالطبع لا يساعد على تحسين الأوضاع. ما مستقبل \"الإسلاموفوبيا\" في الغرب؟ أعتقد أن مستقبل المسلمين والإسلاموفوبيا في الغرب يعتمد كثيرا على ما إذا كانأولئك الذين في السلطة يمكنهم أن يسألوا أنفسهم لماذا لا يريدون أن يكون المسلمون جزءالا يتجزأ من مواطنة متساوية كاملة المشاركة طالما أن لدينا أنظمة مواطنة وأنظمة هجرة وحكوماتمتحيزة على أساس العرق داخل المجتمعات في أوروبا الغربية التي لا تسمح بالمشاركة المتساويةالكاملة، فسنظل نواجه مشكلة. وهذه هي المسألة التي ينبغي أن نجد لها حلا، ويجب أن نجيب عن السؤال الأهم: ما هو شكل المستقبلالذي نريده لأوروبا؟، هل نريد مستقبلا تعمّ فيه المساواة الحقيقية أم نريد مستقبلايتميز بمواطنات متباينة؟، وهل يريدون إعطاء مساحة للمسلمينكمواطنين متساوين أم لا؟، وهذه هي المسألة الرئيسة التي تواجهنا، وأنا لازلت متفائلا بوجود أشخاص يريدون الدفاع عن قيم الحرية والديمقراطية والمساواة.",

Rimostranze che sono assolutamente lontane da qualsiasi forma di speculazione o strumentalizzazione politica di parte e che – al contrario – mirano solo esclusivamente a salvaguardare gli interessi dei territori e delle popolazioni. La nota congiunta “Da una lettura dell’Allegato proveniente dalla Regione Siciliana – si legge in una nota inviata agli organi preposti – si constata la presenza di interventi che erano stati esclusi dalla graduatoria e che adesso prendono sorprendentemente il posto di quelli che erano stati dichiarati ammessi a finanziamento. Eppure tanti dei Comuni da noi amministrati hanno riscontrato subito ogni richiesta di trasmissione delle schede volte alla ricognizione dei bisogni, impiegando importanti risorse finanziarie e professionali per redigere o aggiornare le progettazioni riguardanti interventi non ricompresi nell’Allegato A1, che risultano di fondamentale importanza per la salvaguardia del territorio e lo sviluppo infrastrutturale, economico e sociale di ciascuna comunità. Non crediamo che sia questo il viatico ideale per costruire i nuovi canoni di un’Europa più competitiva, resiliente, Green, sociale, inclusiva e vicina ai cittadini. Tutto questo appare in netto contrasto con l’obiettivo strategico dello sviluppo sostenibile e integrato delle zone urbane, rurali e costiere e delle iniziative locali, Siamo invece convinti che le procedure non siano state pienamente aderenti al principio di trasparenza dell’attività amministrativa e per questo chiediamo con forza di conoscere le puntuali motivazioni strategiche ed i criteri di priorità adottati dal Dipartimento regionale della programmazione e dagli altri Dipartimenti e strutture tecniche regionali, per la selezione degli interventi da realizzare mediante le risorse FSC 2021-2027. Ci riserviamo inoltre – concludono i sindaci – di formulare richiesta di accesso agli atti amministrativi ai sensi della Legge n. 241/1990 e di intraprendere ogni eventuale azione legale a tutela dei Comuni rappresentati”. Alla presente si allega, per ulteriori e più significativi dettagli, l’intera nota sottoscritta da 48 sindaci.",

I finanzieri della compagnia di Monopoli hanno notificato ai nove indagati avvisi di conclusione delle indagini. Oltre alla promotrice finanziaria, gli altri indagati operano in Italia e all’estero. Secondo quanto accertato, la truffa avveniva attraverso il sistema noto come ‘schema Ponzi’ che consentiva di drenare i risparmi di numerosi clienti inesperti e attratti dalla promessa di facili guadagni. Secondo quanto accertato sinora, la promotrice, in concorso con gli altri, avrebbe promosso l’offerta al pubblico di investimenti in prodotti finanziari, italiani ed esteri, per conto di soggetti non abilitati – in assenza del prospetto informativo e delle previste autorizzazioni – prospettando ingenti guadagni oscillanti tra il 2% ed il 7% mensile.

De første fly vil blive sendt afsted i år, kunne den belgiske udenrigsminister, Hadja Lahbib, meddele tirsdag morgen Det er en del af en sikkerhedsaftale, som få timer senere er indgået i Bruxelles mellem premierminister Alexander De Croo og Ukraines præsident, Volodymyr Zelenskyj. »Dokumentet omfatter mindst 977 millioner euro (knap 7,3 milliarder kroner, red.) i belgisk militærhjælp til Ukraine i dette år, og det gælder ligeså Belgiens løfte om at give støtte over de næste 10 år som indeholdt i aftalen«, skriver Zelenskyj på mediet X, det tidligere Twitter. Den belgiske udenrigsminister sagde lidt tidligere på dagen, at hun håbede på, at de første F-16-fly kan leveres til Ukraine ’ved slutningen af året’. Belgiens regering har tidligere meldt ud, at den ville levere F-16-fly til Ukraine. Men det er først nu, at regeringen sætter tal på hvor mange. Belgien er sammen med Danmark, Norge og Holland de Nato-lande, der har lovet at levere de fortsat meget kampdygtige fly til Ukraine. Premierminister Alexander De Croo har tidligere sagt, at omkostningerne til at sende belgiske F-16-fly til Ukraine kan blive betalt med russiske værdier, der er indefrosset i Vesten. En meget stor del af de russiske penge i Vesten er indefrosset i Belgien. De er blevet låst som en del af de vestlige sanktioner mod Rusland. Danmark vil overdrage de første af 19 F-16-fly til Ukraine denne sommer. ritzau",
