        "content": "The NHL fined New York Rangers captain Jacob Trouba $5,000 on Monday for elbowing Florida Panthers forward Evan Rodrigues. The incident occurred late in the second period in Game 3 on Sunday. Trouba received a two-minute minor for the elbow as well as a minor penalty for slashing during the same sequence. Rodrigues, who was struck in the side of the face, left the ice with help but eventually returned in the third period. Trouba, 30, contributed two assists on Sunday in Sunrise, Fla., as New York won 5-4 in overtime to seize a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals. Trouba has one goal and six assists in 13 games this postseason. The defenseman tallied 22 points (three goals, 19 assists) and 73 penalty minutes in 69 games during the regular season.

        "description": "The road to Omaha is underway with regionals beginning this weekend for college baseball.",
        "content": "The road to Omaha has officially begun with the 64-team field for NCAA Division I baseball championship being revealed. Tennessee is the No. 1 (50-11) overall seed after dominating for the entire year and winning the SEC regular-season title and conference tournament. The rest of the top four includes two other SEC schools -- Kentucky at No. 2, Texas A&M at No. 3 -- and North Carolina at No. 4. LSU will look to defend its title on the road in the Chapel Hill Regional with its first game against Wofford, and elsewhere, the Bryan-College Station Regional should bring the drama with the opportunity for Texas A&M to face in-state rival Texas. Notably, Florida State is back in the tournament after missing it for the first time since 1977 last year. The SEC and ACC are each hosting five regionals. The other host regional sites include two schools from the Big 12, two from the Pac-12 -- Arizona was crowned the last Pac-12 champion and is hosting -- and one from the AAC and one from the Big West. Oklahoma is hosting for the first time since 2010, and UC Santa Barbara is hosting for its first time on campus as the only other time the school hosted was in 2015 and did so at a neutral location.

        "content": "Former Mamelodi Sundowns player Lovers Mohlala has spoken about how frustrating it was to miss out on a move abroad, when the club rejected an offer from a Danish club. Soccer Laduma spoke to the retired player to talk about the years he spent with the Tshwane giants. I was there from 1997 until 2003 I think. My time at Sundowns was very nice and painful as well. The nicest part about being at Sundowns was that we were a team that was winning. Players dedicated their lives to represent the Sundowns badge. At some point, I was frustrated. Frustrated how? Remember FC Conpenhagen bought Sibusiso Zuma? I actually went for trials there. They were supposed to buy me. They offered $400 000 to Sundowns. But Sundowns wanted $700 000. The painful part is that what Motsepe is doing today, Sundowns did not do back then. We didn't get bonuses for the Champions League. They said we would share what we win, but we lost in the final and we did not get a cent. We had great players, the likes of Alex Bapela, John Tlale, Roger Feutmba and (Joel) Fire Maselela. We had a bunch of good players and there was unity. We were not celebrity. We were protected by king pins and taxi owners. Even in the township, the Sundowns players would not be hijacked so easily. I remember Albert Kometsi who used to play for Swallows was hijacked. Then we called around and we told him that he would find his car at the police station, but he would not find the tyres and the radio. We were protected and we were not paying a protection fee. We had the nicest time at Sundowns, but there was no money. I'll tell you one thing...the highest that I earned at Sundowns was R12 000. We were playing with players who really wanted to win. The painful part is that you retire in football, but you can't even enter the yard at Sundowns. That's the sad part. When you play, there is no pension. We are the only ones who pay tax and not get a pension fund. That's the sad part of football. My first game was against Chiefs and we beat them 4-1. I was on the bench and Bra Stan said 'boy, what''s your nickname?' Then he said 'today, your name is Horse'. I created two goals that day. That's where I started. I knew when I got there, I had already made a mark for myself. When I got there, it was a matter of showing my skill. It was frustration. They did not want to sell me to Copenhagen. When Copenhagen bought Zuma, Sundowns refused to sell me. They gave me the offer in my hand. They called Sundowns and they even offered me a salary. That's when I got frustrated.",

        "content": "The Press Information Bureau (PIB), which is a part of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, has fact-checked the media reports claiming New Delhi Railway Station will be shut down for 4four years. The New Delhi Railway Station isn't shutting down in 2024. The Ministry of Railways has made this clear. Many media houses had said that the station would close for four years because of development works. They also said that many trains would run from other stations in Delhi. The government has now said that they will give information beforehand if they need to divert any trains. The Press Information Bureau (PIB), which is a part of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, has posted about this. They have rejected the reports that said the New Delhi Railway Station would close. Clarification about Shut down of New Delhi Railway Station for redevelopment Some sections of the media have reported that New Delhi Railway Station will be shut down by the end of this year for redevelopment work It is to announce that New Delhi Railway Station will never be...— PIB India (@PIB_India) May 27, 2024 Many Indian Railway Stations Getting A Makeover The Indian Government has a plan called the Amrut Bharat Station Scheme. Under this plan, they will redevelop 1318 railway stations in the country. The British built most of these stations. The list of stations for redevelopment includes big ones like New Delhi, Delhi Cantonment, Anand Vihar, Gurugram, and Faridabad. In 2022, the Ministry of Railways shared a photo of the proposed redevelopment of the New Delhi Railway Station on social media. The planned proposal calls for a 40-story twin tower, multi-level parking, and pick-up and drop areas at the station, per a Hindustan Times report. The infrastructure of these stations will be modernised by this renovation plan. For millions of travellers, it will improve travel. The government's clarification guarantees that the renovation project won't interfere with the New Delhi Railway Station's normal operations. This allays the worries expressed in the preliminary findings.",

        "description": "The News Mill",
        "content": "Delhi’s Karkardooma court on Tuesday is likely to pronounce an order on the bail plea of Umar Khalid in the larger conspiracy of Delhi riots case of 2020. He has been in custody since September 2020 in a case under UAPA. Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid has sought regular bail on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons. Special Judge Sameer Bajpai reserved the order on May 13 after hearing the counsel at length. Delhi police’s Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) opposed the plea calling it frivolous and baseless. He also filed written submissions. Umar Khalid’s Counsel had argued that no terror case was made out against him and his name was repeated in the charge sheet of Delhi police. Repeating his name doesn’t make a lie, a truth. There was a vicious media trial taken against him. He had also filed his written submissions. It is alleged by the Delhi police that Umar Khalid had pre-planned protests in 2020 at 23 sites that culminated in riots. After withdrawing his bail plea from the Supreme Court in February, Khalid moved to trial court seeking bail on the grounds of a change in circumstances and parity with other account-used persons. Senior advocate Tridip Pais questioned the submissions of Delhi police and asked, “Is sharing messages a criminal or terror act?” He also responded to submissions earlier made by the Special public prosecutor (SPP) who had said that Khalid was amplifying his narrative as part of a conspiracy by sharing certain links with people with people from politics and others on social media. Pais argued that Umar Khalid was sharing the ‘correct narrative.’ The senior advocate had also submitted that there was a vicious media trial taking place against Umar Khalid. He also referred to various statements of news anchors from different media channels. He said that anchors were reading from the charge sheet around the clock. He further argued that no terror case is made out against Umar Khalid and police have no material to this effect. The court must see whether a terror case is made against him or not. There are contradictions in the statement of prosecution witnesses, Pais added. In this situation, the court must determine whether the witness statement prima facie makes a terror case against Umar Khalid. Earlier it was argued that there accused persons namely Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha were granted bail by the High Court. They had a similar role to that of Umar Khalid. While opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid, Delhi police had said that his chats revealed that he is in the habit of creating narratives on media and social media to influence bail hearings. It was also submitted by the Special Public Prosecutor that several people took to X (earlier Twitter) to influence bail hearing. He had referred to the post on X by Teesta Seetalvad, Amnesty India, Akar Patel, Raj Kaushik, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) while opposing the bail application of Umar Khalid referred to his WhatsApp chats. The SPP had submitted, “WhatsApp chats also revealed that he is in habit of creating media and social media narratives at the time of listing of bail applications of the person booked in cases to clearly influence bail hearings.” “Similar exercise is being adopted while applicants’ bails are being listed to influence his bail hearings, samples of post on X (earlier Twitter) with hashtag about applicant annexed herewith,” SPP added. “Thus in the light of the aforesaid, the present second application for grant of bail to the accused deserves to be dismissed by this honourable court in the interest of justice,” SPP Prasad submitted. SPP Amit Prasad also mentioned the Post on Twitter by Teesta Seetalvad, Aakar Patel, Kaushik Raj, Swati Chaturvedi, Arju Ahmed and others. SPP had also read some of the tweets in the court. One of the tweets read “Ram Raheem”s parole approved, Umar Khalid bail 14 times adjourned in SC. #freeumarkhalid.” “Umar Khalid withdraws his bail petition from SC. This is a travesty of Justice,” another tweet read. SPP submitted that Amnesty India also tweeted which read “SC has adjourned hearing his bail hearing 14 times. Acute Subversion of the right of Umar Khalid to get bail.” “#freeUmarKhalid was used,” the SPP submitted. The SPP argued that while they claim that they were subjected to media trial, it is he who was playing around with the media, how His father gave interviews in the media and people associated with him also doing the same. In his rebuttal arguments, Senior Advocate Tridip Pais argued that a mere meeting of accused individuals doesn’t imply terrorism. “None of the witnesses didn’t say anything but then miraculously said something two weeks later. All the witnesses here seem to be taking tablets for memory. Prima facie requires depth, not frivolously reading out the chargesheet,” Pais argued. Senior advocate Pais submitted that the prosecution argument is that because I (Umar Khalid) can fain tension. Therefore I don’t deserve bail. His father gave an interview therefore he doesn’t deserve the bail. While arguing, the senior advocate referred to the Supreme Court judgement in Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali, Shoma Sen and Varnan Gonsalves. “It was submitted that the allegations should be good enough to establish the allegations are substantive, to reject the bail. The duty of the court is not to deal with the material meticulously but to see the broad probability,” the senior advocate added. On the point of terrorist activity aspect, it was submitted that there is no evidence to show it is a terrorist activity. There is nothing on record to attract section Section 15 of UAPA. The High Court and the Special Court haven’t distinguished between the acts or persons. They’ve just painted everything with a broad brush. There is not a single witness whose statement attracts 15(1) qua me (Umar Khalid). On the point of meeting Umar Khalid, the defence counsel rejected the prosecution’s arguements that meetings were secret ones. He said that Umar Khalid, Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi met at the office of PFI has been referred by the Prosecution on the basis of the statement of a witness CDR. “You want to rely on CDR to deny me bail, Pais questioned. “As per CDR they were not there at the given time and date,” he argued. He further argued that there is no credible case of conspiracy, which is also not terror activity. There is no seizure from me that can attract the offence of terror activity. “On the whimsical statement, sometimes even without witnesses, an act of terrorism is foisted towards me,” Pais submitted. “It was also said that Bangladeshi women and children were deployed at the protest sites. Did any women say that it was against me,” Pais questioned. “In the Varnan Gonsalves and Shoma Sen case, the views of the Supreme Court on Prima Facie and analysis of Prima facie have been clarified,” the defence counsel argued. Pais argued that at the time of hearing bail, the court was under a duty to scan the case diary to decide whether the allegations were prima facie true or not. Third-party hearsay can not be attributed to me. “Mere having a meeting is not enough to oppose the bail. There is no material as of now. The bail cannot be denied as the material can come later,” Pais argued. “If ten witnesses state my name, does that make a terror case against me? I have not indulged in a terrorist act. There is not even a seizure from me,” Pais submitted",

        "content": "After Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, accused in the alleged obscene case, alleged conspiracy against him, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar said on Monday that he was free to say anything but is bound to face the law. “Prajwal Revanna may say whatever he wants, but eventually he will have to face the law once he lands,” Shivakumar told reporters at the KPCC office in Bengaluru on Monday. On asked about Prajwal Revanna’s allegation that the alleged case against him was a conspiracy of the Congress party, Shivakumar said, “I don’t have much information on Prajwal Revanna’s video, but I came across it through the media. No matter what he says, he doesn’t have a choice but to present himself before the SIT for investigation. The law will take its course in this case.” “Rahul Gandhi has spoken about Prajwal based on media reports, there is nothing wrong with it. Time will answer Prajwal’s allegation on Rahul Gandhi,” he added. Prajwal Revanna, earlier in the day, released a self-made video in which he alleged political conspiracy behind the case and said that he will appear before the SIT on May 31. The Hassan MP also claimed that he “went into depression” and “isolated” himself as he accused Rahul Gandhi and other Congress leaders of sparking a discussion on the issue as part of an alleged conspiracy. Revanna is facing a probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT) constituted by the Karnataka government over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in his household. Revanna’s video comes days after his grandfather and JDS patron HD Deve Gowda, issued a stern warning to return to India from abroad and face the law in the obscene video case. “I have already said that he should be given the harshest punishment under the law if found guilty. I also cannot convince people that I was unaware of Prajwal’s activities. I cannot convince them that I have no desire to shield him. I cannot convince them that I am not aware of his movements and that I was not aware of his foreign trip. I believe in answering my conscience. I believe in God, and I know the almighty knows the truth,” the former PM said in a post on X on May 23. “I will ensure that there will be no interference in the enquiry against him from me or my family members,” the former PM added. According to the sources, the Ministry of External Affairs of India has received a letter from the Karnataka government for the cancellation of the diplomatic passport in respect of MP Prajwal Revanna. The request is being processed. Siddaramaiah had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1 and May 23 urging him to take action to cancel the diplomatic passport of the Hassan MP, who is said to have flown to Europe after being accused of sexually exploiting several women. In his letter to the Prime Minister, the Karnataka CM said that it is shameful that Prajwal Revanna fled the country on April 27, 2024, to Germany using his diplomatic passport, shortly after news of his heinous actions emerged and just a few hours before the first FIR was filed against him. Speaking on the Karnataka government’s request for cancellation of Revanna’s diplomatic passport, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) received a request only on May 21 to impound Revanna’s passport Revanna. In an exclusive interview with ANI, Jaishankar clarified the procedural aspects, saying, “To impound a passport is governed by an act called the Passport Act. We need a judicial court or a police request to do so. The MEA got this request from Karnataka only on May 21.” Highlighting the adherence to legal procedures, Jaishankar emphasised that the external affairs minister acted promptly upon receiving the request. “We immediately acted on it. On 23rd of May... we have to follow a certain procedure and the procedure is initiated,” he added. However, Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said that they did not get any written communication from the MEA in this matter",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. The memo, obtained by The Times, said a “key theme” was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign after Mr Sunak surprised Westminster by calling a July 4 General Election. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer, staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.”",

        "description": "Rishi Sunak faced questions after a leaked memo from Conservative headquarters blamed MPs and ministers for failing to get behind the election effort.",
        "content": "Rishi Sunak insisted he took responsibility for the Conservatives’ election campaign after a leaked memo criticised MPs and ministers over a lack of effort. Staff at Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) accused MPs of going on holiday, refusing to knock on doors and focusing on ministerial responsibilities rather than the election effort. News of the leak emerged as Government minister Steve Baker defended going for a break in Greece rather than campaigning in his constituency. The memo, obtained by The Times, said a “key theme” was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign after Mr Sunak surprised Westminster by calling a July 4 General Election. The document was accidentally emailed to MPs by a senior campaigning figure at CCHQ, the newspaper reported. The message had two attachments – a constituency breakdown with sanitised comments and another containing the unguarded comments of Conservative staff. The document reveals seats which are short of funding and singles out some MPs for criticism over their efforts. In Plymouth Moor View, the seat of veterans minister Johnny Mercer, staff said there was a issue with “MP co-operation with CCHQ” and “funding issues — currently £2k in bank” and support had been offered. Environment minister Rebecca Pow, who is standing in Taunton and Wellington, was “still too focused on ‘ministerial business’ and non-committal on time she will spend in the seat now and during the campaign”, the memo said. In Cheadle, Mary Robinson is “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo said. A “lack of co-operation” was also noted for Northern Ireland minister Mr Baker. The Daily Mirror revealed that he continued with his holiday plans during what was supposed to be the parliamentary recess. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” Asked about the start of the campaign, the Prime Minister told ITV News: “Of course this is my responsibility, and I actually enjoyed the last few days. “A few days into this and I’ve been in the East Midlands and West Midlands, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland here in the South East.” Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.”",

This move might increase each phone's weight, so, as they say, you win some (longevity), you lose some (ease of handling). The Find X8 should become official in October, just after the Snapdragon Summit where Qualcomm is unveiling the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 SoC . Interestingly, some previous rumors have stated that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 will require bigger batteries since it's going to be more power-hungry than its predecessor. Its CPU's performance cores are expected to reach 4.2 GHz. So perhaps you won't be gaining any longevity with these handsets after all, but merely not losing any compared to the previous generation.

        "content": "Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami directed government officials to keep the Chardham Yatra well organized and also said that offline registration should be kept closed till May 31. Dhami said this while reviewing arrangements in Chardham Yatra, Manaskhand Mandir Mala Mission, Kainchi Dham and Purnagiri at the Secretariat on Monday, according to an official statement. The Chief Minister said that the number of devotees in the Chardham Yatra will increase rapidly every year.

The CM directed that proposals related to parking and basic necessities at the Chardham Yatra routes and important places of pilgrimage and tourism in the state should be sent to the Housing Department. A special plan should be made for every year during the peak period of Chardham Yatra. He said that before the start of Rishikesh-Karnprayag rail service, work should be done with a complete action plan to provide parking and other basic facilities on the railway routes and in Karnaprayag and its surrounding areas, as per the statement. The Chief Minister expressed satisfaction over the smooth running of the Chardham Yatra. He directed the officials of the government and administration to keep the Chardham Yatra well organized with the same dedication, it stated.

        "content": "Home | Karimnagar | Ev Charging Stations Remain Elusive For Karimnagar EV charging stations remain elusive for Karimnagar Despite repeated reminders from officials, the firms which got the permission to install the charging stations have not started the works. By Raghu Paithari Published Date - 27 May 2024, 10:42 PM Karimnagar: The setting up of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations in the district is dragging on, with the process yet to start. Despite repeated reminders from officials, the firms which got the permission to install the charging stations have not started the works. It is said that the firms are reluctant citing the small number of EVs in the district. In order to establish EV charging stations in Karimnagar town, the Telangana State Renewable Energy Development Corporation Limited (TSREDCO) had invited applications from different firms for 10 locations. A few firms submitted Expressions of Interest, after which REDCO gave permission for four firms to install the charging stations in ten locations. While P Ramachary firm got the permission to install stations in five locations, Sri Ganesh Service got three. Both Joel Point Private Limited and Bhavani Engineering Agency got one each. Though the installation as well as operation of the charging stations should have been commenced within three months, the process of setting up the stations has not been started even five months after the agreements were signed, according to sources. One firm, which started work near the civil hospital, has also stopped the work. It requires about Rs.20 lakh for the installation of a charging station. So firm owners are of the opinion that they will not get benefits if they do not get adequate vehicles, REDCO officials said. The accurate figure of electric vehicles in the district is not available since RTA authorities are not registering all types of charging vehicles. RTA authorities are not registering electric bikes with top speeds under 60 kmph. Approximately, there are 20,000 two wheelers, 1,000 autorickshaws and 500 EV cars in the erstwhile Karimnagar district. Speaking to Telangana Today, REDCO district manager, V Paramachary informed that when the firms were contacted last week, they had assured to start works in May but that did not happen. Since the firms were not responding, they have decided to serve notices to the firms, he said.

        "description": "Promises to waive off farm loans have been issued by most political parties during this Lok Sabha election. Here’s a look at how these waivers are implemented, the effect on farmers and governments and what alternatives exist",
        "content": "As the Lok Sabha seats in India’s largest farming belt — Haryana and Uttar Pradesh — go to the polls, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi has once again promised to waive off farmer debts if the Congress-led coalition is voted to power. The last pan-India farm loan waiver was done by the UPA government in 2008 in the form of a ₹60,000 crore economic package. Incidentally, the waiver came a year ahead of the 2009 Lok Sabha elections, in which the UPA was re-elected with a bigger majority. Addressing an election rally in Haryana’s Charkhi Dadri on May 22, Mr. Gandhi promised to waive farmers’ debt and guarantee them Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops. Claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi felt farm loan waivers would “spoil the farmers,” he vowed, “We are going to ‘spoil the farmers’ when we return to power and waive their debts not just once but again and again....We will form a commission and every time farmers need a debt waiver, the panel would let us know and we will do that.” Congress’ Paanch Nyay gurantees The Congress has released five sets of ‘guarantees ’ in which it promises farmers a Standing Loan Waiver Commission to systematically evaluate and recommend debt waivers, apart from the immediate loan waiver which Mr. Gandhi has promised. Farmers, who have been protesting in various States (especially at Delhi’s borders) since February, have been asking for an immediate farm loan waiver and legal guarantee for MSP for all crops procured by the Centre. As of 2022, outstanding agricultural debt stood at ₹18.5 lakh crores. How do farm loan waivers work? Scheduled banks offer loans to individual farmers or group of farmers for agricultural or allied activities such as dairy, fishery, animal husbandry, poultry, bee-keeping and sericulture. Short-term (up to 18 months) loans are offered for raising crops during two seasons – Kharif and Rabi, while medium (more than 18 months up to 5 years) and long-term (beyond 5 years) loans are offered for purchasing agricultural machinery, irrigation and other developmental activities. Loans are also available for pre-harvest and post-harvest activities such as weeding, harvesting, sorting, and transporting farm produce. Most loans have a repayment period in installments up to five years and interest rates vary depending on the nature of loans and the issuing banks. A good harvest bodes well for both the farmers and the banks as installments get paid on time. However, in case of a poor monsoon or natural calamities, farmers may be unable to repay loans on time. As seasons go by, the loans get compounded, adding to the distress of farmers, coupled with crop loss and other damages. In such situations, the Centre or State government steps in, offering a waiver of penal interest or loan interest, rescheduling loans or a full waiver of outstanding farm loans. The liability of repayment to the banks is transferred to the government. Loan waivers are usually selective, explains Businessline . It depends on loan types (small, medium or long-term), the categories of farmers or loan sources. The waivers are introduced via a new scheme by the government, making a budgetary allowance for absorbing the debts. Why do farmers need a waiver now? “Farmers are indebted hence they are asking for waivers. We have seen protests due to it and it is during elections when everyone makes their claims,” says Dr. Dipa Sinha, Assistant Professor, School of Liberal Studies at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University Delhi. Speaking to The Hindu about farmer distress at large, she adds, “Farm distress is due to many reasons and farmers have made other demands too, like the legal guarantee for MSP.” Image for representation| Photo Credit:AKHILESH KUMAR Farmers are plagued by larger issues like disputed land holdings, low ground-water reserves, bad soil quality, rising costs of farming inputs (seeds, fertilizers, water, fuel, electricity) and low crop productivity. Due to a lack of assured remuneration for harvest, farmers are forced to borrow funds to tide through expenses, Businessline explains. The lenders are not always banks, as several small farmers do not have access to credit, leading to a dependence on private lenders (land owners or rich farmers), who levy exorbitant interest rates on such loans. This is why these indebted farmers depend on such loan waivers. “Waiver is not the long-term solution to indebtedness. It is about the larger reforms in agriculture so that farmers don’t end up in the situation that they need a waiver. If you don’t do that (reform) and farmers end up in such a situation, then you are forced to bail them out also,” explains Dr. Sinha. Terming such waivers as inevitable, Dr. Sinha draws a parallel, “If you have a fever, you have to give paracetamol (medicine). You cannot avoid it. However, you should take necessary steps, so that you don’t get the fever again.” When were farm loans last waived? Despite repeated demands from farmers for a pan-India loan waiver, the Modi government has refused to budge, often passing the buck to State governments. According to a study by State Bank of India (SBI), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana implemented a loan waiver in 2014, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra in 2017, Karnataka, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh in 2018 and lastly, Jharkhand and Maharashtra again in 2020. The total amount of debt waived off over these ten instances is ₹2.52 lakh crores. Apart from these, one of the largest loan waivers in Tamil Nadu was announced by the AIADMK government in February 2021. Announcing a ₹12,110 crore-scheme ahead of the State elections in April that year, CM E Palaniswami said outstanding short-term crop loans of all farmers will be waived off. In 2016, the AIADMK government had written off loans for around 12.02 lakh small and marginal farmers, owning land up to 5 acres, to the tune of about ₹5,320 crores. The first pan-India loan waiver was done in the 1990-91 Budget when the V.P. Singh-led National Front Government was in power. Introducing the Agricultural and Rural Debt Relief Scheme (ARDRS), then-Finance Minister Madhu Dandavate stated that the National Front government would provide relief to farmers up to ₹10,000 on select loans. As on October 2, 1989, the loans availed by farmers from cooperative banks and regional rural banks were eligible for relief under the ARDRS scheme, which was allotted ₹1000 crores. The scheme came to a close on March 31, 1991 and was not renewed.

Subramanium The second such instance of a pan-India loan waiver was announced by then-Finance Minister P Chidambaram during his 2008-09 Budget Speech. Under the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme (ADWDRS), 2008, short-term and investment loans disbursed to marginal, small and other farmers by scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks, cooperative credit institutions and local area banks up to March 31, 2007 and overdue as on December 31, 2007, and remaining unpaid until February 29, 2008 were eligible for relief or waiver. With an allocation of ₹60,000 crores, the entire ‘eligible amount’ was waived off for marginal and small farmers i.e. (< 2 hectares of land). In case of ‘other farmers’ (> 2 hectares of land), a one-time settlement (OTS) of 25% of the eligible amount was offered as a rebate, if the farmer pays the remaining 75% of the balance. The rebate would be 25% of the loan amount or ₹25,000, whichever was higher, subject to the balance payment condition. The OTS relief was estimated to cost Rs 10,000 to the Centre, while debt waiver was pegged at ₹52,000 crores. What are effects of such waivers? According to a NABARD repor t, the 1990 ARDR scheme cost the Central government ₹7825 crores. States were forced to take additional loans from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cover their share of the loan waivers and 3.2 crore farmers (53% of the borrowers) were beneficiaries of the scheme. This totalled to one-third of the outstanding farm loans, which were wiped off. Similarly, the 2008 ADWDR scheme cost the government ₹52,000 crores and over 2.9 crore farmers benefitted from the scheme. However, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report concluded that the scheme had favoured several ineligible farmers and a large number of deserving small and marginal farmers were left out during its implementation. The CAG report found that no records were maintained of farmers’ applications accepted or rejected by lending institutions, or how many fresh loans were issued due to debt waiver/relief. A NABARD study on the impact of farm loan waivers from 1987 to 2020, found that farm loan waivers were announced without any development agendas or ideologies (be it a right-wing or left-wing government), and no link between waivers and drought intensities. Till 2016, waivers were found to be announced by s=State governments who could fiscally afford it. After 2016, high fiscal debt did not deter such announcements, while the timings of such announcements were found to be crucial. Any such announcements closer to elections reaped greater gains for the party in power. Of the 21 State governments which announced waivers close to State polls, only four lost. Farm loan waivers between 2014 and 2022 A more recent SBI study (2022) found that only half of the beneficiaries of the nine farm loan waivers announced by State governments since 2014 have actually received write-offs. Maharashtra, which announced two waivers in 2017 and 2020, ensured that 68% and 91% of the beneficiaries received write-offs. The poorest implementation was by Telangana in 2014, where only 5% of 51 lakh farmers eligible for write-offs received it. States like Madhya Pradesh (12%), Jharkhand (13%), and Punjab (24%) see lower rates of implementation, while States like Chhattisgarh (100%) and Andhra Pradesh (92%) haveeffectively implemented such waivers. The study concludes, “Despite much hype and political patronage, farm loan waivers by States have failed to bring respite to intended subjects, sabotaging credit discipline in select geographies and making banks and financial institutions wary of further lending,” terming such waivers a ‘self-goal.’ What are other alternatives? “Agriculture is a sector where markets won’t work and it is hugely subsidised and supported by governments across the world. It is not just about direct subsidies to the farmers but also about creating the larger infrastructure to make agriculture more viable. This needs a number of steps to be taken, like irrigation, electricity, access to seeds, fertilisers, research in agriculture, and extension services,” says Dr. Sinha. Recommending more public investment in agriculture, she adds, “If you look at the investment in agriculture as a proportion of total expenditure or GDP, it has been falling per year. Whichever party comes to power needs to have a long-term policy for agriculture.” When asked if the now-repealed farm laws were a solution to India’s agrarian crisis, she replied in the negative. “Those farm laws were reducing the support of the government even more.” Amritsar: Workers scatter wheat for drying after heavy rains in the city, at a grain market in Amritsar, Friday, April 23, 2021.| Photo Credit:- One of the biggest farming States in the nation is Punjab, which is facing severe depletion of ground water reserves and degradation of soil due to overuse of urea. The State’s farmers have largely stuck to growing wheat and rice, even as farmers in neighbouring Haryana have switched to oilseeds. Speaking about this vicious cycle plaguing Punjab, Dr. Sinha says, “Farmers are businessmen like any other. It is not (due to an) affinity to wheat and rice that they are growing it. In Punjab these are the only two crops which are viable because the government procures it. If they incentivize mustard or pulses, farmers will make the shift. They made the (initial) shift to wheat and rice through policy – via the Green revolution.” While it has promised several schemes to boost farm income, the Modi government has not promised any farm loan waivers if elected for a third time. Meanwhile, farmers continue to protest being caught in debt traps.

        "content": "The High Court has granted Mombasa Governor Abdulswamad Nassir, Kilifi Governor Gideon Mung'aro, and Taita Taveta Governor Andrew Mwadime three days to respond to a case challenging their order to ban muguka. In a brief ruling, Justice Olga Sewe of the Mombasa High Court issued the directive to the three county chiefs after certifying as urgent the lawsuit by two activists seeking to stop the further implementation of the muguka ban in Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties. She found the case by two activists, Peter Agoro and Michael Makarina, challenging the ban on muguka to be urgent and needing to be heard expeditiously, and scheduled it for Friday, May 31, 2024. \"Upon considering the application dated May 27, 2024, together with its supporting affidavit and the documents annexed thereto, it is hereby ordered that the application is certified urgent and the application to be served forthwith,\" Justice Sewe ordered. The court directives come hours after the two activist petitioners moved to court challenging the recent executive order to ban the sale, supply, and consumption of muguka by Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta Counties. The petitioners contend that the three county chiefs' order to ban muguka is illegal and unconstitutional. \"We also seek an injunction order to be issued restraining the effect and/or implementation of the Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties Executive Order 1 of 2014,\" Agoro and Makarina seek. In their court papers, the two activists also fault the three county bosses for failure to conduct public participation before banning muguka. The petitioners cited the law protecting the sale and distribution of miraa as a cash crop in the country, saying muguka could not be isolated from miraa since they are both from the parent plant, khat. They argue that according to Kenyan laws, only Parliament through the National Assembly and Senate can declare a substance narcotic or psychotropic through legislation. \"National Agency for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NACADA) has not declared muguka a narcotic nor banned it. The Crop (Miraa) Regulations 2021 recognize both miraa and muguka as legitimate crops in Kenya,\" the duo states in their court papers. According to Agoro and Makarina, the mandate of banning a product or service protected through an act of parliament is the sole power of the national government. The two petitioners argue that the ban on muguka by the three counties is unconstitutional, illegal, and unlawful as it underscores the complex interplay between public health concerns and economic dependencies in Kenya. \"Despite Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties having legitimate constitutional mandates to guarantee the safety of their citizens, they ought to have taken the legal procedures before undertaking the ban,\" the petitioners state. The petitioners also seek several reliefs, including a declaration that the Mombasa, Kilifi, and Taita Taveta counties' Executive Order 1 of 2024 is illegal, irregular, unconstitutional, null, and void.",

        "content": "Countless people dream of the day when an expected series of fortunate events will lead to a moment of brilliant luck and happiness. Tierra Barley, a Henrico County resident in , experienced a series of extremely fortunate events that resulted in her five-figure . While many people will use significant numbers such as birthdays or anniversaries when playing the lottery, Tierra simply she told the Virginia Lottery. Her luck took an incredible turn on May 8, when five of those numbers matched the day's drawing, winning her an incredible $50,000. But just before the drawing, Tierra almost had a turn of bad luck as she almost lost her ticket. After buying her ticket at Varina Superstore Supermarket on Darbytown Road in Henrico, she accidentally left it in the store while she went to take her daughter to the park. When she returned in search of her ticket, Tierra found someone else buying Powerball tickets, and they turned out to be very helpful in returning her ticket. She chose to use the numbers she found inside a fortune cookie and matched four of the five numbers and the Powerball. The numbers were 7-41-43-44-51 with a Powerball number 5, confirmed Virginia lottery. Another lucky lottery winner decided to pick up a ticket along with his chicken at the grocery store on his way home from work - a move that would see him ultimately winning $500,000. Russell Gomes, of South Boston, had just finished work when he stopped at the Food Lion on Halifax Road to buy some chicken. He decided to try his luck and buy a Magnificent 7s lottery ticket, scratching it off in the parking lot to reveal the $500,000 top prize. Speaking to lottery officials Mr Gomes said: \"I really didn't believe it. It feels great!\" Powerball is an American lottery game offered in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and overseen by the Multi-State Lottery Association. The odds of winning a Powerball are 1 in 25 and the prize money can go up to $120 million. The famous lottery system was launched in 1987 after the localites voted to start a state-operated lottery game. Since its inception, the Virginia lottery has supported K-12 public education in a commonwealth, the website confirms. Moreover, in 2023, it amounted to more than $867 million that went to public education in the state. The funds are about 10% of the commonwealth's budget for K-12 schools distributed throughout Virginia's counties.",

        "description": "From the origin of the traditional jewellery style to the things to keep in mind while investing in a jadau piece, Rohan Narang, managing director, Hazoorilal Legacy, reveals it all",
        "content": "a hallmark of India's rich cultural heritage, is experiencing a resurgence in the contemporary fashion landscape. Known for its intricate Jadau involves embedding precious stones such as diamonds, rubies, and emeralds into softened gold, creating exquisite pieces that exude opulence and tradition. This resurgence can be traced back to Bollywood’s influence, particularly through films like where Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s regal adornments captivated audiences, reigniting interest in traditional . Bachchan's wedding further cemented Jadau’s status as a timeless bridal choice, inspiring many to embrace its grandeur. Renowned filmmaker has significantly contributed to this revival. His collaborations with Shri Paramani Jewels for movies like and now the web series have showcased the beauty of Jadau on an epic scale, with meticulously crafted pieces that highlight the intricate artistry involved. Actor Aditi Rao Hydari, playing the role of courtesan Bibbojaan, epitomises the still-existing opulence of the British Raj era. During the movie promotions, Rao Hydari was seen in a multi-coloured floral anarkali paired with meticulously crafted Jadau earrings by designer Neety Singh. The art of jadau is not just a relic of the past but a vibrant part of Influencers and brides alike are blending these traditional pieces with contemporary styles, creating a fusion that celebrates both heritage and innovation. As Jadau jewellery continues to grace red carpets and , its enduring elegance promises to captivate generations to come. The prized craft of holds a special place in our ethnic wardrobes. An uncut diamond piece is considered a prized possession in any Indian , and is often lovingly passed down through generations as an heirloom. New Delhi-based Hazoorilal Legacy, one of the oldest jewellery houses in the country today, is known for experimenting with traditional jadau designs to serve the modern connoisseur. spoke to Rohan Narang, managing director, Hazoorilal Legacy to get a microscopic view at all that goes into the making of this craft. Excerpts below. Jadau work was introduced in India by the Mughals, but practiced and perfected by the skilled craftsman of , which to date is considered as the hub of jadau jewellery. It is essentially a technique of jewellery-making wherein precious gemstones such as uncut diamonds, pearls, and rubies are embedded into gold. Gold is actually turned into a frame on which precious stones are studded without the use of any adhesive. Jadau derives its name from the colloquial term ‘jad’ (which means to embed), and is commonly used in , and meenakari jewellery. The design of the jewellery is made by [a group of artisans called the] Chiterias, followed by engraving and spacing using pliable gold, which is done by Ghaarias. Once the stones are naturally set in the gold casing, the enameller decorates the back of the jewellery in meenakari work. The time to produce jadau varies, depending upon the piece that is being . It’s a tedious process requiring utmost care and finesse. So while a smaller piece can be finished in a couple of days, an elaborate piece can actually take up to a few months to be ready. It’s one of the of and has an interesting history behind it. The Mughals introduced it to India, but this workmanship was perfected and made native by the artisans of Rajasthan and Gujarat. It requires a skilled and unique craftsmanship, which of course, makes it very compelling. The traditional form of jewellery is made without any interference of technology, which increases the man hours [it takes to create it], and makes it extremely valuable. It’s pure hand work. If you ask me, it is surely a reminder of the rich cultural heritage of our country. Before investing in a , one should always check the purity of the gold being used. The jadau workmanship is usually done in 22-24k gold. The casing in which the stones are embedded should not be less than 22k gold. Another important point is to check if the stones are treated or natural. One should also be aware of the various treatments that are used to enhance the look of uncut diamonds and other precious and semi-precious in jadau jewellery. It’s very delicate and needs to be handled with utmost care. The should be kept neatly wrapped in padded cloth box or an airtight container to minimise any kind of exposure to moisture and other pollutants. This helps to protect the look and feel of the jewellery. It should be the last thing you should wear when you’re getting ready, as perfumes and hairsprays can corrode the , and it should also be the very first thing you take off.",

As the saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder. For one , his heart grows for cookies. Who can blame him? But, of course, dogs cannot have cookies since these desserts often include toxic ingredients to dogs such as chocolate, raisins, nutmeg or macadamia nuts. Cookies are also high in sugar, butter, and flour, and while not toxic, these ingredients are harmful to dogs and can lead to obesity. Despite how harmful can be, this dog still tries sneaking one past his owner in a May 16 . He thought he was being sly, showing his owner innocent eyes, and distracting her with . She wasn't born yesterday and he was caught red-pawed. The text on the video reads: \"Life with a Lab.\" This dog truly thought he could sneak one past his owner by staying calm under pressure as she started badgering him with questions and demanding he open his mouth. He kept moving his head to avoid his owner prying his mouth open, but it was not enough. The owner managed to maneuver his mouth and reveal he did indeed steal a cookie. Defeated, he finally gave in. He let her win this time. But the owner knows there will be plenty more battles to come as this isn't the first time he tried getting into items he shouldn't. The owner told via TikTok, that he tries to steal items often and that shoes are his personal favorite. The video quickly reached viral status, bringing over 6.6 million views, 508,200 likes, and 2,090 comments. \"He just wanted a little sweet treat,\" defended a viewer. Another pointed out: \"Distraction paw shake.\" somehow always think doing a trick will make owners forget what they've done. One TikTok user wrote: \"He said, 'Chocy lab get chocy cookie.

        "content": "The Attorney general of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi has advocated for the scrapping of State Independent Electoral commissions. Fagbemi made the call on Monday at the National Discourse on Nigeria’s Security Challenges and good governance at the local government level held in Abuja. According to Fagbemi, inspite of the constitutional provisions that were meant to safeguard local governments’ autonomy, there have been cases of arbitrary dissolution, abolition or fragmentation of local governments by the higher tiers of government, particularly the state governments. The Minister contended that the provision of the constitution under section 162 (5-8) on State Joint Local Government Account, which empowered the state Assemblies to decide the revenue to their local government facilitated state encroachment on local revenues. “Cases of state hijacking of local government revenues abound from 1999 to date In consequence of these weak constitutional provisions, the lifespan of the local government councils is at the mercy of the state governments. “There is no consistent pattern of local government elections. Some State Governors dissolved their Councils and appoint Caretaker Committees. There are several cases of abuse of the Joint Account by different state governments across Nigeria. “This has undermined the financial autonomy of the local government, as well as their ability to deliver on their statutory responsibilities On the fourth point relating to observed problems/challenges in the way we are implementing the constitutional/legal provisions and what those problems are:Under a true federal structure, the autonomy of local government is adequately guaranteed.” Fagbemi further explained that one of the persisting challenges of Nigeria’s federalism is the persistent failure to grant autonomy to local government as the third tier of government. Read also: Keyamo declares Nigeria Air project fraudulent, says it remains suspended “Although, the LGAs as the third tier of government in Nigeria and as enshrined in the constitution is ostensibly meant to serve as are an institutional framework for effective service delivery to the grassroots and the overall national development; however, LGAs in Nigeria have been performing poorly in provision of essential services to the people due to absence of autonomy. “The 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria did not provide adequately for the political autonomy of the local governments. The resultant effects of these inadequacies are that the state governments have the discretion to determine the nature, content and direction of local government elections and political activities. “The failure of the constitution to articulate a clear line of authorities to both the state and local authorities and the continuing debate over the involvement of state governments in distributing local government allocation from the Federation Account has affected the capacity of LGAs to provide essential services at the grassroots.Rather than function as a tier of government, LGAs have been operating as an appendage of the State governments in Nigeria. “The constitutional provisions on State Joint Local Government Account (section 162 (5-8)) have placed the local government councils in a political bondage.Politically, due to the flaws in the electoral process in the country, what is obtained is a virtual selection and not election of local government functionaries. “Local government chairmen are always imposed on the people by the State Governors. This erodes the three elements of good governance at the local government level, which are citizens’ participation, transparency and accountability. The imposed chairman will be accountable only to the Governor rather than the people. This results in lack of transparency and non-involvement of the citizens. “High level and rampant corruption.The absence of administrative and fiscal autonomy to LGAs created a dependency situation than independent one conceptualized under a true federal system of Govt. The local governments in many instances have continued to suffer fiscal emasculation in the hands of state governments. In all these unwholesome abuses, Sections 7 and 162 of the 1999 Constitution among others have been an escape route for many State Governments to manipulate the Local government and reduce same to a mere department in the Governors’ office. “State joint local government account (SJLGA) has been the anti-development instrument used to frustrate every progressive and patriotic action to make the Local Government work since the return of the Country to democracy in 1999.And finally, what are the solutions/recommendations to the observed problems/challenges: LGAs are created by the Constitution. ”Accordingly, in a tiered system like ours, constitutional amendment is imperative before a new system of local government administration can be instituted.Good governance at any level of governance is not possible without the transfer of authority, responsibilities, capacity and resources. “This is even more so for the LGAs.Accordingly, constitutional reforms should, among other things, aim to: increase fiscal and administrative autonomy of Local Govt system to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency; fiscal autonomy should be balanced with fiscal restraint by strengthening the internal controls system, processes and infrastructure for public financial management;ensure inclusiveness and citizens participation in the governance of LGAs.allow the legislative arms of local governments to decide what they should do with revenue accruing to them;need to capacitate LGAs for effective governance. Capacity building involves equipping local government officials with the necessary skills and knowledge to perform their duties effectively. control corruption and institute transparency and integrity in financial accountability of LGAs. ”Transparent and accountable governance fosters public trust, while efficient service delivery enhances legitimacy and stability.Investing more in local government administration with institutionalised internal and external oversightEnsure adherence to the rule of law by upholding the principles of justice, fairness, and accountability Conclusion: “The ability of LGAs to perform developmental functions, particularly in a federal system like Nigeria revolves around the nature of the relationship between the federal, state and local government any major reform of the Local Govt System will invariably require the alteration of the Constitution and other incidental legislations touching on Local Government administration.On the other hand, constitutional alteration can only be achieved through consensus building and commonality of purpose between the three tiers, as with the three arms of Government. “We are therefore challenged to play our respective roles, when called upon to do so. The best time to act is now.To achieve this, many experts have proposed that there is need for the scrapping of the state independent electoral commission. Their functions and powers should be transferred to the independent national electoral commission because the state independent electoral commission remain an appendage to every incumbent governor. “This is perceived as the root cause of the problem of local government administration in Nigeria. I commend the leadership of the House of Representatives for this bold initiative, which not only signifies an intent but also the desire to fully reposition our governance structures and systems, which will enable us to find lasting solutions to our enduring security and governance challenges. “I happily look forward to further engagements on this crucial issue with the leadership and members of the House of Representatives, as with the National Assembly at large.” Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "description": "Rafael Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 today in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favourite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100 percent sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after today’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100 percent sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “If it’s the last time, I enjoyed it.” 🫶🧡 pic.twitter.com/7DApnv0rxD It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It’s such a great honour. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” Related articles Big interview: The woman who could save NZ tennis Paul Lewis: Novak Djokovic reveals a new side at the French Open No 23!

        "content": "After charging $1 a ride for its first three years, the Buffalo Heritage Carousel announced Saturday it's going to a different pricing model as it begins its fourth season of operation. The waterfront attraction at Canalside will now be asking people to pay what they can, with $1 being the minimum. \"A priority of this institution has always been to make this ride very, very accessible,\" board member Mark DePalma said. \"Up until this point we have been charging $1 a ride, a flat fee for everyone. But we recognize it costs quite a bit more to operate this carousel, so we are shifting to a donation-based ticket model, where we are asking people to pay what they can, with a minimum of a dollar, and to pay it forward.\" Two people who played a key role in making the solar-powered carousel possible were also honored with a plaque on the carousel's wall. Joan Bozer worked for years to see her dream of a solar-powered carousel become a reality in 2021, and Walter Simpson was a champion of alternative energy as the University at Buffalo's energy officer. Both started the Western New York Sustainable Energy Association. \"We are going to mount this plaque so that everyone understands that these two individuals had a pivotal role in this amazing, environmentally-focused and forward-thinking carousel,\" board member Marika Woods-Frankenstein said.

        "content": "No opening-round match in French Open history has garnered so much interest as the contest between Rafael Nadal and Alexander Zverev on Monday. Like many enthusiasts, Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz, and Iga Swiatek also made sure to witness Nadal play in his potentially final match at Roland Garros... even if it means that they have to sacrifice crucial rest of their own. Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz are two young players in the tennis world who grew up idolizing Rafael Nadal. After finishing off their first-round battles, both these prodigies made it to the stands to showcase their support to the King of Clay. It was also pleasantly surprising to witness Novak Djokovic present in the arena. Of course, the Serb shares a mutual respect for his long-time rival. But considering that Djokovic has his first-round clash on Tuesday, it is heartwarming to see him dedicate his resting time to support Nadal. While the stadium erupted “Vamos Rafa” chants, Zverev became a party spoiler and handed Rafa his first-ever opening-round loss at Roland Garros. Alexander Zverev Snapped an Insane Rafael Nadal Streak Apart from eliminating Rafael Nadal from what could mostly be his final French Open tournament, Alexander Zverev also snapped the Spaniard’s insane streak of winning his past 80 matches in the Grand Slam against all players except Novak Djokovic. Alexander Zverev won 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to avenge his 2022 French Open semi-final loss to Rafael Nadal, which also makes the victory more significant.",

        "content": "Baked custard was my childhood get-well dish. My mother made it for me when I was ill. As a disciple of the nutritional guru of the day, Adelle Davis, Mom put bigtime value on dishes that were rich in protein. She liked the primary ingredients, milk and eggs. She closed her eyes to sugar, an ingredient she usually eschewed, probably because she thought a treat might be the cure. I love custard to this day. I like to top the chilled treat with fresh strawberries, although later in the summer I might substitute small wedges of stone fruit, such as apricots or plums. Yield: 6 servings 2 1/2 cups milk 3 large eggs 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups fresh strawberries, trimmed and cut into halves if small or quarters if large 1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, depending on sweetness of berries Optional garnish: Sprigs of fresh mint or peppermint 1. Adjust oven rack to middle position. Preheat to 350 degrees. 2. Place milk in large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Scald milk on medium-high heat. To scald means to heat below the boiling point. Remove from heat. 3. In large bowl, whisk milk, eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla to combine. Whisking constantly, add hot milk little by little to egg mixture. If you add the hot milk too quickly, it might curdle THE eggs. 4.. Ladle mixture into 6 (1-cup) custard cups. Place cups in a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Add enough hot water to the pan to come 1 inch up the sides of the cups. Place in oven and bake 40 minutes or until set; when pressed with a finger it should feel bouncy. Remove cups from water.

        "description": "Later in the year you might try making the dish with stone fruit such as apricot or plum.",
        "content": "Baked custard was my childhood get-well dish. My mother made it for me when I was ill. As a disciple of the nutritional guru of the day, Adelle Davis, Mom put bigtime value on dishes that were rich in protein. She liked the primary ingredients, milk and eggs. She closed her eyes to sugar, an ingredient she usually eschewed, probably because she thought a treat might be the cure. I love custard to this day. I like to top the chilled treat with fresh strawberries, although later in the summer I might substitute small wedges of stone fruit, such as apricots or plums. Baked Custard with Strawberries Yield: 6 servings INGREDIENTS 2 1/2 cups milk 3 large eggs 1/2 cup granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 3/4 cups fresh strawberries, trimmed and cut into halves if small or quarters if large 1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, depending on sweetness of berries Optional garnish: Sprigs of fresh mint or peppermint DIRECTIONS 1. Adjust oven rack to middle position. Preheat to 350 degrees. 2. Place milk in large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Scald milk on medium-high heat. To scald means to heat below the boiling point. Remove from heat. 3. In large bowl, whisk milk, eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla to combine. Whisking constantly, add hot milk little by little to egg mixture. If you add the hot milk too quickly, it might curdle THE eggs. 4.. Ladle mixture into 6 (1-cup) custard cups. Place cups in a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. Add enough hot water to the pan to come 1 inch up the sides of the cups. Place in oven and bake 40 minutes or until set; when pressed with a finger it should feel bouncy. Remove cups from water. Cool for 1 hour and refrigerate. 5. Meanwhile, place the strawberries in a bowl and sprinkle with sugar; gently toss and leave at room temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. Toss again; cover and refrigerate. 6. Serve chilled custard topped with strawberries, and if desired, sprigs of fresh mint.

        "description": "California has no minor age requirement for child marriage as long as a parent or guardian and a judge consents.",
        "content": "Actress and political activist Alyssa Milano has singled out a California Democrat for the amendments he proposed to an assembly bill in April that blocked it from appearing before the assembly's Judiciary Committee. Child marriage has long been a taboo subject in the U.S., but under certain circumstances—such as approval from a judge or a parent or guardian—it is permitted in several states, including California. Child marriage occurs when one or both parties is under the age of 18, but in most cases, it occurs between an underage girl and an adult man. California has no minor age requirement for child marriage as long as a parent or guardian and a judge consents. In February, the California state assembly proposed a bill that would prohibit marriage for children under 18. However, —and Fraidy Reiss—a forced marriage survivor who founded Unchained At Last, a nonprofit organization fighting against child marriage—have written an opinion piece for the accusing Assemblymember Ash Kalra of proposing amendments that prevented the bill from achieving a hearing at the Judiciary Committee. reached out to Kalra by email for comment. Milano and Reiss said that more than 8,000 minors are married in California each year, most of them young girls. \"Child marriage gives a 'get out of jail free' card to would-be child rapists, because statutory rape within marriage is not a crime. Child marriage is a harmful practice that devastates sexual and reproductive rights,\" the women argued. Milano and Reiss alleged that Kalra was swayed by arguments from liberal organizations including Planned Parenthood, the Children's Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union against prohibiting child marriage. Last year, California for children under 18, but the aforementioned organizations spoke out against the legislative proposal. They said that imposing an age requirement on marriage could impede a minor's ability to seek an abortion, among other concerns, reported. \"Their arguments are perplexing. They claim banning child marriage would drive minors in abusive relationships 'underground,' out of reach of social services,\" Milano and Reiss wrote in the opinion piece. \"Does anyone believe a minor in an abusive dating relationship benefits from marrying their abuser? Or that a minor with abusive parents can access social services only if their parents enter them into marriage?\" According to the , any form of child marriage is considered a \"human rights violation and a harmful practice that disproportionately affects women and girls globally, preventing them from living their lives free from all forms of violence.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "Ahead of 29th May, Governor Dauda Lawal of Zamfara State has commissioned a modern Quranic School in the company of the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III in the Gummi local government area. Speaking during the commissioning ceremony, Governor Dauda, said the establishment of the school is part of the campaign promises aimed at promoting combined Islamic Religious Knowledge and Western education. Other projects visited by Governor Lawal were the newly constructed hospital in Nasarawa Burkullu under the Bukkuyum local government area and the other renovated hospital in the Maru local government area of the state. The Governor while delivering his speech at Gummi, emphasized the need to educate the growing children in the modern Quranic Schools in the state with a view to prepare them with peace-loving and brother-keeper attitudes. He further cried that the alarming rate of insecurity bedevilled the state and the entire nation was the handiwork of evil who always accommodates illiteracy as his sole tool to derail society into crimes and cruelties. “Zamfara has been one of the states that slipped into the target of banditry and other heinous crimes therefore, desperately needs to be educated to avoid producing crime-living generations instead”, Governor Lawal has stressed. In his remarks shortly after cutting the tape, the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar III, positioned that, the commissioned school is unique as it would not graduate students who will later become street beggars. “This type of Quranic school would teach, train and discipline its students to become lucrative products in the society as it doubles as a ground to inculcate patriotism and both ethnic and religious tolerance”, the Sultan has added.",

        "content": "The Dallas Mavericks have an opportunity to reach the NBA Finals for just the third time in franchise history when they seek to close out a sweep of the visiting Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals Tuesday night. The Mavericks scored 14 of the final 17 points for a 116-107 home win in Game 3 on Sunday night that left them five wins away from their second-ever NBA title, having captured the crown in their last visit to basketball's grand stage in 2011. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points each Sunday, but the Mavericks also got key contributions from P.J. Washington, Daniel Gafford and Derrick Jones Jr. in a win that gave them a 3-0 series lead. Gafford, acquired in February from the Washington Wizards, had to put in yeoman's work after big-man sidekick Dereck Lively II departed with a sprained neck in the third quarter. Gafford wound up playing a playoff career-high 29 minutes and saved his best for last, blocking a Mike Conley layup attempt with 56 seconds left before slamming down a Doncic alley-oop pass 22 seconds later to clinch the win. Lively went straight to the locker room after catching Karl-Anthony Towns' knee to the back of his head while falling in pursuit of a rebound. He reportedly passed a concussion test, but his status for Game 4 remains uncertain. With or without Lively, Gafford acknowledged after Sunday's win that the Mavericks' success inside is tied to the unselfish play of Doncic and Irving. \"We're trying to find the seams and just what can put us in position to where we can help the team,\" Gafford said. \"Everybody just put trust in us to just finish around the basket. And that's what we did.\" The last time the Mavericks had a 3-0 lead in a playoff series was in 2011 when they finished off the sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers in the West semifinals en route to the title. When informed after the Game 3 win that no team in NBA history has ever blown a 3-0 lead in a playoff series, Irving wanted none of it. \"It means absolutely nothing right now,\" Irving said of a 154 times a team won the first three games of a playoff series. \"Going into Game 4, it's still 0-0. And that's the type of mentality we have in that locker room.\" After being held to 33.3-percent shooting in two home losses, Anthony Edwards broke through for Minnesota with an 11-for-24, 26-point outing in Game 3. But All-Star teammate Towns continued to struggle, missing all eight of his 3-point attempts on a night when he totaled 14 points on 5-for-18 shooting. Towns has now gone 15-for-54 overall and 3-for-22 from deep in the series, yet seemed unperturbed when asked about it following the Game 3 defeat. \"I put up 1,500 shots a day. Shot so well all playoffs,\" Towns said. \"Confidence extremely high, and to be having these unfortunate bounces, these looks are just not going in. It's tough. \"I don't mean to smile, but you have to laugh. It's very disappointing.\" The Timberwolves have trailed 3-0 in a best-of-seven series just one time previously in their history and responded well, forcing the eventual champion Denver Nuggets to a fifth game last year in the first round by winning 114-108 at home in Game 4.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese three short-squeeze stocks with high short interest could be prime candidates for a massive breakout.The post 3 Stocks That Could Skyrocket in a Massive Gamma Short Squeeze appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Short-squeeze stocks have seen an explosion in interest after the recent Roaring Kitty saga that sent many meme stocks soaring to dizzying heights. Now, before we dive in, I would like to mention that meme stocks are something that are generally best avoided, like the plague. Yes, certain meme stocks did surge, but the chance of actually timing any sort of investment correctly is slim to none. Not only that, but most of the mania is short-lived. Thus, you would have to sell at the precise right time to make the most of any rally. And that’s a near-impossible feat for retail investors. In fact, retail investors lost billions in just the past week alone as meme stocks came crashing back down to earth. However, that doesn’t mean you should avoid short-squeeze plays altogether. In my opinion, you can make some sensible bets that aren’t excessively high-risk and provide some asymmetric upside. These stocks are still risky, but at least they aren’t perpetually decline. Furthermore, it’s possible their underlying businesses can likely survive even if a short squeeze doesn’t materialize. Here are three such short-squeeze stocks to consider right now. Upstart (UPST) Upstart’s (NASDAQ: UPST ) recent Q1 results show the company is navigating current economic challenges with foresight and flexibility. While revenue of $127.8 million was $2.71 million above estimates (and rose 24.2% year-over-year) , the company’s earnings per share also beat estimates by 20%. Still, consumers are simply borrowing less, and it’s having a big impact on Upstart. Banks are a lot more cautious when partnering up with Upstart, as they’d rather play it safe than experiment with AI technology. That said, I see a bright future ahead once interest rate cuts begin, and lending volume increases. I’m encouraged by the steps management is proactively taking to cut costs responsibly, including reducing annual personnel expenses by $20 million and computing costs by 23%. The launch of personal loans secured by automobiles in seven states should help more qualified borrowers access loans at lower rates. With ASPL rates 20% lower on average than alternatives, this product seems well-positioned to meet the affordability needs of consumers. Plus, funding is improving on Upstart’s platform for banks, credit unions, and other financial backers. However, with consumer credit risk and interest rates remaining high for now, loan volumes will likely stay restrained in the short term. Upstart is wisely scaling back non-research uses of its own funds for new loans during this period of uncertainty. I think it is only a matter of time before UPST stock heads higher once interest rate cuts start. Some big quarterly beats should cause a short squeeze, considering the stock’s current short interest sits at 32.2% . This is definitely one of the top short-squeeze stocks to buy, in my books. iRobot (IRBT) iRobot (NASDAQ: IRBT ) has been one of the worst-performing stocks in the market this year, and over a longer-term time horizon. The Roomba company is down 94% from its peak, but I see promising trends emerging. T he company’s Q1 results exceeded what analysts had predicted. Total revenue of $150 million surpassed estimates by over $5 million, though sales were still 6.4% lower than the previous year. The company’s aggressive restructuring efforts seem to be paying off, with operating losses shrinking to $40 million. Notably, iRobot also beat earnings per share estimates by nearly 24%. If this number continues to improve faster than analysts think, the upside potential with IRBT stock could be huge. Those who have bet against the stock might be in trouble. The company is getting $94 million in termination fees from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ). This alone is nearly a third of IRBT’s entire market cap. Furthermore, the short interest in this name is above 30%, so any positive news could trigger a rush by short sellers to cover their bets. The appointment of turnaround expert Gary Cohen as the new CEO may provide that catalyst. Regardless, iRobot still faces strong headwinds. Gross profit margins of 24.6% remain squeezed due to intense competition and weaker consumer spending on home appliances. While management is wisely focusing on cost-cutting, making operations more efficient, and participating in the more affordable product segment, a true recovery will depend on growth resuming on the top line. When that will happen remains uncertain, hence the high short interest. Guess? (GES) Guess? (NYSE: GES ) is among the most aggressively-shorted stocks in the market right now. The company sports a short interest ratio of 32.4%, which is quite surprising since this company just had an incredible quarter. Additionally, I believe the company’s stock could climb much higher. Revenues grew 9% year-over-year to $891 million , surpassing estimates by more than $36 million. Even more impressively, adjusted earnings per share of $2.01 far exceeded expectations by 44 cents. Management highlighted that all five of their business divisions increased revenues, with Americas Wholesale, Asia, Licensing, and Europe leading the way. Despite ongoing supply chain challenges, Guess? also finished out the year with inventory down a healthy 9%. With the stock still trading at a reasonable price relative to earnings, the exceptional results of the fourth quarter sets the stage for a potential short squeeze. If this momentum continues, those who have bet against the stock may feel forced to cover their positions. The company’s recently-announced special dividend of $2.25 per share simply adds another catalyst to the list. Currently, GES stock provides a dividend yield of 4.84%, and unsurprisingly, analysts are bullish on this name.

        "description": "Karl-Anthony Towns said he takes 1,500 shots while discussing struggles against the Dallas Mavericks, but the \"Inside the NBA\" crew wasn't buying it.",
        "content": "What a brutal Western Conference Finals it has been for and the . After the first two rounds where they have shown amazing potential in sweeping Phoenix and taking down the defending champs Denver, Minnesota has fallen back down to earth as they stare at a 3-0 series deficit against the . Their struggles in the fourth quarter are one of the main reasons why they have been unable to beat Dallas, but Towns' inefficiency shooting from the field has been heavily concerning. It also doesn't do Towns any favors that in his attempt to alleviate concerns, he says that he's taking 1,500 practice shots every day. The \"Inside The NBA\" crew . Take forward , for example. \"KAT cappin'. Ain’t nobody shooting 1500 shots a day, right now,\" - Draymond Green Charles Barkley was even more blunt on the topic, stating that \"first of all, [Towns] is lying.\" Towns Struggled Again In Game 3 With Dallas having another strong performance, especially in the fourth quarter, to get a 116-107 victory against Minnesota in Game 3, Towns' showing became an immediate point of criticism. He finished with a stat line of 14 points, 11 rebounds, and three assists. Not only was he providing enough scoring-wise, he also shot 5-of-18 from the field and missed all eight of his three-point attempts. It has summed up a series where Towns has been unable to showcase his shooting prowess. In the West Finals, he is averaging 15 points, 8.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and a steal on horrendous shooting splits of 27.8 percent from the field and 13.6 percent from downtown. Compared to the first two rounds, where he shot 51.7 percent overall and 44 percent from beyond the arc, his steep decline has held back Minnesota's offense from being able to explode against Dallas' defense. And with all three games being close as they were decided in the fourth quarter, Towns' inability to make an impact has created the hole the team finds themselves in now. While he did not take the podium in the postgame press conference after Game 3, he spoke to reporters in the hallway. He told them that he's attempting 1,500 shots every day in an attempt to lessen the concern some may have for his shooting woes in the series so far. \"I shot so well all playoffs. Confidence is extremely high. And to be having these unfortunate bounces and shots just not going in, it’s tough. It’s tough for sure. Confidence wise, I just have to keep shooting,\" Karl-Anthony Towns That did not go over well, especially with the \"Inside The NBA\" crew picking apart his statement. NBA legend Charles Barkley sees his shot selection from the three-point line as a huge issue, especially with that shot not falling for Towns as it was in previous series. \"If he’s shooting 1,500 threes, that’s the problem. It’s the types of shots he is getting. That’s the problem. It has nothing to do with him not working on his game. If he’s just out there shooting threes, he’s still 4 for 32,\" - Charles Barkley What's Next For Towns and Minnesota Minnesota's season now hangs in the balance, and it requires Towns to at least play solid for the remainder of the series. A 3-0 series comeback seems improbable, especially with all 154 teams having failed to do so throughout NBA history, but the Timberwolves have a chance to attempt it as long as Towns and return to the form they had in the first two rounds. Minnesota will fight to keep their playoff run alive when they face Dallas in Game 4, taking place on May 28 at 8 p.m. EST.",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Travelers flocking to airports over the weekend shattered previous records ahead of the Memorial Day holiday. The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3 million passengers on Friday, marking the highest single-day total in history. This summer, over 270 million passengers are anticipated to travel on U.S. airlines, reflecting a 6% increase from last year. Following the holiday, the Federal Aviation Administration forecasts this Memorial Day weekend will be the busiest in 14 years. Road travelers are also expected to set new records. According to AAA, more than 38 million people will have traveled by car over the long weekend, the highest number since tracking began in 2000. Hertz highlights the cities with the highest rental car demand as Orlando, Denver, Atlanta, Boston, and Las Vegas. Conversely, severe storms across multiple states over the weekend disrupted travel in some regions. Parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas experienced extensive damage due to tornadoes, downed trees, and destroyed buildings, resulting in at least 20 fatalities. The storms caused flight delays and cancellations, and storm-hit roads faced blockages. By 8:30 a.m. on Monday, over 1,000 flights had been delayed and nearly 130 canceled within, into, or out of the U.S. for the Memorial Day holiday.",

While the Seattle-based carrier has specifically done so through its Fallen Soldier Program, it more recently has featured three aircraft in a dedicated to service members. Plane spotters in Washington have spotted a fourth aircraft donning the patriotic paint scheme. The plane, which is believed to be Alaska’s second , is expected to join the carrier’s fleet The airframe, registered as N806AK, was first noticed last month at Renton Municipal Airport (RNT) with its wingtip painted in the US flag colors and its tail partially painted. The livery comprises a red stripe and blue fuselage with the phrase “Honoring Those Who Serve” displayed above the windows. Symbolic crests near the rear of the aircraft represent the airline’s Fallen Soldier Program, while an “Alaska Airlines Salutes” medallion with six stars is featured near the aircraft’s nose. The stars, along with six stripes on the engine cowls, represent the six branches of the US Armed Forces – the US Air Force, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and Space Force. Earlier this month, the fully painted aircraft was seen departing from King County International Airport (BFI) on a test flight. According to data from , the aircraft had flown 49 minutes and returned to BFI. Last week, it performed another test flight.

The Fallen Soldier Program was established in 2011 to ensure the proper military protocols are implemented when transporting the remains of those who made the ultimate sacrifice to serve in the armed forces. The program allows the bodies to be flown to their final resting place with the highest honor. Alaska also honors members of the armed forces with customized baggage carts. They are stationed at 15 airports across the country to respectfully the remains of service members to and from aircraft and are available for use by all airlines. the airline said.",

The taikonauts aboard Tiangong—Ye Guangfu, Li Cong, and Li Guangsu—have reported instances of swimming upside down, backward, and in circular motions, suggesting that microgravity is having an effect on their spatial awareness. The zebrafish were launched aboard Shenzhou-18, which carried them, as well as a batch of hornwort, to orbit on April 25, 2024. The aim of the project is to create a self-sustaining ecosystem, studying the effects of both microgravity and radiation on the development and growth of these species. As a test subject, zebrafish have several advantages. Their short reproductive and development cycle, and transparent eggs, allow scientists to study their growth quickly and effectively, and their genetic makeup shares similarities with humans, potentially offering insights that are relevant to human health . The zebrafish genome has been fully sequenced, and for these reasons zebrafish are commonly used in scientific experiments on Earth. Seeing how these well-studied creatures behave in such an extreme environment may have a lot to tell us about the life and development of vertebrates across species while exposed to microgravity. The taikonauts aboard Tiangong perform feeding and water sampling at regular intervals , and cameras allow scientists on the ground to monitor the aquarium. This is not the first time fish have been to space. Starting in 2012, a Japanese research project brought medaka and zebrafish to the International Space Station for study in a similar aquatic habitat. The results of those studies revealed a decrease in bone density in the fish within just ten days. Human astronauts experience similar effects in orbit, though not on such quick time scales, and they can be mitigated somewhat through rigorous exercise routines. Earlier fish in space include a mummichog aboard Skylab 3 in 1973 (and again in 1975 aboard Apollo-Soyuz), and zebrafish aboard the Soviet space station Salyut 5 in 1976. A variety of fish reached orbit aboard space shuttles in the 1990s, too. The health and sustainability of animal life in space is a key area of research for human spaceflight efforts. If humans are to travel on long-term space missions, like those required to reach Mars, then understanding the biological implications of space travel is vital. These zebrafish are the latest in a long line of experiments undertaken in this pressing area of research. Provided by Universe Today",

Thank you for your service, sacrifice and selflessness!#MemorialDay2024 (Artist unknown)' Bette Midler shared, 'Today is #MemorialDay in the US, so read #FlandersFields, but spare a thought for the millions who died from the senseless hate humans have rained down on each other in the last 100 years since then, and the one million #Americans who perished during Covid just a few years ago.' Memorial Day tends to mark the unofficial start of summer for many Americans, though the season really begins with the Summer Solstice in mid-June. The annual holiday - which is celebrated on the last Monday of May - is a federal holiday in the United States for mourning the U.S. military personnel who have died while serving in the United States armed forces. Since the Revolutionary War ended, 646,596 American troops have died in battle and more than 539,000 died from other, non-combat related causes. It was formerly observed on May 30 from 1868 to 1970. Flag etiquette on Memorial Day is unique, according to the Farmers Almanac . At sunrise, flags are to be raised to full staff briskly, then lowered to half staff position, where they will remain until noon. See guidelines for flying the American Flag. Traditionally, on Memorial Day (U.S.), volunteers often place small American flags on each grave site at national cemeteries. A national moment of remembrance takes place at 3:00 p.m. local time. Consider visiting a local cemetery to place flags; many organizations would be grateful for volunteers. Contact your local American Legion post, Daughters of the American Revolution, or Boy or Girl Scouts troops. The custom of honoring ancestors by cleaning cemeteries and decorating graves is an ancient and worldwide tradition. In early rural America, it was usually performed in summer and was an occasion for family reunions and picnics. The ritual of visiting family graves and memorials was never a morbid tradition. Rather, it was an annual act of remembrance, as well as a chance to clean and decorate family memorials. Often, families would picnic as well; cemeteries were often the only open green spaces in crowded cities. Memorial Day was originally known as Decoration Day, starting with the American Civil War. It's believed that the tradition of honoring the dead was inspired by the way Southern states decorated the graves of both Confederate and Union soldiers with flowers, wreaths, and flags.

On May 5, 1866, Waterloo, New York, hosted its own community-wide event that, in 1966, led to President Lyndon Johnson declaring the town as the birthplace of Decoration Day. Meanwhile, on May 5, 1868, inspired by the suggestion of veteran, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic (a fraternal organization of Union Civil War veterans), issued General Order No. 11, designating the 30th of May as an annual day of remembrance. The idea caught on. U.S. President Joe Biden honored fallen soldiers during the 156th observance of Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery outside the nation's capital on Monday. Biden placed a wreath of flowers at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in a solemn ceremony, where he was accompanied by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'We gather at this sacred place, at this solemn moment, to remember, to honor the sacrifice of the hundreds of thousands of women and men who have given their lives for this nation,' Biden said afterward at the cemetery's amphitheater. Earlier in the day, Biden hosted a White House breakfast in honor of Memorial Day that included administration officials, military leadership, veterans and so-called Gold Star family members, referring to those who have lost an immediate relative in military action.

Next week, the president will travel to Normandy, France, to participate in ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion . He is expected to give a major speech about the heroism of Allied forces in World War Two and the continuing threats to democracy today. Thursday will mark the ninth anniversary of the death of Biden's son Beau, who served in Iraq as part of Delaware's National Guard. Beau died from glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer that his father believes was possibly a consequence of exposure to military burn pits in Iraq. 'This week marks nine years since I lost my son, Beau,' Biden said. 'Our losses are not the same. He didn't perish on the battlefield. He was a cancer victim. 'The pain of his loss is with me every day ... so is the pride in his service,' the president said. On Memorial Day, each grave site at Arlington will have a small American flag carefully positioned exactly one boot ́s length away from the headstone. The flags were placed by 1,500 soldiers from the Army ́s 3rd Infantry Regiment, better known as The Old Guard. The regiment has carried out the tradition, known as 'Flags In,' just before Memorial Day every year since 1948, when it was designated as the Army ́s official ceremonial unit.

The 45-year-old novelist told an audience at the Hay Literature Festival: 'There are some politicians who, I won't name names, won't come on the podcast because it has the word \"fail\" in the title and they don't want to be seized upon. 'So if I really thought about it I might not have branded it that way. 'But I'm not fetishising the pursuit of failure. I'm simply saying that failure is something that happens to us all and it connects us which is really liberating.' Politicians who have braved the podcast have discussed their failures in Whitehall, their mental health problems and personal relationships. Elizabeth Day (pictured, in May at The Podcast Show in London) has revealed politicians won't be guests on her award-winning podcast How to Fail because they don't want to be associated with the word 'fail' Ed Milliband appeared on Ms Day's podcast in 2021 and discussed his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failure to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive In 2019, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told Ms Day about her failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends Ed Milliband appeared on Ms Day's podcast in 2021 and discussed his failure to win the 2015 general election, suffering from anxiety, failure to get the degree he worked so hard for and a failure to keep his late father, the noted Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, alive. Read More Clive Myrie reveals how he wouldn't report on the Notting Hill Carnival as he refused to be pigeonholed by the BBC In 2019, Jess Phillips, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, told Ms Day about her failure in politics, living with daily death threats and how she stays sane by prioritising her female friends. She talked about the failure in contraception that resulted in her eldest son, her failure to get on the Home Office Fast Track scheme and, in an extremely moving admission, her self-perceived failure to fix her brother's drug addiction. The same year, the former Conservative politician Chris Patten went on the show to discuss losing his seat in the 1992 election and his time as Chairman of the BBC where he presided over the Jimmy Saville scandal. The Magpid author shared that her dream guests for the podcast were Sienna Miller, Michelle Obama, Beyonce and Taylor Swift - though the Midnights singer no longer does interviews. Speaking about her latest non-fiction project, Friendaholic, which shot to Number One on the Sunday Times Bestseller list, she encouraged people to have a wedding ceremony with their friends before getting married to their partner. She said: 'An audience member in Bath said that before she got married to her husband, she got married to her best friend because she thought that relationship was as important to her. 'I completely and utterly agree. - they'd gone into the woods and done a wedding ceremony and I thought that was genius. 'I think people should think about having platonic wedding ceremonies that I put it as an extra chapter in the paperback version of my book.' The Magpid author shared that one of her dream guests for the podcast was Beyonce The former Sunday Telegraph journalist also revealed she was set up on a date with fellow journalist and author of Empireland, Sathnam Sanghera Ms Day got divorced from her first husband the BBC News Editorial director, Kamal Ahmed, who she divorced at 36 after four years of marriage in 2014 and is now married to CEO Justin Basini. The former Sunday Telegraph journalist also revealed she was set up on a date with fellow journalist and author of Empireland, Sathnam Sanghera. She said: 'We quickly realised we worked way better as friends and he's been a very close friend of mine ever since.'

OceanGate's Titan submersible disappeared on June 18, 2023 , after it plunged into the sea to explore the wreck of the Titanic - killing all five people on board, including the company's CEO, Stockton Rush. The cost of the expedition was $250,000. The company was slammed for flouting warnings of the risks and offering cut-price tickets to some of those on the trip. But despite the catastrophic implosion, rich thrill-seekers are still spending thousands on similar expeditions. One of the companies still operating deep sea dives, including an expedition back to the Titanic wreck, is Triton. Its operators insist their submersible is safer than Titan, which was criticized for having no official safety certification. America's super-wealthy are still risking their lives on deep sea adventures even after the catastrophic implosion of OceanGate 's Titan last year, that killed all on board (Pictured: next-generation Triton submersible, the Triton 660/9 AVA, called the Scenic Neptune II) They refused to share the per-person cost for a seat on their sub, or tell DailyMail.com when they plan to plunge to the depths of the Atlantic to reach the Titanic wreck. Triton's subs have been used in the past for the 'world's deepest dive' to Australia's Great Barrier Reef in July 2023 with British biologist Sir David Attenborough . This year, Triton subs were used for expeditions to the Mariana Trench, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Arctic Ocean. Influential individuals have recognized how the tragic implosion could impact the investment in deep ocean research, said Sophie Bentham-Wood, Executive Director of Global Marketing and Sales Strategies for the leading submarine company Triton. 'Some have already approached us to discuss the build of deep-diving submersibles purely to counteract any negative impact those events could have had and maintain momentum in the ocean space,' Bentham-Wood told Dailymail.com. Ohio real-estate investor and businessman, Larry Connor, is one of them. He is planning to be on the first sub to dive back to the titanic wreckage since the Titan imploded last June. Ohio real-estate investor and businessman, Larry Connor (left) says he is signed up for an expedition to the Titanic later this year OceanGate 's Titan submersible (pictured) disappeared on June 18, 2023, after it plunged into the ocean to explore the wreck of the Titanic. The cost of the trip was $250,000 The sub diver is determined to prove submersing down 12,500 feet to the 112-year-old titanic wreckage is perfectly safe - and he has the money to do so. Connor is set on taking a two-person submersible down to titanic wreck depths to show people worldwide that 'while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way,' he told the Wall Street Journal. He is planning the dive with Patrick Lahey, President and co-founder of Triton Submarines, one of the leading submersible companies in the world. The two have worked together previously diving to some of the ocean's deepest depths. Triton clients have already made various dives this year, from exploring the Mariana Trench, the Great Barrier Reef, and the Arctic Ocean. Despite OceanGate's catastrophic implosion last June, the pair aims to prove to the world that such an expedition can be carried out safely. Connor, who has previously explored the Mariana Trench, the deepest oceanic trench on Earth, said they plan to undertake the journey in a two-person vessel called the Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer, named '4000' for the depth in meters it can reach. It's unclear when the trip will take place or how much it will cost.

'If there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,' she told Dailymail.com (Pictured: Project Hercules, a collab between Triton Submarines and Espen Øino International, a luxury sub) Historically, submersibles have successfully dived deeper than the Titanic for decades (Pictured: The world's first and only submersible certified 'Depth: Unlimited') The TRITON 660 AVA series employs our revolutionary Advanced Versatile Acrylics to create the world's first submersibles with a free-form acrylic pressure hull (Pictured: TRITON 660 AVA) The world’s deepest dive to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef was achieved by Sir David Attenborough in a Triton submersible Lahey was among many industry figures who criticized OceanGate before and after the disaster, accusing it of questionable safety standards. After the implosion, he described Rush's recruitment tactics use to convincing people to get on board as 'quite predatory' and emphasized that certified submersibles are generally safe. Lahey emphasized that this tragedy wasn't reflecting of the industry as a whole. 'In that sense, OceanGate didn't make the industry look bad,' McCallum told the WSJ. 'It made us look good.' Lahey said that after the implosion, Connor called him saying, 'You know, what we need to do is build a sub that can dive to [Titanic-level depths] repeatedly and safely and demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that, and that Titan was a contraption.' With respect to the lives lost last June, Bentham-Wood said the 'continued exploration of the deep ocean in manned submersibles is essential to understanding the ocean environment, which is a key component of our future on this planet.' 'If there is any positive to draw from the situation, the legacy will be that there is further investment being made in deep ocean submersibles,' she told Dailymail.com 'Plus everyone realizes the deep ocean is no place for compromise – therefore, the need for programs to solely employ submersibles with full classification certification in their operations is not an option, but a prerequisite.' Before Titan, the only major sub disaster included the USS Thresher's 1963 implosion, killing 129 crew members Dakar - World's Record Deep Sea Dive (1954) Historically, submersibles have successfully dived deeper than the Titanic for decades. When the wreck of the Titanic was first first discovered in 1985, submersibles had already been diving to greater depths for several decades. The first to do so was the FNRS-3 bathyscaphe in 1954, setting a record by reaching 4,050 meters. In 1960, the Trieste descended 10,916 meters in the Mariana Trench. Since then, at least 16 submersibles have repeatedly taken people deeper than the Titanic over the past 69 years. The US submersible Alvin made the first dives to investigate the Titanic in July 1986, followed by the French submersible Nautile in 1987, which returned in 1993 and dived to the wreck 47 times in total. Today, ten submersibles in service can reach Titanic depths and beyond. According to the Marine Technology Society's submarine group, OceanGate was the only company operating a submersible capable of reaching Titanic-wreck depths that was not certified, raising industry concerns. 'There are only 10 submarines in the world that can go 4,000m or deeper and all of them are certified except the OceanGate,' Will Kohnen, chair of the Marine Technology Society's submarine group told CBC News in June 2023. OceanGate was conducting deep-ocean expeditions since 2009, with over 200 successful dives using its three submersibles in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. The Titan was designed to reach deeper depths of over 13,000 feet, according to the company. Before Titan, the only major sub disaster included the USS Thresher's 1963 implosion, killing 129 crew members. British explorer Hamish Harding was among those killed in the 'catastrophic implosion' French Navy veteran PH Nargeolet (left) was in the sub along with Stockton Rush (right), CEO of the OceanGate Expedition But after the implosion, many in the industry called for extra caution around any future trips to the titanic wreckage. Other have called for greater oversight of the submersible industry as a whole. Last year, titanic expert Tim Maltin said trips to the wreckage should be paused until more is discovered about what occurred to the Titan sub. 'We need to make sure that any vessels that go down there carrying fee-paying passengers...[are] certified to greater depths than they will be put through,' said Maltin. Caroline Heaven, a member of the British Titanic Society, said the dangers outweigh any benefits. 'I see no point in even considering the perilous journey to the wreck,' she told the BBC . 'The dangers involved are too great, the conditions are too cramped, and visibility is limited when the wreck is reached. Debris from the Titan submersible recovered from the ocean floor near the wreck of the Titanic, is unloaded from a ship 'Out of the entire population of submersibles, 90 to 95 per cent are certified. There's a five to 10 per cent fringe, so in that aspect they are an outlier, but sure, in the deep submersibles they really stand out.'

On June 18, the OceanGate's Titan was launched around 8am in the Atlantic Ocean above the site of the Titanic shipwreck. The five passengers, tourists Hamish Harding , 58, Shahzada Dawood , 48, and his son Sulaiman Dawood, 19, French Navy pilot Paul-Henry (PH) Nargeolet and OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, started to descend as Rush piloted the vessel. At 9:45am, the ship lost contact with its mothership, the Polar Prince, during a descent to the wreck of the Titanic 12,500 feet beneath the surface. Days later, its debris was recovered. It was said to have suffered a 'catastrophic implosion'. All on board died on the submersible. The US Coast Guard confirmed the victims' deaths four days later and an investigation into the implosion is ongoing . Because OceanGate's titan completely imploded, researchers will likely never determine the exact location of the flaw that caused the tragic event.

        "description": "Songstress Jennifer Lopez's new flick features the Jenny From The Block singer as a gritty data analyst in a sci-fi thriller, but Netflix streamers are less than impressed",
        "content": "Netflix fans are unimpressed with Jennifer Lopez’s new flick. The trailer for her new project Atlas has received poor reception from some viewers who flocked to social media to share their thoughts. Over on X/Twitter under a clip from the preview, one person wrote: “Absolute garbage, that’s as much as I’ll watch of this, the acting is hollow. Hard to watch even this amount of it.” Another person simply branded it “awful” while one said: “Why as a society [do] we keep doing this. Not sure I was looking for JLo action movie.” More comments flooded in, with one scathing remark stating: “What is this, 1999?” However, someone praised Lopez’s hard work and quipped: “She been working like the rent due lately, I respect it.” Jennifer’s brand new science-fiction thriller follows data analyst Atlas Shepherd who is wary about artificial intelligence. She joins a mission to capture a robot but is forced to worked with AI. The Jenny From The Block singer spoke out about the film and said: “I loved that this is a big sci-fi action movie, but at its core it’s a story of friendship and a love story, in a way. I always see everything as a love story, but this is a different kind of love between two beings who connect in disastrous circumstances and teach each other how to be more human.” Elsewhere in news, one freaky film has left streamers with “so many questions” after watching and discovering a “hidden message”. Leave The World Behind is an apocalyptic psychological thriller film which stars Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke and Kevin Bacon as a group of people navigating an apocalyptic event. The film follows Amanda who plans a vacation with her family as the world suffers a cyber attack. The “catastrophic environmental effects” begin to play out and creepy scenes show teeth falling out, dead-eyed deer that haunt the family and a piercing alarm. Fans over in the Netflix Bangers Facebook group said that the film was “kind of freaky but a good watch” and that they “enjoyed” the thriller as one person urged: “Love it.

'You are an enabler, President Biden,' she told a crowd at the Peoples' Conference for Palestine . 'Each year, our country, and I say our country because it is our country, sends billions of dollars to maintain an apartheid government and support the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,' said Tlaib. 'It is disgraceful that the Biden administration and my colleagues in Congress continue to smear them for protesting to save lives, no matter faith or ethnicity,' she said, referring to the pro-Gaza protesters that have popped up at universities and elsewhere throughout the country.' Tlaib was behind a group of Arab activists who convinced Michigan Democrats to vote 'uncommitted' in the state's primary to protest the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Palestine war. 'You are an enabler, President Biden,' she told a crowd at the Peoples' Conference for Palestine Tlaib also tore into Biden for saying Israel is not committing 'genocide' as its defense forces push further into the southern city of Rafah. It comes as Hamas fired rockets from Rafah toward Tel Aviv for the first time in four months, signaling the militant group is still capable of threatening Israel. All of the rockets were intercepted by air defenses. 'The International Court of Justice just ruled that the Israeli government must stop its invasion of Rafah, but President Biden says what's happening [in Gaza] is not a genocide,' the 'Squad' member said. 'Where's your red line, President Biden?' 'Attacking the authority of the International Criminal Court and interfering in the legal process is nothing more, nothing more than an attempt to prevent the genocidal maniac Netanyahu and his senior Israeli officials from being held accountable for those crimes against humanity.' 'You are an enabler,' Tlaib said to Biden. 'But we're not going to forget in November, are we?' Read More BREAKING NEWS Israeli troops exchange fire with Egyptian soldiers near Rafah, killing one: IDF says incident 'under investigation' Tlaib and a handful of her progressive colleagues refused to clap during Biden's March State of the Union address, instead holding up signs that said 'stop sending bombs.' At least 45 people were killed, including women and children, in an Israeli airstrike on a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah over the weekend, the Hamas-run health ministry said. Israel, meanwhile, said it killed two 'senior Hamas terrorists' there and is investigating the circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area.' Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, said the rockets fired from Rafah proved 'the IDF must operate in every place Hamas still operates from, and, as such, the IDF will continue to operate wherever necessary.' Close to 36,000 Palestinians have died in the conflict since October 7, when Hamas killed some 1,160 Israelis and kidnapped over 200 . Biden has in recent months grown more vocal about Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Gaza conflict but staunchly defended the U.S. ally after ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week announced he is seeking arrest warrants for the prime minister and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, in addition to Hamas' Gaza leader Yahya Sinwar, political chief Ismail Haniyah, and as Mohammed Deif, who is behind its armed wing. 'We don't recognize their jurisdiction — the ICC — the way it's being exercised,' Biden told reporters last week during a press conference with Kenyan President William Ruto. 'It's that simple. We don't think there's an equivalence between what Israel did and what Hamas did.' Biden has in recent months grown more vocal about Palestinian deaths in the Israel-Gaza conflict but staunchly defended the U.S. ally after ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week announced he is seeking arrest warrants for the prime minister and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant Pro-Palestine demonstrators march holding a banner expressing their opinion in the neighborhood of Astoria, Queens, N.Y., in mid-May 'Contrary to allegations against Israel made by the International Court of Justice, what's happening is not genocide,' Biden had said earlier. 'We reject that. And we'll always stand with Israel and its — in the threats against its security.' In an olive branch to progressives and Arab-American voters, Biden publicly touted a pause on the shipment of 3,500 bombs to Israel on May 8 in protest of the IDF pushing into Rafah, where some 1.4 million Palestinians took shelter as many of their homes in the northern part of Gaza had been razed. But shortly after that the Biden administration announced a $1 billion arms deal with Israel - and the U.S. will continue to supply Israel with weapons even as they push into Rafah. That package includes $700m in tank ammunition, $500m in tactical vehicles and $60m in mortar rounds.

        "description": "Her attempt literally backfired. Connecticut woman LaTeasha Brost is lucky to be alive after a half-baked attempt to extinguish a kitchen fire literally blew up in her face, as seen in this video setting the internet ablaze.",
        "content": "Crisco inferno? A Connecticut woman is lucky to be alive after a half-baked attempt to extinguish a grease fire literally blew up in her face, as seen in this video setting the internet ablaze. “This is exactly what you SHOULD NOT DO,” warned LaTeasha Brost in the caption to the clip, which boasts over 6.2 million views on TikTok. In the viral footage, the TikToker is seen cooking in her kitchen, when all of a sudden, a fire erupts in the pan. “What do I do?” cries the petrified Brost, who decides to try and douse the blaze with water. Unfortunately, this backfires horribly, creating a giant fireball. Terrified, Brost flees to the living room and chucks the flaming pot, which nearly hits her dog, before she trips and falls in the living room. Thankfully, the fire appeared to go out on its own. Why did the water paradoxically act as an accelerant? As Brost pointed out, the inferno was an oil-based blaze, Yahoo News reported. When water is combined with grease, it sinks beneath the less-dense oil, pushing the grease to the surface. This water then rapidly heats and vaporizes, propelling the flaming top layer of oil into the air and creating a flaming greaseball. Thankfully, Brost said there was no “apartment damage” and that she only sustained second-degree burns in the freak accident. She said she hopes that sharing the video will help prevent others from making the “same mistake.” “It’s okay if you laugh,” she added. “This is your sign to get a fire extinguisher or fire blanket in your kitchen ... We didn’t know what to do and although we are very embarrassed, we hope people can learn from this so they don’t make the same mistake as we did.” It’s okay if you laugh...there was no apartment damage and luckily only recieved 2nd degree burns. This is exactly what you SHOULD NOT DO! Sharing this because we didn’t know what to do and although we are very embarrassed, we hope people can learn from this so they don’t make the same mistake as we did. Social media had a field day with the flaming fiasco. “The accidental stop drop and roll is insane,” exclaimed one bemused viewer, while another wrote, “not you almost throwing the fire ON your dog.” Brost clarified in the comments that she chucked the pan because it was burning her skin. “The important thing is that you didn’t panic,” snarked one TikTok wit. “Friendly reminder not to add water to a grease fire,” advised one social media Samaritan. In the event of a grease fire, people are advised to turn off the stove and cover the pot with a non-glass lid or other pot to starve the flames of oxygen, ABC 27 reported. Failing that, one should try and put it out with an extinguisher or call 911 if the fire’s raging out of control.",

        "content": "Taoiseach Simon Harris has criticised a “siloed” approach to disability services and problems in Ireland as he encouraged local authorities to help solve the housing crisis. At the launch of his party’s local and European manifesto in Dublin, Mr Harris said that he was “sick and tired of the national pass the parcel” in relation to disability services in Ireland. He said Fine Gael would promote a universal design approach for travel and playgrounds and invest in sensory spaces in libraries. “Parents don’t care, children don’t care about it, I don’t care about who does the job – we just need to get it done,” he said. He also said that housing was “the defining societal issue” in Ireland and went beyond a crisis to an “inter-generational anxiety”. He called for a review of the bulk purchase of houses by institutional investors. “I’m pleased with a number of the measures the housing minister and the finance minister have brought in, I think they’ve been good, I think they’ve been effective, but I don’t think we can close our ears in relation to this.” He also said local authorities would be “held to account” for their housing delivery, and said it was “about time every part of the public service puts their shoulder to the wheel”. Asked about the comments afterwards, Mr Harris said: “I don’t say this to be critical, but there isn’t a consistency in relation to the delivery of housing across the country. “And I don’t say that to be critical, the reason I make that point is because sometimes there can be blockages. So this is not about local government and national government having a spat here.” He said he wanted to know if there were “blockages” or resourcing issues behind why some local authorities take longer than others to “turn a vacant property into a home for a family”. He added: “I don’t want to be blaming anybody, nor them blaming us, but I want every arm of this state to work together because what I can tell you, seven weeks as Taoiseach, I am concerned genuinely about the siloed approach that is taken to problems in this country. “I have huge respect for our public servants, I described them as the best in the world today at the National Economic Dialogue, that is my view. But I do sometimes think there can be ‘that’s a matter for somebody else’, ‘that’s a matter for that agency’. The public are sick and tired of that. “I have a very low threshold in terms of tolerance for that. I want to fix housing once and for all and I want everyone to play their part in that.”",

Officials urge caution at the intersection of Thicke Road and the TCH as crews are working on drainage in the area. According to a news release issued May 24 by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, “The work protects the long-term resiliency of the highway as flooding from nearby drains had been affecting the road base.” The ministry noted that the timing of the construction was selected “based on weather and low traffic-volume times to ensure minimal impact to travellers in advance of the summer travel season.” Work is expected to take two weeks. The highway will be fully open overnight and on the weekends though at the end of the two-week work period, the southbound slow lane will require 24-hour a day closure for five days to complete repairs. “Drivers are reminded to observe traffic management personnel and signage in the area, and drive with caution in active construction zones,” said the release.",

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press Immigration Minister Marc Miller is lifting the cap on Palestinian who can be brought by relatives to Canada through a program that faces widespread criticism. Miller speaks during an announcement in the Foyer of the House of Commons, in Ottawa, Thursday, May 23, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld Immigration Minister Marc Miller is increasing the number of applications that will be processed under a much-criticized program to reunite Palestinians with Canadian relatives. The move comes as he testifies about measures introduced months ago that were meant to bring relatives of Canadians from conflict zones in the Gaza Strip and Sudan to safety. The Gaza program initially had a cap of 1,000 applications that could be \"accepted into processing,\" but Miller is now increasing that number to 5,000, each of which can include multiple family members. Palestinian Canadians have complained about inconsistent messaging and onerous requirements that left people unable to leave Gaza before Israel effectively closed access to Egypt. Civil war in Sudan broke out last spring, yet family members say officials expect their relatives will not reach Canada until the end of this year, citing delays with fingerprinting and other biometric requirements Miller is providing a briefing about both programs today at the House of Commons immigration committee. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it has issued 179 temporary-resident permits through the Gaza program as of April 29, but the department doesn't know whether anyone has actually reached Canada. In a statement, Miller said that Canada has been sending the names of approved temporary residents to Israeli and Egyptian authorities, even though they can't currently exit the Gaza Strip. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time,\" Miller said. \"With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves.\" There continue to be reports of Palestinians paying thousands of dollars to cross into Egypt amid uncertainty over their resettlement status. Relatives in Canada say they were given mixed information from Ottawa about whether those who paid to cross could still access the Canadian program. The Gaza program involves temporary residency permits, while the Sudan program is for permanent residency. The NDP has accused the government of bungling both programs, and not learning from other conflict situations, such as the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021.",

        "description": "Jacob Trouba should have had a major and a game misconduct Sunday. Instead, he got two minutes and the NHL got yet another black eye.",
        "content": "Article content Don’t take my word for it. Listen to P.K. Subban, who is rapidly becoming the articulate, fearless charismatic commentator hockey so desperately needs. After the Rangers Jacob Trouba got two minutes for hammering Florida’s Evan Rodrigues with an elbow to the jaw, P.K. didn’t mess around. “The arm is extended,” Subban said. “The elbow is out from the start. Where is this a hockey play? There’s no shoulder involved, don’t tell me he hit him in the neck. It’s a straight elbow to the chin. I’m not going to harp on it too long — it’s a major, for me. That was a missed call.” Exactly. Not surprisingly, there were other media types and no shortage of fans lining up with the usual horse patootie to excuse yet another dirty, dangerous play: “The head was not the principal point of contact.” “It was a hockey play.” “It’s playoff hockey.” The worst was Kevin Bieksa, who tried to tell us it wasn’t an elbow and anyway, it’s all O because he used to hit that way. No, Kevin. It was an elbow to the jaw. Cut the bull. Brendan Gallagher got five games for the same thing. Trouba is not merely a headhunter, he’s a serial headhunter. There was the play against Carolina when Trouba launched himself at a falling Martin Necas. Trouba missed his target, which would have been Necas’s head, but his skate clipped Necas as Trouba crashed into the boards. Then there was the time Trouba hit Tyler Toffoli squarely in the back, driving him face-first into the glass. One of the worst came in Game 7 against New Jersey a year ago, when Trouba came off the bench and Timo Meier didn’t see him. Trouba drove his shoulder into Meier’s jaw, wiping him out completely and prompting one analyst to claim, “he went through the centre core of the body.” No, he didn’t. He went through the centre core of the head. In January, Trouba was handed a two-game suspension for elbowing the Golden Knights’ Pavel Dorofeyev, yet the refs essentially gave him a pass on the shot that levelled Rodrigues. Look, Jacob Trouba is a serial headhunter. He is dangerous. He is as dirty a player as we have seen since Matt Cooke hung up the skates that once slashed Erik Karlsson’s Achilles tendon. And yet the hockey world saw fit to honour Trouba with the Mark Messier Award for “leadership” this year. Leadership in what, pray tell? CTE? Trouba is developing the sort of symbiotic relationship with Matt Rempe that Bobby Clarke once had with Dave Schultz. Like Clarke, Trouba does the dirty stuff knowing that Rempe is there to assault anyone who comes after him. Trouba should have had a major and a game misconduct Sunday. If the referees had done their job, it’s likely the Rangers would not have won the game to take a 2-1 lead in the series against a tough Florida Panthers team. Instead, Trouba got two minutes and the league got yet another black eye. That Florida’s Dimitry Kulikov also got two minutes for interference for hitting the Rangers’ Alex Wennberg in the head with his shoulder earlier in the series doesn’t matter — two wrong calls don’t make it right. Not what the PWHL needs: In almost every way — almost — the PWHL has been a brilliant success in its inaugural season. The playoffs, unfortunately, have been a mixed bag. Too many extended overtime games. Too little scoring. And an injury (which can’t be helped) to the league’s biggest star, Nathalie Spooner. But the worst of it came Sunday night in Minnesota when, with a crowd of 13,104 at the Xcel Energy Centre celebrating what appeared to be the championship winning goal in double overtime and Minnesota players going wild on the ice, the league announced that the goal was being reviewed. Minnesota star Taylor Heise had carried the puck down the left wing and fallen and she cut to the goal. As she slid into the crease, the puck went to Minnesota’s Sophie Jaques, who scored over the shoulder of Boston goalie Aerin Frankel. Heise did not “crash” into Frankel. She didn’t knock her down. Frankel had a full, unobstructed view of the shot. And yet the curse of goaltender interference would strike again. The goal was waved off and one minute later, Alina Müller scored to send the series back to a deciding Game 5 in Boston. The NHL makes similar mistakes night after night, but the NHL can get away with it. The PWHL has to get it right and waving off the winning goal was not right. Heroes: Kaiden Guhle, Juraj Slafkovsky, Sven Andrighetto, Leon Draisaitl, Evan Bouchard, Connor McDavid, Taylor Heise, Félix Leclerc, Olivier Renard, Beatrice Chebet, Camryn Rogers, Gabriel Diallo, Luka Doncic, Tadej Pogacar, Summer McIntosh &&&& last but not least, Jaromir Jagr, retiree. Zeros: Jacob Trouba, Kevin Bieksa, the NHL Department of Player Safety, Kevin Magnussen, Mark Shapiro, Ross Atkins, George Springer, Bo Bichette, Christian Horner, Garry Galley, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Bud Selig Jr., Claude Brochu, David Samson &&&& last but not least, Jeffrey Loria.

The headphones feature 40mm Neodymium Magnetic Drivers with a 20-22,000 Hz frequency response range, supporting 360° spatial audio where available. SteelSeries’ ClearCast 2 microphone — found on its flagship Arctis Nova Pro headset — makes its way onto the new Arctis Nova 5, albeit in an updated (and seemingly better) version the brand is calling ClearCast 2.X. The updated mic features a new chipset it claims will deliver both twice the bandwidth and twice the clarity, as well as supporting 32KHz/16Bit audio to help to deliver clean and clear sound in-game and during conversations.Along with the new headset, SteelSeries is launching the Nova 5 Companion App — an app that the brand created with the help of game developers, esports pros, and its own audio engineers. It features over 100 game-specific audio presets that users can flip between at any time — including whilst playing — with profiles included for many of the most popular titles like Fortnite and Minecraft. With the Modern Warfare III preset, for example, users can expect to hear “enhanced footsteps”, providing them with an advantage in close quarter combat scenes.Connectivity wise, the Arctis Nova headset has it all: users can choose to use Bluetooth or a high-speed 2.4GHz connection with the included dongle, with supported systems including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, Meta Quest and more. Session gamers can expect to get up to 60 hours of wireless play on a single charge, and with its fast charging capability via USB-C it takes just 15 minutes to get from empty to six hours worth of juice. There are on-ear controls for volume, a mute function, and users can toggle between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz with a single click of a button.Available now for $129.99, it’s pretty hard to argue with SteelSeries’ description of these being “affordable luxury”.

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 The forthcoming second edition of Vision Golfe, endorsed by the esteemed Mr. Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic, is set to launch with great anticipation. This prestigious event will take place at the Ministry of the Economy in Paris and seeks to enhance both economic and cultural ties between France and the Gulf Cooperation Council nations, which include the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, and Kuwait. Jointly hosted by the French Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Europe, the summit will concentrate on areas such as trade, technological advancements, and cultural cooperation. In an exclusive interview, Thierry Rayer, President of the Cercle d’Études Scientifiques Pierre Rayer (CESR), reveals the implications of this event and the crucial role of “Universæ Analysis”, a method he has developed for analyzing works of art. Rayer said, “Vision Golfe aims not only to strengthen commercial and technological ties but also to enrich the cultural exchange between these dynamic regions.” Impact on cultural institutions and investors Beyond its cultural contribution, “Universæ Analysis” also offers valuable analytical tools for art investors. “It provides means of authentication paving the way for more strategic investments in the art sector,” says Rayer . Sites like Al Ula and Neom could benefit from these approaches to attract an international audience and redefine their acquisition policy. Collaboration with international art collectors Interaction with international art collectors also plays a crucial role, enriching the cultural experience in Gulf countries through the introduction of rare and valuable works. “These partnerships not only enhance local collections but also encourage a deeper cultural dialogue between countries,” adds Rayer . “Universæ Analysis: A Revolution in Art Analysis” “Universæ Analysis” combines biology, geometry, and mathematics with thorough research in Egyptology and the histories of ancient civilizations like Greece and Rome. According to Rayer, this comprehensive method is designed to uncover previously hidden insights in the artworks of classical masters like Da Vinci and Raphael, and modernists such as Brancusi and Kandinsky. This method is not just academic; it has substantial practical implications for museums and cultural institutions, facilitating enriching partnerships between France and the Gulf countries. Rayer notes, “We use ‘Universæ Analysis’ to enhance the understanding and appreciation of works, which inevitably strengthens cultural and economic ties.” National missions to Gulf countries to enhance cultural tourism Initiatives involving national missions to Gulf countries are poised to stimulate cultural innovation and enhance cultural tourism. These missions are dedicated to promoting artistic exchanges and cultural partnerships, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and appreciation of the diverse cultural wealth shared between France and the Gulf nations. Conclusion Thierry Rayer expresses optimism regarding the potential impact of Vision Golfe 2024: “We expect this conference to serve as a springboard for new partnerships and innovations, affecting both the economic landscape and the preservation of global cultural heritage.” These national missions in the Gulf are crucial for fostering cultural innovation and enhancing cultural tourism, thus opening new avenues for artistic exchanges and economic development. Vision Golfe 2024 is shaping up to be an essential gathering for stakeholders in the realms of economy, culture, and the advancement of arts and sciences.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" The December 2021 tornado tore through eight western Kentucky counties, killing 57 people. Beshear has traveled to the area where his father grew up several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday.

        "content": "Article content Playoff Game Day 3.3 Dallas at Edmonton In the early days of Edmonton Oilers’ third round series with Dallas Stars, two persistent questions have bubbled to the surface time and again. Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch answered both questions at once on Monday morning, announcing that Henrique will replace Ryan McLeod in the line-up as the series lands in Rogers Place for Game 3 this evening. It’s a move that’s been called for by numerous fans of the team, who have called out McLeod’s perceived poor play in various corners of social media not to mention the comments section right here at the Cult of Hockey. There’s no doubt that McLeod has struggled mightily on the offensive side of the puck. 14 games into the playoffs he has yet to record a single point, this after ending the regular season on a 15-game goalless run. Until recently he has maintained his high-level defensive play, but some cracks have developed there as well. Our own analysis of Grade A Shots has identified the speedy forward as a culprit on 3 different goals against in the last 4 games, most notably a dreadful third-period turnover in Vancouver that kickstarted a scary Canucks comeback. In Game 2 at Dallas, McLeod was a split-second late to the shooting lane on Ryan Suter’s outside shot that was deflected home by Mason Marchment for the game winner. Not the biggest mistake of the game or even on the sequence itself, but another mark on the debit side of a ledger that has entered precious few credits at the other end of the sheet. McLeod has played a role in Edmonton’s outstanding penalty kill in the post-season, playing 22 minutes without a single goal against. At even strength, the Oilers have produced 57% of the shots and 55% of the expected goals during his 163 minutes of action. When it comes to actual goals, however, it’s been just 1 for, 6 against, for a dismal 14%. And let’s face it, folks, boxcars of 0-0-0, -5 are deeply underwhelming. Thus he is about to endure the first healthy scratch of his career at a critical time. Coach Knoblauch referred to it as a “reset”, a similar approach that he successfully used with netminder Stu Skinner in the Vancouver series. The expectation is that he will be back in the rotation sooner than later. But not tonight. All that said, team speed is going to take a hit. McLeod is clearly one of the squad’s two fastest skaters, with only Connor McDavid in the same conversation. Henrique is a different animal, especially on the speed front. Nearly 10 years older, he’s nowhere near as fast as McLeod, though much more of a threat offensively. In 2023-24 he produced his seventh 20-goal season, and tied his career high of 51 points. He also hit 50 two other times, and has reached 40+ on ten different occasions over his 13 seasons. That said he checks many of the same boxes as McLeod on the versatility front. Both men can play either centre or wing and can chip in on the penalty kill. Injured in Game 5 of the Los Angeles series, Henrique tested his battered ankle in Game 2 vs. Vancouver but was ineffective. He hasn’t played since, missing Edmonton’s last 7 games. in 6 playoff games, he’s posted boxcars of 1-1-2, -1 averaging 15 minutes a night mostly at 1LW. First report is that Henrique will be airlifted directly into McLeod’s spot at 3C with no other changes to the line-up. More to come.",

        "content": "The Democratic Alliance party leader wrapped up his election campaign ahead of Wednesday’s vote by urging Mzansi to support the DA’s Multi-party Charter. John Steenhuisen wants South African’s to put corruption, poverty and unemployment in the rearview mirror and support the DA’s Multi-Party Charter, reports The Citizen . DA’S MULTI-PARTY CHARTER IS IN WITH A CHANCE “Together (referring to the DA’s Multi-Party Charter) we can get to the 51% we need to rescue South Africa. For the first time, there is a clear pathway into national government. By uniting with our partners inside the Multi-party Charter, we have pooled together the biggest bloc of opposition votes since 1994,” confirmed Steenhuisen. Made up of the IFP, FF Plus, ActionSA, ISANCO, UIM and SNP, the DA’s Multi-party Charter has centered its manifesto on the following topics. Unemployment and poverty reduction through economic growth and a return to global competitiveness. The plan was presented earlier in the year by ActionSA’s Herman Mashaba. As a coalition, the parties represent the biggest alternative political bloc to the ANC ever. When the 29 May 2024 vote concludes, they will cobble together their electoral wins based upon the following agreed principles ... MAKE MZANSI GREAT AGAIN ANC WILL LOSE MAJORITY Steenhuisen also remarked that, “The ANC will lose the outright majority it has abused for decades. This is because it subjected the people to unemployment, corruption and misrule. We will close the ANC chapter of our history once and for all. And a new chapter will begin.” Independent polls in the run-up to Wednesday’s election predict the DA to land roughly 20.5% of the vote, which is similar to previous elections. Nevertheless, Steenhuisen vowed to bring the best municipal and provincial leadership to government, as it has done in the Western Cape. “If we sit back and allow a coalition between the ANC, EFF and MK – aided by sell outs like the PA – our tomorrow will be far, far worse than our yesterday,” concluded Steenuisen. HAVE YOUR SAY Would you vote for DA’s Multi-party Charter in the 2024 National Elections? Despite their combined efforts, the charter maintains each individual party has its own unique policies you should consider.

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press This image released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Tom Burke, left, and Anya Taylor-Joy in a scene from \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.\" (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP) Furiosa won the holiday box office over Garfield by a hair. It was a close race, but the wasteland warrior of “ Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga ” came out slightly ahead of the plump orange cat with an estimated $32 million in ticket sales over the four-day weekend according to studio estimates Monday. “ The Garfield Movie ,” a Sony release, earned $31.1 million in its first four days. The dust won’t officially settle on the showdown until Tuesday when final numbers are reported, but for now at least Warner Bros. has the No. 1 movie in the country. Including international showings, its running global earnings are at $64.8 million. But victory is a long way off for the $168 million production starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth. George Miller’s prequel stormed theaters riding on great reviews and was expected to have at least a slightly stronger debut. For Sony, the launch of the more modestly budgeted “The Garfield Movie” is a win even without the bragging rights of being in first place. The animated film featuring the voice of Chris Pratt is likely to have a long life at the box office the summer holiday beginning for school age children. With its early international release, “The Garfield Movie” has already earned over $91.1 million against its $60 million production budget. But this weekend has also been a sobering one for Hollywood as one of the worst Memorial Day weekend box office showings in decades , excluding 2020 when theaters were closed. Ticket sales are down 22% from 2023 and the gap may just get bigger as the summer goes on. Remember, at this point last year “Barbenheimer” hadn’t even happened . Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Monday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Tuesday. 1. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $32 million. 2. “The Garfield Movie,” $31.1 million. 3. “IF,” $21 million. 4. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $17.2 million. 5. “The Fall Guy,” $7.7 million. 6. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $6.9 million. 7. “Sight,” $3.6 million. 8. “Challengers,” $1.8 million. 9. “Back to Black,” $1.4 million. 10. “Babes,” $1.2 million.",

The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries’ first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic but also to once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit — a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged North Korea to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would “undermine regional and global peace and stability”. Yoon also called for a “decisive” international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch — aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea’s most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries reaffirmed their commitment to the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, adding that peace “serves our common interest and is our common responsibility”. North Korea hit back immediately, saying in a statement by a foreign ministry spokesperson that “to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula today constitutes a grave political provocation.” Any talk of denuclearization would “violate the constitutional position of our country as a nuclear weapons state,” said the statement, carried by the official Korean Central News Agency. “Such thing as ‘complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula’ has already died out theoretically, practically and physically,” it added. Differences As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea’s nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China’s relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has blamed US-South Korea joint military drills for escalating regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement “clearly showed the difference of opinions” between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un’s regime was always going to be difficult “because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country”, Lee told AFP. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is a good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim’s nukes. “If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,” he added. Trade ties The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange “discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA”, and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China’s Li also said they had agreed on not turning “economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains”, Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China’s top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were “closely monitoring and tracking” preparations for another launch—which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. “North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week,” said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. “One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.” — AFP",

        "description": "Aston Villa are playing Champions League football in the new season having finished fourth - they're looking to aim in one direction under Unai Emery",
        "content": "Aston Villa are a short price to repeat their top four achievement of the recently ended season, when they tackle the Premier League again next term. Villa overcame the odds, which were against them, in securing Champions League football for the forthcoming campaign ahead of the likes of Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea and last season's top four occupants Newcastle United. Next year, they'll have to try and repeat the feat while juggling their Champions League campaign , which will entail a minimum of eight matches throughout the autumn and winter in the new 36-team league table format. After Southampton's victory over Leeds United in the Championship play-off final on Sunday, thanks to Adam Armstrong's first-half winner, Villa now know the confirmed line up of opponents who they'll face over the course of the Premier League campaign next season. After this previous term's achievements, Villa are understandably nearer the top of the list with the various bookmakers' odds than towards the bottom. READ: Emery has already paid Barkley a compliment ahead of Villa transfer READ: Villa squad value skyrockets before Barkley transfer and Champions League Premier League title odds: Manchester City 10/11, Arsenal 9/4, Liverpool 8/1, Chelsea 20/1, Manchester United 25/1, Newcastle United 25/1, Tottenham Hotspur 33/1, Aston Villa 50/1, BAR 150/1 Villa are a good bit shorter a price to match this past season's achievements; a top four finish, when you consider the strength and likely improvements of those within the 'Big Six' who comparably underachieved this term, would be another fine effort - particularly, as mentioned, with Villa set to fight amongst the elite both domestically and in Europe this coming year. Top four finish odds: Manchester City 1/10, Arsenal 1/4, Liverpool 8/15, Chelsea 11/8, Newcastle United 7/4, Manchester United 2/1, Tottenham Hotspur 2/1, Aston Villa 3/1, BAR 12/1 (Odds: Bet 365) Where will Villa finish next season?

Nadal crashed to his earliest exit at the French Open on Monday after a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 first-round defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev, with fans wondering if the 14-times champion will return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. Speaking after the match, Nadal said: 'For me it is difficult to say what is going on in the future. It is a big percentage that I will not be back playing here, but I cannot say 100 per cent. 'The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it's special to feel the love in the place I love the most. 'I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it's enough. But it's something I don't feel yet.' Rafael Nadal refuses to rule out a French Open return after first round defeat on Monday Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers' Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. Many believe that this was Nadal's last appearance at the tournament he has won 14 times Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.

        "content": "Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday, his representatives confirmed on Monday. The former heavyweight champion, 57, felt nauseous and dizzy, prompting flight staff to ask passengers if there was a doctor on board to assist him. Paramedics boarded the plane once it touched down in Los Angeles to provide treatment, following a two-hour delay in Miami due to the heat. This incident comes just two months before the boxing legend is scheduled to fight YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in Dallas. However, the former heavyweight champion is doing fine after medical attention and his representatives said that he is feeling better now. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" Tyson's representatives told The New York Post in an email. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Typical symptoms of an ulcer flare-up include nausea and vomiting, bloating, belching, gas pain, chest pain, and fatigue. This follows In Touch's initial report on Monday morning that Tyson \"had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded.\" Sources indicate that the cabin crew \"issued an announcement asking for a doctor 30 minutes before landing, and the message even came on everyone's screens.\" \"He was in first class, but we were an exit row,\" an eyewitness added. \"They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, 'He's a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he's OK.' I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words \"Mike Tyson\" and she nodded her head yes.\" Once the plane landed at LAX, there was an additional delay of around 25 minutes while paramedics treated Tyson. Tyson, who has previously admitted to daily marijuana use, has given up the drug while training to fight Paul because it is on the list of banned substances used by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. He also revealed he has temporarily given up sex as part of his training regimen. \"He only stopped as a means of following all of the rules,\" his publicist Joann Mignano recently told USA TODAY Sports. \"But he is still a strong advocate for the medicinal benefits of cannabis for his personal well-being and others like him.\" Tyson will turn 58 on July 20, when the fight against Paul is scheduled to take place at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Cowboys. The has faced criticism in recent weeks, especially due to the significant age gap between the two fighters. Tyson retired in 2005, but most recently fought in an exhibition match in November 2020 against Roy Jones Jr. in , which was not declared a professional fight.",

        "content": "The Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja on Monday, dismissed the petition filed by Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), challenging the election victory of Gov. Usman Ododo in the Nov. 11, 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel, chaired by Justice Ado Birnin–Kudu, dismissed the petition on the grounds that the petitioners; PRP and its governorship candidate, Abdullahi Bayawo, failed to prove the allegations of non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2022 during the poll. The tribunal, in a unanimous judgment, held that the petitioners’ evidence that Forms EC8B and EC8D (the ward result sheets and the state result sheets) tendered were not prepared for the Nov. 11, 2023 poll, were bereft of substance. The panel said that the testimonies of the petitioners’ witnesses were hearsay and that failure to call polling agents from the alleged affected polling units to give their evidence was fatal to the case of the petitioners. Besides, it held that some of the evidence of the witnesses had no probative value. “The petition lacks merit and it is accordingly dismissed,” Justice Birnin–Kudu-led tribunal declared. It held that the election that produced Ododo of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as governor of Kogi complied substantially with the provisions of the Electoral Act . Earlier, the tribunal dismissed the petition filed by Social Democratic Party (SDP) and its governorship candidate, Murtala Ajaka, against Gov. Ododo. The tribunal held that the petitioners also failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission. It would be recalled that the tribunal had, on Feb. 20, struck out the petition filed by the Action Peoples Party (APP) against the election victory of Ododo in the Nov. 11 governorship poll in the state. The panel struck out the petition following its withdrawal by counsel for APP, Daniel Edeachi. The application, seeking the withdrawal of the petition was not opposed by lawyer to Gov. Ododo, Ibrahim Muhammed, SAN; counsel to APC, DC Denwigwe, SAN, and that of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Kanu Agabi, SAN. The APP had, in the petition number: EPR/KG/GOV/02/2023 filed on Dec. 1, 2023, before the tribunal, challenged the declaration of Ododo as the validly elected governor of Kogi in the Nov. 11, 2023 governorship poll conducted by INEC. The party had sued Ododo, APC and INEC as 1st to 3rd respondents respectively. However, in its motion on notice dated and filed on Feb. 15, the party sought two orders, including an order granting leave to the petitioner/applicant to withdraw the Petition No: EPT/KG/GOV/01/2023 and an order striking out or dismissing the petition, having been withdrawn by the petitioner. Giving eight-ground of argument, APP said though it filed the petition to challenge Ododo’s victory, the party said upon the re-evaluation of the grounds and facts of the petition, it “is not reasonably convinced about the sustainability of the grounds of the petition as presently constituted before this honourable tribunal. According to the party, the withdrawal of the petition is based on the perceived unsustainability of the grounds of the petition and to avoid overburdening this honourable tribunal with numerous petitions.(NAN)",

        "content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as \"vital\" in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has \"its own large reserves of uranium.\" Putin, in turn, vowed to \"do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan's (nuclear energy) market.\" If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia's influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China, where he expressed appreciation for China's proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin's ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal lost in the French Open first round for the first time in what may have been his last match at the tournament he has won a record 14 times. No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany swept Nadal 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday. “I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time that I’m going to be here in front of all of you,” Nadal said in an on-court interview. “Honestly, I’m not 100% sure, but if it’s last time, I enjoy it, no?” The 37-year-old Nadal, unseeded because he missed most of the last year and a half due to injuries, said before the tournament that there was “a big, big chance” it will be his last French Open. Nadal said Saturday that he would need time after the tournament to decide about returning to the event in 2025. “Maybe in two months I say it’s enough, I can’t give anything else, no?” Nadal said after Monday’s match. “But it’s something I don’t feel yet. I have some goals in front. I hope to be back on this court for the (Paris) Olympics. That motivates me. That’s going to be another chance, and I really hope to be well prepared.” Zverev, who won the last top-level tour event before the French Open, broke Nadal at love in the opening game, then again to secure the first set. Nadal broke Zverev to go up 3-2 in the second, then was broken at love while serving for the set. Nadal won the first two games of the third set before Zverev closed it out. Zverev made 77 percent of his first serves, saved nine of 11 break points and had 44 winners to 30 unforced errors. “Today is not my moment,” he said. “It’s Rafa’s moment.” Nadal dropped to 112-4 in his French Open career and has now lost back-to-back matches on clay for the first time since he made his ATP Tour match debut in April 2002. He entered the French Open with a 5-3 record in clay-court matches this season after missing nearly all of 2023. “The last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here, no?” he said. “At least I did. I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” For the Paris Olympics, Nadal is eligible to use an injury protected ranking of No. 9 to get into the singles draw. No. 3 seed Carlos Alcaraz of Spain said Sunday that he and Nadal plan to play doubles together at the Olympics “if everything goes well.” Nadal said the Olympics are his “main goal” and that it would be “difficult” to play Wimbledon next month because it would require going from clay courts to grass courts and then back to clay courts for the Olympics. “Give me two months till Olympics, and then let’s see if I am able to keep going or I say, OK, guys, it’s more than enough,” Nadal said. “Let’s see. I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kind of things. It’s a moment just to keep going, accept the moment, and let’s see what’s going on.” Earlier Monday, top seed Iga Swiatek swept 148th-ranked Frenchwoman Leolia Jeanjean 6-1, 6-2 to reach a second-round match with fellow four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka on Wednesday.",

There are only conjectures, assumptions, and thoughts which the so-called experts had. It is a report of experts which is at times contradictory, and which the magistrate did not make her own considerations on but simply issued charges based on it,” Muscat said in a video posted to social media.He said that €11 million and four-and-a-half years had been spent to find a €60,000 transfer for work that he had done and that he himself had told them about because he had declared it in his tax filings.The €60,000 refers to money Muscat received for unnamed consultancy services from Accutor AG.Muscat said that despite this, an asset freezing order worth €30 million was issued without any justification as to where that figure came from.The former Prime Minister continued that “in this second Egrant” it seems that someone relied on the testimony of “an Indian national” who said he heard someone say that Muscat might have taken millions in connection with the hospitals deal – millions which, Muscat pointed out, were never found.Muscat said that the narrative now is ‘but what might Joseph have known or not known?’ and said that he would answer about this “when the time comes.”He said he also looks forward to answering about a comment in the report where the experts say that there wasn’t any proof about the work that he had done for the €60,000, questioning why he hadn’t been asked to testify about this matter.“Now I will give this evidence when the time comes in court to show how much work was actually done and back it up with proven facts,” he said.Muscat continued that the court process will now start, and observed that even before the first sitting, charges against a company have already been dropped because it didn’t even exist when this case was investigated.He said that the problem is that the case will unfortunately take long, but said that he is “resolute and focused” to “destroy this sand castle built on a lot of conjectures once and for all with a tsunami of facts and proof that I will bring forward in the future.”He thanked people for their support in these times which he said will test their resolve. He called for people to maintain their calm and serenity, as he has no doubt that “very important facts” will emerge to show that there are people who are again trying to push a lie “against him”, “which will now turn on those who were doing it.”",

WHA comprises of sessions in three main committees, which are Plenary, Committee A and Committee B. Committee A will be chaired by India and facilitate discussion on various programmatic topics covering Universal Health Coverage, Public Health Emergency preparedness and response, antimicrobial resistance, climate change, sustainable financing for WHO etc. The Union Health Secretary started his address by highlighting the alignment of the World Health Assembly’s theme this year – “All for Health, Health for All”, with the core values and the ethos of India, that is “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” which means “the world is one family”. He said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, India not only managed the crises within the country but also supplied medicines and health related products across the world embodying the spirit of “One World, One family”. “This philosophy guides our efforts to promote well-being for all, facilitate Universal Healthcare Coverage and achieve health-related Sustainable Development Goals”, he stated. Shri Apurva Chandra stated that the traditional public health approach of focusing on community interventions such as information and awareness as well as preventive measures hold the key to better health outcomes. He informed that India has established Health & Wellness Centres to not only address health issues at the community level but to also focus on educating communities towards better health seeking behaviour. “At this critical juncture, when all countries are working towards our collective Sustainable Development Goals and ensuring health services for all so that no one gets left behind, India has been taking the lead in advocating for digital health innovations as key to the critical transformative process required to help us achieve our goals”, he further stated.",

        "content": "UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday it is \"obscene\" that small island states, which are on the front line of climate change, should pay for the fossil fuel industry's greed and competition between major economies. \"Your unique geography puts you at the mercy of climate chaos, rising sea levels and land degradation,\" Guterres said at the opening of the fourth Small Island Developing States (SIDS) summit in the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda. \"Climate change is an existential crisis for the entire human family, but SIDS are on the front lines,\" he told the conference of 39 states, whose populations number roughly 65 million people. SIDS are extremely vulnerable to climate change but not rich enough to stop it on their own. One key hope from the summit is increased climate financing -- though many criticize the slow pace of fulfilling previous UN aid pledges. \"We cannot accept the disappearance of any country or culture under the rising waves,\" Guterres said. \"The idea that an entire island state could become collateral damage for profiteering by the fossil fuel industry, or competition between major economies, is simply obscene,\" he added. Guterres said the United Nations supported SIDS' aspirations to \"halt and mitigate the terrible impacts of the climate crisis,\" as well as to protect the ocean and biodiversity, and to build resilient economies. He urged SIDS governments to invest and engage in these goals but said they \"cannot do this alone.\" \"The international community has a duty to support you –- led by the countries that have greatest responsibility and capacity to deal with the challenges you face,\" Guterres said. \"SIDS are a test case for climate justice and financial justice,\" he added. Last week, the UN maritime court ruled in favor of nine small island states that brought a case to seek increased protection of the world's oceans from catastrophic climate change. The countries that brought the case called the court decision \"historic,\" and experts said it could be influential in shaping the scope of future climate litigation involving greenhouse gas emissions.",

        "content": "VIENNA - Iran is enriching uranium to close to weapons-grade at a steady pace while discussions aimed at improving its cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog are stalled, two confidential reports by the watchdog showed on Monday. The International Atomic Energy Agency faces a range of difficulties in Iran, including the fact it only implemented a small fraction of the steps IAEA chief Rafael Grossi thought it committed to in a \"Joint Statement\" on cooperation last year. \"There has been no progress in the past year towards implementing the Joint Statement of 4 March 2023,\" one of the two reports to member states, both of which were seen by Reuters, said. Grossi travelled to Iran this month for talks with Iranian officials aimed at improving cooperation and IAEA monitoring in Iran. Follow-up talks have stalled, however, after the death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash last week. \"The Director General reiterates to the new government of Iran his call for, and disposition to continue with, the high-level dialogue and ensuing technical exchanges commenced ... on 6-7 May 2024,\" the report added. It is 18 months since the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors last passed a resolution against Iran, ordering it to cooperate urgently with a years-long IAEA investigation into uranium particles found at three undeclared sites. While the number of sites has since been reduced to two, Iran has still not explained how the traces got there. \"The Director General regrets that the outstanding safeguards issues have not been resolved,\" the report said, referring to those traces. France and Britain are pushing for a new resolution at next week's Board meeting, which the United States has so far not supported, diplomats say. Iran usually bristles at such resolutions, taking nuclear-related steps in response. The other report said Iran's stock of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% of weapons-grade, grew by 20.6 kg over the quarter to 142.1 kg as of May 11, and Iran later diluted 5.9 kg to a lower enrichment level. That means Iran now has roughly enough material enriched to up to 60% purity, if enriched further, for three nuclear weapons in theory, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough for more at lower enrichment levels. Western powers say there is no credible civil reason for Iran to enrich to that level. Iran says its aims are peaceful. REUTERS",

        "content": "The secret is out on the next Chelsea women's manager, writes KATHRYN BATTE... but whether Sonia Bompastor will succeed remains to be seen Lyon manager Sonia Bompastor is on the cusp of a move to take over at Chelsea Her last game came on Saturday during her side's Champions League final loss Plymouth job will be the one that makes or breaks Wayne Rooney's managerial career - Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Kathryn Batte Published: 18:00 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:02 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Sonia Bompastor laughed when she was asked for the second time whether Saturday’s Champions League final had been her last game in charge of Lyon. The first time had been in French, but because the question that had been asked was not translated, it was later repeated in English. Some managers would have snapped. She had just lost a European final for the first time as manager and was probably not in the mood to discuss where she will be next season. But she does not seem the type to do so. She knows as well as the rest of us that it is the worst kept secret in women’s football that she will soon be announced as Emma Hayes’ successor at Chelsea . Bompastor has been manager of Lyon since 2021, winning seven trophies - including three back-to-back league titles and the 2021-2022 Champions League. Sonia Bompastor (pictured) laughed during a press conference after the Women's Champions League final Her Lyon side cut dejected figures after they suffered a 2-0 defeat by Barcelona during Saturday's final The match may have been Bompastor's (centre) final game as Lyon boss, as speculation mounts that she will now move to succeed Emma Hayes at Chelsea Podcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola?

EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify Her team were beaten 2-0 by Barcelona on Saturday but, on another day, could have come out on top. The absence of star striker Ada Hegerberg, who was only fit enough for a place on the bench, proved crucial. Barca dominated possession but both teams had the same number of shots and clear chances. The difference was Barca took two of theirs, even if they needed a bit of luck with a heavy deflection for the first goal. Bompastor will leave Lyon with a fine record but, in truth, it is hard to measure her success. Read More Barcelona 2-0 Lyon: Jonatan Giraldez's side clinch back-to-back Women's Champions League titles... as Aitana Bonmati and Alexia Putellas' strikes seal victory She was appointed at a difficult time, replacing Jean-Luc Vasseur in April 2021 after French rivals Paris Saint-Germain had knocked them out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage. Bompastor, who also played for Lyon, had been coach of the club’s academy for eight years. She could not stop PSG from going on to win the French league, which subsequently ended Lyon’s 14-year reign as champions, but she has since re-established their position at the top. Lyon have won the last three titles and beat Barca in the 2022 Champions League final - which made her the first person to win the competition as both a player and a manager. But she also inherited a talented squad. She will do the same at Chelsea, but the Women’s Super League is far more competitive, with more teams challenging for trophies than in France. Hayes (pictured) had become the unofficial spokesperson of women's football in England during her glittering reign as Chelsea manager The former Chelsea manager guided the Blues to their fifth consecutive Women's Super League title last week Read More Lionesses icon Steph Houghton isn't short of options for what's next after retirement... while top priority is husband Stephen Darby, she will keep fighting for the women's game What may work in Bompastor’s favour is that there will be less of a spotlight on her than her predecessor. As I discussed in this column last week, Hayes had become the unofficial spokesperson for women’s football in England. The same will not be expected of Bompastor. Hayes worked with Bompastor, who played as a left back, during her time as a football consultant for Washington Freedom in America. Hayes described her as a ‘brilliant player’ with an ‘unbelievable wand of a left foot.’ She also said she was ‘very quiet’ but ‘cheeky’ and ‘funny’ - traits she argued the media may not always see. The description Hayes gave of Bompastor mirrors what some of her former players have said. A manager who is passionate, fiercely determined and demands high standards. She is also said to be deceptively loud. Dare I say she sounds an awful lot like England manager Sarina Wiegman, who has many of the same traits. Hayes worked with Bompastor (pictured), who played as a left back, during her time as a football consultant for Washington Freedom Bompastor brings proven experience of winning the Women's Champions League, the one trophy that has seemingly evaded the Blues in recent years Much like at Lyon, Bompastor will enter a dressing room at Chelsea that is used to winning. The Blues have lifted five successive WSL titles but the one competition that has evaded them is the Champions League. Bompastor’s experience in that competition will be key and it is one of the big reasons Chelsea wanted to bring her in. Read More Emma Hayes helped transform women's football in this country... but after her exit from Chelsea, it has to move on without her, writes KATHRYN BATTE But Bompastor will be responsible for more than just tactics and formations. Hayes spoke regularly about having to manage people and personalities. Chelsea’s squad depth meant players who could walk into other starting XI’s did not always make her matchday squad. Bompastor knows all about this from her time at Lyon and it will not faze her. The switch from Hayes to Bompastor will be fascinating to watch next season. While we are unlikely to get references to Star Wars, geese or poetry in press conferences next season, perhaps in time we will get to see the cheeky and funny side to Bompastor that Hayes promised us is in there. The switch from Hayes (right) to Bompastor (left) will certainly be a fascinating one Bompastor will sign off her time at Lyon having guided her side to the Division 1 Feminine title Brilliant Bronze is Britain's best export Lucy Bronze said her Barcelona team will go down in history after winning their first ever quadruple. But it is not just the team, but Bronze herself who will be remembered in the history books. The defender became the first English player to win five Champions League trophies on Saturday and is now the country’s most decorated player. Bronze has not always started for Barca this season, but she put in a fine display against her former club Lyon. There have been a number of discussions recently about who is the best English player to play abroad. Usually, the answers range from Kevin Keegan, who won the Ballon d’Or while playing for Hamburg, to Steve McManaman, who won two European Cups with Real Madrid. But no English player has been more successful abroad than Bronze - who has won 16 trophies across her spells at Lyon and Barcelona. There is no doubt that, for me, she is the greatest English export we have ever seen. Lucy Bronze (pictured) became the first English player to win five Champions League titles on Saturday Bronze (pictured lifting the trophy) stated that her Barcelona team will go down in history The defender will also go down in history, too, as one of British football's greatest ever exports Scotland will play Israel behind closed doors It is a shame that Scotland’s Euro 2025 qualifier with Israel will have to take place behind closed doors due to security concerns. The Scottish FA said its stadium operations team were alerted to the potential for planned disruptions to the game at Hampden Park and therefore made the decision to stop supporters from attending.

        "content": "South Africa’s election will determine how weary the country has become of the ruling African National Congress party , which has been in power since the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule 30 years ago. President Cyril Ramaphosa and the ANC are struggling to keep their parliamentary majority and several opinion polls have put the party’s support at less than 50% ahead of Wednesday’s election. That doesn’t mean that the beleaguered ANC will be out of power in Africa’s most advanced economy. Even as the famous organization once led by Nelson Mandela has seen a decline in its popularity, no one has risen to a position to replace it. Instead, South Africans who have turned away from the ANC have gone looking for answers among an array of opposition parties. The ANC is still expected to gain the largest share of votes. But without an outright majority, it would need to form a coalition to stay in government and keep Ramaphosa for a second and final term as president. For a key country on the African continent, that might bring new complications. Some recent coalitions at local level have been spectacular failures. While most South Africans may be ready to register their disgruntlement with the ANC in a defining moment, a coalition government may not easily solve the country’s big problems, which include some of the world’s highest levels of unemployment and inequality. South Africans don’t vote directly for their president, but rather decide the makeup of Parliament, which is called the National Assembly. They do that by choosing parties and those parties get seats in Parliament according to their share of the national vote. The 400-member National Assembly then elects the president, meaning whichever party has a majority chooses the head of state. That has always been the ANC since the first all-race elections in 1994 , but this time it may need to strike agreements with other parties to get the required 201 votes from lawmakers to reelect the 71-year-old Ramaphosa and form a government. The main election day is Wednesday and people will vote in all nine provinces. It will decide the makeup of both the national and provincial legislatures. Some who have been granted special permission will vote earlier on Monday and Tuesday. Results are expected within days. Nearly 28 million of the population of 62 million are registered to vote in what is only the country’s seventh fully democratic national election since apartheid was dismantled. There are more than 50 political parties registered for the national election, the most ever, and even more for the provincial legislatures. Independent candidates will be allowed to stand for the first time. The ANC’s fate is the headline story: Ramaphosa is the party’s leader and the face of its campaign. The main opposition is the centrist Democratic Alliance , or DA. It has entered into an agreement with some smaller parties in the hope that their combined vote might force the ANC out of government completely, but that’s not seen as likely to happen. The far-left Economic Freedom Fighters , or EFF, is the third-biggest party and led by Julius Malema, a fiery former ANC youth leader . The DA won around 20% in the last national election and the EFF 10% to the ANC’s 57.5%. Neither opposition party appears to have significantly increased in popularity. That’s largely because of the dozens of other parties, many of them new, that have captured small shares. While 80% of South Africa’s population is Black, it is a multiracial society, with many ethnicities and 12 official languages. An equally diverse political picture is beginning to appear. Of the new parties, the MK Party or uMkhonto weSizwe (which means Spear of the Nation) has gained the most attention because it is led by former South African President Jacob Zuma, who has turned his back on the ANC he once led in a bitter battle with Ramaphosa, the man who replaced him. Zuma has been disqualified from standing as a candidate for Parliament but can still campaign for his party. Unemployment and poverty stand out as the most pressing issues for the majority of people. While South Africa is regarded as Africa’s most advanced country, its contradictions are stark. It also has an unemployment rate of 32% — ranked the highest in the world — and more than half of South Africans are living in poverty, according to the World Bank. That has driven most of the discontent as millions of the poor Black majority feel the ANC has not improved their lives sufficiently three decades after apartheid, which brutally oppressed Black people in favor of the white minority. Other prominent election issues that are seen as pushing voters away from the ANC are the high rate of violent crime , multiple government corruption scandals over the years, the failure of some basic government services and a crisis within the state-owned electricity supplier that has led to nationwide blackouts at regular intervals to conserve power. The blackouts have eased ahead of the election but they angered people and further damaged a struggling economy.",

        "content": "( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah.

(AP) Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, (Monday morning AEST) which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said on Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the north western neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” READ MORE: Community rallies for mother mourning death of her toddler son “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike on an area where displaced people were staying. (AP) Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets on Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X.

Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. (AP) Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses.

Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Police move into camp as US anti-war protests continue View Gallery Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its October 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80 per cent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "description": "The Celtics and the Mavericks have rolled through their respective conferences this postseason, thanks in large part to the clutch contributions of Jrue Holiday, PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford.",
        "content": "The Boston Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks saw room to improve, and they struck. Exactly one week before their first preseason game, the Celtics traded a haul for Jrue Holiday , sacrificing depth to bring in the savvy veteran point guard with plenty left in the tank. Dallas’ transformative trades came just before the Feb. 8 deadline, with PJ Washington and Daniel Gafford arriving in under-the-radar moves that gave the Mavericks a much-needed physicality boost. Those deals are paying serious dividends now. Boston and Dallas have rolled through their respective conferences this postseason, thanks in large part to the clutch contributions of Holiday, Washington and Gafford. Here’s how they got here. Fresh off of their second consecutive trip to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics already appeared poised to be among the NBA’s best teams without Holiday. They had traded in June for Kristaps Porzingis, adding another All-Star to a roster headlined by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. The Porzingis trade didn’t come cheaply, however, as it cost Boston their defensive-minded point guard, Marcus Smart, who for years had served as the team’s gritty emotional leader. Boston seemed set to begin the season with Derrick White and Malcolm Brogdon as its top point guards, until Holiday suddenly became available. Holiday — a three-time first-team selection for All-Defensive honors and a 2021 champion with Milwaukee — had just been traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in the blockbuster deal that sent Damian Lillard to the Bucks. Holiday, 33, didn’t fit into the rebuilding Blazers’ timeline, so on Oct. 1, they flipped him to Boston for Brogdon, center Robert Williams and two first-round picks. The do-it-all Holiday proved to be a seamless fit, averaging 12.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 4.8 assist per game for the 64-win Celtics while again making the All-Defensive second team. Holiday remained a consistent force throughout the playoffs but became even more impactful during the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, who boast the NBA’s highest-scoring offense. Holiday scored a season-high 28 points in Boston’s Game 1 win and made a critical defensive play in overtime. With the Celtics up by a point with 1:02 remaining in OT, Holiday’s smothering defense caused Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton, a two-time All-Star, to lose control of the ball out of bounds. “He’s the best defender in the NBA,” Haliburton said afterward. “He has been for a long time.” Holiday finished with seven rebounds, eight assists and three steals and made 10 of his 16 field-goal attempts in Game 1. He followed that up with 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting and 10 assists in Game 2. And in Game 3, Holiday again made a game-sealing defensive stop. With Boston up by a point and under 10 seconds remaining in regulation, Holiday met a surging Andrew Nembhard in the backcourt, remained glued to him as he cleared the 3-point line and stripped the ball away to put Boston up, 3-0, in the conference finals. The steal helped the Celtics overcome an 18-point deficit, as did Holiday’s 14 points and nine rebounds. “I just made a play,” Holiday said. “I kind of jumped his right hand and got the steal.” The Mavericks, meanwhile, tried to retool in the offseason after a disappointing 2022-23 season in which they failed to make the play-in tournament. They traded for center Richaun Holmes and signed forward Grant Williams and guard Seth Curry, hoping to improve the supporting cast around Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving . Those additions each fizzled, however, prompting the Mavs to remake their roster on deadline day. They sent Williams, Curry and a first-round pick to Charlotte for the forward Washington, a hard-nosed defender who shot at least 36.5% on 3-point attempts in three of his five NBA seasons. They shipped Holmes and draft compensation to the Wizards for Gafford, a rim-protecting center who is highly efficient around the basket. Washington shot just 42.1% from the field and 31.4% from deep in 29 regular season games with Dallas but came alive in the playoffs, particularly in the second round against top-seeded Oklahoma City. Washington scored at least 21 points in three consecutive games against the Thunder, making at least five 3-pointers in each. His two made free throws with 2.1 seconds remaining in the series-clinching Game 6 were the final points in Dallas’ 117-116 win. He remained clutch in the Western Conference Finals against the Minnesota Timberwolves, making a go-ahead 3-pointer with 1:56 remaining in Game 1 and another with 3:38 left in Game 3 — both of which proved to be game-winners. “Anything can happen out there on any given night,” Washington said after Sunday’s Game 3 victory put Dallas up, 3-0, in the series. “I’m just blessed to be able to be here in this position. ... We don’t take it for granted.” Despite being five inches shorter, the 6-7 Washington has also played tough defense against the 7-foot Karl-Anthony Towns, who repeatedly settled for 3-point attempts through the first three games and went only 3-of-22 from deep. Towns, a four-time All-Star who averaged 21.8 points per game in the regular season, is yet to eclipse 16 in the Western Conference Finals. Gafford, meanwhile, continues to serve as an effective lob option for Doncic. His alley-oop dunk with 34.8 seconds left in Game 3 served as the dagger in the Mavericks’ 116-107 win. The 6-10 Gafford is averaging 10.3 points per game on 65.2% against the towering Timberwolves, holding his own against 7-1 Rudy Gobert, who just won his fourth Defensive Player of the Year honor. Dallas’ addition of Gafford allows promising rookie center Dereck Lively to come off the bench. The athletic Lively, a top-10 pick who entered the league with raw potential, has thrived this postseason as a reserve, though he left Game 3 with a sprained neck. “Tests returned OK on Dereck Lively II’s neck but his availability for Game 4 remains unclear,” ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Monday. Gafford and Lively solidified a center position that the Mavericks have historically struggled to fill, outside of a pair of one-season stints with Tyson Chandler in 2010-11 and 2014-15, and a two-year stretch with Porzingis that never quite fit. Dallas is getting a combined 50.7 points per game this postseason from Doncic and Irving. Coincidentally, that’s exactly what Boston’s dynamic duo of Tatum and Brown were averaging entering Monday. Thanks to some shrewd trades, Dallas and Boston have much more in common than their standout superstars.",

The rocket launch came just hours after the country's announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center at 10:44pm on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful.

Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. Kim Jong-Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs.

North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia.

You must be an MP to qualify for the post! “Otherwise, he didn’t turn it down, the party appointed Tabitha Khumalo because Chamisa was not a member of Parliament.” Charamba responded: “I can share with you what the plan then was. Chamisa was going to get one of his MPs to cede a constituency to him in return for some ambassadorial posting. “Chamisa would have got into Parliament on that basis, itself founded on mutual understanding between parties. “The same idea had been agreed to with Tsvangirai although it got overtaken by GNU arrangements. “There is always a way out, as you saw with Mwonzora who became that even though he had been outside Parliament!!!! Got it????” Zwnews",

        "content": "Kate Middleton, who's still receiving cancer treatment, is said to be very determined and desperate to attend the upcoming royal event with her husband Prince William and their children. The Princess of Wales, who's been out of sight since she announced her caner diagnosis in March, is eager to make a balcony appearance for Trooping the Colour in London on June 15. However, King Charles and William, according to an insider, \"are not impressed with the idea. \"William and King won't allow Catherine to return to the royal duties until her medical team gives Kate all-clear as she still continues her treatment.\" \"King Charles and William don't want Kate to take any risk as they are taking all necessary steps to ensure that the mother-of-three makes a smooth recovery,\" the source added. They continued: \"Kate Middleton is thankful for the time she's spending at home while focusing on her health, but very excited to attend the event that she and her kids eagerly await for almost a year. On the other hand, Buckingham Palace has also not revealed the details about Trooping the Colour, which is a ceremonial event performed every year on Horse Guards Parade in London to celebrate the official birthday of the British sovereign. It is also known as the Sovereign's Birthday Parade. Speculations are rife when the future Queen returns to royal duties. William, according to reports, has directed the Kensington Palace to maintain privacy protocols around Kate as his top priority is her health. Last year, King Charles took the royal salute and inspected the troops at Horse Guard's Parade before returning to Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast. Queen Camilla, Prince William, Kate Middleton and their three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis joined King Charles for the photo op of the day on the palace's balcony.",

        "description": "A similar Sunseeker Predator was featured in the 2006 James Bond film \"Casino Royale.\"",
        "content": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ( WNCN ) — Two people were rescued just before a $1 million luxury 80-foot sport yacht sank off the coast of Florida Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The incident was reported just after 11:35 a.m. about 3 miles off St. Augustine Beach, a news release from the Coast Guard said. The operator of the Atlantis, an 80-foot sport yacht, said the vessel hit an object in the water and was sinking. The Coast Guard sent out a boat crew to assist and coordinated with St. John’s County Fire and Rescue, which soon arrived and plucked both people from the yacht. The Atlantis yacht appears to be a 1999 or early 2000s model of the Sunseeker Predator 80. A larger Sunseeker Predator was featured in the 2006 James Bond film “Casino Royale.” A 2001 Predator that is 5 feet shorter than Atlantis, which sank Saturday, is listed for sale for $975,000. Sunseeker Predator 80 yacht, built in the United Kingdom, can accommodate up to six guests in four staterooms, with two crew members aboard. Atlantis has two Caterpillar diesel engines and can reach a top speed of 44 kn, or 50 mph, according to data from Boat International. A data sheet about Atlantis says the vessel is in the top 5% by speed in the world. After Saturday’s rescue, a hazard to navigation was broadcast to alert mariners about the yacht, which could cause damage to other vessels, according to the Coast Guard. The owner of the Atlantis will arrange for a salvage of the vessel, the Coast Guard said. The cause of the incident is under investigation.",

        "content": "EMMANUEL Macron has pledged a military crackdown on New Caledonia after meeting with riot cops on the paradise-turned-hellhole island. The French president made a long-haul trip to the Pacific territory on Thursday and urged a \"return to peace\" after deadly rioting left six dead and hundreds more injured. 12 Emmanuel Macron arrives at the central police station in Noumea, New Caledonia, for his meeting with riot cops Credit: EPA 12 A member of police stands guard ahead of the arrival of the French President Credit: EPA 12 Riots have run rife across the Pacific island over the last nine days Credit: EPA 12 Burnt-out vehicles lay strewn across roads in Noumea's Magenta Tour district Credit: AFP Macron arrived in the capital Noumea after a 24-hour flight and vowed that thousands of military reinforcements will be deployed for \"as long as necessary\" following nine days of looting, arson and clashes. The unrest erupted over a French voting reform plan that Indigenous Kanaks say will dilute their voice. As he exited the plane at Tontouta International Airport, the French leader told reporters he wanted to ensure that \"as quickly as possible there will be a return to peace, calm, security\". \"That is the absolute priority,\" Macron added, ahead of a day of intensive meetings with local leaders. He is expected to spend about 12 hours on the ground. France has ruled New Caledonia since the 1800s, but many Indigenous Kanaks still resent Paris's power over their islands and want fuller autonomy or independence. \"I don't know why our fate is being discussed by people who don't even live here,\" said Mike, a 52-year-old Kanak at a separatist roadblock north of the capital, on the eve of Macron's visit. Since May 13, separatists have thrown up barricades that have cut off whole neighbourhoods and the main route to the international airport, which remains shuttered.

        "content": "ISRAELI troops are flying drones in pairs on seek and destroy missions against terrorists operating in the West Bank and Gaza. Extraordinary drone footage seen by The Sun shows how four armed terrorists were tracked along an alleyway inside the West Bank town of Nur al-Shams Tulkarm before being killed in a targeted strike. 11 Israeli troops use drones to target terrorists in Gaza and the West Bank 11 Panicked Hamas terrorists throw objects and fire shots at an Israeli drone 11 Another drone armed with an explosive device moves in on the terrorists 11 A bomb is dropped from several hundred feet above, apparently killing the terrorists Israeli operators can be heard discussing the operation in the background while controlling a reconnaissance drone with a handset not much larger than a mobile, to track down the gunmen. The terrorists appear surprised by the drone as it flies close to them at around head height. The panicked insurgents begin throwing objects at the drone, with one firing shots from his weapon, as the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) operator withdraws from the alleyway. Meanwhile, another drone armed with an explosive device moves in on the terrorists and drops a bomb from several hundred feet above, apparently killing all four. The footage appears to end with the drone camera zooming in on the lifeless bodies of the four gunmen. Eran Salmon, a bomb disposal officer with the Israeli police, described the footage as \"Rare documentation of IDF forces fighting terrorism in an integrated manner using small drones.\" The former IDF special forces commander wrote on social media: \"In a recent operation, four armed terrorists concealed in the complex alleys of the Nur al-Shams Tulkarm were surprised when an IDF small drone appeared and located them from a short distance. \"They fired at the drone and threw objects at it, but it managed to evade them. \"Meanwhile, another drone dropped an explosive warhead at their exact location and...

The pair of despots look increasingly cosy on the surface - but Lord Admiral West warned that Xi could be set on seizing Russia's resource-rich territory. 6 Admiral Lord West believes Xi's long term goal could be to tear up his alliance with Putin and invade Siberia Credit: The Sun 6 He told The Sun's defence show that Putin was playing a dangerous game with Xi Credit: The Sun 6 The pair of tyrants looking cosy on their state visit last week that solidified their burgeoning alliance Speaking on The Sun's World at War show, Lord West branded Putin a submissive \"supplicant\" to a far more powerful Xi. He argued their flourishing, but not strictly defined, alliance could fall apart if the Chinese leader got too greedy. The former First Sea Lord believes Xi's long-term strategy could be to invade parts of Russia and capture its bountiful oil fields and other raw materials. He said: \"If it really gets very bad and they desperately need resources I think there's a very real risk they cold decide to take the bits of Siberia they want. \"It is all about resources. Resources are going to become more and more of a problem for China. \"They have already issued maps of Siberia that have Chinese names.\" \"That is why Putin is playing with fire. The Chinese don't like him.\" Referencing Putin's cuddly state visit to Beijing last week, he said: \"He looks like the little teddy bear about to be eaten, doesn't he? \"[That is] the danger of supping with the devil.\" Since Russia's full-scale of Ukraine over two years ago, Putin has relied on Xi as a lifeline, increasing his economic dependence on China as Western sanctions cut off access to much of the international trading system.

She repeated a warning that Moscow first issued earlier this month after British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Ukraine had a right to use weapons provided by London to hit targets inside Russia. The ex-PM also announced new British military aid for Ukraine - saying it would be up to Kyiv how it used the UK-supplied weapons. Moscow reacted with outrage as a result, citing Lord Cameron's comments as one of the reasons why it has opted to hold exercises this month to simulate the launch of tactical nuclear missiles. Raging Vlad even slammed the former PM and branded his comments as \"dangerous and worrying\". Lord Cameron said: \"In terms of what the Ukrainians do, in our view, it is their decision about how to use these weapons. \"They're defending their country, they were illegally invaded by Putin and they must take those steps.\" It prompted a fierce response from the Kremlin, with Putin's puppet spokesman Dmitry Peskov vowing his comments could \" imperil the entire system of European security architecture\".

A spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs office said in a statement that China will take action to \"resolutely crush\" any separatist plot if Taiwan pro-independence forces insist on going their own way or taking risks. China hopes Taiwan will work with the mainland to oppose independence separatism and interference from external forces, said spokesperson Chen Binhua. Early this morning, China encircled Taiwan and other Taipei-controlled islands of Kinmen, Matsu, Wuqiu and Dongyin as part of the \"Joint Sword 2024A\" exercises. Taiwan has condemned the military drills - which are tagged as \"A\" in an apparent warning of potential follow-ups - as \"irrational provocations\". It quickly mobilised its naval, air and ground forces to \"defend the island's sovereignty,\" the defence ministry said. The defiant island has scrambled jets and even placed missile units on high alert.

Russia is said to be trying to redraw their territorial waters to steal areas in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland and near the cities of Baltiysk and Zelenodradsk in the Kaliningrad region. But, experts are most concerned over Putin's plans to take over Gotland - an island that sits just off the coast of Sweden . It is thought to be the next area on Putin's hitlist if he gets his way and is regarded as one of the most important areas in the Baltic Sea.

They were headed towards Nestryha island in Kherson region, which Russia has been seeking to control since last year. In scenes too graphic to show, the survivors of the explosion were killed by drone-dropped grenades as they scrambled onto the island. A report on the ambush stated: \"It is noted that there were several boats, on which landed more than 15 occupants.\" It added: \"The Birds of Madyar [drone unit] disrupted the operation of the Russians and eliminated at least seven Russians. \"Note that Nestryha island is the last before the mouth of the river and actually the last island on the right bank.\" As such it is strategically important \"as the positions on the island allow shelling the right-bank Kherson region with mortars and artillery\".

Nine people are seriously injured and seven people are in critical condition after what cops say was likely caused by an overload of people on the first floor. Abdoulaye Diop, 44, a Senegalese migrant living in Majorca, was the first of those who died last night to have been named. He had been working as a nightclub doorman in the area who made headlines on the island in 2017 by saving a man who was drowning. He is thought to have stopped off at Medusa Beach Club, on the beachfront promenade, after leaving the gym. The fourth victim is a 23-year-old female Spanish worker. It has now emerged nine survivors being treated in hospital are Dutch, the nationalities of the others are unknown. Locals have now sent out an urgent warning saying more disasters could soon happen as many venues \"aren't designed for tourists\".

Entrepreneur Fred Frost was out on a yacht during a business trip to Positano in Italy last August when he scrambled up a cliff and jumped into the waters below while wearing his Rolex Sky-Dweller. 7 Fred Frost, 27, lost his £40k Rolex but immediately replaced it 'not to look poor' Credit: Kennedy News 7 This is the moment the millionaire lost the luxury timepiece while tombstoning in Italy Credit: Kennedy News 7 Fred, who currently lives in Dubai, said he felt 'like an idiot' after losing his Rolex Credit: Kennedy News 7 The Danish millionaire said his lost luxury wristwatch was part of his £500,000 collection Credit: Kennedy News After plummeting 30ft into the water, the catch on his watch sprang open and the timepiece slipped off his wrist into the ocean below. The 27-year-old sheepishly asked a nearby fisherman how deep the water was. But after learning it was 82ft to the seabed, he conceded it was \"gone forever\". Keeping schtum to his rich pals Fred, owner of leading forex market trading company Fred Trading, put an order in for an identical watch so people wouldn't realise what an \"idiot\" he'd been. The luxury wristwatch is part of the £500,000 collection he uses as his calling card to attract wealthy \"like-minded connections\" - as other collectors \"are probably not working as plumbers or handymen\". Fred, who lives in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, said: \"When I lost my watch it was like in Titanic when the expensive necklace went to the bottom of the ocean. \"I was looking down at the water and saw the watch sink slowly, I thought 'yeah that's lost to the sea now'. \"It didn't bother me that much because I made half a million dollars that month. \"I went home and bought an identical one so nobody would notice and also because I looked like an idiot dropping a £40,000 watch in the sea. \"In Dubai if you want to...

A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico’s southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up, and water supplies are running out. Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "I write in support of Denise Tepler for Senate District 24. Denise has served admirably in the House of Representatives for eight years supporting children, families and a myriad of important issues for all of Maine citizens that includes access to health care, support for reproductive freedom, safeguarding our environment and combatting climate change. As an advocate for children and families at the Legislature in the past, I have worked to support increased investments in children and support a legislator who clearly supports children and families. Denise understands and has already shown she can deliver for us in the eight years she has served as a state representative. We will all miss Sen. Eloise Vitelli, who had to step down due to term limits, but having someone who has already proven the ability to get things done at the Legislature can give us hope for the future. Ellie Goldberg, Past and founding president of Maine Children’s Alliance, Bath Maine is facing new challenges in the years ahead as both the natural environment and the political environment change rapidly. Not only are storms stronger and more frequent as the weather becomes warmer, but the politics of the country are also becoming more partisan, more strident and less focused on a common purpose. In trying times like these, what we need in Augusta are legislators who are committed to the principles of negotiation, compromise and fairness that have been the hallmark of Maine politics since we became a state. Denise Tepler is that kind of legislator. We have watched her serve four terms in the House as the representative from Topsham, and she has learned a great deal about how state government works well in the process. She is now ready to put that knowledge to good use as the state senator from District 24, which includes all of Sagadahoc County plus Dresden, including such wonderful communities as Bath, West Bath, Bowdoin, Bowdoinham, Arrowsic, Georgetown and Phippsburg. Denise is not a showy person. On the contrary, she is fairly quiet at times, even modest in outward behavior. That is good. She is not showy because she is trying to understand the issue at hand, what the facts are, what people think about the problem and what solutions are possible. She knows that in a citizen legislature no single legislator knows everything and that everyone serving there must often rely on the knowledge and expertise of other people. A vote for Denise Tepler is a vote for calm and rationality in a world that is not always calm and rational. She is just the kind of state senator we need in Augusta.

        "content": "( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score.

        "content": "It’s been 10 years since Christopher Nolan’s mind-bending space epic Interstellar, and now fans can see it as originally intended yet again, as the movie will be returning to cinemas. Interstellar was Nolan’s first film after working on , and it scratched an itch for longtime Nolan fans eager to see the director get away from superheroes.

Interstellar’s release will mark a momentous occasion for fans who last saw the film in IMAX in 2015. So when will Interstellar be returning to cinemas? When is the Interstellar IMAX re-release? For the film’s 10th anniversary, This was confirmed by Empire Magazine, with the re-release will including digital screens, as well as . The news of an Interstellar re-release was first revealed during a CinemaCon presentation in April 2024. Interstellar’s original release in 2014 cleaned up at the box office, becoming the 10th highest-grossing film for the year. While that may sound low, consider the competition: Interstellar was up against heavy hitters like Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies. The Interstellar theatrical re-release shouldn’t be too surprising to longtime fans, as Nolan is a passionate advocate for the theater-going experience. Following the 2020 pandemic, Nolan was the first to come out swinging about the importance of movie theaters. “These are places of joyful mingling where workers serve up stories and treats to the crowds that come to enjoy an evening out with friends and family. As a filmmaker, my work can never be complete without those workers and the audiences they welcome.” Nolan said in a 2020 op-ed. If Interstellar returning to cinemas is of interest to you, you can set a reminder for when tickets go on sale at . Until then, you can always watch all the or read about so far. Related:",

        "content": "The Pittsburgh Pirates played another week of .500 baseball, dropping a series to the San Francisco Giants after their pitching collapsed spectacularly in consecutive games before salvaging Memorial Day Weekend with a series win against the Atlanta Braves, one of the best teams in baseball over the past half decade. While most national outlets demoted Pittsburgh in the standings because of their scuffling results, they continued to say nothing but good things about the club even in spite of their struggles. The national media even talking about the Pirates is a phenomenon seldom seen over the past three decades... and when they do, it’s hardly ever for a positive reason. With a trio of excellent starting pitchers leading the charge, though, it seems like people are ready to give Pittsburgh their laurels, even if the results aren’t there yet. Here’s what they had to say. MLB.com demoted the Pirates one spot to No. 21, although they praised Mitch Keller for his recent surge, pointing out his 1.30 ERA this month despite taking a backseat as Paul Skenes and Jared Jones absorb the spotlight. CBS Sports dropped the Pirates three spots to No. 23, for some reason invoking their dropoff following a 9-2 start to the season: a topic that was all the rage a month ago. The Pirates fell one spot in Bleacher Report’s rankings , although the outlet issued nothing but compliments beyond that. As one might expect, Jones’ and Skenes’ success came up once again. theScore held the Pirates at No. 21 , praising Nick Gonzales, Bryan Reynolds and Andrew McCutchen for their performances at the plate beyond paying due diligence to Skenes.

        "description": "The new Røde Interview Pro can be connected to any of Røde’s Series IV wireless system but it also includes 32GB of memory recording up to 40 hours of audio.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The new Rode Interview PRO mic can connect wirelessly to many of Røde's products as well as ... [+] recording 32-bit float audio directly to the mic's onboard 32GB of memory. Back in April, Røde announced new products at the NAB broadcasting technology show in Las Vegas. Those products are landing on customers desks and the first up for review is Røde’s Interview Pro, a wireless and handheld microphone with 32-bit float recording and 8GB of onboard memory that makes it completely self-contained. As you would expect from a Røde product, the Interview Pro is manufactured at the company’s New South Wales factory. It feels like a solid piece of kit that’s tough enough to handle the punishment meted out during newsgathering on the road. The Interview Pro can be connected to any of Røde’s Series IV wireless system which includes the Wireless PRO, Wireless ME and Wireless GO II products. The pocket-sized radio receivers used in these kits can transmit pristine digital audio up to 200m as long as both devices are in sight of each other. The receiving device can be plugged into a camera, digital recorder or even a smartphone. The new Interview PRO from Røde is a handy battery powered wireless mic with a condenser capsule and ... [+] 32GB of built-in memory. As well as connecting with Røde’s wireless systems, the Interview Pro will also connect to the RødeCaster Pro II, RødeCaster DUO and the Røde Streamer X. When connected to these devices, the incoming wireless ling takes over one of the XLR channels so bear that in mind when adding up how many mics your setup can take. Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time—At Lower Price, Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50 Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone The Interview PRO uses Røde’s innovative Series IV 2.4GHz digital transmission with 128-bit encryption. The result is an incredibly stable wireless feed and the mic is perfect for vox pops and interviews when on the run. The condenser capsule used in the Interview PRO has a superbly rich and detailed sound with a warm character and an excellent response time. The mic also ships with a foam windshield for when it is used outdoors. The Røde Interview PRO can plug into a laptop and the audio files stored on board will appear as a ... [+] removable drive. The fixed internal battery inside the Interview PRO can be recharged by unscrewing the mic’s barrel to reveal a USB C charging port and a full charge will provide up to 25 hours of use. The USB port not only charges the battery, but it’s also used to connect the mic to a Mac or PC. So that the 32GB of internal memory appears on the computer desktop like any other removable storage. The audio files stored on the mic can be dragged and dropped to the computer ready for processing. The ability to record up to 40 hours of high-quality audio on the Interview PRO’s internal memory means you don’t even need the wireless kit, although it’s a good idea if you want to monitor the recording as it’s being made. The audio files can be matched up with the video footage in post-production, but just be sure to use a clapper board for syncing the sound and identifying which recordings belongs with which video. Also built into the Interview PRO is Røde’s innovative GainAssist technology. This uses intelligent algorithms to adjust the mic’s gain levels automatically as you are recording. The system goes a long way top stopping any clipping and works so well. The Interview PRO can connect to any of the Rode Series IV wireless mic kits as well as the ... [+] RødeCaster PRO II, RødeCaster DUO and Streamer X devices. Another innovative feature with this mic is its ability to record audio in 32-bit float audio at 48kHz sampling rate directly to the built-in memory. The beauty of 32-bit float recording is there is no chance of the ever clipping the sound. The gain can be adjusted afterwards so you don’t need to monitor the sound as it’s being recorded. And when you are recording to the internal memory, a handy pause button on the mic means you can stop the recording in-between interviews or vox pops. With more than 40 hours of onboard recording time, you can always have a saftety track as well as sending the audio wirelessly back to the camera or digital recorder. This dual recording facility is an excellent plan when you are recording occasions that can’t be repeated. It’s virtually foolproof. Verdict: The new Røde Interview PRO wireless mic combines the convenience of a wireless mic with the deep and rich sound quality of a great condenser capsule. The sound is bigger and deeper than a Lavalier mic and shock-mounting built into the mic’s body means almost no handling noise. For recording pristine interviews for video or radio, the Interview PRO is a no-brainer. For those who need more than one mic, there’s even a smart docking station that can recharge two mics at the same time so they are always ready for use at a moment’s notice. Highly Recommended.

        "content": "Jason Kelce had some choice words for a troll who called his wife, Kylie Kelce, a “homemaker.” After voicing his disagreement with Harisson Butker’s controversial commencement speech , the former NFL player became the target of a troll on X (formerly known as Twitter) on Monday. “Your wife is a homemaker,” the critic wrote. “But you can’t support butker.And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. Sorry but it is dirty and messy on television.” The netizen then accused Jason of being a “bit hypocritical,” warning he would “be left with nothing but swifties,” referencing his brother Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift. “You just ruined your gig. It’s a shame,” they concluded. The former Philadelphia Eagles player — who has three daughters , Wyatt, 4, Ellie, 3, and Bennett, 14 months, with Kylie — explained that he doesn’t view his wife as “a homemaker.” “I think of her as my wife,” the 36-year-old wrote . “I think of her as a mother. She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily. The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first.” Jason went on to add that the couple both raise their kids and tidy up the house. “It is both our faults it is messy, but such is life with 3 young children, busy schedules, and neither of us being neat freaks.

Butker later defended his speech claiming at a fundraiser, that the backlash revealed how “timeless Catholic values are hated by many.”",

        "content": "MADRID (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday secured from Spain a pledge of additional air defense missiles to help fight the about 3,000 bombs that he says Russia launches every month at Ukraine in the third year of the war. However, Ukraine still urgently needs another seven U.S.-made Patriot air defense systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction, Zelenskyy said. “If we had these modern Patriot systems, (Russian) airplanes wouldn’t be able to fly close enough to drop the (glide) bombs on the civilian population and the military,” Zelenskyy told a news conference in the Spanish capital. Glide bombs are heavy Soviet-era bombs fitted with precision guidance systems and launched from aircraft flying out of range of air defenses. The bombs weigh more than a ton and blast targets to smithereens, leaving a huge crater. Two Patriot systems are needed to protect the northeastern Kharkiv region, where the Kremlin’s forces launched a cross-border offensive on May 10 that left Ukrainian troops reeling, Zelenskyy said. The death toll from a glide bomb attack on a Kharkiv shopping mall Saturday rose to 18, regional Gov Oleh Syniehubov said Monday, with five people still missing. The Kharkiv push has further strained Ukraine’s already depleted army, which in recent months has been fighting Russia’s intense drive deeper into the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region. Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the Kremlin’s army is mustering at another point in Russia, farther north but close to the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, aiming to stretch Ukraine’s depleted army thinner and crack its resistance in the area. Zelenskyy and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez signed a bilateral security agreement that allocates 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) by 2027. More Leopard tanks and artillery ammunition also feature in the package. “After more than two years (of war), Russia’s aggression continues, and that’s why it is more necessary than ever to redouble our support,” Sánchez told the joint news conference. The Patriot is a surface-to-air guided missile system that was first deployed in the 1980s and can target aircraft, cruise missiles and shorter-range ballistic missiles. It is expensive but is effective and sought after by armies around the world. European countries have hesitated to send Patriot systems to Ukraine, fearing they may need them. Spain’s King Felipe VI earlier welcomed Zelenskyy at the capital’s Barajas airport. Zelenskyy was due in neighboring Portugal on Tuesday. He had been due to visit Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia’s response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. A Ukrainian long-range drone set a new distance record by attacking overnight an early-warning radar in the Russian city of Orsk, some 1,800 kilometers (1,120 miles) from the Ukrainian border, Ukrainian officials claimed. The operation was conducted by Ukraine’s military intelligence, GUR, an intelligence official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to comment publicly. Ukraine’s previous long-range attack record was at 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) when a drone struck an oil refinery in Russia’s Bashkortostan on May 9. It was not immediately possible to verify either claim. Meanwhile, a Western intelligence assessment suggested that Russia’s Kharkiv offensive has subsided. “The northern Kharkiv front has likely stabilized with Russian territorial control fragmented and not joined up,” the U.K. Defense Ministry said Sunday. “Russia’s gains in this axis will be limited in the coming week, as Russia’s initial momentum has been contained by Ukrainian resistance.” That is in line with Zelenskyy’s claim last Friday that Ukrainian forces have secured “combat control” of areas where Russian troops entered the Kharkiv region. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in U.S. military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force. ___ Associated Press writer Illia Novikov in Kyiv, Ukraine contributed to this report. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",

        "content": "@XandertheWise It depends on when the first day of school is of that year. My high school typically started very early in August, then seniors wouldn't be around anymore in May. I graduated in 2008 and during that year they pushed our first day into late August. So while my graduation was the first day of June, on Sunday, our last day of classes was the 2nd week of May. Sorry for the late reply @Bundersvessel ! I pulled a back muscle and I was in so much pain over the weekend. The joys of getting old Yeah it was an extraction. It seems to be doing rather well now.. So surreal that it's gone though. Ooooh boy I don't envy you. Mine are already all grown up thankfully (Though that comes with it's own problems). I don't think I could manage with a baby/toddler at my age now... I deal with kids enough as a teacher ha ha Is this where @kyleforrester87 is at? @JohnnyShoulder nah but I have seen that in recent years. We are total bad asses! Went to a local Tekken 8 tournament last night and it was pretty cool. I didn't do great @Voltan Cool. How many took part in that? @oliverp It was actually quite big (and a Dojo event for Tekken World Tour) - 48 players in the bracket @Jimmer-jammer How are you man? I'm still downloading RotR, despite having completed the tutorial, as I have a very slow internet connection/set up my Ps5 with performance settings that somehow cause slow downloads, anyway, it is a big game as well so that probably contributes to that. Anyway, how's work and life treating you? Is your job anything like the TV Show 'The King of Queens'? 🤣 @Black_Swordsman Doing well, thanks! Yeah, RotR is a really big game, so that’s surely a factor. As for my job, it’s less King of Queens and more Highway Thru Hell. In fact, parts of the show were filmed in my neck of the woods. I haul petroleum crude, so there’s the added stress of dealing with a dangerous goods product but the nice thing is that I work a 9 on and 5 off schedule, which works well for managing my life, especially when my real passions are decidedly less blue collar. I did, for a time, deliver and service portable toilets across Calgary and Vancouver, including at the 2010 winter olympics, which probably could have been its own tv show 😂 How are you doing? Have you carried on with your studies? Still operating the helplines? @Jimmer-jammer Yeah, good thanks, I am applying for courses at the moment so hopefully I'll get on to a good one, and yes, still operating the helplines. It's quite rewarding and enjoyable. That's interesting about your former employment. Definitely a TV Show I would have paid to watch! @Black_Swordsman Glad to hear you’re doing well! Being an ear for people in need is a real gift and takes a tremendous amount of personal fortitude. Here’s hoping your courses pan out the way you’d like! Plan a game purchase for tomorrow (its the day when the salary comes here where I live so) feel like I deserve to buy a game then (have planed the purchase for quite some time). @oliverp Which one? I cna't wait to buy Paper Mario 2, but unfortunately I had an awful pay day this month. That on top of me having spent all my savings over the last year, makes it really hard to justify new game prices. Especially since I still have quite some games left unfinished. Finances will probably return to normal by next month, so it's nothing to be worried about. Just sad that the one game I was looking forward to happened to release this month. @kidfred Oh its a big one which I might announce in the purchase thread. I of course hope that you soon will be able to pick up some new games. @oliverp I might have an idea about which game 😉 I have decided to give up on the idea of being a professional musician and focus purely on psychology for a future career path. It was an accumulation of things that led to this decision, I suppose, but mostly the fact that I realised I had been holding on to my teenage dreams, mostly inspired by reading interviews with musicians, mostly from the band 'Iced Earth' and other rock and heavy metal bands about how you go \"all in\" when you're young if you're gonna make it, and then stick to it, kinda thing. I realised that at this age a career in psychology, another of my interests, is more realistic, and on a personal level, more fulfilling to me. I also felt like I had \"made my mark\" on the music industry, with a handful of gigs from my teens under my belt, in addition to SoundCloud recordings, which people liked, flatteringly, recorded more recently. I will now just play guitar for fun, along with games, and read and watch cricket as my primary hobbies and interests, whilst focusing on psychology for the career and personal fulfillment. I have \"met up\" with my college self in the best possible way now, still focusing on a couple of the same hobbies and interests I had at that age, but without applying the passion and drive necessary to become a professional musician to that unlikely end now, and instead applying it to becoming a professional psychotherapist. @Black_Swordsman I find your decision and self-awareness quite inspiring. I'm closer to retirement than I am to my early working years, and I still don't know what I would choose to do or have a passion for. I do have some experience in psychology having spent many years talking to professionals with my personal history of depression, anxiety and other related mental illnesses, and I can certainly see the appeal and fulfillment of such a career choice. The very best of luck to you! @Malaise Thank you for your feedback and for disclosing that, I sincerely wish you all the best with your mental health and everything else in your life. I hope you discover what you want to do, in terms of a particular ambition, what you and I both referred to as a passion, and if not, I hope you enjoy the things that you do do in life that you may not necessarily be passionate about in the sense of a specific ambition, goal, or drive.",

District Judge Gail Horne Ray's decisions have raised questions over a potential conflict of interest in Brooks' case. Brooks, 19, died when she was hit by a car in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana , on January 15 2023 after she was allegedly raped by four men , Kaivon Washington, Casen Carver, Everett Lee, and Desmond Carter. Ray is presiding over their trials, but her impartiality has been called into question after she dismissed Donald Ray Link's 1972 rape conviction this month and released rape suspect De’Aundre Cox on reduced bail last year. East Baton Rouge District Attorney Hillar Moore III has clashed with Ray over the decisions telling WBRZ : 'I've never seen this done ever or heard of it ever done before.' Madison Brooks, 19, died when she was hit by a car in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana , on January 15 after she was allegedly raped by four men District Judge Gail Horne Ray's decisions, along with her son Nelson Dan Taylor Jr's multiple rape convictions, have raised questions over a potential conflict of interest in Brooks' case Ray's son, Nelson Dan Taylor Jr, was convicted of raping multiple classmates - aged between 12 and 17 - between 1995 and 1996, breaking into their homes in a mask and attacking them at knifepoint. He pleaded guilty to all of the rapes and was sentenced to 50 years in prison with a requirement to serve at least 25. Ray took office as a 19th Judicial District Court judge January 12, 2023. Three months later, she released De’Aundre Cox, who was accused of raping his preteen neighbor, on reduced bail without alerting the victim or notifying the district attorney's office. Cox is facing two counts of aggravated rape against a now-teenage girl who lives near his family’s home in the Park Forest neighborhood. She was 12 when the alleged sexual abuse began. She told officers that Cox threatened her with a gun before raping her on two occasions. The abuse was discovered when the victim's older brother, who was friends with Cox, found a video of the attacks on his phone. District Attorney Hillar Moore slammed Ray's decision to release him last April and said his office was only notified a week after he was released. He told The Advocate at the time: 'We really are confused as to how this bond was reduced without notice to the state and an opportunity for us to be heard on behalf of the victim. And we are concerned as to what happened and how it happened.' The victim's mother told the outlet that the family 'live in fear' and said: 'Why didn’t they let me know? We could’ve changed up, because these people have already threatened me.' This month, Ray clashed with the DA again over her decision to throw out convicted rapist Donald Ray Link's 1972 conviction for aggravated rape. Link was serving a life sentence for threatening a woman with a butcher's knife before raping her. He appeared before Ray asking her to reduce his sentence so he could ask for parole. Instead of reducing his sentence, she overturned his conviction entirely, bypassing the parole process. Moore told WBRZ her decision was 'unheard of', adding: 'She has no authority whatsoever to do what she did and her reasoning was erroneous.' Ray's decisions and her family history have raised further questions over Ray's impartiality in the ongoing Brooks case. Her decisions were slammed online with one Twitter user saying 'she needs to be removed' and another saying 'this judge should be removed! Absolutely disgusting.' Moore and Ray did not return Fox News Digital's requests for comment. LSU student Brooks was allegedly raped by Carter and Washington in the back of their car while the other two suspects watched after a night of drinking at a bar in Tigerland. After the alleged attack in their car, the suspects allegedly left Brooks stumbling and drunk on the side of a busy four-lane highway. She was hit by a car around 3am and died from her injuries. Brooks' alleged attackers claim they did not rape her and say only consensual sex happened in the back of the car. Brooks was allegedly raped by Carter and Washington in the back of their car while the other two suspects watched after a night of drinking at a bar in Tigerland Casen Carver, 18, (left) Kaivon Washington, 18, (second left) and Everett Lee, 28, (second right) and Desmond Carter, 17, (right) were all arrested on rape-related charges Brooks was last seen drunkenly stumbling out of Reggie's bar, which has since had its license revoked, with the group. Other footage released by authorities shows the student running after the group of men on the night she died. Fellow Varsity football player Washington has been charged with third-degree rape in Brooks' case – though prosecutors say they are hoping to upgrade the charges. He has been accused of raping another young woman who claims he attacked her in October last year after targeting her at Reggie’s, the same bar the group met Brooks. The victim in the October case says she was too drunk to go home so asked if she could stay at one of Washington's friend's apartments. According to his arrest affidavit, they all went back to the home together, where she and the friend started having sex in front of Washington. The friend allegedly became more 'aggressive', pinning her down and ignoring her as she pleaded with him to 'stop'. Other footage released by authorities shows the student running after the group of men on the night she died The 29-second clip shows Madi appearing to tell the teenager Desmond Carter, 17, to 'get out' of the car so she can 'Uber on her own' Washington was watching but then approached and felt the victim's breast and vagina, the affidavit claims. The alleged incident is the third accusation of rape to have been made against Washington. In addition to Brooks, he is accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in 2020 after following her home from a pool party when he was 15. The Walker High School Varsity Football player has been charged with first-degree rape in that case, with prosecutors vowing to upgrade the charges in relation to Brooks. Lawyers for Washington previously submitted video footage to the court in an attempt to prove that the drunk sorority girl was able to consent to the acts – but a judge felt it showed 'criminality'. A legal expert told DailyMail.com that the judge's 'inappropriate' comments could 'taint the public opinion' of the defendants. Washington can reportedly be heard in the footage laughing at Brooks as she slurs her words after the alleged anal rape. Her sorority Alpha Phi confirmed that she donated her kidneys and heart Madi died after being hit by a ride-share car at 3am on January 15, when she was dropped off by the four men who had picked her up at a college bar Louisiana's first-degree rape statute carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. Brooks died after being hit by a ride-share car at 3am on January 15, when she was dropped off by the four men. Two Good Samaritans reportedly stopped to perform CPR on the sophomore LSU student after the collision. East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office says they were guided by first responders on the phone in the pouring rain after Madi was hit by the ride-share car. They confirmed that Madi Brooks died from 'multiple traumatic injuries' when she was hit by a car after allegedly being raped. Police confirmed that the driver of the vehicle will not be charged as he was not impaired and contacted emergency services immediately. A memorial was created for the 'amazing young woman' who had 'limitless potential' by her friends on the highway where she died. Carter has been formally charged with the first-degree rape and third-degree rape of Madi, but a grand jury chose not to indict him on one count of kidnapping Madison Brooks (left) seen behind the bar at Reggie's with two sorority sisters. She had been drinking at the bar before she was raped and fatally struck by a car on January 14 Pictures show Washington partying with friends and posing for the camera, while another shows him topless and clutching an inflatable alien The bar where Madi worked, according to several social media posts, has also had its responsibility for the incident called into question. Surveillance footage surrounding Reggie's bar, where the group met, shows Madi drunk and stumbling around, according to police documents. The Louisiana ATC has confirmed that they have suspended the license of Reggie's following the 'seriousness of the allegations and potential threat to public safety'. An attorney for the bar, Kris Perrett, confirmed in a statement that they are 'fully cooperating with authorities'. A lawyer for Brooks' family issued a statement last year saying: 'She was raped. Rape is rape. It's just a horrific, terrible situation. 'And to the extent that those involved with the alleged rapist want to blame the victim and show up at press conferences and say things ... we're standing up for Madi. That's not right.'

        "content": "by: iSeeCars Posted: May 27, 2024 / 10:00 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 10:00 AM PDT ( iSeeCars ) – It’s time to buy a new car, but you’re not flush with cash. You need to figure out how to get a car loan. Whether you’re thinking new or used, securing a car loan is one of the first steps you should take in the car-buying process. Breaking the process down into pieces rather than trying to tackle it all at once makes it easy. Here’s everything you need to know about how to get an auto loan with the best rates, even if you don’t have the best credit score. The first step toward getting a car loan is determining your credit score. This can also be referred to as your “FICO score” and is a numerical representation of your credit history. The three major credit reporting agencies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – will each provide a free credit report and your FICO credit score once per year. Another option is to check with your bank or credit card companies. Many of these institutions also provide a free credit report and will tell you your credit score. The credit report contains a record of your credit history, including any items that are hurting (lowering) your credit score. Any previous car purchases, including the auto lenders’ names, will be listed, along with the car payment amount, interest rate, and other loan terms. If you’ve missed a car payment in the past, the financial institution likely reported it to the credit bureau, and you’ll see it here. If your credit score is low, don’t panic. You can boost the number. Start by making sure you make your credit card and loan payments — particularly any existing auto loan payments — on time. Take care of any past-due accounts, and pay down the balance on your loans if you can, especially any revolving credit accounts. You should also avoid opening new accounts, as frequent inquiries to the credit bureaus seeking new credit can hurt your credit score. A good credit score isn’t required to secure a car loan, but as a borrower seeking a competitive annual percentage rate (APR) on the interest you’ll pay, good credit is critical. If a bad credit score is causing a higher APR you might consider a co-signer. A co-signer, usually a close relative or very good friend, can agree to be responsible for making loan payments if you don’t, which can lower an otherwise high interest rate. You should always get pre-approved for a loan before you visit the first dealership. A pre-approval means a lender has fully reviewed your credit and loan application to determine a likely loan amount and interest rate. During the pre-qualification process, the lender doesn’t look at your credit in as much detail. They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

They’ll still give you an interest rate and a loan amount, but there’s a good chance the exact auto loan terms you’ll get, once your loan is fully approved, can change. Determine How Much Car You Can Afford The amount of money a lender is willing to let you borrow, and the amount you can afford to borrow, are not necessarily the same number. How much you can afford is something you need to determine long before your car purchase. As a general rule, your car payment should not be more than 10% of your take-home pay, and your total car expenses (fuel, maintenance, insurance, registration) should not surpass 15 percent of your take-home pay. Many sites offer a free auto loan calculator, where you can quickly determine a car payment based on the purchase price, down payment, and interest rate. Consider the impact of that monthly car payment on your overall budget. If your monthly take-home pay is $4000, your car payment shouldn’t be more than $400, and your total monthly car expenses (including the payment) should be more than $600. If the loan terms, including principal payment, interest, and any additional fees, are cutting it too close, take out a smaller car loan, even if the bank is willing to loan you more. Consider a Down Payment A down payment reduces the amount of the loan you need to take out, and that reduces your monthly payment. This also reduces the overall interest you’ll pay on the loan. While that can help make a car easier to afford, don’t empty your savings account. Be sure to keep enough money on hand for whatever surprises might come your way. New or Used? When buying a vehicle, you have the choice of buying a new or used car . One of the big perks of new cars is the reduced likelihood of unexpected repair bills. They also come with new car warranties that protect you for a limited time. A new car loan can also mean a lower interest rate, especially if the manufacturer is offering incentives to sell a specific model. These could include zero percent interest if you have a good credit score. Used cars might not be as reliable, though many now come with their own manufacturer (CPO) warranties to set your mind at ease. (Check out our guide to learn more about Certified-Pre Owned cars and if they are worth it.) And while new cars are sold exclusively through dealers, which can often arrange an auto loan, used cars can be purchased from a dealer or a private party. A private party purchase will require you to arrange your own car loan terms, but you already did that, as we suggested above, right? Finally, keep in mind the depreciation on a new car means there’s a much greater loss in its value in the first few years after purchase compared to a used car. If you’re going to keep your new car for the life of the loan, which will likely be between 5 and 7 years, that’s not a concern. But if you decide to switch cars earlier the vehicle’s depreciation represents a significant ownership cost, beyond interest charges, insurance, maintenance, etc. If you plan to switch cars every few years you’ll save a lot of money buying cars that are at least 3 years old. Keep in mind that cars depreciate at different rates, so buying a car that best holds its value is a smart purchase decision. Do Your Research A car is a major purchase, so do your research before you decide which model to buy. Seek out online reviews to see what experts think about the car you’re considering. It’s also good to research consumer reviews to see if people who did buy your car are happy or if they have complaints about reliability. Test Drive at the Dealership Once you narrow down your choices, make time for some test drives. No matter how good a car looks on the internet, you need to get behind the wheel and drive it. This gives you the opportunity to check on the interior quality, the comfort of the seats, and the overall performance of the car you’re considering. Don’t let a salesperson cut your test drive short. Take as much time as you need. Also, be sure to do the kind of driving you normally do every day, whether that’s cruising on the highway or navigating downtown traffic. If you have kids, check that their car seats fit and that everyone is comfortable. A test drive is your chance to make sure the car you’re looking at will really work for you and your lifestyle. (Check out our guide on What to Look for When Buying a Used Car to help you get the most of your test drive.) Compare Dealer Financing with Outside Financing There are multiple options for securing financing. First, there’s the dealership. Dealers often work with multiple auto lenders and will be able to check with several at one time to come up with a loan term, but they aren’t your only option. As mentioned above, you can also work directly with a bank, starting with whichever one already has your business. They’ll often provide better loan rates to existing customers but check with other banks, too. Finally, there are credit unions. They work much like banks and can offer the same types of loans and loan terms, but you may need to be a member of the credit union to secure a loan. This could be as simple as opening a checking account. Check all three options – the dealership, banks, and credit unions – before you make a decision about financing. Many of these institutions will offer online lender applications, so don’t feel you have to physically visit each of them to receive a loan offer. Negotiate Don’t feel obligated to accept whatever loan offer the dealership presents to you. Understand that you can usually negotiate your used car or new car price. There’s plenty of room for negotiation, especially if you secured your own financing before you went to the lot. Factors worth negotiating include the purchase price of the car, the value of your trade-in (if you have one), the length of the loan, the loan interest rate, and any extra charges (see below). Decide what loan terms you’ll accept before you arrive at the dealership, and be ready to negotiate to get the best deal. Beware of Add-Ons Once you’ve agreed to a car’s purchase price you’ll find yourself sitting in the finance office, where you will be presented with all sorts of add-ons that the dealer wants to tack on to your purchase. They’ll include everything from extended warranties to car washes to rust-proofing. The list is endless. Add-ons like extended warranties are not worth the extra cost. You do not have to accept a single one of these add-ons, and should be prepared for pushy sales people. Look carefully at what is offered and be firm in saying no if you’re pressured to purchase add-ons you do not need. Remember, these add-ons aren’t free and they will increase your monthly payment. Understand the Terms of Your Loan Be sure you fully understand the terms and disclosures of your loan. Know the interest rate, the number of months the loan covers, and the final monthly payment. If you see a cost in the loan terms that doesn’t make sense, ask for an explanation and don’t proceed until you understand it and feel it’s justified. Check to see if there is any prepayment penalty if you try to pay off your loan early, and understand what fees will be incurred for things like late payments or returned checks. Make Payments on Time It will help your credit score immensely to make your payments on time. Consider scheduling automatic payments to keep your loan on track. Missed payments can add costly penalties and reduce your credit score. Should I Refinance My Current Loan? If you had poor credit when you first took out your loan and it has since improved, refinancing may be a good call. However, there are fees associated with refinancing. Make sure the lower interest rate isn’t offset by refinancing fees. Bottom Line Buying a car is a major purchase. It’s not something you do every day, and understanding the auto financing portion of buying a car is as important as finding the right make and model to fit your needs. Take your time to figure out exactly how much you can afford and secure the best financing possible. Budget carefully so you don’t over-extend yourself, and make your car payments on time to maintain a good credit score. More from iSeeCars.com: Car Leasing Vs. Buying: Which is Better?

        "content": "Chelsea made history in English football. Recently, they won the Women’s Super League title after beating Manchester United 6-0 at Old Trafford when the whole country counted them out. Emma Hayes, who is now departing the club as the season has ended, got to end her tenure as a Blue with yet another trophy. The club legend leaves Chelsea having won silverware 16 times in just under 12 years as head coach. Hayes joined Chelsea in August of 2012, during a difficult period for the club. It was not until 2015 when she got to earn her first silverware at Chelsea. That year, Chelsea won the WSL title, as well as the Women’s FA Cup. Over the next few years, Emma Hayes continued to fill up the trophy cabinet. Under her leadership, Chelsea have won eight FA WSL titles (including the Spring Series), five Women’s FA Cups, two FA Women’s League Cups and one FA Women’s Community Shield. Chelsea has been quite the dominant side these past five years, however, this season was far from easy for the Blues. Here, we will take a closer look at their season, the lows, the highs, and how they gave Emma Hayes an imperfectly perfect sendoff. The first 10 games of the season saw Chelsea consistently produce good results. In those 10 games, the Blues went 8-1-1. Notably, their draw and loss came from those that gave them competition for the title. In what was their second game of the season, Chelsea drew 1-1 to Manchester City. The defeat came from a London derby hosted at the Emirates, where they lost 4-1 to Arsenal. While Chelsea had positive results in the first half of the season, they were not the only ones to. Manchester City and Arsenal also had solid starts to the season. In 10 games, City enjoyed 7 wins, 1 draw and only 2 losses. Their draw came from the previously mentioned game with Chelsea, and one of their losses notably came from Arsenal. As for their London rivals Arsenal, the Gunners had 7 wins, 1 draw and 2 losses. Heading into January, it therefore appeared to be a three-horse race to the WSL title. In January, Chelsea announced that prolific striker Sam Kerr would be sidelined for the rest of the season following an ACL tear. The Australian had managed nine goals in all competitions before the injury. In her absence, Mia Fishel stepped up and took on the role of central striker. But, to the Blues’ demise, Mia Fishel also sustained an ACL tear a month later. In the games that followed, it was clear that Chelsea were missing the presence of a natural goal scorer in the final third. Luckily for the Blues, by the end of most 90 minutes, they were able to score goals and win. However, the difference between Chelsea and Manchester City was that the latter more often won games with ease. A telling game was their return fixture when City beat Chelsea 1-0 at Kingsmeadow. This loss held heavy meaning. It was Chelsea’s first home loss since February 2021, ending a run of 33 games. It was also Chelsea’s first loss to Manchester City at home in the WSL for the first time since 2016. At this point in time, City looked the most likely to be the victors of the season. The first six games of 2024 saw City be more consistent than Chelsea who had a loss, as well as Arsenal who had two losses in that run. Arsenal was no longer strong contenders for the title . Heading into the final six games of the season, consistency was what the teams had to muster. In their third game of the final three, Chelsea had quite the blow. A 4-3 loss to Liverpool had Emma Hayes conceding the title to City. In her own words; “I’d love to win titles again for Chelsea, but that’s not going to be this year I’m afraid.” Hayes was not bluffing, as the title did seem to slip out of their hands, and only a miracle would bring them back into a fight. To Chelsea’s luck, a miracle in the form of a Stina Blackstenius brace brought the Blues back into the fight. In what was expected to be a decisive game, Manchester City were leading 1-0 against Arsenal into the final 10 minutes. However, a minute before stoppage time, Stina Blackstenius scored an equalizer. The Swede was not done scoring yet though, as she netted another goal two minutes into stoppage time. Not only had Blackstenius won Arsenal a big game, but she had also allowed Chelsea back into the title fight. This was all the more important as Chelsea had just come off the back of an 8-0 victory against Bristol City, as well as a 1-0 against London rivals Tottenham. Manchester City and Chelsea therefore went into the final game of the season, equal in points. Goal difference would be the title decider if both teams were to earn the same points on Saturday. Heading into the final season Chelsea’s goal difference was +47 while City’s was +45. On a day when goals mattered though, it was Chelsea who came out on top. Whilst Manchester City struggled to earn a 2-1 win against Aston Villa, Chelsea was enjoying an easy win at Old Trafford. In ‘The Theatre Of Dreams’ Chelsea scored six goals and kept a clean sheet against Manchester United. Columbian striker Mayra Ramirez who joined the Blues on a record-breaking fee had an incredible first half, managing two goals and two assists. Johanna Rytting Kaneryd, Sjoeke Nüsken and Melanie Leupolz also added their names to the scoresheet. Poetically, the last to score a goal for Chelsea that day was Chelsea’s all-time leading top goal scorer Fran Kirby on her last Chelsea game, who just like Hayes, is set to leave the club now that the season has concluded. Chelsea’s victory at Old Trafford allowed them to add yet another achievement to the history books. Chelsea is now the first team in England to win five league titles in a row (WSL or EPL). They are the WSL’s most successful club since its inception in 2011 with eight league titles. In a season where it looked like Hayes would be leaving trophyless , the Blues proved why they should never be counted out. The brilliance of Emma Hayes and her mighty Blues has been a marvel to watch. A true legend of English football is leaving on a well-deserved high. Hayes will coach her first game for the United States Women’s National Team (USWNT) for a friendly against South Korea.",

        "content": "Some of the polls before the general election may be overstating Labour’s huge lead over the Conservatives , a Tory election expert has said. According to Robert Hayward, a peer and former MP who first identified the phenomenon of “shy Tories” before the 1992 election, his analysis of local election results suggests that the Conservatives are getting more support from voters who say they are undecided than is showing up in the polls. “About 33 years on, I am yet again convinced that a statistical bias exists in the polls,” he said. Polling in the run-up to the election has shown commanding leads for Labour of more than 20 points in some surveys, such as YouGov, while others, such as Opinium, show a gap of about 14. Some constituency-level polling by YouGov suggests the Conservatives are heading for near wipeout. Its April projection points to more than 400 seats out of 650 going to Labour . Most experts, MPs and political strategists across the parties agree that Labour is almost certainly heading for victory, but the size of its lead will determine its majority in parliament. Hayward said it was “not shy Tories” all over again, and that Labour still undoubtedly had a large lead over the Conservatives, but he was concerned the polls were “getting it wrong”. “I think the biggest problem for me is how you allocate the Conservative 2019 voters who are now ‘don’t knows’. I do believe the ‘don’t knows’ will vote in fairly large numbers, and the indications from local council results is that they are beginning to break towards the Conservatives. “Because of the lack of commitment displayed so far, I’m not sure where things are going to end up, because events during this election could have more of an effect than in many elections because there are so many undecided.” One polling industry expert also agreed there was a risk the polls could contain methodological or structural errors. They said: “I think there are lots of reasons to be concerned about a polling error this time around. There are serious data quality issues across the industry, where it’s getting tougher to ensure the people taking part in surveys are real, taking the surveys seriously, and representative of the wider population. Pollsters are working harder to combat it, but that task is getting tougher, and there is a risk that it affects the accuracy of the polls this election. “The other issue is undecided voters. There’s three times more people who voted Conservative and are undecided than voted Labour and are undecided, and where these voters end up going will make a big difference. The pollsters make different assumptions about this group ... The range of this is probably like Labour 1997 to Canada 1993 – it’s a Conservative party historic defeat with one methodology, to complete wipeout with another methodology.” Sign up to Election Edition Make sense of the election campaign with Archie Bland's daily 5pm briefing, direct to your inbox. Jokes where available after newsletter promotion They added: “The last thing is that polls do tend to be less accurate in elections with lots of change. Polls were fairly inaccurate in 1997 but it didn’t matter, because the result was so decisive. When there are more voters moving between parties, polls become more chaotic, their accuracy tends to decrease.” Anthony Wells, head of European political and social research at YouGov, said it was likely that the differences between each company’s surveys would narrow as polling day approached. “There are still a substantial number of people who voted Tory in 2019 saying ‘Don’t know’ when asked how they will vote,” he said. “A large amount of the difference in leads between different polling companies is because of different choices in how to handle that. Some companies choose to model or predict how those people will vote come election day, while others report only what people currently say. “It is as much a philosophical decision as anything else. Are we measuring how people say they will vote, or predicting how we think they will vote? Either way, it is reasonable expectation that the differences between pollsters will narrow in the lead-up to July 4 as the number of people saying ‘Don’t know’ falls. However, whether that results in a narrowing lead or not depends on to what extent, if at all, those voters return to the Tory party.”",

With camping gaining popularity, it might have you wanting to take your motorcycle out into the wilderness to see what all the fuss is about. Motorcycle camping isn't exactly the same as going into a campground with your truck pulling a camper, or even car camping.

You might think having a spot for a motorcycle would take up a lot of the room, but you still have room for two or three people with the motorcycle. However, it would get cramped fast if you're all trying to fit air mattresses in there. It comes bundled with a storage bag that lets it get all packed up and tucked away on your bike when you're all done. This tent has a 4.4 out of five user score on Amazon based on more than 140 ratings. While it's advertised as being waterproof with a rainfly for cover, some reviewers have noted water soaks through the liner and gets the floor wet. Other reviewers mention it being a good tent during storms, so your mileage will vary. A cheap, no-frills tent that will keep you inside overnight is exactly what the Coleman Sundome tent offers. It's available from Amazon for $68.78, and its easy 10-minute setup makes it a breeze to make your campsite. There's no fancy way to keep your motorcycle housed inside as this is meant for two people, but you can opt for bigger sizes if you have more people with you. Coleman recommends the tent for backpacking and hiking, With more than 20,000 ratings on Amazon, this Coleman tent has a 4.7 out of five rating. There's nothing particularly fancy about the tent, but it's affordable and easy to carry around, which makes it a solid option for somebody camping out with their motorcycle. If all you're looking for is a way to stay dry overnight while having a roof over your head, it's hard to beat this tent for the price. It comes with a carrying bag so when you're all done with the tent you can get it packed away and back on the road within minutes. The poles fold up nicely, so you won't have issues storing it away nicely on a motorcycle. While not exactly a traditional tent, the Outsunny folding camping cot get you elevated off the ground and give you housing that'll keep you dry from any potential rain. This is an option for solo bikers who don't want or need to set up a whole tent. The cot comes with an air mattress and a dome covering for $124.99 from Amazon, where it has a 4.2 out of five user score. It seems like quite a bit to pack away, and everything weighs 27.1 pounds, making it heavier than some of the other options on the list. Some reviewers note it's too wide to stow away on a bike, but others mention how it was fine for road tripping on a motorcycle, so perhaps you'll need to measure the dimensions of your motorcycle beforehand. With this being more of a raised bed, you do have the downsides of not having a ton of storage space. If you're looking for a simple way to sleep overnight and get going again in the morning, then this is a good choice for you. If you want to have additional room outside of just a bed, you'd want to go with a regular tent instead. For a lightweight option at just about 2 pounds, the Hubba Hubba 2-person tent is a perfect choice if you're not trying to lug around something heavy. Cutting back on the pounds comes at a premium of $549.95 at retail, but you can often find the tent on sale well below that. On Amazon, you can grab it for $299, and it's much easier to justify at that price. It's a small tent that's mean for just a couple of people, but you have some nice storage options where you can put your phone and keys. Don't expect to be able to stand up in this tent, but there are 40 inches of headspace that lets you still move around without being too uncomfortable. The user scores are nice at 4.5 out of five on Amazon. There are some negative reviews where the tent broke or ripped on them after the first use, so that's a potential issue you could run into. With this being a high-priced tent, that'd be a shame, especially since there's no type of warranty offered with the purchase. If you didn't know Harley-Davidson made outdoor gear , you likely had no idea the company made tents. The Harley Road Ready Tent boasts the brand's iconic black, orange, and gray colors and comes in at a lightweight 5 pounds. The size makes it perfect for taking on a road trip, and you can fit it into the trunk of your Harley or luggage rack with ease. It comes in at $179 from Harley-Davidson, so while it's not the cheapest tent from the list, it's also not the most expensive. It can house up to three people and comes with a duffle bag that makes it easy to transport. The tent has a 4.56 out of five rating on Harley-Davidson's website, where customers speak highly of its quality. In a one-star review of the Harley tent, a buyer argued the rain fly isn't large enough, and that's the only complaint from the user scores. This is a good one for Harley fans who want to show off their brand loyalty. The tent is backed by a 90-day limited warranty. All five of the tents on this list have high user scores from where they're sold, whether that's Amazon, or in the case of one tent from Harley-Davidson. Motorcycle camping differs from regular camping as you don't have the room a car can provide, so you need to save space where you can. Each of these tents fits into a little bag that makes it easy to carry with a motorcycle. On top of that, nothing's too heavy where you'll feel like you're being weighed down while riding in a noticeable way. With many motorcyclists traveling on their own, each tent is made for a person or two, so you won't have a lot of extra space. That's not a huge deal if you're just looking for somewhere to spend overnight, but don't expect to pack a full family comfortably into any of these five options.",

        "description": "\"That is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss, Bruno Famin.\"",
        "content": "According to Sky F1 correspondent Craig Slater, dropping Esteban Ocon for the Canadian Grand Prix is “under serious consideration” for Alpine boss Bruno Famin after the events of Monaco. Ocon had launched an overtake attempt on Alpine team-mate Pierre Gasly into Portier on the opening lap of the race, but the duo would collide, lifting the rear of Ocon’s Alpine off the ground as he suffered race-ending damage. This did not go down well at all with team principal Famin, who in the immediate aftermath, threatened “consequences” for Ocon via French broadcaster Canal+, which sparked speculation that Ocon could be benched for the upcoming Canadian Grand Prix, where he is due to serve a five-place grid drop. Slater has moved to confirm that this is a genuine threat facing Ocon, rather than just a rumour that emerged in the heat of the moment. “Bruno Famin, he was actually on the pit wall with Canal+ who called him up immediately in the aftermath of that first-lap crash and Famin spoke angrily and he talked about taking a tough decision, which everyone has interpreted as benching Esteban Ocon for the next race in Canada,” Slater began. “What I can say to you is that that is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss, Bruno Famin. He will do what is best for the team. But if he decides that leaving Esteban Ocon out for a week as a demonstration of how team discipline needs to be, he is prepared to do that, but that decision has yet to be taken. “There were face-to-face meetings between Ocon and Famin in the aftermath of the Grand Prix yesterday. Ocon apologised, both privately face to face and publicly afterwards via social media. So let’s see what happens.” 👉 Revealed: The staggering cost of Sergio Perez’s Monaco Grand Prix crash 👉 Monaco GP data: Mercedes ‘survival’ strategy conditioned by Alonso’s traffic denies fight for the win Gasly did go on to secure a point in P10, moving Alpine’s total up to two in what has been a disappointing season for the team so far, these struggles having seen both Gasly and Ocon linked with moves away from the team for F1 2025. Williams has been speculated as a potential destination for Gasly, while Ocon has been linked with the likes of Haas and Sauber, to become Audi in 2026. And Slater reckons that this Monaco incident – and any repercussions that it may carry for Ocon – fuels such exit talk. “I think what it does do is call into question whether Ocon will continue with the team beyond next year,” Slater continued. “We all cast up the fact that he was a childhood rival of the other Alpine driver Pierre Gasly and could the two happily coexist in the same team? Well, this is another example of them not coexisting happily. “And the other thing is, as far as most observers were concerned, it was a needlessly optimistic attempt that Ocon made to pass. “It could have cost the team any points in the Grand Prix, it could have taken both the drivers out the race and with the situation as it is at the moment, with anyone outside the top five teams really struggling to get points, it could have left them again at the back of the Constructors’ standings. “In the end, Gasly was able to get a point, that keeps them on two points for the season, but that’s an illustration of just how costly that crash could be. “So we wait and see. I think it would be a big, big decision to drop someone like Esteban Ocon. It really rarely happens. You don’t see it happen. “And remember, not that he’s unavailable to race, he has a five-place grid penalty for Canada, that would carry on to whoever got in that seat, of course. “But it is, as I understand it today, still a potential outcome here. Bruno Famin is weighing up whether or not to drop Ocon for the next Grand Prix. It’s in a couple of weeks time. Let’s see if he does take that very, very big call.” Ocon and Gasly have contributed a point each for Alpine so far in F1 2024.

Whatever measures are necessary to save our future generations exploitation will be taken and non-governmental organizations working in this regard deserve appreciation. He said this while talking to a delegation of the Roshni Helpline, which met with him at his office on the occasion of International Missing Children's Day, led by Dr. . He said that the Metropolitan Corporation will work with Roshni Helpline to recover missing children and prevent their exploitation, and will also arrange awareness programs and display awareness messages at public places so that people know how missing children are being used for their purposes and how they are being treated. Barrister Murtaza Wahab said that Roshni Helpline's emergency service 1138 will be linked with the KMC's helpline so that we can work together in this regard. He said that the KMC will raise awareness among the public about missing children so that innocent children are not used for begging. The Mayor said that wherever there are no manhole covers in the city, the work of installing them is underway and will be expedited so that children do not fall into them and get or killed. Dr. said that Roshni Helpline is an institution that has been working for a long time to prevent child abduction.

Linden, who has 39 years of experience as a driver, said the award is a good way for him to be recognized after a long career of driving. “It’s an accomplishment of my career here,” he said. “I’m getting ready to retire in a couple more years, so it’s a good way to go out.” Linden was recognized at the National Waste and Recycling Association’s Waste Expo convention May 7 in Las Vegas, Nev. He said it was a great experience traveling out West. “It was unlike anything I’ve experienced before out there,” Linden said. “ Republic Services did a great job of getting me out there. “(National Waste and Recycling Association) was there and they gave me my award, and the CEO’s of my company were there to congratulate me.” Linden, who has consistently received positive customer reviews over the years with Republic, stressed how important paying attention to safety is when working as driver. “You got to watch out for everything, focus on your job and on the other people on the road,” he said. In honor of Linden’s award, the National Waste and Recycling Association awarded Republic Services in Elyria with a brand new truck worth over $400,000 with Linden’s name printed on it.

        "content": "Devon’s planned devolution deal with Torbay has been thrown into limbo because of the surprise announcement of the general election. Devon and Torbay’s councils had both agreed to create a combined county authority (CCA), a so-called devolution deal that proponents believe would provide a better chance of securing government cash for projects linked to adult education, housing, transport, and green initiatives. But prime minister Rishi Sunak’s plans for a poll on Thursday 4 July mean parliament will be dissolved next week, putting many planned pieces of legislation on ice. Before the election was announced, it was hoped the parliamentary process would take place in or around October, but with uncertainty about who will be running the country then, it’s now unclear what will happen. “We are seeking clarity from government officials on how the legislative process for setting up the Devon and Torbay Combined County Authority will be affected following the announcement of the general election,” Cllr James McInnes (Conservative, Hatherleigh & Chagford), the new leader of Devon County Council said. “We met....with Torbay Council and both organisations remain committed to bringing forward our agreed devolution arrangement as soon as possible, and we collectively await clarity from government officials.” Cllr McInnes added that he had already contacted the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing, which oversees the devolution process, to secure the previously announced £16 million agreed as part of the deal. He and Torbay’s leader, Cllr David Thomas (Conservative, Preston), have selected 16 “excellent projects” to receive the money, a decision that now needs to be confirmed by a formal vote. “These schemes span housing, skills, business support and green infrastructure and can have an immediate impact on our local economy,” Cllr McInnes added. “There would be schemes in each district area with the potential to bring forward affordable homes, decarbonise existing properties, support more than 1,000 learners in green and net zero skills, and the creation of jobs and apprenticeships.” Cllr McInnes added that as soon as he had any more information about the devolution process, he would update the council.",

        "description": "Following an aggressive move in Monaco that resulted in a collision, Alpine F1 is contemplating benching Esteban Ocon for the upcoming Canadian GP.",
        "content": "In the aftermath of a collision involving teammates Esteban Ocon and Pierre Gasly during the opening lap of the Monaco Grand Prix, the Alpine F1 team may sideline Ocon for the Canadian Grand Prix. The incident, which resulted in Ocon's retirement and compromised the team's standings, has led to internal criticism and discussions of significant disciplinary measures. The iconic streets of Monte Carlo became a scene of frustration for Alpine during the Monaco Grand Prix. The issue stemmed from Esteban Ocon's overly ambitious overtaking maneuver on his teammate Pierre Gasly right in the opening lap. This impulsive act not only finished Ocon's race prematurely due to suspension damage but also endangered Gasly's race, although he managed to continue. The initial response from Alpine was swift and stark. Team chief Bruno Famin did not mask his disappointment over the incident. He stated to Canal+ during their broadcast, as quoted by (translated by ): \"It's sad these kinds of incidents. This is exactly what we didn't want to see. Esteban's attack was completely out of circumstance. We're going to decide straight away.\" Considering the race presented Alpine's best starting grid position of the year, expectations were naturally high, and Ocon's rash decision significantly derailed their strategy. Given the gravity of the mistake, Famin hinted at severe disciplinary actions, which might include sidelining Ocon for the upcoming Grand Prix in Canada. : \"Famin spoke angrily. He talked about taking a tough decision which everyone has interpreted as benching Esteban Ocon for the next race in Canada. What I can say to you is that that is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss Bruno Famin. \"He will do what is best for the team but if he decides that leaving Esteban Ocon out for a week as a demonstration of how team discipline needs to be he is prepared to do that but that decision has yet to be taken. \"There were face to face meetings between Ocon and Famin after the grand prix. Ocon apologised privately and publicly afterwards via social media. Let's see what happens.\" Slater added: \"What it does do is to call into question whether Ocon will continue beyond next year. We all cast up the fact he was a childhood rival of the other Alpine driver Pierre Gasly and could the two happily co-exist in the same team? It's another example of not co-existing happily. \"The other thing is, as far as most observers were concerned it was a needlessly optimistic attempt by Ocon to pass. It could have cost the team any points in the Grand Prix.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "Couch co-op and JRPG are two genres you don't often see together. Secret of Mana is one of the earliest examples of the genre, with most of the Tales of series also allowing fans to play together while sitting side-by-side. But outside of those examples, playing JRPGs with your friends in the same room isn't a common experience. Fortunately, Timesea Studio — made up of three brothers — is changing that. Nintendo Life can exclusively reveal that the developer's first game, Infinity Knights: Xross , is coming to Switch (and other platforms) in late 2025. It's a three-player couch co-op RPG inspired by the Mana series, first and foremost. But it's clear that the trio behind the title — Saxon, Michael, and Tyrone Goodrick — have a wealth of knowledge about the genre. Dark Cloud , infamously called the \"Zelda Killer\" by PlayStation Magazine back in the day, and the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI (which is still going after 22 years) are both name-dropped. Plus, the brothers have managed to make \"a dream come true\" and have brought Secret and Trials of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta on board. Infinity Knights: Xross is centred around the titular Infinity Knights, who serve the king. They wield The Armaments, magical weapons with the power to revive the dead — including, enemies you've just slain. You'll be playing as Xross, the newest Infinity Knight, and you and two others (this is where that co-op comes in) will get to explore the world, scout static and randomly generated dungeons, engage in a huge variety of minigames and quests and plenty of active combat with puzzles to solve. And like any good RPG harking back to the SNES days, there's some lovely pixel art on show, too. We had a chance to send Timesea Studio a bunch of questions and dig deep into the game's inspirations, mechanics, and world. From working together as brothers to implementing quests from an MMORPG, and making quality-of-life enhancements inspired by childhood frustrations, this is clearly a labour of love. Nintendo Life: Could you tell us a little bit about how you came up with the idea for Infinity Knights: Xross, particularly around creating a couch co-op RPG and working together as siblings? Michael Goodrick, Lead Boss Design & Area/Experience Development: We always knew one day we would make a game. We have all these ideas swirling around – ideas about quality of life, intriguing stories, and engaging gameplay. As RPGs are one of our favourite genres, and with old-school games being close to our hearts, we decided to make Infinity Knights: Xross pay homage to that. But specifically making it cooperative comes from a long-shared passion of playing video games – we’ve played in the same house together since we were kids. It was never really a question. Working together on a video game was just the next step! we’ve played in the same house together since we were kids. It was never really a question. Saxon Goodrick – Lead Programmer & Story/Event Planner: We also noticed that there is a distinct lack of good cooperative experiences in the gaming world. We wanted to fill that gap by creating a game together, as some of our fondest memories are playing games in the same room, on the same couch. Games like Secret of Mana, Crash Bash , Halo 3 , etc. Tyrone Goodrick – Lead Combat Design & Minigame Design: Being brothers makes working together on the game easy. When it comes to discussing ideas, mechanics, bosses, and stories, we are all on the same wavelength. New ideas are usually met with a \"That's awesome!\" Working together as siblings is a blast and a lot of fun. We’ve got game titles with Cross, or with X (sometimes pronounced cross, sometimes the letter 'X'). So why 'Xross'? Saxon: There are quite a few reasons. Infinity Knights is a collection of stories experienced from the viewpoints of certain characters. This game is the first story, and it features the titular character ‘Xross’, hence, Infinity Knights: Xross. Using the ‘X’ instead of the ‘C’ in ‘Xross’ is very symbolic concerning the story. The name is... regionally unique. It’s a different dialect compared to most other names in this chapter of Infinity Knights. Xross himself is also an integral part of the Infinity Knights – he is a very significant person. ‘X’ marks the spot, as they say. It’s also an ode to many things. To Final Fantasy XI, to the Organization XIII members in Kingdom Hearts , and X ( Mega Man X ) to name a few. Infinity Knights: Xross is the cumulative influence of gaming generations combined with our own new and unique ideas. An intersection of two directions. A cross! You’ve been inspired by a range of classic (and sometimes overlooked) RPGs, with Dark Cloud, the Mana series, and Final Fantasy XI singled out. What is it about these games/franchises that struck you, and what inspirations have you taken from them? We’d say that the strong point of those games is deep immersion. Each game brought something new to the table that hadn’t been seen in a game before – at least to us. They still feel like fresh experiences that haven’t been replicated since. We love questions like this because we could talk about these games for hours. Infinity Knights: Xross is the cumulative influence of gaming generations combined with our own new and unique ideas. Dark Cloud is so unique in its worldbuilding and atmosphere. The combination of dungeon diving, slaying monsters, and building up the towns via Georama ... the whole experience is fantastic. It’s got an unusual (brilliant) soundtrack, fun drawings, and a wicked weapon customisation/progression system. Great game. We’re combining this weapon system with some inspiration from Final Fantasy XI’s ‘ Trial of the Magians ’ system, allowing players to customise their stats and abilities present on both weapons and abilities. Xross also looks after a sector of the Kingdom as part of his Infinity Knight duties, and we have been inspired by elements of the Georama system. In Dark Cloud, you would explore dungeons and use Atlamillia to rebuild a town before moving on to help others. We take a similar approach, where on adventures you collect all kinds of things on the overworld and dungeons before bringing them back to bolster shops, equipment, sector resources, and so on. Ultimately, it helps your character's progression and the story. Final Fantasy XI has this incredible sense of adventure and wonder. It really captures immersion well. It’s the kind of game where you can just run around the world map for hours, talking to NPCs, discovering secret areas, and fighting cool enemies. We have loads of memories in Vana’diel. Those who’ve played the game know the feeling. We wanted adventures outside our kingdom sector to hit home in a similar way. In Infinity Knights: Xross, you team up and venture out to undiscovered lands, secret areas leading to dungeons, and tough enemies to fight. That sort of thing. We’re also structuring part of the character progression in the same way [as] job classes in Final Fantasy XI. Some sharp-eyed fans have noticed that you wield a variety of different weapons – and these sort of act like job classes. Each weapon comes with a set of abilities unique to it that augment the way you fight when combined with the elements you’re harnessing. Secret of Mana was ahead of its time for RPG console co-ops. You could play the whole game together, or you could drop in and drop out! How awesome! Co-op experiences are a lot of fun, and we were inspired by Secret of Mana from a young age. It’s also got an awesome soundtrack. We’re very encouraged by the co-op legacy that Secret of Mana left, and that’s especially evident in a later Mana release on the Nintendo DS called Children of Mana . A lot of inspiration is taken from these games in the way that pixel and sprite games can be just as enjoyable, sometimes even more so than AAA games. There is a lot to be said for the immersive qualities of a top-down sprite J/RPG. We think that these games have effectively constructed this immersive feeling through their unique graphics, story content, gameplay systems, and sound. It’s a delicate balance to create experiences like these games do. That’s what’s inspired us. We want to create an amazing experience for gamers through every medium we can. Engaging gameplay, great scenes and story, fun... and we’re going to do it cooperatively too. What kind of modern qualities of life have you considered for Xross? Are they inspired by any frustrations you’ve had when playing and replaying older JRPGs? Michael: This is an excellent question and something we are very passionate about. We’ve kept a list for a long time regarding the features we would love to have seen in the games we’ve played — JRPGs and other genres — and it is a BIG list. As such, many quality-of-life features have made their way into our game, and will continue to do so. Some of these already exist, but a lot are unique! Secret of Mana was ahead of its time for RPG console co-ops Tyrone: Things like accessibility for disabilities, being able to customise the UI, and rearranging things. It amazes us that many games do not allow you to customise button inputs. No drop rates that don’t respect players’ interest or time. Making sure cutscenes are skippable and tutorials are optional and non-repetitive. Preset modes for speedrunning and randomization. The list goes on. We’re keeping a lot of our unique features a secret, but hopefully, these can get you into our mindset of how we’re enabling players to enjoy themselves most. There are a few things we’re willing to share now though. Saxon: We’re developing an automatic reaction timer (that can be turned on or off). If the game senses you need a bit more time to parry correctly, then it will adjust to challenge you appropriately. We’re hoping that features like this will encourage people to try some of the more challenging mechanics in video games, as well as increase the immersion felt by players. We’re also looking at changing the way ‘difficulty’ works in this game, so that the experience is more customised for your enjoyment, instead of just having preset modes with scaled stats, etc. You’ll be able to combine different levels of ‘difficulty’ for yourself, granting the best experience for you. We could go on to list more features, but what really matters is our intention. We want to make a game that respects players’ time and doesn’t feature punishing statistics, missables, penalties, and so on. We have every intention to make sure players enjoy their time in the world of the Infinity Knights. You can be sure that we will try our utmost to reduce all frustrations players have to zero through a lot of personal playthroughs, testing, and player feedback. We want to make one of the most accessible and playable RPGs of all time. What can you tell us about the Armament System? How does it affect combat and gameplay, and can you give us examples of side quests that involve this mechanic? Saxon: The Armament System is the Infinity Knights’ bread and butter, and we can split that into two sections: gameplay and story. The Armament System is our weapon upgrade system. You can select enhancements you’d like to apply to the weapons you want to wield, strengthening them as you use them more. This will also augment your abilities. You can also combine them with elements! You might like a giant scythe with a hefty chance to teleport and deal double damage, or maybe you’re more of an archer who likes to use magic lightning arrows that bind opponents while reducing your ability cooldowns. We want players to know they can use whatever weapon they want combined with many different enhancements, which will drastically change the way each individual plays the game. We want to make a game that respects players’ time Michael: In addition to that, if you and your allies combine attacks, you ALL get the enhancements from each other. We’re hoping that by blending these abilities cooperatively, you’ll create a truly unique strategy for taking down foes. It’ll be something just you and your cooperators share. We have lots of mechanics that promote teaming up with your allies, be it CPUs, friends, or family. Saxon: The Armaments themselves are summonable weapons that the King bestows on his Infinity Knights. They’re strange blades that only the King can create, and every day, he performs a ceremony called ‘The King’s Rite’ that seems to revive anyone slain by an Armament... The Infinity Knights rely heavily on this, using the weapons on themselves or allies to save themselves in the heat of combat, traversing another realm to be called back to the Kingdom. The Infinity Knights also use the Armaments on their enemies, isolating foes within the Kingdom at the discretion of the King’s power. Almost all quests involve the mechanics of the Armaments, and many of them will provoke players into questioning the morality of the blades' power, of what is right and what is wrong. How are the Armaments made? Do they have a cost? Should they be used on the guilty? The innocent? Why does only the King have them? Are there others? As a brief example, there is a quest where Xross throws himself off a cliff in pursuit of an enemy, by using his Armament on himself before he plummets to his death. We’re really trying not to spoil the game, but we’re hoping that the people who read this can start to imagine what they might do if they could cheat death for themselves and others, and how that might change depending on the type of immortality a person has. Through this avenue, we can engage those who love the story, morality, and philosophy behind some of the great RPGs of the past. Hiroki Kikuta has worked on a few notable indie titles such as Indivisible , YIIK , and Tangledeep . What’s it been like working with Kikuta-san, and what do you love about his music? Michael: It has been like... a dream come true. If you told us 20 years ago that we’d be working with Kikuta-san, it would have left us gobsmacked. Kikuta-san is an incredible artist - his passion, experience, and musical talent we just have so much respect for. If you told us 20 years ago that we’d be working with Kikuta-san, it would have left us gobsmacked. Tyrone: He is a legendary composer that made a massive impact on how a game's sound can be. We feel that while the story, characters, and visuals are a massive part of a game, the music direction is equally as important. Many games wouldn't be what they are today without the talents of their respective composers and we believe Secret of Mana (among others) is one such game. Kikuta-san creates songs that can transport you into that world. He manages to capture the atmosphere of the moment - running around, fighting a dangerous boss, saying farewell, etc. You can listen to the soundtrack decades later and remember your own feelings playing that game, something he has achieved time and again. The main track for Infinity Knights: Xross – ‘Going to the Eternal’ – is a great example of how he took the story and the questions it poses, and transformed it into a song. Incredible. Also. We love Kikuta’s drum tracks and beats, they’re so good. We’re amazed by him, to put it simply, and we’re very much looking forward to all our future work together. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. Thank you to Saxon, Michael, and Tyrone for taking the time to answer our questions. Infinity Knights: Xross is set to release in late 2025 on Switch, and you can find even more details about the game on its official website . So....would that be “ex-ross” (and if so who is Ross?) or just “cross”? 🤣 Or would be pronounced like “zross”? And if it is just “cross” then what’s with the “x”? Inquiring minds want to know..... Will it have blackjack and hookers?",

Timeless white linen sun dresses will always be fashionable, but there is one dress in particular that is taking Instagram by storm right now. Fashion fans are going wild for Marks and Spencer's Pure Cotton Midi Cami Shift Dress and we can definitely see why. For one, it looks so much more expensive than its modest £39.50 price tag. In fact, it resembles a £434 version from the designer label, Wolf and Badger. The cami-style shift dress, which previously sold out online, is guaranteed to be a staple in any spring and summer wardrobe for years to come, thanks to its timeless design and effortlessly elegant construction. It has been cut in a regular fit with a n elegant and floaty midi skirt that's flattering on any figure.

It can be worn to formal events with heels or a blazer or with a pair of wedges, sandals or trainers on less dressier occasions. We especially like these £22.50 Flat Open Toe Mules and the £55 Leather Double Buckle Flatform Sandals.

        "description": "'It’s exhilarating. It’s terrifying.'",
        "content": "Debuting on Disney+ today, The Acolyte aims to revive the Star Wars universe with a fresh storyline set 100 years before the Skywalker saga. The NZ Herald ’s Karl Puschmann talks to showrunner Leslye Headland about the new series, her compelling vision and why she’s avoiding online discourse. A lot is riding on the success of The Acolyte , Disney’s new Star Wars series , and its creator Leslye Headland is feeling all of the feels. “It’s exhilarating. It’s terrifying. It’s vulnerable. It’s a dream come true. It’s the worst thing that’s ever happened to me...” She waits a beat, then laughs. “No, I’m just joking. It’s wonderful.” Beaming in from Los Angeles, Headland appears relaxed. She’s confident the series she’s created, wrote and directed will bring balance back to the Star Wars fandom , which has generally been left disappointed by recent offerings from that galaxy far, far away. The Acolyte can almost be considered a soft reboot of the franchise. Rather than attempting to shoehorn itself into the Luke Skywalker/Darth Vader timeline which all the current movies and TV shows are set in, the series instead rewinds the clock 100 years. This gives The Acolyte a completely blank slate to tell its story without the need to worry about continuity or disturbing other canon events in other media, while still giving it the basic Star Wars foundations to build on. The show is an action-mystery series that sees Jedi being tracked down and killed by a shadowy assassin and the emergence of her hidden Sith puppetmaster. The story follows Jedi master Sol (played by Squid Game’s Lee Jung-Jae ) and his former student Mae ( The Hunger Games’ Amandla Steinberg) as they attempt to track down the killer and her master. When Headland pitched the series, she memorably presented it as “ Frozen meets Kill Bill ”. It was a combo so appealing LucasFilm’s head honcho Kathleen Kennedy greenlit the series there and then. “It was surreal,” Headland says, the disbelief still present in her voice. “I know that’s a pat answer, but it really was. I had been working on the pitch for so long and Kathleen’s a legend, so I was very nervous. But to achieve that in the room, to connect with her in that particular way, to leave the meeting knowing I was going to get to work in this IP, in this world that George Lucas created... the only word I can think of is surreal.” To call her a Star Wars fan is an understatement. During an interview promoting The Acolyte at the giant fan convention Star Wars Celebration , she was asked about her history with the franchise and broke down in tears, saying the movies “saved her life”. Frustratingly, the host didn’t ask how, or why, or anything further about her emotional revelation before moving on. “My family moved when I was in high school. I went from one place where I had a lot of friends to a place where I didn’t have a lot of friends and felt very alienated,” she replies when asked to elaborate on her Star Wars Celebration answer. “This coincided with the special editions coming out. Being able to see them in the theatre the way George Lucas intended them to be... I was blown away. I loved them as a child, but at that point, to experience that, to love that, it became my whole personality. Star Wars really just became my whole personality for a while there.” More so than any of the recent shows, The Acolyte explores the classic Star Wars themes and ideas of the moral struggle between right and wrong and the consequences of embracing dark over light. “The thing I learned is that conflict is inside all of us. It’s what George Lucas talks about; the balance,” she says. “It’s not the banishing of the bad or the banishing of emotions. That’s not what the Jedi are about. They have those things inside them. They’ve just found a way to balance that.” Related articles Furiosa Review: Buckle up, George Miller's back Karl Puschmann: Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes' effects are 'flawless' Karl Puschmann: The Moon is Upside Down is an illuminating Kiwi dramedy Karl Puschmann: The verdict on the grand finale of Curb Your Enthusiasm She grins and admits there are “absolutely” examples from her own life when she’s failed that morality choice or given into the dark side. Despite all insistence for her to provide a concrete example, she laughs and simply says, “I can’t disclose that at this time.” What she can talk about, however, is the moment The Acolyte went from a successful pitch to something she was actively working on. “I had pitched a season arc, but for every writer, that first page is still daunting, even if it’s a story you’re excited to tell. I think every writer has that same feeling when they’re looking at the notepad and going, ‘God, I hope I get an idea. I hope something comes to me.’” “My advice to any aspiring writer is: finish it.” she says, emphasising the full stop. “Finish the draft. If you go back and start rewriting while you’re writing, well, that way lies madness.” Keeping track of “the conversation” can also lead a person directly to madness. As much as Star Wars is beloved, there’s a segment of the fandom online that has fallen to the dark side and become toxic. Female stars, writers and Kennedy have all been subjected to a torrent of online abuse. Headland and The Acolyte are no exception. “As a Star Wars fan and somebody who consumed a lot of the ‘capital-D’ discourse before I got the job, I know what’s out there. I don’t need to go searching for it,” she says. “Since getting the job, I’ve had to mind-wipe it away.” Not that she’d have time to jump online even if she wanted to. Right now she’s caught up in the show’s launch, doing as much as she can to ensure it goes smoothly, finds a fanbase and gives Star Wars the win it currently needs. The pressure’s on. Not only does Disney want The Acolyte to be a hit, they want it to be the springboard for its own galactic universe of spinoff shows and movies. Headland has done all she can. She’s created a compelling vision, written an intriguing story and directed a great cast in physical locations with real sets. Now, it’s up to the force. “You know, the goal was to create this show, to execute it and work with incredible people,” she smiles, “And then send it out into the world and let it breathe. We’ve done that. Now we have to let it live.” The Lowdown Who: Leslye Headland. What: Creator of the new series Star Wars: The Acolyte When: Streaming from today on Disney+. New episodes weekly.

        "content": "The Cincinnati Cyclones , the ECHL affiliate of the New York Rangers , finished their season last month, and it was a bit disappointing. However, there were some positives to take away from the season as well. The team had a 31-34-7-0 record, with a 43.10%-win rate. They scored 236 goals and allowed 261 goals against. Their power-play percentage was 23%, and their penalty-kill percentage was 76.4%. The Cyclones finished 6th in the Central Division standings, which was a bit lower than hoped for, and they missed the Kelly Cup Playoffs for the first time since the 2016-2017 season. Despite the challenges, the team has a strong young core that shows promise for the future and will be a force to be reckoned with in the Central Division next season. Top 3 Forwards: Patrick Polino: 23 Goals, 35 Assists (72 Games Played) Lincoln Griffin: 13 Goals, 18 Assists (40 Games Played) Sahil Panwar: 22 Goals, 32 Assists (64 Games Played) Top 3 Defensemen Jalen Smereck: 14 Goals, 57 Assists (70 Games Played) Cole Fraser: 3 Goals, 12 Assists (58 Games Played) Ole Julian Bjørgvik-Holm: 5 Goals, 28 Assists (57 Games Played) Goaltending Cyclones fans witnessed a revolving door of goaltenders throughout the season, with six netminders taking the ice. Olof Lindbom led the pack in terms of playing time, appearing in 29 games and boasting a .884 save percentage along with a 3.56 goals-against average (GAA). Talyn Boyko also made a significant impact, playing 26 games and achieving a .888 save percentage with a 3.42 GAA. The remaining games were split among Pavel Cajan, Rylan Parenteau, Michael McNiven, and Julian Sime. Looking ahead, the team will need to shore up their goaltending if they want to make a serious run in the Kelly Cup Playoffs. Unfortunate Losses Zack Andrusiak, a key scorer for the Cyclones, was traded to the Florida Everblades in March and then moved to the Fort Wayne Komets, a divisional rival. By that stage of the season, the team was no longer in playoff contention, and it seemed that Andrusiak was ready for a new opportunity. He mentioned his interest in continuing his career in Europe, so it remains to be seen what the future holds for him. The team captain, Justin Vaive, played in just 45 games during the last regular season before being sidelined with a season-ending shoulder injury in early February. Despite this, he managed to tally 28 points, bringing him closer to becoming the Cyclones’ all-time points leader. As he just finished his 9th season with Cincinnati, fans are hopeful that he will return for his 10th season and surpass the current franchise leader, Jesse Schultz, in points. Louie Caporusso, a crucial player for the team, had an impressive performance in the 2022-2023 season, scoring 73 points. However, he was sidelined for most of the recent season due to a sports hernia that occurred in January. Despite this setback, he managed to tally 29 points (10 goals and 19 assists) in just 34 games, showcasing his exceptional skill. It’s expected that he will return to the Cyclones in the Fall, and his presence will be instrumental in the team’s development, particularly in terms of offensive power as a center. Within the final games of the season, Cole Fraser sustained an undisclosed injury that is expected to keep him out of play for a significant portion of next season, possibly until January. Cole is a vital defenseman for the Cyclones, contributing 15 points in 58 games during the previous season. As an integral part of one of the top defensive pairings, the Cyclones are eager to have him back on the ice as soon as possible. History Made in March For the first time in professional hockey history, tonight's starting five skaters are all players of color! Representation matters ️ pic.twitter.com/P4sABLcIgF Cincinnati Cyclones Make Professional Hockey History Outstanding Themed Nights I love the variety of themed nights that the Cincinnati Cyclones offer, from the heartwarming Teddy Bear Toss night to the festive Pride night, Marvel nights, Star Wars nights, Hockey Fights Cancer night, St. Patrick’s Day game, Skyline Chili night, and New Year’s Eve Firework night. As someone who grew up in Cincinnati, attending Cyclones games has given me countless cherished memories from childhood to adulthood. These themed nights not only add fun to the game but also support great causes. While I’m a die-hard hockey fan, I appreciate how these themed nights can engage a wider audience and create an electric atmosphere at the Heritage Bank Center. Personally, my top picks are the Teddy Bear Toss and the New Year’s Eve Firework show – the energy at those games is always incredible, with Heritage Bank Center typically rocking at full capacity. End-of-Season Awards MVP: Jalen Smereck : Had a career-high 71 points and led the ECHL with an outstanding 57 assists. Best Fighter: Sean Allen “The Sheriff” Most Improved: Ole Julian Bjørgvik-Holm Best Rookie: Sahil Panwar 2024-2025 Season Tickets on Sale: Cincinnati Cyclones | Cincinnati, OH Professional Hockey | Ticket Packages | (cycloneshockey.com) The Cincinnati Faithful The passionate Cyclones fans consistently fill up the Heritage Bank Center year after year, creating what I believe to be the most electrifying atmosphere in the ECHL. The 2023-2024 season drew an impressive total of 243,350 fans, ranking among the highest in the entire league. With such overwhelming support, we have much to anticipate for the upcoming season, and I have no doubt that this steadfast fan base will be there every step of the way. Despite differing opinions, I firmly believe that Cincinnati is a true hockey town; our dedicated fans are a testament to that. Hey Cincinnati, we love being your hockey team ️ pic.twitter.com/9EaTT5YG0H Season Attendance (Cincinnati Cyclones) This article first appeared on Inside The Rink and was syndicated with permission.",

The gamification of cryptocurrency is changing how investors interact with digital assets. ‘s latest dashboard feature is a prime example of this trend, offering a gamified experience that engages users. This article will compare BlockDAG with Dogwifhat Price and Theta Network Prediction, highlighting their similarities, differences, and unique selling points. It also aims to provide useful and interesting content to generate excitement about BlockDAG’s mineable network and encourage readers to consider investing in the presale. Theta Fuel (TFUEL), the Theta Network’s operational token, is essential to on-chain processes like deploying smart contracts and compensating relayers for sharing video streams. Analysts and investors often discuss the potential for TFUEL to hit $1. Although it is currently undervalued, a number of factors could affect its price in the future. Technological developments, general market trends in the cryptocurrency industry, and the Theta Network’s overall growth and adoption are all significant factors. The market for TFUEL is anticipated to grow as Theta Network broadens its alliances and applications. Innovations in blockchain technology and the growing popularity of decentralised streaming services also contribute to the increase in its potential value. Reaching the $1 threshold is a difficult but attainable goal, though it takes significant market momentum and positive sentiment to do so. DogWiFhat, although not very well-known, has seen its price rise sharply due to significant investments by large players known as ‘whales’. These big investors have been buying substantial amounts, causing a noticeable increase in the cryptocurrency’s value. This activity has sparked curiosity in the crypto community, with many speculating about the reasons behind these large transactions. Whale activity has given DogWiFhat’s price a brief boost, but overall, the price has been extremely volatile. This has caught the eye of retail investors, who see it as a possible investment opportunity. However, opinions among analysts are mixed. Some believe the whale activity signals confidence in DogWiFhat’s potential, while others warn that the price surge may be short-lived and driven by speculative trading rather than real value. BlockDAG’s latest dashboard feature offers users comprehensive insights and tools to manage their investments. Upon entering the dashboard, users see the latest announcements, ensuring they’re always informed. The dashboard also displays the user’s current rank, wallet balance, and recent transactions, making it easy to track investment progress.

This gamified ranking system adds competition and motivation for users to increase their investments.

By accelerating development timelines and reducing time to market, BlockDAG fosters a vibrant ecosystem of diverse projects. The platform’s robust and scalable infrastructure supports the growth of decentralised applications, enriching the blockchain landscape with innovation and diversity. Each platform showcases distinct strengths and promising prospects when considering BlockDAG, DogWiFhat, and Theta Network. DogWiFhat has garnered attention due to its substantial whale activity, while Theta Network’s expansion relies on its broadening range of applications and technological advancements. Nevertheless, BlockDAG shines through its innovative dashboard feature and user-friendly interface, making it an appealing option for potential investors. BlockDAG sets itself apart with its user-friendly dashboard, gamified ranking system, and easy-to-use token creation tools, positioning itself as a frontrunner in the crypto industry.

        "description": "The chief executive concedes the trip coinciding with the cuts proposal is not ideal.",
        "content": "The Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) chief executive is flying business class to Europe on a taxpayer-funded work trip just as staff are being consulted on a proposal to cut almost 400 jobs in an effort to reduce spending. Megan Main, who became ACC’s chief executive in 2021, admitted the timing was not great but said the trip to attend a conference and hold meetings was important to improving ACC’s services. “The timing of the trip coinciding with consultation on ACC’s change proposal is not what I would have chosen,” she told the Herald in a statement. “I have carefully considered attending the conference and these meetings and believe the knowledge gained will help us with our important work to enhance rehabilitation outcomes for the New Zealanders ACC supports. “I know this is a tough time for many of our kaimahi [staff] and I remain closely connected with the process and will continue to receive and consider consultation feedback while overseas.” Main left New Zealand on Saturday ahead of the International Federation of Health Plans biennial conference in Paris. Main would be speaking at the conference. She would then go on to spend four days in Finland, one day in Switzerland, one day in Ireland and two days in England to meet with “health system experts”, according to a statement from acting chief executive Michael Frampton. The statement said Ireland and Finland had similar populations to New Zealand and “highly performing health systems”. It claimed Switzerland’s Suva scheme was the most comparable to New Zealand’s ACC and had a mandate for “prevention, rehabilitation and compensation of injured workers regardless of where their injury occurs”. In London, Main would have two meetings with public sector departments for workplace health and safety. The approximate cost of the trip was $32,000. The final cost would be declared as part of the annual declaration of chief executive expenses. In his statement, Frampton said Main was travelling business class “for the long-haul flights within her itinerary”. She was expected to return on June 10. Earlier this month, Main proposed to disestablish nearly 10 per cent of ACC’s staff with 390 roles on the chopping block. Of the 390 roles, 81 were vacant. The proposal also included 65 new roles. The Government was set to reveal in Thursday’s Budget how much its goal to reduce public service spending by up to 7.5 per cent had earned. ACC, a Crown agency which manages injury claims, was not directed by the Government to tighten its belt but decided to pursue savings of about 6.5 per cent. Main had said the proposals supported the Government’s saving priorities and “set up ACC for the future”. Final decisions on the proposal were set to be shared with staff on June 26. Earlier this month, the Public Service Association (PSA) said it was alarmed by the proposals, which included 29 dedicated injury prevention jobs at a time when the number and cost of injuries was rising in New Zealand. “It makes no sense to propose these cuts, particularly as our working-age population is increasing,” PSA assistant secretary Fleur Fitzsimons said. “This is just more dumb stuff forced on ACC by the Government’s spending cuts. We will all pay the price for years to come with more accidents, injuries and harm.” The PSA chose not to comment on Main’s Europe travel. ACC Minister Matt Doocey also did not comment, saying it was an “operational matter” for ACC and its board.

        "description": "Almost 4000 roles would be cut as part of the Government's aim to reduce spending.",
        "content": "The level of the public service cuts needed to fund the Government’s tax cuts is becoming clear with more than 240 programmes scaled down or scrapped in Budget 2024. Finance Minister Nicola Willis also revealed yesterday the Government’s drive to reduce public service spending could lead to 3900 job cuts, comprising about 2750 currently filled roles and about 1150 vacancies. While she wouldn’t say how much the cuts were worth, Willis promised they would go towards National’s commitment to provide tax relief as well as employing more doctors, teachers, police and corrections officers as part of her “frontline” Budget to be released on Thursday. “Our hearts go out to anyone losing their jobs, but Budget 2024 has required us to carefully prioritise taxpayer dollars. Budget 2024 is unashamedly a budget for the frontline,” she said. “Instead of being a confetti of new spending ideas, you’ll also see examples of careful reprioritisation in almost every area of government. “Together, our savings exercise has freed up considerable cash and as promised, some of this will go to support tax relief.” Labour leader Chris Hipkins is taking aim at the scope of the cuts, saying New Zealanders would find out “the true price of those tax cuts” in the Budget. Thursday’s political theatre will likely be intensified by a nationwide protest effort called by Te Pāti Māori and others in Māoridom, designed to oppose what they describe as the “Government’s assault on tangata whenua and Te Tiriti o Waitangi”. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon says Te Pāti Māori and its supporters were entitled to peacefully protest and reinforced his commitment to deliver better outcomes for Māori and non-Māori. Willis, appearing with Luxon in a press conference yesterday, gave the most definitive update on the Government’s “savings” exercise as she revealed how many programmes would be impacted in order to facilitate tax cuts. Some of the 240 would be cut completely while others would be scaled down. The cost of those programmes varied from the hundreds of thousands to tens of millions. She wouldn’t give an overall figure, invoking the well-worn Budget-week answer that all would be revealed in a matter of days. Willis also provided her latest estimate for how many public service jobs would be gone, seeking to address speculation of the final count as government departments were proposing how many roles it sought to cut to comply with the Government’s request to trim up to 7.5 per cent of spending. She clarified her estimate of 3900 jobs was subject to change as departments undertook staff consultation, but warned further cuts were possible. “We see that the new normal for our Government will be constantly evaluating our dollars ... so that means I won’t rule out any further changes to public service workforce structures, they could change. “Our focus will remain on the frontline and that could mean in the future, there will be further changes to the back office. She also noted it was expected job growth from Budget intiatives would exceed the level of job losses, but didn’t specify how many jobs would be created. “We have encouraged ministers where possible to be very upfront about how many jobs are being created through initiatives and we intend to keep you updated about the impact of policy changes.” National’s “Back Pocket Boost” tax cut plan it took to the election promised an array of changes including adjusting income tax brackets to compensate for inflation and introducing a childcare tax credit - which would combine to give an average-income family with children up to $250 more per fortnight. She has repeatedly promised the tax cuts wouldn’t require borrowing and wouldn’t worsen inflation. On Monday, Willis wouldn’t state her commitment to implementing National’s policy when asked, saying she wouldn’t be spoiling Thursday’s surprise. She also wouldn’t address why the tax calculator National created to help people learn how much they would save from the party’s policy wasn’t operational online yesterday. Hipkins believed this indicated the tax cuts being offered in the Budget would not be the same as those National had promised. He pointed to the already announced cuts to the free school lunch programmes and the grants to first home buyers, as well as the likely demise of free prescriptions. “Every time Christopher Luxon or Nicola Willis said ‘we couldn’t afford that,’ keep in mind they gave $2.9 billion worth of tax cuts to landlords.” He also cast doubt on Willis’ claim that cuts to the back office staff would not come at the cost of frontline staff. “This distinction they’re making between back office and frontline is farcical.” The national protest action planned for Thursday reflected the sentiment behind a similar effort in December shortly after the coalition Government was confirmed and its policies agreed upon. That protest was partially fuelled by opposition to Act’s proposed Treaty Principles Bill that aimed to redefine Te Tiriti’s principles in law. National, which promised to support the bill to select committee, was initially vague on whether the controversial bill would get its support after select committee. Luxon has since confirmed it would not receive National’s ongoing support. Hipkins said he was not surprised protest action was planned for Budget Day: “There [are] increasing numbers of New Zealanders concerned about the impact that the decisions this Government have been taking are having on the day to day lives of a whole wide range of New Zealanders, whether Maori, Pacific New Zealanders, whether it’s those with disabilities, whether it’s women wanting to have pay equity.” Adam Pearse is a political reporter in the NZ Herald Press Gallery team, based at Parliament.

        "description": "Around 60 members of the public turned out to support the motion tabled by the mayor.",
        "content": "Far North District councillors have taken a stand on two controversial and high profile issues - one half a world away and the other here in New Zealand. At an extraordinary meeting on Thursday the council voted to call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza while also condemning violence and terror against civilians on both sides of the conflict and also to oppose the coalition Government’s bid to disestablish Māori wards. Far North Mayor Moko Tepania introduced a notice of motion for Thursday’s extraordinary meeting calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza and to endorse a letter to be sent to the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs to show its support and call for peace. Elected members passed a motion calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza while also condemning violence and terror against civilians on both sides of the conflict. The war in Gaza started after Palestinian group Hamas launched an unprecedented raid into Israel on October 7 . Hamas fighters stormed communities along Israel’s southern fence with Gaza. At least 1139 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the attack, and about 240 others were seized as captives and taken back into Gaza. Israel then launched a major offensive against Hamas in Gaza that has since turned much of the country to rubble and killed an estimated 35,500 Palestinians, many women and children. Israel is also about to launch a major offensive against the Gaza city of Rafah and the situation has led to widespread global condemnation of the continued offensive. Tepania said introducing a notice of motion follows the leadership and example being set by fellow councils around Aotearoa including Canterbury Regional Council, Christchurch City, Nelson City and Whanganui District to name a few. “It has been horrifying to see the human toll of innocent bystanders, especially tamariki.” “The Far North calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza is a small gesture that we can do from this side of the world to lend our voice to seeking peace while at the same time showing the leadership of our nation that we support continued global pressure for resolution of this conflict.” Around 60 members of the public turned out to support the motion tabled by Tepania. Councillors also endorsed sending the motion to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs to “show our support and call for peace”. Councillors also agreed to call for the immediate release of all hostages and to allow international aid to be allowed into Gaza. At the same meeting, councillors agreed to oppose the coalition Government’s bid to disestablish Māori wards and sign a letter by Local Government New Zealand , along with many other councils in Aotearoa, asking the Government to rethink its policy. The Government is proposing legislation that will require the Far North District Council to either disestablish its Ngā Tai o Tokerau Māori ward or hold a binding poll of all Far North electors to disestablish or retain the ward at the 2025 local elections. FNDC has already resolved not to disestablish its Māori ward, and it estimates that a binding poll alongside the local elections could cost up to $10,000. “Signing this joint letter will show sector-wide support alongside the other 44 councils that have established Māori wards or constituencies who will also be affected by the proposed legislative change,” Tepania said in his notice of motion.

        "description": "From Australia to Norway and Boston to Japan, architects and hoteliers are renewing historic slammers for the experience obsessed traveler.",
        "content": "Ever wished your holiday would never end? Want to take your next trip to the maxi-mum? Looking for a spot for a cell-abration? Dreaming of a great escape? By order of the court, check into the swankiest of sneezers. A bevy of adaptive reuse projects around the world has led to a surprising luxury travel trend: a growing number of stunning new hotels where you’d least expect to find them—in prisons. One recent unprepossessing pokey to get the Cinderella treatment is in Australia —a country that knows a thing or two about convicts. After a $1 billion dollar revamp, the defunct HM Prison Pentridge in Melbourne—which housed famed Down Under criminals like Ned Kelly and Mark “Chopper” Read —has reopened its gates as the 5-star Interlude . With just 19 suites, a subterranean heated pool, an award-winning restaurant and a wine bar, it’s a sumptuous slammer à la mode. “Pentridge from the time it was established, operated under oppressive rules, it housed some of Victoria’s most hardened criminals and over time,” said Dennis Bear, a former officer at the prison, who now acts as a tour guide. “The preservation of Pentridge is invaluable as it offers a wealth of knowledge and history. One has to admire the transformation of the complex. It has really rejuvenated the area. It’s a sanctuary for me now.” The draw for hotel developers is obvious: Prisons are often large heritage buildings with compelling back stories. Despite occasional backlash and even if those stories aren’t always positive—most of these prisons have seen executions, or, in the case of Mamula Island in Montenegro , have served as concentration camps —they offer the most coveted hotel amenity of all: experience. Moreover, to assuage guest concerns, exorcize ghosts, and cast out all that bad juju, prison hotels thoroughly sanitize. In the case of the Interlude, it even tapped Indigenous Elders to perform cleansing ceremonies to “purify” the property. Here’s a look at the most luxurious new, forthcoming, and established prison hotels from Japan to Boston . Completed in 1851, the Charles Street Jail was home to some of the country’s most notorious criminals for 140 years, as well as big names like Malcolm X and former Boston mayor James Michael Curley. Most notable and controversial inmates include Italian-born anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, who were executed by electric chair in 1925 before being vindicated in 1977 . Rumors circulate that baseball legend Babe Ruth may have something to do with the transformation, with the great slugger saying it felt more like a hotel than a prison during his visit in 1925. After a $150 million dollar transformation, the Charles Street Jail opened as a 298-room luxury hotel in 2007, now called the Liberty Hotel . The property, holding on to its “Boston Granite” structure, has added stellar suites and multiple dining options, including the “old drunk tank” for late night drinks. Its most luxurious “suite hole” is the Ebersol Presidential Suite, with 270-degree panoramic views of Boston, chaise lounges, and a butler pantry. Presidential Suite from $2,920 a night. The Interlude sits on the outskirts of Melbourne, without another luxury hotel insight. After more than $1 billion invested in the transformation, the former penitentiary (home to bushrangers, outlaws, and no-gooders like Douglas Ryan, the last man to be executed in Australia), is now Melbourne’s top urban retreat. A contrast to what it was before, B Block has been converted into a beacon of light with colorful textiles, chilled prosecco in flutes, and calming muzak awaiting guests in the octagonal-shaped atrium. The hotel is also home to an award-winning restaurant, North and Common, a 500-bottle wine bar with drops from the Australian Barossa Valley and Europe, including a 2017 Bruno Giacosa Barolo Vigna le Rocche Riserva Nebbiolo from Piedmont. All 19 suites have been carefully restored with the original bluestone walls, barred windows, and wooden doors. Today, the rooms offer black marble tiles in the bathroom, curated tea blends at the mini bar, and Dreamcatcher beds for the most comfortable stay behind bars. Sanctuary suite from $1,099. Even the Four Seasons wants to unlock the potential of a cellblock. In Istanbul, the company’s Sultanahmet district property recently underwent a hotel-wide refurbishment. Opened in 1996, the 65-room and suite Turkish neo-classical structure’s history dates back to 1918, when it was a jailhouse. Humorist Aziz Nesin, poet Nazim Hikmet, and novelists Kemal Tahir and Orhan Kemal all seceded from society here. Much of the external design and mosaic tiles remain as they always were, but inside everything old is new. The reno added Sureyya, a rooftop bar with panoramic views of the city, a gastronomic restaurant featuring Anatolian cuisine, and an expansive wellness center equipped with Turkish barber and beauty salon. There are a range of suites, but the simplest cell category is a Beyzade suite. Beyzade suites from $2,715 a night. “Bravery, resistance, and survival” was the motto of those who survived a stay at Mamula Island , a fortress dating back to 1852. Originally built as a military camp, the island was used as a concentration camp under Benito Mussolini, who sent thousands into this “den of cruelty.” Despite protests from families of those imprisoned , the island now serves as a remote wellness resort, offering Shamanic body treatments, lazy mornings by the underground pool, and seaside cocktails in the evenings. Despite its morbid history, demand is high, with three months advance booking required during peak periods. Room categories include Panoramic suites, Sky suites (best for sea views), and the two bedroom Sky Spa suite—replete with frescos, Jacuzzi, in-room bar, fireplace, and views of the Adriatic Coast. Panoramic suites from $1,410; Sky suites from $2,600; Sky Spa suite from $4,870 a night. Last year, Hoshino Resorts announced its plans to develop its 10th luxury hotel on the site of a former prison. Set in the south-central Honshu district of Japan in Nara, the 1908 prison will see the conversion of cells that once housed both war criminals and juvenile delinquents into 48 guest rooms. The prison only closed in 2017, when it was used for vocational training for young perps. Set to open in 2026, the hotel will have a restaurant, a bar, and a museum to preserve the “culture and history” of this Meiji period landmark. Pricing to be announced. This former prison and women’s correction facility in Berlin was recently reborn as a luxury boutique hotel in the heart of the eclectic Charlottesburg neighborhood. Reopened in 2022, it has a particularly rich history as a hub of anti-Nazi activists during WWII, a juvenile detention center, and a filming location for the Academy Award–winning movie The Reader . Now, known as the Wilmina Hotel, the 44-room estate is known for its light-filled, minimalist design by the husband-and-wife architect duo behind the conversion of the abandoned building. The property features all-natural COCO-MAT beds, a vegetarian restaurant tucked in the former prisoner courtyard, and the low-key Lovis bar for cocktails. Rooms come in various sizes from cozy to penthouse suite, plus one Garden Loft with its own kitchenette and large living area. From $243 per night; Penthouse Suite from $505; Garden Loft from $600. It’s hard to imagine Tjuvholmen, a tiny car-free district in Oslo known for its arts and culture scene, overrun by robbers, criminals and bandits. But it used to house them. Tjuvholmen translates to “Thief Islet” in English, and after a century serving as Oslo’s only correctional facility on the coast, this former prison is now one of the country’s most admired urban design projects. Known as the Thief , this hoosegow-cum-hotel has the biggest spa in Oslo with a hamman, multiple steam and sauna rooms, and a beauty salon. Better still, its eponymous restaurant earned a Michelin star in 2023. The nine-story, 118-room hotel also boasts an impressive amount of heist-worthy art. While most of its artwork can be found in the public areas and in the hotel’s rooftop bar, the Oslo Suite houses the most prestigious pieces and a series by artist Sir Peter Blake . If you can’t snag the biggest suite in the hotel, other suites come with bathrooms facing the Oslo fjord, floor-to-ceiling windows, and Japanese style electric bidets for your seating pleasure. From $835; Oslo Suite from $2,987 per night.",

        "content": "It may make you popular, but detrimental health consequences lurk below. Here’s why you need to stop being so nice all the time. There’s something seductively addictive about being a kind , generous, thoughtful human. A good friend to all, a reliable shoulder to cry on, the ultimate trouper. What could be wrong with that? Well, in fact, these traits could be detrimental to your physical and mental health . Because when compassion tips into you being a people-pleaser, the impact can become dangerous, even life-threatening. Why people-pleasing is bad for your health Stress is coming at people-pleasers from all angles. There is the tendency to live in perpetual high alert and be acutely sensitive to the feelings of others, while not vocalising your own needs and opinions. Hence you become entangled in a state of false existence. Some experts call it “ masking ” – when a person camouflages their authentic self. But living in this suppressed emotional state can lead to long-term health issues like depression , anxiety, exhaustion, poor sleep, burnout – and even heart issues, high blood pressure and cancer. We all deserve esteem. But people-pleasers undermine themselves, absorbing blame and guilt and endorsing the sense that they are less important than the rest. It’s not unusual either for people-pleasers to find other ways to cope, like slipping into addictions or taking medication to support their stifled feelings. Tanya Bardsley, 42, is a mother of four and a businesswoman . As a child, after being badly bullied at school and feeling cripplingly isolated, she adopted chronic people-pleasing behaviour. “I just wanted to be liked, and this transferred into my adult life. I would never say no to people or opportunities and constantly found myself in situations where I felt deeply anxious. “Every time I was there for someone else, I was chipping away at my own self-worth. Work piled up [Tanya appears in The Real Housewives of Cheshire ], I was running my businesses, going out all the time, being a mum and drinking too much booze to calm me down. “I was in a terrible state. I looked haggard, I was racked with anxiety and my heart was racing to the point where I thought I might have a heart attack – but still I kept trying to please everyone else. There were times when I felt so unhappy, I considered taking my own life. “Then when I was 39, I had a seizure and collapsed. In retrospect, it was the best thing that happened to me. I knew I had to change. I saw a psychiatrist who, after a lengthy assessment, told me I had undiagnosed ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]. “I’ve since found out that people-pleasing is related to ADHD, and rejection-sensitive dysphoria [RSD] is linked to ADHD. “It suddenly made complete sense. I am now so much happier. I’ve cut back on my workload and primarily focus on my passion projects like the installation of Cubbie sensory hubs in public places for ADHD and autistic people to take time out. “I eat healthily and I don’t drink but, mostly, I have put in strong boundaries for myself. If I can’t do certain things or show up for people, I simply don’t. “I wouldn’t say it’s always easy but I know that the alternative is a dark place. I firmly believe that if I hadn’t turned my life around, I wouldn’t be here.” Is it all to do with past experiences? The experts agree that people-pleasing tends to be a response to what has previously happened to you, and is adopted as a coping mechanism . It could be a learned reaction: Maybe your mother was a people-pleaser; or you found yourself in a situation where you had to go along with the norm to fit in. Rejection is a factor: Perhaps a parent put you down continuously, or a lover made you feel worthless, or school kids waited behind the bike sheds after the last bell to bully you. Anger could be a thread in your story: If you grew up in a volatile household you may be more prone to avoiding conflict, or if a depressed sibling regularly had meltdowns, it’s possible you quickly learned to keep schtum. Tiffany McLean is a personal and professional coach and admits she has been a people-pleaser since infancy. As the youngest of three children , she always felt on the sidelines. “I once heard my dad jokingly say to a friend that I was a mistake,” she remembers, “My parents already had a boy and a girl, and I felt like an extra. I adopted the role of being the pleaser because I wanted everyone to accept me. I never caused any bother, in fact I wanted to fade into the background. “This transferred into my adult life. I was always the follower, not the leader. In every relationship I was constantly complying; getting caught up in things I didn’t want to do. “At work, I took on more than I had the capacity for. I would stay late, never say no to whatever was thrown at me and even though I knew I deserved it, I never asked for a pay rise. “A typical trait for people-pleasers is resentment and at that time I had bucket-loads because I felt so put upon. “In my 40s I was at burnout and very unhappy. Then a colleague introduced me to a book called Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown. I renamed it ‘the art of saying no’. “It was a game-changer for me. I read it from cover to cover and it made me evaluate what was most important to me and if I was spending my time on the right things. “I realised I’d spent decades looking after everyone else and facilitating the belief, ‘Oh, Tiff is exhausted but never mind, she’s still breathing so let’s ask her to do more’. For the first time in my life, I started prioritising me.” How you can tell if you are a people-pleaser The 10 most common traits This behaviour endorses the internal belief you are not good enough and must exist at the bottom of the pile. Simone Bose, a psychodynamic and systemic therapist in private practice and for British relationship counselling service Relate, says: “This type of person may pride themselves on being a great friend or a rescuer, but often this way of being has been created for their protection. “They’ve learned somewhere along the way they can only be loveable, accepted or belong if they put others’ needs first. Their fear of rejection is huge, they can’t bear the idea that another person may not like them and so they safeguard themselves behind a shell of niceness.” Is people-pleasing a disorder? Many of the “ avoidant - psychological traits of dependent personality disorder show up in people pleasers: sensitivity to criticism, reliance on the approval of others, passive behaviour, lack of decision-making. But, while people-pleasing can be embedded in someone’s psyche, it is recognised more as an informal label used to describe a spectrum of behaviour. Most psychologists are more interested in the “why” behind its origins. Lara Waycot is registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy as an integrative therapist. “Some of my clients recognise this in themselves and they are the ones who are open to doing something about it,” she says. “Other clients, who have been acting in this way since they were little, don’t know any different. “If you have been trying to satisfy others for most of your life, you won’t have a strong sense of yourself. It can be devastating to realise at a mature age that you don’t know who you are, or what you want. “For those caught up in this mindset, there is a higher chance of being involved in destructive relationships or manipulated by others.” How to break free A people-pleaser is a highly tuned self-critic. But it’s important to remember, this belief originates from a difficult place and has been influenced by circumstance and the impact of others. So the best starting point is to recognise what happened to you, why it happened and the fact you adopted this persona to help you cope with life . In short, it is not your fault. The self-worth that has been lacking for so long must gradually be rebuilt, and while validation previously would have come from external sources; now it needs to be sought internally. It’s only when you believe in your own value that the confidence to instil boundaries and stand tall can happen. Often people-pleasers think that if they are not pleasing then they are being selfish. Corinne Maier, a writer, recently stirred the hornet’s nest when she encouraged women to be more selfish and “minimise the time you devote to others ”. And social media flies the flag for young women to put themselves bang up front, but what are the consequences for elbowing the rest out of the way? Bose says: “Being selfish is a difficult concept. But perhaps we need to reframe that word. Selfishness can be a good thing if you are working out what you personally need to be fulfilled. But equally, for some of us, being considerate and helpful is a top priority. “It comes down to balance – intense selfishness or overly pleasing takes us into extreme territory and usually doesn’t work out well. “As a therapist, I always encourage my clients to have a go at making changes slowly. Practise being more assured and saying no when you are pulled into doing things. “It will feel scary at first, but it’s important to sit with that discomfort and not push it away. If change is a gentle process, I find that people can tolerate the micro pain; they get through it and then they are ready to go again. “But however hard it might feel, if you really want to evolve, you must face the discomfort and understand how best to manage it.” Waycot says it’s often the reaction of others that complicates matters. “They are so used to having you on hand, it might be difficult for them to accept the new you. “But being assertive about what you want doesn’t mean being aggressive. For example, you might say that you’d rather not go to that party and explain the reasons why (too tired, you won’t know anyone) but you’d love to meet up for dinner next week – and then you suggest the restaurant.” The final word comes from McLean: “All those years I craved affirmation, then when I learned to value myself, my self-respect grew. “Interestingly, the more confident I became, the more respect and recognition I got from others too.” Share this article Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.",

        "description": "EVs and AI are putting huge demands on the power supply. What does it mean for investors?",
        "content": "Electric power consumption is expected to soar in the next few years. What will increased demand mean for share market investors? “I’m not sure that the average person is aware how much more electricity we’re going to need and consume over the next five to 10 years as we transition away from traditional fossil fuels,” says Pie Funds chief investment officer Mike Taylor. “Not to mention the impact that AI will have on the electricity demand.” It was probably more understood that if the entire car fleet went electric, we’d need a lot of power. But while the world has raced to adopt AI in the past two years, the amount of electricity that must be generated to power it was not so well-understood, he said. “A really simple way to think about it is if you look at an average Google search and the energy consumption for that versus an AI Chat GPT search, the AI search requires 10 times as much power or energy as a regular Google search,” Taylor said. There had been an explosion of growth for data centres, he said. “Where all this work goes on in the background is on servers and data centers.” If we look at the US as an example, data centres currently consume about 3 per cent of their overall power - by 2030 this was estimated to be 7 per cent of power, Taylor said. “They’ve got to come up with that extra power, on top of the fact that the whole economy is electrifying as well. So estimates in the US say that over the next 10 years, they will need an extra 40 per cent more power.” Taylor said that was putting discussion about more nuclear power back on the table in the Northern Hemisphere. There had been talk that Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg was looking to build an entire power plant just to run a data centre, he said. In the past few weeks, New Zealand’s power grid has struggled to keep up with demand as winter hit early. Meanwhile, we were also talking up this economy as a great space for data centres, encouraging the likes of Microsoft here. That combined with a growing electric car fleet could create issues locally unless we start investing in a big way, Taylor said. “We have to be a little bit careful of what we wish for. Obviously to have data centres here is good for data sovereignty, but then we need the power to run them,” he said. “I’m not sure that, in a short period of time, we could generate the additional electricity required for that, particularly if we want to move away from fossil fuels, because not all our power here that’s generated is renewable.” New Zealand still relied on coal to some extent and, while it was good to see some solar and wind continuing to open, it was not yet at a significant scale, Taylor said. “Just to give some context, New Zealand uses about 43,500 gigawatts of power per year. There’s a new solar farm that’s been built in the Bay of Plenty - it’s got about 60,000 solar panels and that’s only going to generate 54 gigawatts. It’s a drop in the ocean [with regard to] to the extra power we’re going to need over the next decade.” For consumers, this could mean ever-higher prices. But what does it mean for investors? “As an investor, you’re always looking to invest in something that’s got strong tailwinds, and from a utility perspective or power companies, it really looks like they do have tailwinds for the foreseeable future,” Taylor said. In fact, the market had already cottoned on to this, he said. The utility sector was the best-performing sector in the US year to date, even though interest rates were still high and normally these were dividend-paying stocks that don’t grow fast. “They normally trade very much around where bond yields are, but now that investors can see that, they will be getting growth as well as a yield,” Taylor said. “It’s suddenly becoming quite an attractive place to go.” On top of the traditional heavyweight power companies, there were investment options around alternative and green energy start-ups. But perhaps more overlooked were the money small-cap stocks that focused on improving energy efficiency, Taylor said. “There’s lots of little companies around the world you can find to invest in which are focusing on providing energy-efficient components, whether it’s into a data centre or in a building.” Liam Dann is business editor-at-large for the New Zealand Herald .

        "description": "Alt rock band X Ambassadors’ lead singer and Ithaca, N.Y., native Sam Nelson Harris is no stranger to the ‘Burgh.",
        "content": "Alt rock band X Ambassadors’ lead singer and Ithaca, N.Y., native Sam Nelson Harris is no stranger to the ‘Burgh. “My brother-in-law went to Carnegie Mellon, so I was there a lot when he was in school,” Harris said ahead of his band’s upcoming show Tuesday at Mr. Smalls Theatre in Millvale. “We’ve been to Primanti’s, I feel like I’ve been to every location.” Harris says Pittsburgh and Ithaca share a lot of similar qualities. “You’ve got the colleges there, I’m a college town kid,” he said. A good chunk of X Ambassadors’ new album “Townie,” which released April 5, is about Harris’ experience growing up in his hometown. “I love this new record. We worked so hard on it. It’s a very personal one,” Harris said. Harris has been musically inclined since birth, basically. “My mom’s a singer, I’m sure that had a huge impact on me.” She just recently sent him a video of him as a child, rapping along to the “Men in Black” theme song. He said that the first albums he owned as a kid were by Will Smith, Matchbox Twenty, Smashing Pumpkins and Red Hot Chili Peppers. The latter had a profound effect on his concept of an ideal music group. “I just loved the familial nature of that band. I was fixated on finding something like that,” he said. “They also don’t take themselves too seriously. I take myself so seriously sometimes and I hate it. ... I was a very serious kid and I think the attraction to a band like that was because of how playful they were,” he added. Finding his musical and songwriting voice was an early project for Harris. “I think there’s a thing with a lot of musicians — myself included — where I loved music so much, it did something to me, it inspired me, it moved me, it fascinated me. I listened to so many types of music and I somehow got fixated on that there was a mysterious combination, somewhere out there was an album or song that combined all of my favorite things. “I had to figure out what that was. And I think I kind of set myself to the task of figuring that out. That’s when you start writing music, that’s when you start playing music with a band,” he said. In high school, Harris played in various bands with his best-friend-since-kindergarten, Noah Feldshuh, and his brother, Casey Harris. After graduating, Harris and Feldshuh moved to New York City and met X Ambassadors percussionist Adam Levin at the New School dorms. A year later, Casey Harris joined them. “We got a rehearsal space and started cutting our teeth and writing songs and rehearsing and getting tighter and tighter. ... That was the beginning of things,” Harris said. The band released their debut full album, “VHS,” in 2015 and immediately had a hit with “Renegades,” The album also spawned the single “Unsteady,” which peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. “I feel like we really deserved it,” Harris said of the band’s big break. “We’d been ... toiling away in obscurity for so long. It was a bit of a relief when that happened.” But just as the band was hitting its peak, things were tumultuous within. Feldshuh and Harris ran into some difficulties and Feldshuh left the band in 2018, taking an indefinite hiatus in 2016. “That was a big blow, a founding member of the band and one of my oldest friends,” Harris said. He learned some valuable lessons from that time in the spotlight — first and foremost, to enjoy experiences as they come. “I think that because things were so painful for me, I just was unable to be in the present moment. I was so stressed out, so scared of losing this thing I wanted my whole life. “If we ever get lucky enough to have another moment in the sun like that,” he said, “I will be sure to try and appreciate it, and I think I’ve got some tools in my toolkit now.” “Townie,” X Ambassadors’ new album, is heavily about reflecting on the past and moving on from it. “I was at a point in my life where I felt like I had no road map forward,” Harris said. He used the process of this album to explore some of his past repeated patterns and discover a new sense of self. “I wrote a lot about what it was like growing up in Ithaca,” he said. It’s also about looking back on why he was in such a rush to grow up, even when he was 11. “The record is me reckoning with a lot of these things. It’s been cathartic, but it’s also been kind of nice to move on from it.” “I’m happy to be playing these songs and getting them out in the world,” he said. He’s been encouraged and humbled by the positive fan response to X Ambassadors, even after all these years. “We put this record out, and I’m really proud of it, and I’m happy with the work that I’ve done,” he said. “I feel like I spoke my truth on this record.”",

        "description": "Todd Stephenson has links with two of the three companies Seymour met.",
        "content": "Act MP Todd Stephenson has investments in three biotech or drug companies - and is Act leader David Seymour’s special Pharmac envoy; Seymour met Stephenson’s former employer in April, two months after the new MP got the Pharmac role; Seymour also met one of the companies in which Stephenson has investments - the new MP was not present for that meeting. Act leader and Associate Health Minister David Seymour has met representatives of three pharmaceutical companies since becoming responsible for drug-buying agency Pharmac - of which two are linked to the Act MP who serves as his special envoy for medicines. The Opposition is calling for Act MP Todd Stephenson to sell investments in three biotech and drug companies if he is to continue using his 17 years’ experience in the pharmaceutical industry to support Seymour with his Pharmac duties. But Seymour says Stephenson had no role in organising the meetings - although he attended two of them - and he has declared his investments publicly. Stephenson was called a “pharmaceutical industry plant” in Parliament last week by Labour’s deputy leader Carmel Sepuloni - an allegation that drew a sharp rebuke from Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters. Peters said Sepuloni was “defaming ... someone who’s got no chance to defend himself” with an allegation for which there was no evidence. The questions in Parliament followed the Herald revealing Stephenson’s investments in three biotech or drug firms and his close links to the pharmaceutical industry. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told media he dealt with Seymour as the Associate Minister responsible for Pharmac and not with Stephenson, and while not briefed on the former drug company executive’s investments, noted that they had been publicly declared. On Stephenson, he said: “He’s got a lot of expertise in the pharmaceutical world. He’s got a lot of expertise and contribution to make to Pharmac supporting David Seymour.” The Herald reviewed Seymour’s Beehive diaries since he was appointed to his ministerial roles in November and identified three meetings with pharmaceutical companies. Seymour today confirmed that Stephenson - his Parliamentary Private Secretary for Pharmac - attended the 30-minute meeting held with Stephenson’s former employer, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, at Parliament on April 10. Stephenson worked for Vertex Pharmaceuticals as its “international patient engagement director” immediately before being elected. The company is known for drugs that combat serious illness and particularly for its cystic fibrosis medication. Prior to working for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Stephenson spent a decade working for multinational pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson. Seymour also met Johnson & Johnson in which Stephenson has investments, according to the Register of Pecuniary Interests. Stephenson was not present for that meeting. Stephenson spent nine years, until 2022, working for The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. The third pharmaceutical company Seymour met was Merck, Sharp & Dohme, on February 27 at Parliament. While there is no direct connection to Stephenson, Merck is a member of industry body Medicines Australia, which he co-chaired for six years, and is known for collaborating with Australian multinational CSL Ltd, in which he has investments. The diaries for Seymour’s office note Stephenson’s presence at the Merck meeting but he is not referenced as being present for the Vertex meeting. Seymour’s office said “staff” who attend meetings are not always listed in the minister’s diary. Seymour has rejected criticism of Stephenson’s close links to the pharmaceutical industry, saying he brings valuable experience and skills. “If we start applying a standard where no-one can work in an area where they have expertise, Parliament would suffer as a result.” He said farmers brought expertise to agriculture policy as did teachers to education policy - “Todd shouldn’t be treated any differently”. Seymour said the meetings were organised by his office after requests from the companies and were important in helping him understand “the challenges we face in making sure Kiwis can access life-changing medicines”. “Todd is welcome to attend these meetings in his role as Parliamentary Private Secretary, although he did not attend all of them. He has disclosed all of his interests and since becoming a candidate has been open about his experience in patient advocacy.” Seymour said the Government supported the independence of Pharmac which meant the drug-buying agency did not discuss specific drugs with his office and he had no way of influencing its decision-making process. When approached, Seymour’s office said parliamentary private secretaries were not bound by the same rules as ministers and he had declared his interests as MPs were required to do so. It referred the Herald to the Cabinet Manual which described the PPS role as “building relationships with relevant communities, representing the minister at public events, delivering speeches on occasions when the minister is not available, and assisting with administrative matters”. “Todd is fully compliant with the Cabinet Manual and we are comfortable that there is no conflict of interest. If Todd was part of the executive he would review the situation and make appropriate arrangements.” The Herald has posed questions to Stephenson on the issue. His office said it was a matter for Seymour to handle as minister. His office did refer Sepuloni’s comments to Stephenson but no response has been forthcoming. Labour’s health spokeswoman Dr Ayesha Verrall said in her view Stephenson’s presence should be disclosed where he was at any meetings with companies with which he was associated. “It feels like a grey zone where a Member of Parliament has none of the requirements of the Cabinet Manual but can work so closely with a minister - on briefings from officials, key information on Pharmac, accessing key documents - and not have any process around conflicts of interest.” She said in her opinion Stephenson should attempt to manage any potential conflicts by selling his investments in biotech and pharmaceutical companies. “There is always the option for MPs to sell or divest themselves of their shares as ministers would be expected to.” David Fisher is based in Northland and has worked as a journalist for more than 30 years, winning multiple journalism awards including being twice named Reporter of the Year and being selected as one of a small number of Wolfson Press Fellows to Wolfson College, Cambridge.

Everton will demand around £80m for Branthwaite, while United value him closer to the £60m mark. Ratcliffe has completed a review of United's recent transfer activity since taking charge of football operations in January. The billionaire believes United have grossly overpaid on several occasions - and is determined not to fall into the same trap when it comes to Branthwaite. He knows cash-strapped Everton are desperate to raise funds this summer, and fears the Merseysiders will look to exploit United's wealth. But Ratcliffe is not prepared to pay over the odds, and will look elsewhere if no deal can be struck with Everton. United want to bring in a top class replacement for Raphael Varane, who left the club following last weekend's FA Cup final win over . While there are also doubts about the long-term futures of defenders Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof. Alternative targets include England and star Marc Guehi, Juventus defender Gleison Bremer and ace Levi Colwill. Branthwaite, who is under contract with Everton until 2027, was recently voted his club's Players' Player and Supporters' Young Player of the Season.",

        "description": "Foreign Minister didn't seek advice on impact of coal policy on global commitments.",
        "content": "Questions are being raised over whether the Government’s coal mining strategy breaches New Zealand’s international climate commitments. It has been revealed Foreign Minister Winston Peters did not ask for advice on how “cutting consenting red tape for coal mines” will impact our international standing or relationships. This is despite New Zealand being among the first nations to sign up to the Powering Past Coal Alliance - an agreement to transition from coal to clean energy. The deal was struck at the 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference - COP23 - and now consists of 60 governments. Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick is particularly concerned, saying that Peters should have at the very least looked at how such a decision would impact New Zealand’s relationships and reputation on the world stage. “The Government has continued a relentless assault on people and planet,” she said. Swarbrick fears this goes against the way New Zealand has positioned itself globally as a leader in the Pacific, where island nations are at considerable threat from climate hazards, such as sea level rise. Last month, Resource Minister Shane Jones announced the Government would remove controls introduced by Labour to end the consenting pathway for existing thermal coal mines from December 31, 2030. It’s part of a sweep of reforms included in a first Resource Management Act Amendment Bill, which was introduced to Parliament on Thursday. When asked in a parliamentary written question if he had requested advice on the impact of the policy on New Zealand’s international standing or relationships, Peters replied “no”. He said the Government remains committed to doubling New Zealand’s renewable energy production and therefore becoming a lower emissions economy. “New Zealand’s international standing with regards to addressing climate challenges will be shaped by delivering on the Government’s steadfast commitment to the Paris Agreement and other accords.” The Paris Agreement is an international treaty to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, adopted by 196 parties at COP21 in 2015. But Swarbrick said excavating and opening up more coal mines completely ignores the advice of the country’s independent expert Climate Change Commission, to transition away from coal as quickly as possible. The commission’s latest advice to keep New Zealand on track to reach its target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is out for consultation. It recommends a steady and sustained shift away from coal, diesel and fossil gas - to electricity and biomass energy. Swarbrick said this goes against the Government’s own coalition agreement to be driven by data and evidence. She claims the Government is intentionally not asking questions of its advisers, so there is no paper-trail. “As we can see here, particularly when it comes to decisions around climate change, they are simply not seeking that advice,” she said. “I guess you could say they aren’t taking the advice they haven’t got.” Jones has said consenting coal mines was necessary to ensure industrial processors will have access to domestic coal and not be forced to rely on imported coal to meet their needs. Earlier this month, power generator Genesis Energy revealed it expected to be buying coal again by the end of the year - for the first time since 2022 - to “keep the lights on” while it progresses its transition to renewable energy. Meanwhile, Climate Change Minister Simon Watts said he was confident that the Government’s proposed reforms will not affect its commitments to meet its climate change targets and support the transition to a low emissions future. In a statement, he said he has not sought additional advice from officials to date because he sits on the Ministerial Group for Resource Management Act Reform - and receives briefings. But Swarbrick said this confidence is not reflected in what she’s hearing from not only young people and mana whenua, but also business leaders in her electorate of Auckland Central. Swarbrick said that even includes those who elected the current regime. “They voted in the direction of this Government because they wanted them to act on cost-of-living,” she said. “They didn’t understand or they didn’t foresee how nasty and how cruel, how anti-evidence and anti-environment they could be.” Share this article",

        "content": "It’s hard to top many Aaron Judge performances, even if you’re Aaron Judge. This is a man who set a then-rookie record with 52 homers and later became the first American League player to ever swat 62. His highs have been higher than almost any player in MLB history. Nonetheless, right now might be his all-time best heater. After a start that saw him receive tons of backlash and boos from the New York Yankees faithful (not to mention some wild suggestions ), Judge has hit the stride that everyone expected him to hit. The captain is currently slashing .279/.410/.629 with a 189 wRC+ and a 3.3 fWAR. It’s a stark difference from how Judge looked to begin 2024. In 31 games through March and April, he slashed .207/.340/.414 with an OPS of 754. In 141 plate appearances, he registered six doubles and six home runs with 18 RBI’s, walking 23 times and striking out 38 times. But, boy, May has treated Judge well. Whether it was by simply finding his rhythm after an injury-slowed spring or by swinging a little more often , he’s been on fire. In 24 games and 104 PA, he had 12 doubles and 11 home runs. He has walked almost as many times (20) as he has driven in runs (21). Through the beginning of play on Sunday, he was slashing .390/.515/.974 with a 1.489 OPS. Although the full calendar month has been strong, his past three weeks have been an outright tour de force . But how does this run stack up to different hot streaks that we have seen from Judge across his excellent career? There are 12 different 20-game streaks from Judge where he produced an OPS over 1.500. Eight of those 12 streaks and three of the top five came in 2022. Narrowing it down to avoid overlap between different streaks by picking the best from each general stretch, there are three others outside of 2024 that are noteworthy. With a tip of the cap to Stathead , we’ll compare them all. The first of the elite heaters came in September of 2017, when the peak run from the 9th through the end of the regular season saw Judge finish with a 1.548 OPS in 88 PA. He had 5 doubles and 13 home runs with 27 RBI, also walking 22 times — the most of any these 20-game spans. On the strength of this incredible effort, Judge helped the Yankees nail down a Wild Card berth on the precipice of a memorable postseason, and just as he did in June 2017, he won both AL Rookie of the Month and Player of the Month honors. The 15-homer September resuscitated Judge’s season after an August slump and propelled him to Rookie of the Year honors. He also finished runner-up for AL MVP, but the less said about that subject , the better our collective blood pressure will be. It will likely not be a surprise to learn that the next two streaks were both from Judge’s MVP 2022. One went from July 16th to August 9th and the next from August 29th to September 21th. The first streak finished with a 1.580 OPS across 94 PA, and the opponents that the Yankees were playing in that span were impressive. The Bombers came up against teams like the Astros , Orioles , Mets , and Mariners . Three of those ballclubs made the playoffs and the O’s came up just short. So it wasn’t as if Judge was doing this against only easy opponents. The 2022 Yankees began to hit the skids in early August, and without Judge’s heroics — like his walk-off homer to break a scoreless tie against Kansas City — they might have fully wilted and lost their once-massive AL East lead. He was the reason they remained afloat. The second streak, which primarily featured September baseball, cracked the 1.600 OPS mark with 1.608. However, the opponents that the Yankees were playing certainly weren’t to the levels of the first 2022 streak. There were a couple teams within it like the Rays and Twins that are often in the playoffs, but there were a couple more easy series. The primary pressure on Judge at this point was again to push the slumping Yankees forward while also continuing his chase for Roger Maris. Why did opposing teams continue to pitch to Judge even though he was socking bombs left and right while the rest of the lineup slumbered more than Rip Van Winkle? We’ll never know, but we’ll always be thankful for the generosity. And finally, we reach the present day. Statistically, Judge’s run from May 4th through the beginning of play on May 26th is the best of the four. The OPS ranks as the highest at 1.634, which said out loud sounds more like an important year from high school history class than a real number. Furthermore, in 88 PA, he has 12 doubles (five more than the next highest), 11 home runs (tied for second), 21 RBI’s (the third-highest of the four) with 18 walks (third-highest), and—here’s the kicker—18 strikeouts, which is the lowest of the four streaks. The story of the 2024 season is still being written of course, but Judge faced the Mariners, Padres, Rays, Twins, and Astros among the batch of opponents. All are potential playoff teams — even the Astros aren’t sunk yet . So despite the ball not leaving the park the most out of any of these 20-game streaks in Judge’s career, he’s reaching second base by far the most and striking out the least. For many Yankees fans, that’s as important as anything when it comes to the power hitters in the heart of the lineup. He’s going yard and putting himself in position to get driven home by productive teammates like Alex Verdugo and Giancarlo Stanton. Hitting the ball hard has been the name of the game for Judge this time of year. Even if it’s not leaving the park every time, and it has resulted in the best stretch of the larger-than-life outfielder’s career. Judge’s resurgence has been a catalyst for the team’s recent run of success, and to see the Yankees captain back on track after an uncharacteristically slow start is huge for both team and fan morale.",

        "description": "Biologist warns of potential environmental impacts of this practice on local sensitive habitat",
        "content": "Tanja Hespe Kerr moved to Royston about 25 years ago. Over the years, she has observed from her front porch, which overlooks Comox Harbour, a trend she says has been worsening. “People drive down the beach, park wherever they want and set up their lawn chairs,” she said. “Sometimes they have fires going and some let their dogs run free. They can stay there for several hours.” “It has been getting worse, especially in the summertime, (and it seems like) the place is getting more popular.” Accessing the intertidal zone via the community’s boat launch on Marine Drive, steps from Royston Road, Hespe Kerr explained that vehicles typically enter the beach at low tide and leave when the tide rises. Though she mentioned that the majority of people are using the boat launch for its intended purpose, the Royston resident is concerned about those using it improperly. On more than one occasion, she observed up to six vehicles driving and parking all over the beach, littering the ground, and becoming mired in the mud as they tried to leave. “One time, a woman got... stuck so badly that the tide came in (and engulfed her car,)” said Hespe Kerr. “It was kind of laughable because her dog was swimming in circles around the vehicle while she was standing beside the car with her coffee cup trying to scoop water out of the inside of her vehicle.” Despite efforts from locals, law enforcement, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to prevent vehicle access to the beach, this illegal practice, in violation of the federal Fisheries Act, persists to this day. “Around five years ago, DFO put up a sign saying ‘Launch and retrieve ramp only. Do not park on the beach,’” said Hespe Kerr. “That sign was taken down in less than 10 days. As soon as it was put up, people were still driving on the beach.” At her wit’s end, the nature enthusiast and avid kayaker took to social media to share her discontent with the current situation. Shortly after, Area A Director Daniel Arbour commented on Hespe Kerr’s post. In a May 23 interview with the , Arbour shared that he would address this matter in an upcoming regional district meeting. “I think there’s a lot of value to (this boat launch), but I think that what was not anticipated is people using it to go for random drives around the beach,” said Arbour. “That is definitely not the kind of thing that we want to encourage.” “It’s also not in my intent (to close off the boat launch.) We want to make sure that people continue to have amenities but have respect for the marine environment.” The local politician also added that he is currently in discussions with regional district staff to find ways to prevent motorists from accessing Royston’s intertidal zone. “We’re going to start by laying out our options and strategies,” said Abour. “(We also want to) engage the community and see what’s (needed) to improve the management of that boat launch.” Although this practice seems to be localized to Royston, as Arbour noticed, registered biologist Dusty Silvester said the damage done by motor vehicles to this small area cannot be neglected. “(Any) additional impacts beyond the baseline are just going to push things a little bit further towards an unbalancing (of the ecosystem),” said Silvester. “If there’s an introduction of a deleterious substance by way of access to the intertidal zone, that’s gonna have an impact not only on that specific location where it occurred but on the broader landscape.” Any pollutant or contaminant, whether introduced willingly or accidentally – such as gasoline, motor oil, or invasive species –could cause harm to this ecosystem, which happens to be a sensitive habitat. “Royston, and other parts of the Comox harbour, are identified (as) red-listed communities which is a provincial regulatory item (which recognizes) that specific areas need to have special management practices put in place to protect (them) and (mitigate negative) impacts. “These sensitive ecosystems are (called) ‘sensitive’ because they’ve already been subject to the impact of human development and urbanization. Adding these extra impacts to a location (that was) somewhat stable, (might cause its loss.)” Potentially affecting everything from aquatic plants to mollusks, fish, birds, and mammals, the biologist highlighted that driving one’s vehicle in this sensitive habitat could have a ripple effect on the region’s broader food web. The impacts could be significant, including ground compaction that could asphyxiate shellfish, the crushing of crustaceans that are food for local birds, and the disruption of herring spawning grounds and smelt feeding areas, which support other aquatic species. Extending beyond the Comox Harbour, Silvester also expressed concerns about the effects of deleterious substances carried by south-flowing currents to the Baynes Sound, another highly ecologically and biologically sensitive area. “That area in particular is well known for being an intertidal agriculture area for the shellfish leases,” Silvester noted. “Would you wanna eat oysters that were exposed to motor oil or gas? Probably not. “I’m sure that (the shellfish industry) have practices in place to protect their harvest... but ultimately (I’m) sure they would want to keep these deleterious substances out of that area.” In a May 23 statement to the , DFO stated that they are taking proactive steps to address the current situation. “Fisheries and Oceans Canada is aware of the issue of off-road vehicle activity in several intertidal foreshores around the Comox Valley and of potential impacts to in-channel and riparian fish habitats associated with this activity,” reads the statement. Additionally, the governmental institution mentioned collaborating with the province to find a long-term solution for managing vehicle access and protecting fish habitats in the Comox Valley area. Under the federal , it is considered a violation to operate a motor vehicle on intertidal flats (section 34.4) and harmfully impact fish habitats (section 35). If the operator of a vehicle is found guilty of an offence under either of the two sections, they are liable for a fine ranging from $15,000 to $100,000. Members of the public are asked to report observations of illegal off-road activity to the DFO Observe Record Report line at DFO.ORR-ONS.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca or toll-free at 1-800-465-4336.",

        "description": "Our ‘Dot and Bubble’ review breaks down why Doctor Who Season 14 Episode 5 is yet another middling adventure for the Doctor and Ruby.",
        "content": "Doctor Who Episode 5 takes a page out of Black Mirror’s book for its tale of digitally-obsessed citizens under attack, but never truly succeeds at being mind-bending. After two episodes that allowed and to thrive on their own terms, the newest adventure of , ‘Dot and Bubble’, keeps the duo together as they attempt to help a spoiled young woman named Lindy navigate her way through a monster-laden city. From the offset, fans assumed from the title that ‘Dot and Bubble’ would be tech-focused, perhaps even Black Mirror-leaning. They weren’t wrong — everything from its fictional social platform to its pastel-hued cityscape just screams ‘Nosedive’. (Even the two protagonists in the respective shows are named Lindy and Lacie, though if we had to draw a line between all correlations, we’d be here all day.) Unfortunately, Dot and Bubble might have done better to stretch for more originality, as it’s not quite the effective statement on a digitally-dependent society it’s obviously striving to be. The Doctor and Ruby take a backseat For the most part, the Doctor and Ruby are absent in this episode, save for appearing on Lindy’s “dot and bubble” screen. In Lindy’s city, known as Finetime, rich young civilians communicate only via a social media platform that obscures their vision. With the system telling them where to step and what to do, there’s no need to ever remove it. However, this proves a problem when Lindy’s friends start going missing. Something is hunting down these unsuspecting airheads, and the Doctor and Ruby are forced to help Lindy via digital navigation. This means that Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson aren’t the heroes of this story as such. In fact, Lindy is doing most of the narrative work here, forever irritated by the Doctor and Ruby’s constant interruption of her day. Callie Cooke, who plays Lindy, is strong enough to lead this adventure, but it’s admittedly strange that Lindy is such an unlikable protagonist. She’s vapid and self-absorbed, but at least it’s somewhat fun to watch — the watery plot might have been duller if she’d been more amenable. Other episodes push ‘Dot and Bubble’ to the sidelines What ‘Dot and Bubble’ is most guilty of is being...well, a little boring. Finetime isn’t a particularly engaging world, emulating the atmosphere of a newbuild estate rather than a planet designed for the elite children of the wealthy. The monsters too, once revealed, aren’t hugely terrifying or unusual, meaning this doesn’t feel particularly urgent or threatening. Related: If anything, ‘Dot and Bubble’ is pretty ugly, both in aesthetic and in nature. And when it’s not being actively off-putting, it’s never really piquing interest. Following on from and — both clever and emotionally-gripping episodes, ‘Dot and Bubble’ doesn’t have much to offer, other than being a run-of-the-mill, semi-energetic installment. ‘Dot and Bubble’ isn’t about anything It’s hard to tell what ‘Dot and Bubble’ is really supposed to be about. Is it a commentary on fake reality and digital obsession? If so, where is the point it’s trying to make? Yes, those hooked on their dot and bubble system can’t even walk when it’s turned off, but one gimmick doesn’t make a moral. Perhaps it’s a message about false comforts and the vapidness of the rich offspring. But again, this isn’t hammered home in any particularly convincing way, since there’s no connective tissue to be found. The only “moral” of the story can be found in a very heavy-handed moment. (There’s no need to specify when it happens, because you’ll know when it does.) But unfortunately, this feels cheap and unearned, leaving a sour taste in the mouth after viewing and feels more out of pocket than revolutionary. It’s not hard for one to imagine a hundred different ways this particular point could have been handled far more effectively, and by someone who isn’t Russell T Davies. ‘Dot and Bubble’ verdict: 2/5 Put simply, ‘Dot and Bubble’ is one of the more forgettable Doctor Who episodes of Season 14 so far. It’s not wild enough to be memorable as a concept, and it lacks everything it’s trying to give. But it’s not the worst either, with enough sense and purpose to propel its own runtime. Audience reaction to the final act will prove whether this will stand as a notable, perhaps polarizing addition to the canon, or whether it’ll become lost in the show’s history. For more, find out .

        "description": "Man United have identified four players who are not for sale any under any circumstances this summer - but their list should be longer.",
        "content": "Manchester United's players had not even made their way out onto the sun-soaked Wembley pitch and Lisandro Martinez was already making his presence felt. As Erik ten Hag and Pep Guardiola got the nod to lead out their teams behind the match officials, Martinez screamed at the top of his voice in an attempt to rally his teammates. His scream was loud enough to force the young mascot next to him to cover his left ear. Martinez was making just his second start since overcoming a muscle injury and United's supporters were hopeful his last dance with Raphael Varane at centre-back would boost their chances of an unlikely FA Cup triumph. It was the first time they had started alongside each other since February 1. READ MORE: United considering keeping Erik ten Hag as manager READ MORE: INEOS respond to fears United could be banned from Europa League next season While United's 13th FA Cup crown will always be remembered for the goals from academy graduates Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo , Martinez's role in contributing to such an impressive triumph should not be dismissed. He played a starring role at the back, managing 73 minutes on what was just his fifth start this calendar year. The Argentine was restricted to just 14 appearances in all competitions this season because of injury issues, robbing United and Ten Hag of one of the most important figures in the squad. He was immense in his first season at Old Trafford, silencing critics in the process, and United missed him far too often this term. Providing an unrivalled level of passion for the game, Martinez wears his heart on his sleeve, producing the commitment and desire United fans expect as a bare minimum. As he said in a post-match interview with MUTV, United's players \"need to die for this badge\". Martinez's mentality ranks as one of the very best in the squad. Few can admit they are as passionate and motivated as he is when they cross the white line. While there is no doubting the importance of having the right mentality, Martinez is also fortunate enough to be an excellent player at the same time. His presence in the heart of United's back four at Wembley gave Ten Hag's side a completely different dimension, with the Argentine capable of stepping up with the ball, playing aggressive, forward-thinking passes and giving United an improved level of control. \"Lisandro Martinez is [one of the] top five centre-backs in the world,\" City boss Guardiola said in a post-match interview . \"He made the difference on this game by playing passes through our defence.\" Lisandro Martinez is a vitally important figure for Manchester United. (Image: Justin Setterfield - The FA/The FA via Getty Images.) Compliments do not come much bigger. Martinez's passing ability was a trait United missed far too often this season. Last term, he regularly linked up with Luke Shaw on the left side of the defence and they progressed the ball with purpose in the first phase of the build-up play. What's more, United's defensive record has been poor this season without Martinez being an almost ever-present figure. He played a key role in helping the club record 28 clean sheets in all competitions last season, whereas this term they kept just 13. United are planning to make big changes to the landscape of their centre-back department this summer and have already made the decision to let Varane go. Jonny Evans is out of contract, meaning he could follow suit, while one of Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof is expected to be sold. United need to recruit a new first-choice partner for Martinez for him to bond with and form the bedrock of the team. Yet the club, surprisingly, has not included the Argentine on its list of players who have been deemed untouchable ahead of this summer's transfer window. As reported by the Manchester Evening News last month, it is understood the club will entertain offers for everyone but Andre Onana, Rasmus Hojlund , Mainoo and Garnacho. Martinez should be added to that list, as should captain Bruno Fernandes, who also played a starring role at Wembley. Martinez, who faced a barrage of questions about his height when he arrived in England almost two years ago, has been one of United's biggest success stories in the transfer market in the last few years. His injury record this season, of course, has put the brakes on his progress, but his importance to this team is unquestionable. Next season, United will be praying he does not encounter the same level of bad luck he has experienced this term. First, though, they need to add him to their list of untouchables.",

        "description": "Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has been in need of a win after the embarrassing collapse of her controversial Reading Cinema deal, and it seems she may have found one with a new high-flying advisory group. The mayor’s new team of leaders from the retail, hospitality, tech, property development and creative sectors will advise her directly as the capital undergoes major redevelopment — while reeling from public sector cuts and the rising cost of living. It’s a group that includes proven experience from the likes of Willis Bond’s Mark McGuinness and Primeproperty’s Eyal Aharoni, alongside fresher faces like Yu Mei handbag designer Jessie Wong and Brooke Roberts from online investment platform Sharesies. Whanau has said it’s important to her “that our local businesses have an active role in shaping and delivering the transformation of our city”. For a hand-picked team of business advisers, the mayor has done well. But even more important than her selection is the fact she’s realised she needs to be working closer with those on the frontline. Those who have chosen and still choose Wellington to make a living. Those who call the capital home. Last month Whanau suffered an embarrassing blow when Wellington City Council officials decided to finally end negotiations with Reading International over a controversial deal to reopen the closed cinema complex on Courtenay Place. The council had planned to buy the land under the cinema for $32 million, money which the cinema would use to redevelop the building. It was a deal blasted by some as nothing more than corporate welfare and raised questions about how much the global company really cared about Wellington if it wouldn’t carry out the necessary strengthening work itself. But even in the face of its toughest critics, Whanau championed the deal as a game-changer for the central city. For a mayor under fire for failing to read the room when it comes to dishing out ratepayer money to help one international company, her new move shows she’s ready to listen and learn. The mayor has signalled an announcement will be coming soon in relation to the plan to remove cars from the Golden Mile. This has already seen Cranfields, a business that has operated in Wellington for 33 years, decide to shut up shop. Whanau has said the project is transformational change. “It will create a beautiful, pedestrian-friendly CBD that will attract people, workers and shoppers. It will make our buses more reliable. It is estimated to deliver hundreds of millions of dollars to benefit our city.” How the mayor navigates such a thorny endeavour, and what role her new advisory group plays in bringing businesses on board, remains to be seen. But if the collaboration prevents another Reading saga, it’ll be a win for ratepayers.",

        "description": "OPINION: It's a win the mayor needed after the controversial cinema deal collapsed.",
        "content": "OPINION Wellington Mayor Tory Whanau has been in need of a win after the embarrassing collapse of her controversial Reading Cinema deal, and it seems she may have found one with a new high-flying advisory group. The mayor’s new team of leaders from the retail, hospitality, tech, property development and creative sectors will advise her directly as the capital undergoes major redevelopment - and reels from public sector cuts and the rising cost of living. It’s a group that includes proven experience from the likes of Willis Bond’s Mark McGuinness and Primeproperty’s Eyal Aharoni, alongside fresher faces like Yu Mei handbag designer Jessie Wong and Brooke Roberts from online investment platform Sharesies. Whanau has said it’s important to her “that our local businesses have an active role in shaping and delivering the transformation of our city”. For a hand-picked team of business advisers, the mayor’s done well. But even more important than her selection choices is the fact she’s realised she needs to be working closer with those on the frontline. Those who have chosen and still choose Wellington to make a living. Those who call the capital home. Last month Whanau suffered an embarrassing blow when Wellington City Council officials decided to finally end negotiations with Reading International over a controversial deal to reopen the closed cinema complex on Courtenay Place. The council had planned to buy the land underneath the cinema for $32 million, money which the cinema would use to redevelop the building. It was a deal blasted by some as nothing more than corporate welfare and raised questions about how much the global company really cared about Wellington if it wouldn’t carry out the necessary strengthening work itself. But even in the face of its toughest critics, Whanau championed the deal as a game changer for the central city. A tough thing to come back from, which makes this new business advisory group a very smart move. For a mayor already under fire for failing to read the room when it comes to dishing out ratepayer money to help one international company, this shows she’s ready to listen and learn. It also comes on the cusp of a very disruptive period for Wellington’s economic heart. The mayor’s signalled an announcement will be coming soon in relation to the plan to remove cars from the Golden Mile. It’s a project that’s already seen Cranfields, a business that’s operated in Wellington for 33 years, decide to shut up shop . Whanau has said the project to revitalise the Golden Mile is what transformational change looks like. “It will create a beautiful and pedestrian-friendly CBD that will attract people, workers and shoppers. It will make our buses more reliable. It is estimated to deliver hundreds of millions of dollars to benefit our city.” How the mayor navigates such a thorny endeavour, and what role her new advisory group plays in bringing businesses on board remains to be seen. But if the collaboration prevents another Reading saga it’ll be a win for ratepayers. Share this article Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.",

        "description": "Biologist warns of potential environmental impacts of this practice on local sensitive habitat",
        "content": "Tanja Hespe Kerr moved to Royston about 25 years ago. Over the years, she has observed from her front porch, which overlooks Comox Harbour, a trend she says has been worsening. “People drive down the beach, park wherever they want and set up their lawn chairs,” she said. “Sometimes they have fires going and some let their dogs run free. They can stay there for several hours.” “It has been getting worse, especially in the summertime, (and it seems like) the place is getting more popular.” Accessing the intertidal zone via the community’s boat launch on Marine Drive, steps from Royston Road, Hespe Kerr explained that vehicles typically enter the beach at low tide and leave when the tide rises. Though she mentioned that the majority of people are using the boat launch for its intended purpose, the Royston resident is concerned about those using it improperly. On more than one occasion, she observed up to six vehicles driving and parking all over the beach, littering the ground, and becoming mired in the mud as they tried to leave. “One time, a woman got... stuck so badly that the tide came in (and engulfed her car,)” said Hespe Kerr. “It was kind of laughable because her dog was swimming in circles around the vehicle while she was standing beside the car with her coffee cup trying to scoop water out of the inside of her vehicle.” Despite efforts from locals, law enforcement, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) to prevent vehicle access to the beach, this illegal practice, in violation of the federal Fisheries Act, persists to this day. “Around five years ago, DFO put up a sign saying ‘Launch and retrieve ramp only. Do not park on the beach,’” said Hespe Kerr. “That sign was taken down in less than 10 days. As soon as it was put up, people were still driving on the beach.” At her wit’s end, the nature enthusiast and avid kayaker took to social media to share her discontent with the current situation. Shortly after, Area A Director Daniel Arbour commented on Hespe Kerr’s post. In a May 23 interview with the Record , Arbour shared that he would address this matter in an upcoming regional district meeting. “I think there’s a lot of value to (this boat launch), but I think that what was not anticipated is people using it to go for random drives around the beach,” said Arbour. “That is definitely not the kind of thing that we want to encourage.” “It’s also not in my intent (to close off the boat launch.) We want to make sure that people continue to have amenities but have respect for the marine environment.” The local politician also added that he is currently in discussions with regional district staff to find ways to prevent motorists from accessing Royston’s intertidal zone. “We’re going to start by laying out our options and strategies,” said Abour. “(We also want to) engage the community and see what’s (needed) to improve the management of that boat launch.” The environmental impacts Although this practice seems to be localized to Royston, as Arbour noticed, registered biologist Dusty Silvester said the damage done by motor vehicles to this small area cannot be neglected. “(Any) additional impacts beyond the baseline are just going to push things a little bit further towards an unbalancing (of the ecosystem),” said Silvester. “If there’s an introduction of a deleterious substance by way of access to the intertidal zone, that’s gonna have an impact not only on that specific location where it occurred but on the broader landscape.” Any pollutant or contaminant, whether introduced willingly or accidentally – such as gasoline, motor oil, or invasive species –could cause harm to this ecosystem, which happens to be a sensitive habitat. “Royston, and other parts of the Comox harbour, are identified (as) red-listed communities which is a provincial regulatory item (which recognizes) that specific areas need to have special management practices put in place to protect (them) and (mitigate negative) impacts. “These sensitive ecosystems are (called) ‘sensitive’ because they’ve already been subject to the impact of human development and urbanization. Adding these extra impacts to a location (that was) somewhat stable, (might cause its loss.)” Potentially affecting everything from aquatic plants to mollusks, fish, birds, and mammals, the biologist highlighted that driving one’s vehicle in this sensitive habitat could have a ripple effect on the region’s broader food web. The impacts could be significant, including ground compaction that could asphyxiate shellfish, the crushing of crustaceans that are food for local birds, and the disruption of herring spawning grounds and smelt feeding areas, which support other aquatic species. Extending beyond the Comox Harbour, Silvester also expressed concerns about the effects of deleterious substances carried by south-flowing currents to the Baynes Sound, another highly ecologically and biologically sensitive area. “That area in particular is well known for being an intertidal agriculture area for the shellfish leases,” Silvester noted. “Would you wanna eat oysters that were exposed to motor oil or gas? Probably not. “I’m sure that (the shellfish industry) have practices in place to protect their harvest... but ultimately (I’m) sure they would want to keep these deleterious substances out of that area.” DFO’s stance In a May 23 statement to the Record , DFO stated that they are taking proactive steps to address the current situation. “Fisheries and Oceans Canada is aware of the issue of off-road vehicle activity in several intertidal foreshores around the Comox Valley and of potential impacts to in-channel and riparian fish habitats associated with this activity,” reads the statement. Additionally, the governmental institution mentioned collaborating with the province to find a long-term solution for managing vehicle access and protecting fish habitats in the Comox Valley area. Under the federal Fisheries Act , it is considered a violation to operate a motor vehicle on intertidal flats (section 34.4) and harmfully impact fish habitats (section 35). If the operator of a vehicle is found guilty of an offence under either of the two sections, they are liable for a fine ranging from $15,000 to $100,000. Members of the public are asked to report observations of illegal off-road activity to the DFO Observe Record Report line at DFO.ORR-ONS.MPO@dfo-mpo.gc.ca or toll-free at 1-800-465-4336.

        "description": "UC Davis Health researchers uncover substantial treatment disparities and inequal access to autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation therapy among multiple myeloma patients.",
        "content": "A new study published in reveals racial and social disparities that prevent patients with multiple myeloma (MM) from receiving autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT), a type of stem cell therapy. UC Davis Health researchers discovered that individuals from minority communities or those covered by public health insurance (such as Medicare or Medicaid) were less likely to undergo autoHCT treatment. Image Credits: © Catalin - stock.adobe.com AutoHCT is a commonly used procedure that uses a patient’s existing stem cells to target cancerous cells in the body. Stem cells are harvested from the blood or bone marrow and frozen to remove contaminants before being reintroduced to the body. After treatment with high dose chemotherapy or radiation, the stem cells replenish the body’s blood and immune cell populations, allowing for bone marrow recovery and immune system restoration. The researchers analyzed data collected from the California Cancer Registry (CCR), the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), and the California Patient Discharge Database. The CCR provided researchers with demographic information including race, ethnicity, insurance status, education, employment status, and other measurements, which were compared against rates of autoHCT treatment in individuals diagnosed with MM between 1991 and 2016. Study authors used novel data linkage between the CCR, CIBMT, California’s patient discharge database, and hospitalization records to identify autoHCT treatment in a population-based MM cohort. Hazard ratio and confidence intervals were used to evaluate the association between demographic data and the likelihood of receiving autoHCT therapy. To account for interactions between different treatment stages, study authors used stratified multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. Of the 29,109 patients included in the study, 18.9% received autoHCT treatment. Although findings showed an increase of patients with MM who received treatment from 5.7% (1991 to 1995) to 27.4% (2011 to 2016), minority and uninsured populations received significantly less access to treatment. Black patients received a lower proportion of therapy at 15.8% (2011-2016 HR 0.83, CI: 0.72-0.95). Hispanic patients were less likely to undergo autoHCT, particularly in the earliest treatment era (1991-1995 HR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.37-0.90; 2011-2016 HR 1.07, CI: 0.96-1.19). Patients with public insurance or who were uninsured were less likely to receive treatment [2011-2016 Medicare hazard ratio (HR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.78; Medicaid HR 0.81, CI: 0.72-0.91; no insurance HR 0.56, CI: 0.32-0.99).1Alternatively, individuals with private or military health insurance had a higher likelihood of receiving autoHCT therapy, at a rate of 28.4%. This data prompts further investigations into how public health insurance affects patient evaluation for treatment eligibility, referrals to transplant centers, and other potential impacts. Researchers also measured neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), which accounts for education, employment, poverty, etc., and found this also played a role in a patients’ likelihood of receiving treatment. Patients living in neighborhoods with higher nSES scores showed increased rates of autoHCT usage, while those in lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods were less likely to undergo therapy. However, study authors note these differences decreased over time. Identifying the social and economic barriers that prevent patients with MM from receiving autoHCT therapy is crucial to ensuring equitable access to care for all patient populations. Further research into understanding these treatment obstacles enables health care providers and policymakers to develop interventions and systems that ensure access to care and improved patient outcomes.",

        "description": "OPINION: Political conflicts of interest are dragging the Government down. Does it care?",
        "content": "Simon Wilson is an award-winning senior writer covering politics, the climate crisis, transport, housing, urban design and social issues. He joined the Herald in 2018. OPINION You couldn’t make it up. The Government has a bill that undermines democratic processes. The MP in charge of hearings on the bill received far more donations for his election campaign than any other candidate, and failed to declare 85 per cent of them. Some of the undeclared money came from interests who will probably benefit if the bill becomes law. The MP is National’s David MacLeod, from New Plymouth, and he has now been stood down . But what was he even doing in the job in the first place? Isn’t his conflict of interest obvious? MacLeod is new to Parliament but was put straight into the chair of the Environment Select Committee, which is considering the Fast-track Approvals Bill. The bill will allow the ministers of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development to approve projects, even if they have been ruled out by the courts and experts have advised against them. MacLeod won the New Plymouth candidacy on October 31, 2022. Over the two months that followed, he received 18 donations worth $168,335, all of which he failed to declare. In his 2023 declaration he also failed to include another $10,000 donation. All up, MacLeod received $207,662 for his campaign, including seven big donations from Aucklanders. The recipient of the next-highest amount was National’s unsuccessful Manurewa candidate, Siva Kilari, who raised $110,483. Even NZ First’s Shane Jones, who sometimes seems like a magnet for political donations, pulled in “only” $98,549. MacLeod says it was an honest mistake: he thought his party had declared the money on his behalf. I believe him. It’s not credible, to my mind, that he would have deliberately tried to hide those donations. But that hardly lets him off the hook, because he should have known better. What remains is a sense that he didn’t think it was important to know the rules. But there are other questions. How was he able to raise so much money? What did he do with it? MacLeod’s declared election spend was only $22,826. The discrepancy exists because, while candidates are allowed to spend no more than $30,600, that doesn’t apply until three months before election day. Parties and candidates are free to spend what they like before that. It’s an absurd rule, and those who can take full advantage. As well as the money donated to MacLeod and other individual candidates, National received a record $10.4 million in campaign donations last year. That followed the $5m it raised in 2022: also a record, for a non-election year. The result was plain to see: there was a blitz of billboards up and down state highways and throughout many electorates, and the spend carried over to social media, print ads and a torrent of radio advertising. (Among the other parties, Labour raised $4.8m in 2023, Act $4.3m, the Greens $3.3m and NZ First $1.8m.) There are many problems with the Fast-track Approvals Bill, not least that it will enable bad decision-making and lead to environmental harm. Its purpose, we’re told, is to free big infrastructure development from bureaucratic traps that delay progress. But if the Government thinks planning rules are too restrictive - too weighted to environmental concerns - the proper democratic response is for it to change the law. Instead, it’s adopted an approach that means, at least for its own decisions, that environmental law won’t matter. In my opinion, the worst thing about this is that the unchecked power the bill gives to three ministers will open the door to corruption . You might think the Government would be going out of its way to avoid that charge. In one sense, it has done that with MacLeod. He was dobbed in by his own party, when it discovered the mistake. Prime Minister Christopher Luxon then moved swiftly to demote him. But MacLeod has been the recipient of considerable largesse from members of the mining, property and investment worlds, all of which stand to benefit when the Fast-track Approvals Bill becomes law. It’s not credible that senior members of the Government were unaware of either the scale or the source of his financial backing - right from the get-go. Again, why was he allowed to chair that committee? MacLeod’s sin, once revealed, was that he’d breached the disclosure rules. It wasn’t that he had an obvious conflict of interest. Why didn’t that matter? Is it because too many politicians think that conflict of interest actually doesn’t matter? When Auckland Council considered whether to sell its remaining shares on Auckland International Airport this month, three councillors declared that they or their spouses held shares in the airport company. They also told the council they had taken legal advice, which assured them they did not have a conflict of interest and they would be free to vote. So they did. I’m not contesting the advice, which I assume reflects the law. But if holding shares in a company you’re going to vote on is not a breach of the rules, then the rules should be changed. When the Government announced it would repeal Labour’s smoke-free law changes, many questions were asked about links between the tobacco industry and Government ministers. As for Shane Jones, he’s the minister for regional development, fishing and resources (aka mining), despite his party receiving financial support from individuals and/or corporate interests in all three sectors. It looks to me like he could be up to his neck in conflicts of interest, but the rules say he’s not. I Am Hope, the Gumboot Fridays charity, has just received a $24m contract for health services, although there’s little independent analysis the charity does a good job. Its chair donated $27,000 to the National Party over two elections. Act MP Todd Stephenson has a “special responsibility” for advising Pharmac’s minister, Act leader David Seymour, on Pharmac and the funding of medicines. As my colleague David Fisher reported last week , Stephenson has spent 17 years in the pharmaceutical industry, has investments in three drug companies and retains close links to the sector. It looks for all the world like he’s their guy on the inside. That may or may not be true, but for the democratic process to function properly, what it looks like matters. Seymour says Stephenson “is fully compliant with the Cabinet Manual and we are comfortable that there is no conflict of interest”. But if this isn’t a breach of the Cabinet Manual, it should be. Or is it just that politicians will always have expertise in one field or another, so inevitably they will have links to some of the people they get to make decisions about? That really doesn’t fly. For starters, I believe, there’s a difference between having a background in an industry or sector group, and being compromised by receiving funding from it. On top of that, where the appearance of partisanship exists, it’s vital to have transparent and credible processes. Every decent Minister for the Arts, for example, is a proud advocate for the sector. But nobody thinks the decisions about which performers, writers, movies and arts groups get funded should be made by the minister. And what about the biggest conflict of all? Successive parliaments have consistently voted for a tax system that favours property investment. This makes it ridiculously hard for people to buy their first home and provides tax-free rewards for people who are already well-off. It’s also financially incompetent. The New Zealand economy is distorted so badly, 91 per cent of our national assets are tied up in housing. That’s a direct cause of our having one of the lowest levels of productivity in the Western World. But MPs keep voting for this. And according to the Register of Pecuniary Interests released last week, about half of them own investment properties. Quite a few have several. The Prime Minister has two “residential properties” in Auckland and another one in Wellington, as well as four rental properties. Act MP Simon Court has what he calls four “family homes”, in Auckland, Wellington and Rotorua. National’s Carlos Cheung owns five rentals and two property management businesses. Todd Stephenson has an interest in six rental properties. And on it goes. Why don’t investment property owners recuse themselves on all votes to do with tax? How is it not a conflict of interest when every vote related to tax is, in effect, a decision not to introduce a capital gains tax? In politics, a conflict of interest is where you’re in a position to decide something for the greater good, but your personal interests get in the way, or could be seen to get in the way. Appearances matter. It should not be hard for politicians to understand this. Share this article Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.",

To ensure food security for the nation's growing population, it's essential to effectively manage damage and infections through Primary Plant Protection (PPP) measures. Crop protection chemicals, including insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides, are pivotal in preventing crop contamination, which not only reduces grain yield but also degrades quality. The agricultural technology landscape is advancing swiftly, with innovations such as telematics, autonomous vehicles, and crop protection making notable strides. Restraints: Rising environmental concerns related to petrol-oil based adjuvants Concerns are mounting regarding the impact of herbicides and their accompanying adjuvants on non-target species due to their excessive usage. These adjuvants are not only dispersed on the intended target plants but also spread across the entire agricultural field. Consequently, the environmental repercussions stemming from the combined application of adjuvants with fungicides, insecticides, and herbicides have led to regulatory restrictions. Moreover, as spray adjuvants drift into neighboring areas due to wind dispersal, each application contributes to air pollution. The overuse of pesticides poses a significant environmental threat, which acts as a barrier to market growth. Opportunities: Rapidly growing demand for green adjuvants Environmental impact assessments indicate that green adjuvants, when utilized alongside crop protection chemicals, have minimal negative impacts on both humans and the environment. These adjuvants not only enhance the effectiveness of active ingredients in crop protection chemicals but also prioritize human safety. The growing emphasis on the nutritional value of products among urban residents, driven by increased personal incomes and affordability, has sparked a surge in demand for organic food items.

        "description": "An economic impact assessment report on the proposed federal emissions cap framework.",
        "content": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An economic impact assessment report completed by S&P Global Commodity Insights for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producer (CAPP) shows that a scenario where a stringent 40% emissions cap is applied from 2030 could lead to significant cuts in domestic conventional oil and natural gas production, reaching a one million barrel of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) reduction by 2030 relative to the reference case. A mandated stringent 55% emission cap by 2035 would result in a reduction of two million boe/d in 2035 compared to the reference case. Conversely, the assessment shows that the conventional industry could deliver $1.3 trillion in GDP contributions and support 383,000 Canadian jobs annually by 2035 with just an 8 percent increase in production if it were permitted to add drilling and export infrastructure under current policy frameworks. CAPP commissioned the assessment to better understand the potential economic implications of different production scenarios, including one where a fixed emissions cap is imposed upon the sector. The report only focused on the impact on conventional production and did not include oil sands production. The S&P Global Commodity Insights analysis explored three alternative production scenarios under parameters requested by CAPP for the conventional oil and natural gas sector to 2035. The Reference Case forecasts conventional oil and natural gas production under current policy conditions. The Stress Case forecasts production under a stringent 40% emissions cap mandated for 2030. The High Case forecasts production with the assumption of additional investment into export and production infrastructure. The Reference Case forecasts that under current policy conditions conventional oil and natural gas production could reach six million boe/d by 2030 and remain near that level to 2035. In comparison, the Stress Case shows that a mandated 40% emission reduction by 2030, relative to 2021, could lead to one million boe/d lower production in 2030 and a two million boe/d reduction by with a mandated 55% reduction by 2035. According to the economic assessment: The Stress Case results in total $75 billion lower upstream investment spend across the 2024 to 2035 period compared to the Reference Case. This would result in $247 billion lower GDP contribution between 2024 and 2035 compared to the Reference Case. The Conventional oil and natural gas sector could support an average of 347,000 jobs annually under the Reference Case. The Stress Case has 51,000 fewer jobs supported annually across Canada. The report also explored scenarios with higher economic benefit to Canada. Both the Reference and High Case scenarios show production can grow while the investments in decarbonization leads to lowering emission intensity. The High Case shows that 8% growth in conventional oil and natural gas production, compared to the Reference Case out to 2035, would support an additional 36,000 jobs annually across Canada and over $100 billion in additional GDP contributions to 2035 with debottlenecking of existing pipeline and LNG export capacity. Compared to the Stress Case, the High Case scenario shows an additional $125 billion in investment from the conventional sector, $351 billion in cumulative GDP contributions, and 87,000 more jobs supported annually out to 2035. The report can be found on CAPP’s website. Quotes from CAPP President & CEO Lisa Baiton “The proposed emission cap framework for the oil and natural gas sector is unnecessary and should not proceed. Under existing proven policy measures the conventional oil and natural gas sector is growing production while lowering emissions. Instead, Canada should give the policies in place time to work while collaborating with industry and provinces on pragmatic solutions to deliver emissions reductions in the short term while positioning Canada and our energy industry for long-term success.” “The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is forecasting Canada’s per capita GDP will perform the worst out of all its 38 member nations for the next 40 years. To change the direction of our economy we need to support growth in our largest job creators. The S&P Global Commodity Insights report shows the conventional oil and natural gas sector holds significant potential for even greater contributions to the Canadian economy through thousands of new jobs, billions in revenues to governments and over a trillion dollars in GDP over the next 12 years.” “Declines in production forced on the industry by a stringent emissions cap will result in significant job losses for Canadians, severe impacts on the economy and our GDP, and have the potential to compromise Canada’s energy security and prosperity. Canada has a choice. We can discourage growth in one of the country’s largest industries and pursue aggressive climate policy at the highest cost to Canadians, or we can encourage growth and prosperity while still delivering emissions intensities reductions.” “Instead of supporting emissions reduction in upstream operations, a new cap and trade system adds costs and uncertainty, which stifles investment and will force producers to curtail production to reach compliance. Lower Canadian oil and natural gas production does nothing to curb global demand growth and will have no impact on global emissions. The loss of Canadian oil and natural gas exports will be made up by other nations, who may not share Canada’s high environmental and emissions standards.” “Both the Reference and High Case conventional oil and gas production forecasts would contribute to over $1 trillion in cumulative GDP and support up to 383,000 jobs annually out to 2035. CAPP believes this is a conservative estimate of Canada’s growth potential given the country has one of the largest undeveloped resource bases in the world.” About CAPP The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) is a non-partisan, research-based industry association that advocates on behalf of our member companies, large and small, that explore for, develop, and produce oil and natural gas throughout Canada. Our associate members provide a wide range of services that support the upstream industry. CAPP’s members produce nearly three quarters of Canada’s annual oil and natural gas production and provide approximately 450,000 direct and indirect jobs in nearly all regions of Canada. According to the most recently published data, the industry contributes over $70 billion to Canada’s GDP, as well as $45 billion in taxes and royalties to governments across the country. CAPP is a solution-oriented partner and works with all levels of government to ensure a thriving Canadian oil and natural gas industry. We strive to meet the need for safe, reliable, affordable, and responsibly produced energy, for Canada and the world. We are proud to amplify industry efforts to reduce GHG emissions from oil and gas production and support Indigenous participation and prosperity.",

        "content": "Even when you get a on something at a dealer, they’ll still find a way to try and get some more money out of you to make up for the fact that you got said deal. Take how Hyundai covered for my car, but the dealer still said I needed to part with $800 for new hoses and belts. The main place things like this happen at dealerships is in the finance managers office. Going over those final contracts dealers will often try and sneak things in like extended warranty plans and gap insurance. Take a dealer that tried to sneak in $20,000 worth of extras on a customer. This latest dealer grift comes to us by way of a on X via friend of the site Zach Shefska of and on YouTube. In the tweet, Zach says that they recently helped a customer with a Lexus deal at , New Jersey. Except when they got to the finance manager’s officer, they tried to throw on thousands of dollars in extras. Wanting a bit more info, I reached out to Zach for some more details. He informed me that they helped the customer get their Lexus and negotiated $7,000 off sticker for the vehicle. Apparently, the dealer finance manager may not have liked that the customer got $7,000 off. Zach says they were informed of what the manager was trying to pull through a message from one of the guys working on the deal. “You gotta be kidding me,” read the message. Not long after the customer sent them over the vehicle contract. As you can see, the total vehicle price is just over $90,000. Yet the manager tried adding on nearly $21,000 in bullshit extras. A near $9,000 extended warranty on top of a $5,000 maintenance contract, another $5,000 for “tire wheel and product,” more insurance from Toyota for $1,200 and most egregious of all, $1,240 for an “optional sales commission.” Surprisingly, Zach says they were able to get all the extra crap removed and the deal moved forward. Personally, seeing that would have been a deal breaker for me and I would have torn up the contract and walked. I’m sure though whoever’s buying that Lexus is a better person than I am. And what of the sales manager that tried to pull a fast one? I asked Zach does he know what happened to them, he said he’s not sure. I’d bet money though that nothing happened and that the person is still sitting pretty in their office. This is all just another example of why it’s important for every single line of a car sales contract to be read. Dealers will hate you for it, and they’ll try to explain it away as “Mumbo jumbo. Just sign on the dotted line.” Yet things like these sorts of extras often get snuck in because people fully review the contact. Oh, if only the government had they could enact that would stop this sort of thing.",

        "content": "ROCHESTER — Due to a coaching change at Winthrop University, Joe Sperry has had a change of heart. Sperry, a 2022 Lourdes grad, has spent the last two seasons as a standout for the University of South Carolina Lancaster junior college baseball team. He had planned to play at Division I Winthrop starting this fall, but decided to decommit when the head coach was fired following the 2024 season. “I don’t know who the (new) coach is going to be,” Sperry said. “The staff that recruited me to go there, or at least the coach, isn’t there anymore. So I think I should just find a new relationship with a coach at a different school. I had the option to do that so I chose to do that.” Sperry had to get a release from Winthrop after signing a letter of intent before he could begin the recruitment process again. “They gave me an opportunity to be successful, and I’m grateful for that,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT The right-handed hitting and throwing Sperry was a two-way player at Lancaster. He had a monster hitting season this year as a sophomore. He batted .398 with a lofty 1.264 OPS. He smashed 20 home runs, had 16 doubles, scored 56 runs and had a whopping 84 RBIs in just 54 games. On the mound, the 6-foot-2, 210-pounder went 3-4 with a 6.67 ERA with 56 strikeouts in 54 innings. His fastball topped out at 93 miles per hour and was regularly in the 88-92 range. He has already had some preliminary talks with coaches at other Division I schools, but is still early in the process. He would like to make his decision as soon as possible, but doesn’t want to rush it. “There could be a lot coming up here soon,” he said. “When you reopen your recruitment, it’s just crazy for the first couple of days. You don’t know who’s going to be talking to you or who’s interested.” Sperry is done with the school year and has returned home. He is training at The Yard Sports Training facility in Rochester. He is taking a little break from baseball but will play with the Rochester Honkers of the Northwoods League beginning July 3. “That’s still the same plan for the summer,” he said. “But who knows, I might have to take some time off with the Honkers in order to visit a school or something. But I’m sure they’ll understand that. But hopefully, I’ll find a new home by then.” — — Four area seniors have been selected to play in the Minnesota High School All-Star Baseball Series. The event will be held June 20-22 at Chaska Athletic Park. ADVERTISEMENT The event will feature six teams and each team will play a pair of games. Local seniors who will participate for the South squad include Isaiah Brennan of Byron, Preston Ohm of Zumbrota-Mazeppa, Reid Hartmann of Red Wing and Isaac Nelsen of Lyle/Austin Pacelli. — — Rochester Community and Technical College had six baseball players named MCAC South All-Division for the 2024 spring season. The Yellowjackets finished the season 29-17 and were one of the final four teams in the North Plains District Tournament. Yellowjackets coach Clark Jones was named the South Division Coach of the Year for guiding RCTC to a division title and a 14-2 record. Named to the first team were infielder Griffin Olson of Viroqua, Wis., catcher Augusto Mungarrieta of Valencia-Carabobo, Venezuela, and outfielder Luis Rodriguez of Coamo, Puerto Rico. Rees Campanale of Orlanda, Fla., was named to the second team as a pitcher and the third team as a designated hitter. Others named to the third team were pitcher Jerry Santiago Jr. of Coamo, Puerto Rico, and outfielder Ramon Teran of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. Guy N. Limbeck is a sports writer for the Post Bulletin.

        "description": "Minnesota has a new point person working with the state's Fortune 500 companies, educating them about NIL, all in search of the next 'game changer.'",
        "content": "Imagine a day when Gophers athletes are receiving millions of dollars in name, image and likeness (NIL) payments from Minnesota's big businesses, putting them on par with peers across major college sports. The Gophers are hoping for their own version of what the University of Memphis landed in April with a $25 million NIL contribution from FedEx. Why not dream big on getting an NIL supercharge from among the state's 15 Fortune 500 companies? \"FedEx is a game-changer,\" Gophers athletics director Mark Coyle said. \"There's no doubt.\" Brett Schreiner is the new point person trying to help Coyle and the Gophers attract a big-business NIL investment like the one Tigers athletics scored from the Memphis-based shipping giant. Schreiner was fundraising on the university's academic side before taking on his new role as Senior Manager, Business Development-NIL. He works for Learfield, the official rights holder for the Gophers and hundreds of other collegiate programs. The Gophers were the 13th program within Learfield's national footprint to hire someone for an NIL-specific job. \"We're trying to kind of be on the cutting edge with this role,\" Schreiner said. \"We're trying to work with a lot of companies to make NIL more important to them.\" Schreiner, who played Division III football at Wisconsin-Eau Claire and worked in athletics at his alma mater and Wisconsin-Stout, is trying to change the way big companies think of NIL in Minnesota. The most familiar NIL path involves donations to a collective, such as Dinkytown Athletes , which helps athletes get paid through endorsements. A challenge facing collectives is trying to explain to larger businesses how they can benefit from this process. Why should Minnesota's Fortune 500 companies, such as 3M, Target, Best Buy, Land O'Lakes and General Mills, invest in NIL deals with Gophers athletes? Many of these corporations already donate to the U in other areas. In 2017, 3M announced a 14-year, $11.2 million Gophers athletics naming rights sponsorship with the Mariucci hockey arena. NIL is completely different, but the Gophers have talked to 3M about giving. \"3M and the University of Minnesota have had a strong relationship for nearly 100 years and our involvement in Gopher Athletics is one piece of a larger partnership,\" 3M spokesman Mike Laninga said. \"The Gopher athletic department was very helpful in explaining how the NIL process works and how to properly engage if we chose to do so.\" Schreiner works closely with Jeremiah Carter, Gophers senior associate AD for NIL/Policy and Risk Management . Schreiner explained that a crucial step to convincing corporations to invest in NIL is getting them to see the value of influencer marketing. Using social media and video messaging, athletes can use their personal brand and social media following to bring exposure to companies big and small. \"I don't think this path has gotten as much press,\" Schreiner said. \"This basically gives student-athletes a chance to be influencer marketers for companies. That can mean a lot of different things. This can also teach athletes about developing their entrepreneurship and what they want their brand to be.\" Sure, Timberwolves' Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns or the Vikings' Justin Jefferson are popping up on billboards and ads all over town. Could Gophers athletes be in the running for similar opportunities? A recent example was Gophers women's basketball leading scorer Mara Braun's image being used on a billboard in town to promote Affinity Plus, a Minneapolis credit union. Braun has nearly 28,000 followers on Instagram. \"How can we pair a company with student-athletes and the Gophers' brand to touch the hearts of fans across the state and the nation?\" Schreiner said. \"We can humanize the companies with athletes from the University of Minnesota and not just from the local pro sports teams.\" U.S. companies went from investing an estimated $1.7 billion in influencer marketing in 2016 to $16.4 billion in 2022, according to data from influencermarketinghub.com . Other data from the site projects that investments in influencer marketing by businesses nationally could increase to $24 billion this year. In late February, state legislation stripped the NCAA's ability to regulate NIL in recruiting, opening doors for collectives to negotiate directly with prospects before they signed. That changed NIL in a big way. An agreement Thursday between the NCAA and Power Five conferences opened the door for direct payments to athletes -- another massive-change moment for college sports. This points toward Minnesota and other schools taking control of the NIL process, which would make Schreiner's goal of connecting large companies to NIL funding even more critical for the Gophers. \"It's part of the growth and evolution we will need as an athletics department to best position us for the future,\" Carter said. \"A position like Brett's is going to be relevant and needed no matter where NIL goes.\"",

Strengthening optimism that the European Central Bank, which meets on June 6, could make positive moves towards a rate cut have also buoyed stocks and oil prices. The governor of the Bank of Finland, Olli Rehn, who is also the European Central Bank (ECG) governor, helped matters on Monday by suggesting that rate cuts could begin in June because inflation was closing in on its 2% target across the euro zone and that the drop in inflation was “sustained”. “Thanks to this disinflationary process, inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, and the time is thus ripe in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates,” Rehn said . “This obviously assumes that the disinflationary trend will continue and there will be no further setbacks in the geopolitical situation and energy prices,” he added. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} For April, Euro zone inflation was 2.4%, the seventh consecutive month in which it remained below 3%, with May figures due out on Friday this week expected to be highly anticipated by markets.

        "description": "Market expectations are for a $10-15b increase in the NZ bond tender programme.",
        "content": "Market expectations are for a $10-15 billion increase in the Government’s bond tender programme over the next four years to fund future deficits. A weaker outlook for nominal GDP and thus a smaller tax take will be the key driver for the Government’s future borrowing. Westpac economists expect the programme to lift by a cumulative $15b over the next four years compared with last December’s update, which laid out plans to borrow $38b in 2025, $36b in 2026, $28b in 2027 and $16b in 2028. The bank expects this Thursday’s Budget to see a $3b lift in the borrowing requirement for the upcoming 2024/25 fiscal year, moving it slightly above the $38b programme that will be completed in the current fiscal year to June. “The increase in the borrowing requirement could be smaller if tax cuts have been scaled back or spending control is assumed to be tighter than we have assumed. But it could also be larger if Treasury’s growth forecasts are revised down more than we have assumed,” the bank said. Westpac senior economist Darren Gibbs said the market is expecting another $10b to $15b increase over the next four years. “If we get something that’s in that window, then I don’t think that that’s going to be a problem for the market,” he said. However, anything wildly outside that would be an issue. The Government’s borrowing requirement, before the onset of Covid-19 in 2020, looks puny compared with what’s coming up. In the fiscal update in December 2019, just a month before the outbreak, NZ Debt Management outlined plans to raise a total of $42b over the ensuing five years, starting with a meagre $10b bond programme for fiscal 2020. “These days, churning out $38-40b bond programmes in a year seems to be doable,” Gibbs said. In terms of pricing, Gibbs said bond traders appeared to be more concerned about the Reserve Bank’s next change in its Official Cash Rate, and the monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve, than the prospect of more supply coming on stream. “The market is very aware of the supply that is coming on tap from ongoing fiscal deficits, but I don’t think that’s the key driver. “There are two real issues. One is the size of the programme and how the market can absorb it. “The other is getting our heads around how the Reserve Bank is likely to view the Budget, and what that means for the way they are thinking about the economy and inflation,” Gibbs said. “Does it make it less likely or more likely that policy easings are more likely sooner or later?” Economists said Crown debt was likely to remain above the Government’s long-term goal of 20-40 per cent of GDP. New Zealand’s current debt-to-GDP ratio of 44 per cent of GDP is around the same as it was in the mid-1990s and small by some standards. In the US, the ratio is 120 per cent and it’s around 100 per cent in the UK. ANZ expects to see a $10b lift in the bond tender programme over the forecast period. “The increase in the borrowing requirement could be smaller if tax cuts have been scaled back or spending control is tighter than we have assumed.” the bank said. “But it could also be larger if Treasury’s growth forecasts are revised down more than we have assumed.” Jamie Gray is an Auckland-based journalist, covering the financial markets and the primary sector.

        "content": "National’s tax cuts will be the centrepiece of the Budget on May 30 , and Finance Minister Nicola Willis has been open about funding them partly by slashing government spending. National campaigned on adjusting the tax thresholds in a way that would cost almost $9 billion over four years , alongside other tax changes worth an additional $5.6b over four years . How these would be paid for was immediately questioned , and since the coalition Government was formed, Willis’ task has been more difficult as National dropped its proposal for a foreign buyer tax . Willis hasn’t said whether the tax relief she will announce this week will be the same as what National campaigned on , but it will provide relief to working New Zealanders and will be paid for by a mix of new revenue streams as well as savings. So where has the slash come from? $7.47 billion over four years This was revealed in Willis’ mini-Budget in December , and includes: $2.61b by scrapping several policies and projects including free ECE for 2-year-olds ($1.18b), Let’s Get Wellington Moving ($525m), Labour’s RMA reforms ($302m), Fair Pay Agreements ($65m), subsidised public transport for 5 to 12-year-olds and 13 to 24-year-olds ($265m), industry transformation plans ($127m), and the clean car discount ($50m). $2b from the Emissions Trading Scheme by scrapping the GIDI fund subsidising businesses to cut emissions ($647m), and returning committed funding from the Climate Emergency Response Fund ($900m) and the National Land Transport Fund ($500m). $2.8b from tax and benefit changes (including $2.31b from ending commercial buildings depreciation , and $676m by indexing benefits to inflation instead of wage growth), but returning the bright-line test to two years will cost the Government $180m. Not included in this (and more than offset by it) is the phasing in of interest deductibility for landlords (which will cost the Government $2.9b ). $1.5b in annual savings from slimming down the public service This also includes about 5000 job losses or disestablished roles following public service bosses being asked to find 6.5 to 7.5 per cent in savings , and ministers going line-by-line through departmental spending. A small proportion of these roles would have occurred regardless of a change in government due to organisational changes that would have happened anyway. Yesterday Willis said there were 2250 fewer roles and 1150 vacancies that won’t be filled following ministers’ and chief executives’ review of government spending, with “just over” 500 further roles identified in addition to the baseline exercise. This totals 3900 roles/vacancies. Willis said there were more than 240 “initiatives... many of which we had never heard of before” - and which will be detailed on Thursday - that had either had some funding cut or been axed altogether. These have “freed up considerable cash” to pay for tax relief, and also for more teachers , the boost to Gumboot Friday , and for Surf Life Saving . It has also allowed programmes that had time-limited funding - including for Pharmac and for school lunches - to continue to be funded. She said “hundreds” of frontline roles will be added including teachers, health workers, police, Corrections officers, and road maintenance crews (to fill potholes), and overall job creation will “likely” outweigh job reduction. The public service cuts/savings include: $442m over four years from Corrections, which has been allocated to hiring more staff, funding rehabilitation programmes for remand prisoners, and building 810 more prison beds $107m from the Defence Force ($99m) and the Ministry of Defence ($8m) by ending projects, reducing international and domestic travel, and decreasing contractor and consultant spending. The savings are being allocated towards boosting pay for Defence Force staff, upgrading its NH90 helicopter fleet and replacing 40-year-old Unimogs and Pinzgauer trucks. 447 fewer roles at Oranga Tamariki , 391 jobs at the Ministry for Primary Industries including 133 existing roles, and 341 roles at the Ministry for Business, Innovation and Employment , while the numbers at the Ministry of Education (605) and the Ministry of Social Development (712, including some voluntary redundancy ) are higher. The Ministry of Health is looking to disestablish 271 roles and propose a restructured new 137 roles . Stopping the money tap, altering programmes, avoiding future big bills This includes refusing the $1.47b KiwiRail request to support the plan for Cook Strait’s mega-ferries. It’s unclear whether the previous Government, had it remained in power, may have also declined to throw more money at the project, or what the current Government might spend to plug the infrastructure gap ( ageing ferries ) that the investment was meant to fill. The Government is claiming savings of $107m a year by delivering a no-frills school lunches programme. Last week it stopped the First Home Grant scheme, which is expected to save $245 million over a four-year (2024-28) period , $140m of which is allocated to community housing providers to deliver 1500 new social housing places. And the Government has stopped Auckland Light Rail and the Lake Onslow hydro scheme , both of which held significant fiscal liability risk ($15b for the former, $16b for the latter). This leaves the Government without the transport benefits in Auckland if light rail had ever been completed, or the safety net for the country’s energy lulls if the hydro-project had ever come to fruition. The Government has made a series of transport announcements for Auckland , and has plans to increase energy supply . It is also possible that the cancellation of the Lake Onslow project could encourage more investment in the energy sector, given the chilling effect it was having on investment.

        "description": "Lincoln City Libraries announced the top three books competing for the annual Memorial Day “One Book One Lincoln” competition on Monday morning.",
        "content": "Lincoln City Libraries hosted coffee fanatics and book lovers at The Mill Coffee & Tea's Telegraph District location Monday morning to announce the top three books competing for the annual “One Book One Lincoln” competition. “ The Berry Pickers ” by Amanda Peters, “ A Little Devil in America ” by Hanif Abdurraqib and “ North Woods ” by Daniel Mason are the three left to vie for the top title. The three books come from the 71 titles nominated by community members, which a committee of 15 members narrowed to 10, then three. Now, community members are encouraged to vote for their favorite until Aug. 31, and the winner will be the top featured book in the 2024 reading program. \"We look forward to receiving votes throughout the summer and learning which book our community selects as their One Book One Lincoln shared community read,” said Ryan Wieber, Lincoln City Libraries director. Allysa Diehl. Allysa Diehl, the chairperson of the One Book One Lincoln committee, said there is something for everyone within these three books. “I really think there's just nice variety in the top three,” she said. “Lots of different stories, but really great writing.” \"The Berry Pickers\" is one of three One Book One Lincoln finalists. “The Berry Pickers,” a debut novel written by Amanda Peters, is a national bestseller, 2023 Barnes and Noble Discover Prize Winner and winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction. The book takes readers through the nearly 50-year-old unsolved mystery of a missing 4-year-old girl from the blueberry fields of Maine. Hanif Abdurraqib’s essay collection, “A Little Devil in America,” is the first collection to be featured in the One Book One Lincoln competition. The collection is a finalist for the National Book Award and Pen/Diamonstein-Spielvogel award, winner of the Andrew Carnegie Medal and the Gordon Burn Prize, and one of the top ten Best Books of the Year, according to the Chicago Tribune, The Philadelphia Inquirer and more. \"A Little Devil in America\" is one of three One Book One Lincoln finalists. Diehl said some committee members paused their reading to research certain parts of the story, learning about multiple generations through stories of different centuries, all encompassed in one book. “North Woods” by Daniel Mason is the story of a house in the New England woods, told by the many inhabitants who have lived there over many centuries. The book is a National Bestseller, a New York Times and Washington Post top ten Book of the Year, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and one of the Best Books of the Year, according to Time, NPR, The Boston Globe and more. \"North Woods\" is one of three One Book One Lincoln finalists. All three books are available in print, audio and e-book formats and can be borrowed from the library through its catalog . This event has been held annually since 2002, letting Lancaster County residents connect through reading the same books and discussing them together. “What we're looking for are books that have good writing and opportunities for lively discussion,” Diehl said. Community members are invited to begin nominating books for next year's competition. “The goal is that it'll give us something to talk about all across the city,” Diehl said.

        "description": "It doesn't have to take a lot of resources to distinguish yourself in a crowded tech market. What it does take is a truly innovative idea, customer focus, a compelling story, and working with people who complement your strengths.",
        "content": "I've spent the bulk of my career in the tech startup world. In the late 1990s I developed the security software Snort and then launched the security software Sourcefire , which was later acquired by Cisco. Currently, I'm the CEO of another security startup called Netography. I also serve as a board member of several other cybersecurity tech startups. Over the years, I have been repeatedly in a position of thinking about what it takes for startups to stand out amid market noise, category confusion, and louder voices from companies with more resources. Here are five suggestions that have helped tech startups find their niche and differentiate themselves . As soon as a new technology starts to capture attention, the market gets flooded with companies trying to capitalize on it. But I have found that the seed for innovation often comes from examining why things are the way that they are, not chasing trends. For example, why does network security only exist in on-premises networks and not in cloud networks? As it happens, the tools we built 25 years ago for securing networks are not effective on modern networks. Since 89 percent of organizations have a multi-cloud strategy this is a problem--and presents an opportunity to architect a vastly more effective approach to network security. Don't fall into the \"if you build it, they will come\" mentality. Innovation alone isn't sufficient; it needs to be proven, with actual users. Before you invest heavily in building the solution, validate your idea with your target audience. Run your idea by potential customers, ask for feedback, and truly listen. If possible, get your solution in their hands so you can learn from actual user experiences. It's better to know upfront if you are really onto something, or if you need to pivot before you sink time and money into execution to the exclusion of a better idea. You have multiple audiences you need to \"sell\" your solution to, including customers, investors, employees, and partners. You need a compelling overarching story that includes the current state of the market, the challenge, the opportunity, and how your company addresses the challenge in a new and more effective way. Simplify the technical and, when you can, relate your approach to something these audiences are likely to be familiar with so that the story will resonate. Everything is fair game--pop culture, consumer products, and daily life. In cybersecurity, I've seen successful parallels drawn from spy movies, self-driving cars, and even cooking and cattle ranching. I've been lucky enough to benefit from relationships with industry and business mentors. Mentors on the industry side have a deep understanding of the technology area you are focused on, an informed perspective on how the industry has evolved and where it is going, brutal honesty when they foresee potential challenges on the horizon and creativity to help you think about how to approach and solve problems. Mentors on the business side serve as great examples of how to be an effective manager and leader, which includes recognizing the talent you have in the organization and staying focused on the mission--building a great company. The experience they bring having worked successfully with investors, lawyers, and strategic partners can help you avoid costly mistakes. Recognize where you lack experience and surround yourself with people who complement your strengths and who you can watch and learn from. When times are tough, as they were during the dot-com bust and are today amidst current macroeconomic conditions, the flip side is that many great talents become available. Your company may be in a position to benefit. Scrutinize your needs and see if there's an opportunity to bring in the right people to fill the gaps you have. Standing out in a crowded tech environment will always be challenging, particularly for startups with limited resources. To find your niche, start with a truly innovative idea, validate it with customers, tell a story that resonates, and surround yourself with the right people to help you build a great company.",

        "description": "New Zealand is falling behind in key areas of technology, those in the sector say.",
        "content": "Here are seven areas that many in the tech industry would like Thursday’s Budget to address – and the likelihood of the Government delivering. Action on AI New Zealand is falling behind the rest of the world with artificial intelligence (AI) in that it has no major Government funding initiatives to boost uptake and no AI-specific regulation. Surveys have revealed that a majority of Kiwis are spooked about the dark side of AI and want some guard rails put in place. Why would anyone in the private sector want red tape wrapped around artificial intelligence? Buddle Findlay special counsel Damien Steel-Baker says many New Zealand companies want to invest in AI systems. They think some degree of regulation is inevitable, at some point, but don’t want to waste money now creating products and services that could fall foul of yet-unknown rules. “So some will have a bit of uncertainty, which will stifle their innovation,” Steel-Baker says. In the United States, President Joe Biden launched a comprehensive series of directives on AI. The European Union passed the AI Act, which includes safety benchmarks that AI systems must meet, and bans (bar law enforcement exceptions with a warrant) on using artificial intelligence with CCTV footage, predictive police profiling or “emotion-recognition” systems in the workplace, to give a few examples. Australia’s Budget 2023 allocated A$101.2 million ($108.6m) to a critical technology fund to help create governance rules for AI and support small and medium enterprises’ adoption of AI technologies (as part of a wider tech adoption fund that topped A$1 billion). Its Budget 2024 (delivered on May 14) had a further $40m for national AI centre programmes to support safe and responsible deployment of AI. Will we see similar initiatives on this side of the Tasman? It’s a sure bet Technology Minister Judith Collins will deliver an AI strategy soon, but with purse strings tight, meaningful Crown spending to boost an update of the tech is slim. A rural broadband boost The Briefing for the Incoming Minister (or “Bim”) for Media and Communications Minister Melissa Lee (since replaced by Paul Goldsmith) said the urban Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) network is “world-class”, but “despite substantial government investment, rural New Zealanders experience connectivity services that are slower, less reliable and more expensive than urban New Zealanders”. The Technology Users Association of New Zealand (Tuanz) has been advocating for better rural broadband and Chorus recently reiterated its proposal that the Crown co-invest in a PPP to expand fibre into rural areas. The NZX-listed firm envisioned a 10-year, $2-2.5b 10-year public-private rural fibre rollout . That probably represents too much sticker shock for Goldsmith - for Budget 2024, at least – but the Government could still expand more modest wireless broadband and cellular efforts, or simply expand a pilot project to subsidise Starlink installation in remote areas. $300-500m for start-ups Will Elevate get elevated? In 2020, the previous Government gave $300m (most of it via the NZ Super Fund) to create the Elevate fund, which chipped in on new funds created by private venture capital firms, which in turn invested in tech start-ups. With that $300m almost run dry, the Startup Council, assembled by the Labour-led Government, consisting mainly of people from the private sector, recommended that Elevate be topped up – and this time to the tune of $500m. That suggestion, and others, were not picked up. Recently, one of the partners at Blackbird – Australasia’s largest venture capital fund, and the recipient of $30m from Elevate toward its NZ Fund 2 – wrote an open letter to the coalition Government, also recommending a $500m top-up for Elevate. Elevate’s success is hard to gauge at this point. There was a venture capital (VC) boom in New Zealand from early 2020 to early 2022. But cheap money meant a VC boom worldwide. And it’s too early to gauge the success of Elevate’s co-investments (and the Crown-backed New Zealand Growth Capital Partners, which runs it, always plays its cards close to its chest over any timeframe). Regardless, a top-up is unlikely to appear. Before the election, Collins tamped down expectations of more money for Elevate, citing tight Crown accounts and a need to get the lie of the land while in office. And that land is looking rougher than expected. The Startup Council also recommended tax breaks for investing in start-ups. Again, Collins was careful to dial down expectations before the election, citing the fiscal constraints that have only got tighter since. Fabled esops Tech entrepreneur and unsuccessful National candidate for Auckland Central Mahesh Muralidhar and the Startup Council are among those who’ve lobbied for the Government to drop a tax on unrealised gains for employee stock ownership plans (esops). That would make it financially practical for cash-strapped start-ups to offer shares to retain talent, or lure it from within New Zealand or overseas. Collins said pre-election that she was open to the measure, but would not 100 per cent commit. Still, it looks on the cards. Some in the startup community also want the Government to address the foreign investment fund tax , which they see as a double taxation and disincentive for high net worth individuals to come to NZ and invest in our early-stage companies. So far there’s been no sign of appetite for action on this front. A leg-up for NZ Inc “NZ Inc” is shorthand for the Government and private enterprise co-operation in our everybody-knows-everybody small-country economy, where some see various sectors needing a boost from the Crown grow to the point where they’re competitive on the world stage – or in a position to grow faster. So far, the current Government has delivered some negatives, with tech-friendly agencies like Callaghan Innovation and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (Mbie) caught in the general cull of civil servants, delays in major IT projects contributing to Spark’s recent earnings downgrade and pressure on every firm that deals with the Government – easily New Zealand’s largest single buyer of tech products and services – as Crown agencies button down. The cloud software boosting kiwiSaaS, whose six fulltime staff are funded by $11m from the last Government, expiring in June , is one of several industry entities looking nervously to Budget 2024. It’s likely the NZ Inc-friendly Collins will continue and even expand public-private efforts to boost tech. But the funding might not come with the squeezed Budget 2024, and she’s more likely to strike her own path than renew the previous Government’s initiatives. More for cybersecurity and e-safety Australia has comprehensively outspent New Zealand, on a per capita basis, on Government efforts to boost cybersecurity defences and promote e-safety online. The Aussies earmarked A$86.5m to establish a new National Anti-Scam Centre, A$46.5m for a co-ordinator for cyber security to co-ordinate multi-agency efforts in the event of a cyber incident, and quadrupled funding for the office of Australia’s e-Safety Commissioner (its rough equivalent to New Zealand’s Netsafe) with a A$131m injection (Netsafe’s total funding is around $4.5m). We’re unlikely to see spending on that scale here (and indeed, so far there have only been cuts, with Internal Affairs consulting on a proposal to lay off 11 staff in its Digital Safety Group ) and abandoning plans for a social media safety regulator. Here, we’re definitely going to see more centralisation and co-ordination between the public and private sectors and the stew of agencies on the Crown side of the fence – as flagged by Collins in her Technology and Government Communications Security Bureau ( GCSB) portfolios, and Commerce and Consumer Affairs Minister Andrew Bayly in the area of cyber scams. But immediate funding boosts are less likely. A Digital Services Tax After taking it to Cabinet in 2019, Finance Minister Grant Robertson (with new Revenue Minister Barbara Edmonds) finally introduced legislation for a Digital Services Tax (DST) on the eve of the 2023 election. It had no time even for a first reading. A DST would involve a flat tax on a Big Tech firm’s New Zealand revenue, regardless of a profit – billed as a measure against so-called profit-shifting to low-tax countries like Ireland. Local tech industry ginger group NZRise liked the bill, but Big Tech might have hoped it would die a natural death, post-election. Instead, Revenue Minister Simon Watts reinstated the Digital Services Tax Bill in December . He recently told the Herald he was still considering whether to proceed with it. Budget 2024 could reveal whether he sees the threat of a DST as a useful bargaining chip, or a route to crackdown. Critics, including Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) officials , say the sums gained would be modest and could be negated altogether by retaliatory tariffs. What’s already been done? The Government will maintain the 20 per cent R&D tax rebate introduced by its predecessor for the video game sector. The Consumer and Product Data Bill 2024, introduced to Parliament last week , is designed to usher in open banking, which - all going to plan - should make it easier for fintech apps to provide the likes of new payment solutions, putting market pressure on contactless payment fees. It should also make it faster and easier to get a loan, or compare or switch a power or other provider (banking will be it’s first point of focus though).

        "content": "The Tennessee Titans say they won’t trade wide receiver Treylon Burks, but actions speak louder than words. After selecting him in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, the Arkansas product has struggled to do much of anything at the professional level. Burks appeared in 11 games last year, recording just 16 receptions for 221 yards while failing to climb up one of the worst depth charts in football. After firing Mike Vrabel , first-year head coach Brian Callahan revamped the wide receiver room with big-name signees in Calvin Ridley and Tyler Boyd. With those two joining established star DeAndre Hopkins, it’s hard to envision a world where Burks has an opportunity to break out in 2024. With this in mind, the rebuilding Titans could trade Treylon Burks to a receiver-needy team looking for a cheap dart throw at the position. According to Bleacher Report , the New York Giants could send over a 2025 sixth-round pick for his services. Bleacher Report Proposes Treylon Burks Trade Between Titans, Giants The New York Giants are currently between a rock and a hard place. With Daniel Jones entrenched as the starter for at least one more year, New York must improve the supporting cast to field a functional offense. Unfortunately, the team only has $ 1.1 million in salary cap space , so they lack the financial resources to go after a top-market player. This increases the odds of a Treylon Burks trade, as the wide receiver is still on a rookie contract and won’t carry a large cap hit. Darius Slayton is a fine player and Malik Nabers could be a superstar , but this team could use a third option to compete with Wan’Dale Robinson. Treylon Burks is anything but a guarantee, but he’s a fine low-risk acquisition, especially since Slayton is holding out and possibly seeking a trade of his own. Somebody must catch the ball, and a healthy version of Treylon Burks might be able to do just that. Of course, the Giants shouldn’t be the only teams interested in a Treylon Burks trade. While he hasn’t panned out at the NFL level, the wide receiver was a first-round pick for a reason. In a league lacking enough reliable receivers to meet demand, some other team should be willing to roll the dice on the once-beloved prospect. The Bills brought in a small army to try and replace Stefon Diggs. After parting ways with their top receiver, the team now has tight end Dalton Kincaid, Curtis Samuel, and Khalil Shakir set to catch passes from superstar quarterback Josh Allen. While these three are all reliable in their own right, Kincaid is the only one with meaningful upside. Treylon Burks has untapped potential, and the cash-strapped Bills could swing a trade for the cheap veteran to see if they can bring out his natural talent. Lamar Jackson had two starting-caliber receivers last year, and he won MVP honors. Now that Odell Beckham is in Miami, Baltimore should try and add another reliable target. Rashod Bateman and Treylon Burks are unproven assets at this point in their careers and could fight for starting duties if acquired via trade. Nelson Agholor and rookie DeVontez Walker are better off in depth roles, while Burks has the raw potential to be more than that. Rashee Rice will face some type of suspension, and Xavier Worthy already has a hamstring injury . Just like that, Kansas City’s revamped wide receiver depth chart could be down to Marquise Brown, Kadarius Toney, and Skyy Moore. Treylon Burks is a major question mark at this point in his career, but it’s hard to envision the trade target being any worse than Toney and Moore. All he has to do is not actively sabotage the team and he’ll be a step up from what those two provided last year. The Saints are in their usual self-imposed salary cap hell and cannot afford an expensive replacement for Michael Thomas. What they can do, however, is trade for Treylon Burks and hope a change of scenery brings out the best in the Arkansas product. Derek Carr is only as good as his surroundings, so it’s crucial that New Orleans finds three reliable wide receivers to compensate for the questionable offensive line. There is a strong case to be made that the Chargers have the worst collection of wide receivers in the NFL. Ladd McConkey has some potential, but the rest of the group is either untested late-round picks or underwhelming journeymen. Treylon Burks isn’t a safe trade target by any stretch of the imagination, but he has the upside to become a solid player in the NFL. Based on the current state of the depth chart, Los Angeles should throw as many darts as possible at the position and see what sticks.

        "description": "'Bigger is uglier and harder, not better when it comes to construction' – Richard Kroon.",
        "content": "When it comes to construction, bigger is “uglier and harder”, according to luxury apartment developer Richard Kroon. So how has he set the ambitious Victoria Lane project on a path to success? Meanwhile, a sleek and tall addition to Auckland’s skyline is nearing completion and we get the latest on Kiwi Property Group’s build-to-rent homes. Completion has been achieved of Victoria Lane, one of Remuera’s most luxurious new apartment buildings, clad in stone and aluminium, and now developer Richard Kroon has reflected on that $150 million project in the village heart. He hit the market at the right time, selling high-end apartments before the recession really took hold. This is a big project and places came with matching price tags: apartments were marketed from $3m to $18m each for the five-level 23-unit block with 52 basement car parks running the full length underground. “Bigger is uglier and harder, not better when it comes to construction. Small is great, easy,” said the experienced developer, now in his early 70s. Victoria Lane was one of the few projects where the presence of a tower crane by builder CMP Construction sparked a High Court ruling, issued in August 2021 by Justice Edwin Wylie . Being in such a built-up area, the boom of the giant crane had to swing over 31 people’s and entities’ properties, directly under the slew path of the main boom, so Kroon approached everyone seeking consent. Some agreed, but others were opposed or were silent. So Victoria Lane sought a court order authorising it to enter and re-enter the neighbouring properties’ airspace with CMP’s crane to build the apartments. Neighbours Harry and Christine White and Anthony Sandlant of 6 Victoria Ave were opposed, saying half their house lay under the crane’s path. The neighbours wanted a $1m bond from Kroon’s company. Evidence was presented that the site was 100m long. If the crane was placed in the centre, it had to be capable of lifting 5.6 tonnes at a distance of 50m from the tower. The requirement dictated the size of crane that is necessary, the court heard. In evidence, Andrew Moore of CMP said that mobile or crawler cranes couldn’t be used because of the site. A mobile crane wouldn’t have been able to lift the weights needed. The judge ruled in August 2021 that “the terms of any order and the conditions for the proposed entry into air space require further thought and perhaps evidence”. But a decision the next month said the parties had indeed reached an agreement. So the crane went up and Victoria Lane rose and has been a big success for Kroon. Its name came from being on Victoria Ave but backing on to a narrow paved walkway or lane leading from the building directly to Remuera Rd via that laneway. The building is nicely positioned to capture the sun on the ridge, facing north. A porte-cochere with a grand 7m internal height connects two parts of the building and reception and dual lobbies lead off that. Minimalist details like cream stone cladding create a strong visual statement. The block is near the corner of Remuera Rd and Victoria Ave, one commercial/retail building back from the main street. The design is by Leuschke Group Architects and the interiors are by James Doole. Around 40 per cent of the building is already occupied, Kroon said last Thursday. Some buyers are yet to return from overseas. So what has he learned of developing 4 and 4A Victoria Ave and how does he see the market? He notes big change, including at that top end: “You’ll do well if you have built stock. You won’t do well if you are trying to float an apartment.” Asked about prices achieved, Kroon said some buyers did their own internal fit-outs so the amounts paid reflected that. His project has been highly successful in terms of sales, with only two of the 23 apartments unsold: a 100sq m unit for $3.8m and a 260sq m northwest facing place for $8.85m. On those two last sales, he notes some air of caution: “Some people are looking but you can tell how much the market has changed. People are very nervous about selling their own homes even at the higher end of the market. You are just not getting a lot of confidence.” A lower level of debt than many other projects carry was another key to success, Kroon said. “If you get caught, sometimes the problems are complex so you have to have a higher equity ratio. You can’t afford to do something like this like a house where you have 70 per cent debt. My debt was not that high. All funding facilities are fulfilled,” he said. Victoria Lane got funding for construction from First Mortgage Custodians. So, will Kroon do it again? He does have another project in mind, he admits, also understood to be in Remuera, but he isn’t giving any details away, including the location. $250m Indigo Hotel and Residences nears completion Icon is nearing completion of Auckland’s new 41-level $250 million Indigo Hotel and Residences at 51 Albert St, a tower which also backs on to St Patrick’s Square. Dean Rzechta , managing director of Melbourne-headquartered 94 Feet, which developed and owns the building, said he would visit early next month. “Icon is rapidly approaching the code compliance stage. That is expected to be achieved in late June and we’re looking forward to the opening of the hotel shortly afterward,” Rzechta said. Hotel rooms and apartments, including a penthouse, are now completed although the foyer, reception and restaurant are around two months behind, he said. Rzechta expects the opening to be around August, depending on the building programme’s finalisation. The tower rose on the site of the heritage Macdonald Halligan Motors building near the Wyndham St intersection, opposite Manson TCLM’s $650 million 50 Albert development , where Spark and Milford Asset Management are moving once that’s finished. 51 Albert is a hotel/apartment scheme: a 225-room Hotel Indigo and 30 upper-level or “sky” apartments in the tower, funded by Australian private lender Merricks Capital. New Lynn build-to-rent Expectations are high that Kiwi Property Group will start planning another build-to-rent project in New Lynn, following success in completing and opening its first scheme beside Sylvia Park in Mt Wellington. Simplicity Livings’ Sam Stubbs said the only three scale builders of build-to-rent (BTR) were Kiwi, New Ground and his business. “Why only three? Because construction costs make it devilishly hard to build to rent, so I’m left asking – why do retirement housing and student accommodation builders pay no GST, but long-term build-to-rent developers have to? “Seems a bit bonkers to me when New Zealand needs many more homes. My prediction? GST relief would open the floodgates of KiwiSaver money into BTR, and we need some competitors!” Shane Brealey of Simplicity Living said Australia only had around 5000 BTR units, although another 5000 were under construction. New Zealand only had around 1300 BTR units. “Why is Kiwi Property not flying into New Lynn and the next BTR project?” Brealey asked. A Kiwi spokesman confirmed on Friday that the company’s plans to build new rental apartments in New Lynn were indeed concrete. “We have resource consent for our mixed-use tower at LynnMall. Our initial focus is successfully launching Resido and proving up the concept, after which we’ll look at new opportunities,” he said.

On Monday it was reported that a PNG government official told the United Nations that more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple the U.N. estimate of 670 killed by the landslide in the South Pacific island nation's mountainous interior. The remains of only five people had been recovered by Monday, local authorities reported. It was not immediately clear why the tally of six reported on Sunday had been revised down. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely since the disaster occurred, and it was not immediately clear how officials concluded the number of people affected.

Determining the scale of the disaster is difficult because of challenging conditions on the ground, including the village's remote location, a lack of telecommunications and tribal warfare throughout the province which means international relief workers and aid convoys require military escorts, PA reports. The national government's lack of reliable census data also adds to the challenges of determining how many are potentially dead.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsBuild a portfolio that steadily generates passive income for you. Here are three overlooked dividend stocks to consider.The post Dividend Deals: 3 Overlooked Stocks Offering Incredible Value appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "There is no joy like receiving passive income each quarter. I am someone who loves to receive dividend income and see my money grow without having to do anything. But money will multiply only if you put it in the right place, and dividend stocks can be an ideal place to start. If you seek steady dividend income and long-term growth, consider the overlooked dividend stocks mentioned here. They have a history of raising dividends and are known for bringing stability to your portfolio. These are solid businesses that have gained investor trust and become industry experts. Whether you are only starting or rebalancing your portfolio, here are three dividend stocks to consider, each trading below $100 with a dividend yield over 3%. Now, without further delay, let’s dive deep into them! Coca-Cola (KO) Dividend yield: 3.13% Beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO ) is often overlooked because it keeps moving sideways and hasn’t shown much upside over the past two years. Trading at $62, the stock is up only 3% year-to-date and has been moving between $52 and $62 for the past 12 months. However, looking at the company’s rich history, legacy business, and global presence, Coca-Cola is one of the best investments you can make. It is Warren Buffett’s favorite stock for a reason. I think investors need to look beyond the financials when it comes to this company. It has seen several market ups and downs and survived them all. When you put money into this company, you are investing in the brand. Coca-Cola has licensed the formula to beverage makers across the world and this has helped increase production significantly. It also ensures steady and consistent availability of the products across the globe. In the first-quarter results , the company reported revenue of $11.3 billion and earnings per share ( EPS ) of $0.72. Organic sales increased 11% in the quarter and the management is aiming for an organic revenue growth of 8% to 9%, up from the previous range of 6% to 7%. The company enjoys stable cash flow and has been paying dividends for 63 years. It recently increased the dividend by 5.4% to $0.485 per share per quarter. With a yield of 3.13%, Coca-Cola is one of the best dividend stocks to own. You may not be able to find a stock that offers the same stability and reliability to your portfolio. Morgan Stanley (MS) Dividend yield: 3.44% Another overlooked dividend stock is Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ). Trading at $98, the stock is up 5% YTD and 18% in the past 12 months. Earlier, the company generated the majority of its revenue from traditional banking and trading but has moved towards asset management and investment banking. The transition has paid off and the company has seen steady growth. This has also made it stable and reliable. Today, it derives a higher revenue from wealth management. In the first quarter , the net income stood at $3.4 billion for a revenue of $15.1 billion. The investment banking revenue increased 16% YoY while the wealth management segment was up 5%. Growth in investment banking helped the profit jump 14% YOY. It also completed two acquisitions back in 2020, E-Trade and Eaton Vance which has helped with revenue growth. It reported an EPS of $2.02 which is up 19% YOY. Morgan Stanley has a dividend yield of 3.44% and the dividend has grown 27% in the past 5 years. It has increased dividends for 11 consecutive years. With an improved market and better economic conditions, Morgan Stanley could be in a better position to deliver higher dividends. The company has had a good start to the year and is on a roll. With investment banking back in full force, it makes sense to invest in Morgan Stanley before it hits the triple digits. Pfizer (PFE) Dividend yield: 5.82% Beaten-down Pfizer (NYSE: PFE ) is a value stock, and investors who manage to bag it at the current level could be setting themselves up for massive gains in the long-term. Exchanging hands for $28, the stock has dropped 21% in the past 12 months and has lost most of its value since the pandemic. Its claim to fame was the COVIDvaccine but investors need to realize that there is so much more to Pfizer. While the past few years haven’t been easy for the company it has successfully invested the cash it earned during the pandemic into drugs that can become blockbusters in the next few years. It acquired Seagen for $43 billion, a cancer drug developer which already has four approved medicines. This is its biggest investment in the recent years. It received nine FDA approvals in 2023 and was recently granted full approval for the cervical cancer drug. Pfizer reported a 19% drop in revenue in the first quarter which has led to the stock sell-off, but the management has reaffirmed the full-year revenue guidance of $58.5 to $61.5 billion. PFE is one of the most overlooked dividend stocks in 2024. I think Pfizer’s worst days are over, and we could start seeing growth through its blockbuster drugs. The company is working on reducing operational costs and this could help improve the bottom line. It enjoys a dividend yield of 5.82% and has raised the dividends annually since 2009. I think it has enough liquidity to keep rewarding investors and raise dividends further.

        "description": "The final resting place for a U.S. Navy submarine that sank the most Japanese warships in World War II has been found more than 80 years after it was sunk.",
        "content": "( WAVY ) — The final resting place for a U.S. Navy submarine that sank the most Japanese warships in World War II has been found more than 80 years after it was sunk. The USS Harder was found in the South China Sea, more than 3,000 feet below the surface off the coast of the Philippines’ northern island of Luzon, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. The sub, with its 79-man crew, was sunk during a 1944, battle. It was data collected and provided by Tim Taylor, CEO of Tiburon Subsea and the Lost 52 Project, that helped find the sunken submarine. Previous submarines found by the Lost 52 Project include the USS Grayback, the USS Stickleback, USS R-12, USS S-26, USS S-28 and the USS Grunion. The first USS Harder was commissioned Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It now rests upright and is relatively intact. The NHHC said the excellent state of preservation of the site and the data it collected allowed it to confirm the wreck as the USS Harder. The first USS Harder (SS 257) was commissioned on Dec. 2, 1942, with Cmdr. Samuel D. Dealey in command. It was lost at sea with 79 souls aboard on Aug. 24, 1944. “Harder was lost in the course of victory. We must not forget that victory has a price, as does freedom,” said NHHC Director Samuel J. Cox, U.S. Navy rear admiral (retired). “We are grateful that Lost 52 has given us the opportunity to once again honor the valor of the crew of the ‘Hit ‘em Harder’ submarine that sank the most Japanese warships — in particularly audacious attacks — under her legendary skipper, Cmdr. Sam Dealey.” The Harder made six patrols before it was sunk, with its fifth being the most successful, according to the NHHC, sinking three Japanese destroyers and heavily damaging or destroying two more in four days. Its last known location was in the South China Sea off Luzon during its sixth and last war patrol. Japanese records later revealed Harder fired three torpedoes at its CD-22 vessel, the NHHC said. “The Japanese ship evaded the torpedoes and began a series of depth charge attacks, [with] the fifth depth charge attack sinking Harder and her crew,” the NHHC said. The USS Harder received the Presidential Unit Citation for her first five patrols, six battle stars for World War II service. Dealey was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor “for his outstanding contribution to the war effort on Harder’s fifth patrol.”",

        "content": "The ‘‘Cyber Surakshit Bharat’ initiative of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) was conceptualised with the mission to spread awareness about cyber-crime and build capacities of Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and frontline IT officials, across all government departments, for ensuring adequate safety measures to combat the growing menace of cyber crime and enable organizations to defend their digital infrastructures and become future-ready in tackling cyber-attacks. National e-Governance Division (NeGD), under its Capacity Building scheme, organised the 44 th CISO Deep-Dive training programme from May 27–31, 2024 with participants from Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal and New Delhi at the Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi. The inaugural session of the programme was attended by senior officials from MeitY, NeGD & IIPA. The deep-dive training specifically aims at educating and enabling CISOs to understand cyber-attacks comprehensively and thoroughly, get necessary exposure in latest technologies of safeguard, and translate the benefits of a resilient e-infrastructure to individual organizations and citizens at large. The training is also focused on providing a holistic view of legal provisions, enabling CISOs to formulate policies in the domain of cyber security and build concrete cyber crisis management plans. The purpose of the programme is to spread awareness, build capacities as well as enable Government departments to take steps to create a cyber resilient eco system. The endeavour of the programme is to sensitise and orient participants on cyber safety and security, thus facilitating the Digital India programme for integrated delivery of various Government services to citizens. It also imparts holistic information and knowledge about cyber security to enable government departments to look after their cyber hygiene, safety and security. Launched in 2018, the CISO training is the first-of-its-kind partnership between the Government and industry consortium under Public Private Partnership (PPP) model. Since June 2018 until May 2024, NeGD has efficaciously conducted 44 batches of CISO deep-dive training programmes for over 1,637 CISOs and frontline IT officials.",

        "content": "Madam Dorcas Atia, the Talensi District Director of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), has called on Ghanaians to be reminded of the democratic gains of the country and safeguard it to protect the prevailing peace. That, she said, would ensure prosperity and stability not only in Ghana but also in the sub-region for sustainable and human-centred development. The Director made the call when she addressed stakeholders, including political parties, traditional leaders, religious leaders, security agencies, leaders of persons with disabilities, and youth groups, at an Inter-Party Dialogue Committee (IPDC) meeting held in Talensi District of the Upper East Region. The meeting was organised by the NCCE under the auspices of the European Union-sponsored project dubbed “Preventing and Containing Violent Extremism (PCVE) in the Northern Regions of Ghana”. It is aimed at creating awareness about violent extremism and facilitating activities to engender security consciousness, social inclusiveness, community cohesion, and situational awareness among the citizenry to enhance peacebuilding for sustainable development. Madam Atia noted that the challenges posed by violent extremism were complex and multifaceted, and it was therefore imperative that stakeholders worked together collaboratively across all agencies to monitor and report on threats and vulnerabilities. “NCCE believes that by sharing information and best practices, we can enhance our ability to detect early warning signs and take proactive measures to prevent violent extremism in this district,” she stated. She said, “we aim to pave the way for a safer and more secure electoral environment in 2024 and beyond” and called on the stakeholders to get involved in ensuring there was peace before, during, and after the 2024 elections. Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Saeed Boachie Yiadom, District Police Commander, Talensi, indicated that while it was essential for stakeholders to report on threats and vulnerabilities, it was also important for them to know where to channel those reports for the desired actions to be taken.
