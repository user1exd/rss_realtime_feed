The four, described by the OM as the core of the gang of robbers, were involved in almost all of the robberies. Two men who were involved in one home invasion, Dut M. (30) from Alkmaar and Martijn G. (28) from Heeurhugowaard, were sentenced to 6.5 years and 3 years and 9 months in prison, respectively.

        "content": "The US Dollar (USD) trades a little softer against most major peers on Monday as there is not much to report for the Greenback, with US markets closed for the Memorial Day holidays. However, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, a change in stance on the (ECB) is starting to form. There is a very quiet economic data calendar on Monday. Most of this week will be rather quiet, with only some soft data and US (Fed) speeches ahead towards Thursday. Then, the second estimate for the Q1 US (GDP) on Thursday and April’s US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) numbers on Friday could hit markets and leave more clues on the disinflationary pathway in the US and what the Fed might do next. (DXY) faces a bit of a horror story on the technical front after its weekly close on Friday. First of all, on the weekly chart, the DXY closed below the 100-week Simple Moving Average (SMA), which is a severe bearish signal and could point to a further downturn. A similar picture is seen on the daily chart, where the DXY was unable to stay afloat above the 55-day SMA at 104.86 and gave up its gains for the week above 105.00. On the upside, the DXY index needs to reclaim those levels it lost last week: the 55-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 104.86 and the 105.00 big round level. Further up, the following levels to consider are 105.12 and 105.52. On the downside, the 200-day SMA at 104.40 and the 100-day SMA around 104.30 are the last line of defence. Once that level snaps, an air pocket is placed between 104.30 and 103.00. Should the US Dollar decline persist, the low of March at 102.35 and the low from December at 100.62 are levels to consider. ECB FAQs The European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, is the reserve bank for the Eurozone. The ECB sets interest rates and manages monetary policy for the region. The ECB primary mandate is to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation at around 2%. Its primary tool for achieving this is by raising or lowering interest rates. Relatively high interest rates will usually result in a stronger Euro and vice versa. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy decisions at meetings held eight times a year. Decisions are made by heads of the Eurozone national banks and six permanent members, including the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde. In extreme situations, the European Central Bank can enact a policy tool called Quantitative Easing. QE is the process by which the ECB prints Euros and uses them to buy assets – usually government or corporate bonds – from banks and other financial institutions. QE usually results in a weaker Euro. QE is a last resort when simply lowering interest rates is unlikely to achieve the objective of price stability. The ECB used it during the Great Financial Crisis in 2009-11, in 2015 when inflation remained stubbornly low, as well as during the covid pandemic. Quantitative tightening (QT) is the reverse of QE. It is undertaken after QE when an economic recovery is underway and inflation starts rising. Whilst in QE the European Central Bank (ECB) purchases government and corporate bonds from financial institutions to provide them with liquidity, in QT the ECB stops buying more bonds, and stops reinvesting the principal maturing on the bonds it already holds. It is usually positive (or bullish) for the Euro.",

Lamberth recently granted a delay in Purdy's trial along with two co-defendants. Former President Donald Trump has been subjected to limited gag orders in a variety of criminal and civil cases, from Justice Juan Merchan in the hush money trial to Judge Tanya Chutkan in special counsel Jack Smith's election interference case and Justice Arthur Engoron in New York Attorney General Letitia James' civil fraud lawsuit. However, there is no formal gag order in Smith's Mar-a-Lago documents case, which has been delayed indefinitely by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee. Smith last week requested from Cannon a partial gag order in that case, inspiring an angry rant from Trump on his Truth Social platform. In his Friday request , Smith told Cannon that a limited gag order is needed in order to discourage Trump from making statements \"that pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents.\" READ MORE: What to watch for in Trump trial's closing arguments Smith's motion argues, \"The Government's request is necessary because of several intentionally false and inflammatory statements recently made by Trump that distort the circumstances under which the Federal Bureau of Investigation planned and executed the search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. Those statements create a grossly misleading impression about the intentions and conduct of federal law enforcement agents — falsely suggesting that they were complicit in a plot to assassinate him — and expose those agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial, to the risk of threats, violence, and harassment.\" Attorney George Conway, a Never Trump conservative who is fundraising for President Joe Biden's reelection campaign, applauded Smith's gag order request during a CNN appearance — while Trump railed against the special counsel on Truth Social. Trump posted , \"I guess they're hoping they can silence me from telling the TRUTH like the Corrupt and Highly Conflicted Judge in New York City has done. Gag Orders have a very strong tendency to BACKFIRE, and if anybody should be GAGGED, it should be Deranged Jack, who was recently caught doing very bad things.\" It remains to be seen what Cannon will decide in response to Smith's request.

Internet accuses Trump team of flouting gag order again Law & Crime's Colin Kalmbacher notes , \"Smith's effort to double up on his success with gag orders, if successful, would exact a hat trick of speech concessions on the ex-president at the height of the 2020 campaign season. Trump has, for his part, consistently sought to make political hay out of the four different indictments he faces in four different jurisdictions. Friday night's post on his homegrown social media website keeps up a theme of characterizing those criminal prosecutions as rogue actions of corrupt and partisan prosecutors.\" READ MORE: Trump suffered a 'stunning rebuke' in disastrous Saturday night speech: analyst CONTINUE READING Show less Insiders in Donald Trump’s campaign are increasingly worried that an ally’s extremist past could hand a key swing state to Joe Biden in November. The Daily Beast reported concerns that the former president’s aligning himself with North Carolina’s far-right candidate for governor, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson , is damaging his chances of taking the state. “He’s an opposition researcher’s dream,” Democratic strategist Morgan Jackson told the Beast. “Mark Robinson is the most extreme candidate for public office, period, in North Carolina, much less the race for governor.” He added, “If you're a CEO and you're thinking of moving your business to North Carolina, and Mark Robinson is the governor, I think your employees are going to tell you they want to go somewhere else.\" Among the extremist opinions Robinson has voiced are denial of the Holocaust and a desire to roll back feminism. “I absolutely want to go back to the America where women couldn’t vote, ” he said in 2020. But a Trump strategist told the Beast, “DJT likes him a lot.\" \"Clearly, it's not great,\" he added. ALSO READ: Inside Donald Trump’s billion-dollar Big Oil heist North Carolina-based GOP strategist Paul Shumaker said Robinson's campaign could have a \"reverse coattails\" effect on Trump — meaning Republicans who vote against Robinson might also vote against Trump rather than split their tickets. \"The Biden campaign will attempt to tie the two together,” Shumaker said. “Trump will distance himself and withdraw his endorsement if Robinson becomes too much of a liability. [I] can't underscore Ds' turnout problems enough.\" CONTINUE READING Show less Former President Donald Trump told a roomful of donors that he has plans to expel student demonstrators from the United States, insiders at the meeting told the Washington Post . Talking to a roomful of wealthy supporters — that he joked contained “98 percent of my Jewish friends” — he promised to deport anybody taking part in what he called a “radical revolution.” The promise would be a fundamental disregard for the right to freedom of speech. “One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country,” he told the group at the meeting on May 14, according to the Post. “You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” He also praised the NYPD’s crackdown on Columbia University protesters , and urged police forces elsewhere to take similar action. “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,” he said, according to the Post’s insiders. “The private New York meeting offers new insight into his current thinking, ” the Post reported.

Tommy Tuberville dismisses Trump connection to 'unified Reich' video “Speaking to wealthy donors behind closed doors, Trump said that he supports Israel’s right to continue “its war on terror” and boasted of his White House policies toward Israel. “The former president didn’t mention Netanyahu, whom he resents for acknowledging Joe Biden’s victory in 2020 and hasn’t spoken to in years.” Trump also told donors he supported Israel’s right to attack Gaza. “But I’m one of the only people that says that now. And a lot of people don’t even know what October 7th is,” he said. Trump has stated he wants to deport \"anti-American\" protesters at rally speeches. CONTINUE READING Show less",

        "content": "Mount Baker Wild Theatre (MBWT) captivated audiences with a unique rendition of its latest production, Legally Blonde: The Musical, at Key City Theatre this past week. “Legally Blonde is a feel-good musical based on Heather Hach’s book with music and lyrics by Laurence O’Keefe and Nell Benjamin,” according to the MBWT program. The two-hour show made possible through Musical Theatre International (MTI), demonstrated the sophistication and talent of the cast and crew under Emily McCue’s direction. McCue and her team, including Musical Director Justin Swanson, captured the spirit of the 2001 movie starring Reese Witherspoon. The stellar cast carried the production, reaching a level of professionalism far beyond their high school years. Hailey Conroy plays Elle Woods, Legally Blonde’s heroine and aspiring Harvard law student following a breakup with her long-time boyfriend Warner Huntington III, played by Finn McBurney. Conroy carries the production with the help of a phenomenal supporting cast, including Edison Wilmot as Professor Callahan, Joelle Carlisle as Paulette Buonofonte and Hudson Gross as Emmett Forest. True to the original, Woods wins a seat at Harvard Law School and transforms from a lovestruck schoolgirl to a serious and competent law student, eventually graduating at the top of her once skeptical class. Through a myriad of scenes, choreography, sets, costumes, sound and lighting design, MBWT pulled off its latest production with aplomb while proving that a zebra can change its stripes. “Despite many doubts, Elle’s journey at law school defies all expectations while staying true to herself,” said the MBWT.",

        "content": "A viral post has reminded fans of a trailblazing Black trans character that serves as a timely reminder that trans representation in video games was once uncontroversial. A post on on Sunday (26 May) responded to a clip from the 2016 open-world hacking video game, commenting that it was “wild” and, in many ways, ahead of its time. “They had a Black trans woman as the protagonist’s mentor figure and nobody gave a s**t,” the post, which has been viewed more than one million times, and has 22,000 likes, read. The user appears to be referring to San Francisco city councillor Miranda Comay, who mentors protagonist Marcus Holloway throughout the game. A long-time friend of his family, Miranda is introduced after Marcus asks for information about the mysterious pseudo-religious cult New Dawn. Miranda reveals that she has a long and bitter history with the cult, but that she isn’t too fond of Marcus’ hacking collective, DedSec, either. Prior to her becoming a councilwoman, New Dawn harassed her and leaked information about her “surgeries,” seemingly alluding to gender-affirming procedures. While she admits that the ordeal was embarrassing, she has “nothing to hide”. Fans responding to the post expressed surprise that not only did a game from 2016 feature a Black trans character, but that she is incredibly fleshed out and not simply the butt of a joke. “I think the game came out before all the s**t happened so no one cared because it wasn’t a culture war issue yet,” one user suggested, referring to the controversy of more than 10 years ago. “ is more of a cult hit,” another explained. “[ burned people due to the overhype, and the initial PC launch was rough. Those who did eventually stick with it loved the game but it wasn’t really that popular.” Others joked that, given the game is set in San Francisco, the appearance of queer characters isn’t exactly a shock.",

        "content": "In the annals of Philippine cinema, few names resonate with the enduring legacy of Eva Darren, an actress whose career has spanned decades and whose contributions to the film industry have been nothing short of iconic. However, recent events have cast a shadow over Darren’s illustrious career, as she finds herself at the center of a social media backlash against the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS). Eva Darren’s illustrious career, marked by memorable roles in films such as “Ang Langit sa Lupa” and “Brides of Blood,” has solidified her status as a cinematic icon. Her impressive versatility and talent have also shone through in notable television appearances in beloved series like “Mula sa Puso” and “May Bukas Pa,” further endearing her to audiences. Her contributions to the entertainment industry have enriched Philippine cinema and television and inspired countless artists and viewers, making her a beloved and influential figure. Her distinguished career, extending over several decades, is characterized by her dynamic performances in both cinematic and television realms. In 1998, her role in the critically lauded film ‘Ligaya Ang Itawag Mo Sa Akin’ (1997) earned her a Gawad Urian nomination for Best Supporting Actress, highlighting her exceptional talent alongside Rosanna Roces. Darren’s depiction of Belen Macaspac in the acclaimed ABS-CBN television series ‘Pangako Sa ‘Yo’ (2000) profoundly resonated with viewers, especially in her role as the adoptive mother of the character portrayed by Kristine Hermosa. Her significant portrayal as a fortuneteller in ‘Sineserye Presents: Patayin Sa Sindak si Barbara’ (2008), co-starring Kris Aquino, further reinforced her esteemed standing. Additionally, in 2008, she appeared in the film ‘Ate,’ alongside Ara Mina and Cristine Reyes, showcasing her versatility. Throughout her expansive career in television, she has assumed various roles, manifesting her adeptness across multiple genres. Her career commenced with ‘Hiwaga sa Bahay na Bato’ in 1963, setting the stage for a prolific career. She continued to engage audiences in episodes of ‘Maalaala Mo Kaya,’ with notable roles such as Lydia in ‘Dancing Shoes’ (1994) and Selma in ‘Lupa’ (1995). Her portrayals as Josefina “Pining” Miranda in ‘Mula sa Puso’ (1997) and Editha in ‘Marinella’ (1999) stand out as particularly memorable. Darren’s skills were evident in series like ‘Darating ang Umaga’ (2003), ‘Now and Forever’ (2005-2006), and ‘Komiks Presents: Pedro Penduko at ang mga Engkantao’ (2007). In more recent years, she has appeared in ‘The Rich Man’s Daughter’ (2015), ‘Wish I May’ (2016), and ‘Kadenang Ginto’ (2018), further contributing to the Philippine entertainment industry with her extraordinary performances. The recent incident at the FAMAS Awards has reignited discussions about the immense respect and recognition that veteran artists like Eva Darren deserve. Her legacy and the impact of her work underscore the need for the industry to honor and uphold the contributions of those who have shaped its history. This event has amplified calls for greater appreciation and acknowledgment of the veterans whose artistry and dedication have paved the way for future generations, highlighting their critical role in the continued evolution of Philippine entertainment. Eva Darren’s son, Fernando de la Pena, voiced his and his mother’s dismay in a heartfelt social media post titled “A Moment of Debacle at the FAMAS Awards Night.” Despite preferring a quiet family life, he detailed how his mother had eagerly prepared for the event, buying a new dress and investing in professional styling, only to be sidelined in a bewildering turn of events. Despite adverse weather, Darren made it to the Manila Hotel, only to be replaced on stage by a young singer, leaving her and her family in shock and seeking answers from the FAMAS PR team, which only offered apologies but no accountability. The incident not only represented a personal affront to Darren, who had not been featured on the FAMAS stage since 1969 when she won Best Supporting Actress, but also highlighted issues of professionalism and respect within the organization. FAMAS’s response, attributing the mishap to logistical errors and misjudgment, did little to quell the growing indignation among the public and the artistic community, who saw it as a grave disrespect to a revered figure in the industry. The controversy has sparked a broader conversation about how veteran artists are treated in the entertainment industry. It has questioned the integrity and operational competency of award-giving bodies like FAMAS. It underscores the need for these organizations to honor and respect all artists’ contributions and reflect on their practices to avoid such disrespectful incidents in the future. In response to the backlash, FAMAS issued a public apology, stating that the failure to locate Ms. Darren during the live show was “negligence on the part of the team” and not intentional. They expressed their commitment to making amends and rebuilding trust, including a visit by the FAMAS Board to honor Darren’s stature if she allows it. This moment has highlighted the challenges veteran actors face in the industry and sparked a conversation about the treatment of esteemed artists. As the dust settles on this unfortunate episode, one thing remains clear: Eva Darren’s legacy is etched in the history of Philippine cinema, and no oversight can diminish her contributions to the art form she has helped shape and define.

        "content": "In a bid to combat the rising tide of digital scams, Mastercard and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have forged a strategic partnership. Under the banner of a Memorandum of Understanding, the two entities are pooling their resources to deepen the understanding of the developmental impact of digital scams and to devise effective strategies for detection and mitigation. Digital scams have emerged as a formidable global challenge, exacting staggering financial losses and wreaking havoc on individuals and communities worldwide. Despite the enormity of the problem, much of it remains hidden, with countless incidents going unreported. These scams not only impede progress toward development goals but also corrode the trust essential for fostering an inclusive digital transformation, particularly in developing nations. Recognizing the imperative for a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach, the UNDP Global Centre for Technology, Innovation, and Sustainable Development in Singapore is spearheading a global coalition. This coalition aims to unite international and local public and private sector entities, as well as civil society, in a concerted effort to comprehensively understand the impact of digital scams on development, with a specific focus on developing countries. Mastercard, renowned for its expertise in safeguarding global networks, is the first private sector organization to join this coalition. Its participation underscores the company’s commitment to bolstering global and regional initiatives aimed at fortifying the cyber resilience of digital economies. Leveraging its extensive experience and technological prowess in combatting fraud, Mastercard will provide invaluable insights, best practices, and industry expertise to elevate cybersecurity standards and combat digital scams. Marcos Neto, UN Assistant Secretary-General and Director of UNDP’s Bureau for Policy and Programme Support, emphasized the urgency of the endeavor, highlighting Mastercard’s pivotal role in augmenting the coalition’s capabilities. Ari Sarker, President, Asia Pacific, Mastercard, echoed this sentiment, stressing the importance of fostering trust in an interconnected world plagued by increasingly sophisticated online scams. Looking ahead, the global coalition will undertake an in-depth analysis of the socio-economic ramifications of digital scams and formulate a comprehensive framework to address these multifaceted challenges. Special attention will be devoted to developing countries, where the impact of such scams is most acutely felt. The insights gleaned from this initiative will inform the creation of a toolkit comprising strategies, best practices, and capacity-building resources aimed at galvanizing collaborative action against digital scams on a global scale.",

Profits at China’s industrial companies rose 4% at an annualized pace in April, compared with March’s 3.5% decrease which ended seven consecutive months of rises. April’s uptick was led by the government’s stimulus measures which came into effect to boost the economy and a recovery in exports. In January-April, industrial profit went up by 4.3% from a year ago to 2.09 trillion yuan ($289 billion). State-owned industrial companies saw a 2.8% fall in profits in the 4-month period, foreign companies ran a 16.7% rise and private companies a 6.4% increase.

        "content": "LONDON (Reuters): The European Central Bank (ECB) is ready to start cutting interest rates next month, but policy must continue to be restrictive this year as wage growth will not normalize until 2026, its chief economist Philip Lane told the Financial Times. The ECB has all but promised a rate cut for June 6, so the debate has shifted to subsequent moves, and markets have dialed back their expectations, betting on just one more cut this year. “Barring major surprises, at this point in time, there is enough in what we see to remove the top level of restriction,” Lane told the FT in an interview published on Monday. “The best way to frame the debate this year is that we still need to be restrictive all year long,” he added. “But within the zone of restrictiveness, we can move down somewhat.” While Lane made no explicit comment about the July policy meeting, a string of policymakers, including fellow board member Isabel Schnabel, have already said that a second step should not come so soon. Wage growth is expected to “visibly” decelerate next year, and policymakers can then debate normalizing policy. At 4%, the ECB’s deposit rate holds back growth, and there is little debate that the first few cuts, at least until 3% but possibly further, merely remove restriction rather than provide stimulus. “We need to see more progress (on inflation) before we move from maintaining the restrictive phase to thinking about normalization,” Lane added. Lane said ECB policymakers needed to keep rates in the restrictive territory this year to ensure that inflation kept easing and did not get stuck above the bank’s target, which “would be very problematic and probably quite painful to eliminate.” A key wage indicator accelerated last week, spooking some, but Lane said the figure was well anticipated and a slowdown was already in the works. “Deceleration does not necessarily mean an immediate return to steady state,” Lane said. “This year, the adjustment is clearly quite gradual.”",

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters): China has established its third planned state-backed investment fund to boost its semiconductor industry, with a registered capital of 344 billion yuan ($47.5 billion), the filing with a government-run companies registry showed. The hundreds of billions of yuan invested in the sector puts into perspective President Xi Jinping’s drive to achieve self-sufficiency for China in semiconductors. That commitment has taken on renewed urgency after the U.S. imposed a series of export control measures over the last couple of years, citing fears Beijing could use advanced chips to boost its military capabilities. Chinese chip shares rose, with the CES CN Semiconductor Index rallying more than 3% and set to log the biggest one-day gain in more than a month. The third phase of the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund was officially established on May 24 and registered under the Beijing Municipal Administration for Market Regulation, according to the National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System, a government-run credit information agency. The third phase will be the largest of the three funds launched by the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, known as the “Big Fund.” China’s finance ministry is the biggest shareholder with a 17% stake and paid-in capital of 60 billion yuan, according to Tianyancha, a Chinese companies information database company. China Development Bank Capital is the second-largest shareholder with a 10.5% stake. The Ministry of Finance didn’t immediately reply to Reuters request for comment Seventeen other entities are listed as investors, including five major Chinese banks: Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications with each contributing around 6% of the total capital. Reuters reported in September that China would launch the third phase of the Big Fund. The first phase of the fund was established in 2014 with a registered capital of 138.7 billion yuan, and the second phase followed in 2019 with 204 billion yuan. The Big Fund has provided financing to China’s two biggest chip foundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, and Hua Hong Semiconductor, as well as to Yangtze Memory Technologies, a manufacturer specialized in flash memory chips, and several smaller companies and funds. One of the major areas the third phase of the fund will focus on is equipment for chip manufacturing, Reuters reported in September. Also, the Big Fund is considering hiring at least two institutions to invest the capital from the third phase.",

        "content": "Sam the Man's car 'scam': Dozens of customers allege car detailer took their vehicles and then held them to ransom By Freddy Pawle For Daily Mail Australia Published: 15:08 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 15:31 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail Alleged victims of a 'dodgy' car detailer have claimed their vehicles were held ransom for huge additional payments on works that never happened. The owner of Sam the Man Car Care, Sam Baravelli, 34, trusted to touch up the dream cars of of customers has instead been accused of using their vehicles as a way to extort them from more cash. Dozens of customers allege Mr Baravelli held their car for weeks longer than expected and charged exorbitant amounts - with some claiming they got them back in a worse state. Mr Baravelli was arrested by police last Tuesday after Consumer Affairs Victoria warned the public from taking their business to Sam the Man in January. Police towed away a dozen allegedly stolen vehicles from Baravelli's car shop in Footscray, inner-west Melbourne , before charging him with 33 counts each of car theft and obtaining property by deception. An allegedly dodgy car detailer, Sam Baravelli (pictured being arrested), has been accused of holding customers' cars to extort them of additional payments One of those allegedly affected by Bavarelli was 19-year-old apprentice mechanic, Josh Williams, who said his Nissan Skyline R34 was trashed by the car detailer. What was supposed to be a four week job quickly ballooned out to an almost two month project which wound up costing Mr Williams all of his savings, $17,194.50. After spending all of his money and still not getting his car back, Mr Williams took issues into his own hands and found the car at the business in a horrific condition. 'All of the paint protection has been taken off it, there's quite a few more scratches than were originally there,' he told A Current Affair. Read More Facebook Marketplace scam Australians need to know about 'My interior's absolutely trashed. There's stains everywhere. '(Baravelli) said there's more to be done, I told him I wouldn't pay for it ... If I stopped paying him, he wouldn't give me my car back. 'In a way I was being held ransom and my car was the bait.' Consumer Affairs Victoria director Nicole Rich warned the public of taking their business to Sam the Man after receiving over 70 complaints from members of the public. 'Not only were there breaches of consumer law, but there was also just potentially outright theft of vehicles occurring,' she said. 'We were very worried about Sam the Man Car Care based on the reports we were receiving from Victorian consumers about what was going on and I formed the view we needed to warn the public as a matter of urgency.' The watchdog's warning alleged Mr Barravelli made 'false or misleading representations as to the price of his services (and) increasing the initial quote'. '(Sam the Man allegedly) failed to carry out services within the agreed upon time or within a reasonable period of time and returned consumers' vehicles with further damage while the vehicle remained in Sam the Man's possession.' The warning also claimed that on three occasions, cars left with Sam the Man weren't returned to their owners. Apprentice mechanic, Josh Williams (pictured with his Nissan Skyline R34), claims Baravelli trashed his car despite paying him over $17,000 Police towed a dozen allegedly stolen vehicles from Baravelli's workshop (pictured), before charging him with 33 counts each of car theft and obtaining property by deception Victoria Police allege the scam was much broader and involved him holding 'onto customers' vehicles for unreasonably long periods and refused to return them until they paid a substantially higher fee than initially agreed'. '(Baravelli allegedly) requested payment for services he did not carry out, and also drove customers' cars for personal use'. Police will also allege he continued to take customer's cars and issue quotes after being evicted from the shop. However, Mr Baravelli said there was more to the story and that customers just didn't understand how he worked. 'I've tried to explain it as best I can because I feel like I owe the community a bit,' Baravelli told the program while being arrested. 'I never had the intention of taking anyone's car to do anything. 'All of the cars that are in there have had work done ... they've had work done on the road.' He has since been bailed and set to appear before the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on June 20. A woman from South Melbourne, 45, is also expected to be charged with theft of a motor vehicle and obtain property by deception. Police have urged anyone with information regarding the alleged scam to come forward as investigations remain ongoing.

Alexia Gallegos, from the US, is a mother of three, but it's the contents of her eldest child's school lunches that have been igniting controversy on Instagram. The mother, who insists that 'school lunches don't have to be cold and boring,' recently posted a video on her Instagram account, @lexymariee_, which features a detailed display of her lunch-packing routine. Posting the clip , Gallegos was seen preparing a freshly baked potato, topped with seasoned steak bites, shrimp, broccoli, grated cheese, and herbs, and wrote: 'Baked potato for the win.' A stay-at-home mother has faced backlash on social media after showcasing the elaborate school lunches she prepares for her nine-year-old daughter, including a loaded baked potato After neatly packing the main course into a circular pink Bentgo lunchbox, Gallegos added an array of snacks to her daughter's to-go bag. Read More I posted a photo of my kids' school lunchboxes but never expected such furious backlash over one tiny detail These included: a small container of pistachio nuts, a small container of Haribo Goldbear candy, a packet of chocolate-covered dried strawberries, a packed of sea-salt roasted seaweed and a packet of garden 'Veggie' straws. The mother then added extra snack items, such as two Ferrero Rocher chocolates, a Kinder Joy chocolate, a tub of jellied fruit, beef jerky, a gummy Pizza candy box and strawberry and cream Tic Tacs. To complete the meal, Gallegos included a Stanley flask filled with butterfly-shaped ice cubes and water, and a handwritten note that read: 'Hey beautiful, you are worth it ALWAYS! Keep being you! Love Mommy.' Despite Gallegos' display of motherly affection, over 54,000 Instagram users have expressed their shock and concern over the appropriateness of the lunch - with many criticizing the portion sizes and the nutritional value of the snacks. One person said: 'Sorry I feel bad saying it because you look so happy and made all with love... but this is so much food... also so much sugar for one day...' Another wrote: 'All the plastic waste... and wouldn't one kind of sweets be enough? No apple, no banana....'

A third said: 'Idk about anything else but that ice p****d me off she's not even gonna see the shape of the butterfly it's going to melt.' A teacher confirmed that the video is likely to be a truthful representation of the child's daily lunch, writing: 'I've seen lunches like this before. Kids take one or two bites of the main and then eat the packaged food. Pack less. They don't need it.' Meanwhile, an Instagram user claiming to be a school administrator, said: 'As a school administrator, we do not allow teachers to warm kids lunches up, so she's eating it cold the next day.'

        "content": "With the Kolkata Knight Riders lifting the trophy, star all-rounder Andre Russell said he feels excited over his contributions to the team's journey in the IPL and it's a special feeling. Kolkata defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL 2024 finals at the MA Chidambaram Stadium and registered the title to their name for the third time. ADVERTISEMENT Mitchell Starc, Andre Russell's exceptional spells and Venkatesh Iyer's gritty fifty helped KKR successfully chase the target in the IPL 2024 finals against SRH. Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head who showcased their explosive batting approach in most of the SRH's IPL 2024, got a taste of their own medicine in the finals. In a battle of two big buys, the Australian stars Cummins (Rs 20.5 crore for SRH) and Starc (Rs 24.75 crore for KKR), it was the latter who prevailed. \"When you're a part of this squad, not playing or not involved in the field, but supporting the guys all the way, it's always a good feeling, but this is a special feeling. In the XI, playing a part in the final, contributing as well through my leadership and everything, it's an exciting feeling. It's special,\" Russell said on Jio Cinema. The 36-year-old cricketer further spoke about his batting technique. \"It's just me not clearing my front leg too much, standing as still as possible, and waiting as long as possible. Normally, this is my trigger movement, clearing my left leg, so I tried to keep it as still as possible. So, if the bowler bowls wide, I push straight and I have access because I am standing on the off-stump,\" the West Indies all-rounder added. Earlier, SRH won the toss and elected to bat in the IPL 2024 finals. KKR rocked SRH with continuous wickets, with the big buy justifying his Rs 24.75 crore price tag. Only skipper Pat Cummins (24 in 19 balls, with two fours and a six) and Aiden Markram (20 in 23 balls, with three fours) touched the 20-run mark and SRH was bundled out for 113 in 18.3 overs. Andre Russell (3/19) was the top bowler for KKR. Starc (2/14) and Harshit Rana (2/24) also contributed well with the ball. Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy and Vaibhav Arora took a wicket each. KKR pulled off the run-chase of 114 runs in just 10.3 overs with eight wickets in hand, with Venkatesh Iyer (52* in 26 balls, with four boundaries and three sixes) and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (39 in 32 balls, with five fours and two sixes) shining for KKR.",

The landslide crashed through Yambali village in the country's north at around 3am on Friday while most of the community slept. Hundreds of houses were buried beneath debris almost two stories high as rescuers told local media they heard screams from beneath the earth. Initial reports put the estimated number of casualties at more than 670, but updated figures released by the government's National Disaster Centre this morning raised the shocking toll to more than 2,000. Delivering an official statement today, King Charles said: 'I have witnessed first-hand and have great admiration for the extraordinary resilience of the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands. I have faith that your communities will come together to support the survivors and the recovery in these heartbreaking circumstances. 'My wife joins me in sending our most heartfelt condolences to the families and communities who have suffered so much as a result of this appallingly traumatic event. Papua New Guinea is very much in our special thoughts and prayers.' People are seen digging at the site of a landslide at Mulitaka village in the region of Maip Mulitaka, in Enga Province, Papua New Guinea More than 2,000 people have been buried in a Papua New Guinea landslide that destroyed a remote highland village In this image supplied by the International Organization for Migration, villagers react after a body was discovered amongst the debris form a landslide in the village of Yambali in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea, Monday, May 27, 2024 This handout photo taken and received on May 27, 2024 from the International Organization for Migration shows locals digging at the site of a landslide at Mulitaka village in the region of Maip Mulitaka, in Enga Province, Papua New Guinea King Charles III sent his condolences to the people of Papua New Guinea following news of the landslide PNG's last credible census was in the year 2000 and many people live in isolated mountainous villages, meaning the exact toll will be extremely difficult to calculate More than 72 hours after the landslide residents are still using spades, sticks and their bare hands to try and shift the debris and reach any survivors PNG's last credible census was in the year 2000 and many people live in isolated mountainous villages, meaning the exact toll will be extremely difficult to calculate. But the remote location of the disaster and the treacherous terrain over which it occurred have impeded the delivery of aid and means the chances of rescue for any remaining survivors are very low.

'But I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.' More than 72 hours after the landslide residents are still using spades, sticks and their bare hands to try and shift the debris and reach any survivors. Heavy equipment and aid have been slow to arrive due to the remote location while tribal warfare nearby has forced aid workers to travel in convoys escorted by soldiers and return to the provincial capital, roughly 35 miles away, at night. The official statement from the Palace is pictured The government figure is roughly triple the U.N. estimate of 670 killed by the landslide in the South Pacific island nation's mountainous interior Relief workers gather around provisions to be distributed, in the aftermath of a landslide in Enga Province This picture shows a demolished house at the site of a landslide at Yambali Village Eight people were killed and 30 houses burnt down on Saturday, a U.N. agency official said. Aid convoys on Monday passed the still smoking remains of houses. The first excavator only reached the site late on Sunday, according to a U.N. official. Six bodies have been retrieved so far. Contact with other parts of the country is difficult due to patchy reception and limited electricity at the site. Many people aren't even sure where their loved ones were when the landslide hit because it's common for residents to stay at the homes of friends and relatives, according to Matthew Hewitt Tapus, a pastor based in Port Moresby whose home village is roughly 12 miles from the disaster zone. 'It's not like everyone is in the same house at the same time, so you have fathers who don't know where their children are, mothers who don't know where husbands are, it's chaotic,' he told Reuters by phone. Locals gather at the site of a landslide at Mulitaka village Locals and members of United Nations (UN) take part in search and rescue efforts, led by Papua New Guinea's Defense Force Prime Minister James Marape's office said the disaster was being handled by PNG emergency authorities and Marape was in the capital Port Moresby preparing for the return of parliament on Tuesday, where he faces a no-confidence motion. Even when rescue teams can get to the site, rain, unstable ground and flowing water is making it extremely dangerous for residents and rescue teams to clear debris, according to Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the U.N. migration agency's mission in PNG. There is still a risk the soil and debris could shift again and more than 250 homes have been abandoned as officials encourage people to evacuate, he said. More than 1,250 people have been displaced. Some local residents also don't want heavy machinery and excavators entering the village and interrupting the mourning, he said. 'At this point, people I think are realising that the chances are very slim, that anyone can basically be taken out alive,' he said. Australia's Defense Minister Richard Marles told the media that his office has been working with their Papua New Guinea counterparts since Friday's disaster. 'The exact nature of the support that we do provide will play out over the coming days. We've obviously (have) airlift capacity to get people there. There may be other equipment that we can bring to bear in terms of the search and rescue (and other matters)... that we are talking through with PNG right now,' he said. Papua New Guinea is a former Australian colony, achieving independence in 1975.

        "description": "Follow Windsor Star reporter Taylor Campbell’s live blog below for up-to-the-minute coverage of Windsor city council’s meeting on Monday, May 27, 2024. 10:03 a.m. — Ward 1 Coun. Fred Francis makes a motion to move a petition from residents of the Roseland neighbourhood and surrounding area to a future council meeting as a regular business item [...]",
        "content": "Article content Council adds 8.22. Sandwich Street Infrastructure Enhancement Heritage Permit to the consent agenda. Read the Star’s coverage of plans for the city to fund nearly $400,000 in improvements to Sandwich Street — improvements that go alongside upgrades being done by the Gordie Howe bridge team — . Council moves on to the consent agenda. Ward 4 Coun. Mark McKenzie and Ward 3 Coun. Renaldo Agostino declare conflicts of interest on Official Plan Amendment and Zoning By-law Amendment Applications for 835 Tecumseh Road East, 2148 Marentette Avenue, and 2175 Parent Avenue. Both men are members of the Giovanni Caboto Club, which is requesting the ZBA to build housing on the property. Read the Star’s coverage and . Francis asks when residents will be heard and when they can speak to these developments. Payne says it would be when the EOI process happens. No date has been set. Francis refers to a line in the report that indicates developers approach folks at city hall about building on city-owned properties. He wants to know how those conversations are disclosed. Payne explains: “Whenever developers come to us, what we typically do is we hear them out, we listen to what their what their ideas are. We provide guidance based on the expertise of various departments, but ultimately we always direct them back to our formal process which is either an RFP or an EOI process that is then open and transparent.” Francis asks if a developer spoke with anyone at city hall about developing the Roseland property before council decided to make it available for residential development. Payne says she is not aware of any such conversations. City CAO Joe Mancina says the same thing. Francis asks Ray Mensour, city commissioner of community service, when the results of the public survey about development on the Roseland property will come back to council. Mensour says it will come back in a report about the EOI for that property. The survey results will inform the EOI, Mensour says. Francis has questions on the Housing Solutions Made for Windsor. He asks any residents in the gallery who are present because of the Roseland petition to raise their hands. At least two dozen people put their hands up. Francis asks about the public consultation process. Residents want their voices heard. Francis notes that the council majority voted to build housing on these city-owned properties without hearing from the public first. Jelena Payne, the city’s commissioner of economic development, explains that the expression of interest process will allow the city to gather ideas/vision from developers. Once the city has architectural renderings from developers, “viable concepts related to residential developments,” they will be brought to council for “further refinement.” The process can take years, Payne says. “We want to make sure we do our due diligence. We want to make sure we consult the public throughout the process. We have multiple touch points with council throughout the process to, ultimately, hopefully, get the best development possible for the community.” Francis says he thinks the public should have been engaged before council made its decision to move forward with any residential development on city-owned land. This elicits a short round of applause from residents in the audience. Administration says there will be opportunities for public consultation as the process progresses for each lot individually. The report is about issuing requests for expressions of interest (EOI) from developers interested in building housing on several city properties. Check out the Star’s coverage of city council’s decision to build housing on five city-owned properties . Ward 1 Coun. Fred Francis makes a motion to move a petition from residents of the Roseland neighbourhood and surrounding area to a future council meeting as a regular business item so residents can delegate. City clerk Steve Vlachodimos says Francis cannot do that, procedurally, because he voted against the related item about building a luxury condo on Roseland Golf and Curling Club property. A councillor who voted in favour of that item could reopen that debate, Vlachodimos says, but Francis cannot. It would technically be a “motion to reconsider.” Today’s city council meeting has begun.

        "content": "In a landmark announcement, the Government of Ghana unveiled a strategic partnership with seven industry leaders to introduce affordable 5G mobile broadband services nationwide. However, notably absent from this collaboration is MTN Ghana, the country’s leading telecommunications provider. The seven partners comprising Ascend Digital, K-NET, Radisys, Nokia, and Tech Mahindra, along with telcos AT Ghana and Telecel Ghana, have joined forces to establish the Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC). NGIC, equipped with a 5G license, aims to launch 5G services across Ghana within the next six months, marking a significant milestone in the nation’s digital advancement. The partnership envisions enhancing the lives of Ghanaians by introducing digital services in education, healthcare, and digital payment transactions, thereby bridging the digital divide and promoting financial inclusion. Additionally, NGIC plans to adopt India’s successful model of affordable handsets, digital platforms, and localized content to replicate high-speed mobile data access across Africa. MTN’s absence from this initiative has sparked questions, given its substantial market share in Ghana’s telecommunications sector. Despite MTN’s previous announcement of readiness to roll out 5G services, regulatory constraints prevented its implementation, raising concerns about market imbalances. While MTN Ghana is reportedly engaged in separate discussions with the government regarding its 5G strategy, the exclusion from the shared infrastructure arrangement signifies a significant development in Ghana’s telecommunications landscape. Nevertheless, MTN’s existing national roaming arrangements with Telecel Ghana and AT Ghana ensure continued service provision to its customers. The move towards shared infrastructure aligns with broader discussions around digital public infrastructure (DPI) and the imperative of collaboration to drive accelerated development in Africa. Therefore, it is anticipated that MTN will eventually join the shared 5G infrastructure initiative to facilitate concerted development efforts.",

        "content": "KISUMU, Kenya May 27 – Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o has raised concerns that devolution is under threat from the Kenya Kwanza administration. As the lands, housing, and urban development committee chairperson for the Council of Governors (CoG), Nyong’o claims the National Government is determined to undermine devolution. Speaking in Kisumu on Monday during the official opening of a national dialogue on urban development, Nyong’o called on the government to gazette all transferred functions and the resources aligned to them. He criticized the involvement of road authorities in county projects without consulting county executives, arguing it goes against the spirit of devolution. “Those authorities coming to build the roads are completely contrary to the spirit of devolution,” Nyong’o stated. Nyong’o emphasized that the gains made in devolution are being eroded under the current administration. He urged the national government to stop actions that threaten devolution, asserting that funds must follow functions in the counties. He warned that continued centralization of county functions would lead to inefficiencies and economic waste. “Our clarion call is, we must defend devolution,” he declared. “If the threat to devolution mounted by the current regime continues, then Kenyans are bound to lose a lot in terms of service delivery.” The national dialogue forum, which brought together city and municipal managers, focused on building thriving cities and municipalities in the country. Nyong’o highlighted the need to review the Urban Areas and Cities Act, 2011, and discussed the importance of the Affordable Housing Act and the role of city and municipal boards in implementing the housing agenda. “Cities and urban areas are engines of growth and innovation, but they also face complex challenges,” Nyong’o noted. He concluded that the forum presents an excellent opportunity to address critical emerging issues in the urban sector and to ensure that devolution remains intact for the benefit of all Kenyans.

During a discussion on the ABC’s Q&A program, the panel was asked whether Australia should consider leaving bodies like the ICC and UN when decisions that do not favour us are made. But Ukrainian journalist Alisa Sopova advised caution on the matter. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. “Australians should think about what company they want to be in if they pull out because 99 per cent of countries that pull out of the ICC are the countries who committed war crimes and they have something to be prosecuted for,” she said. The Guardian’s world affairs editor Julian Borger also disagreed with the suggestion. “I think if you support international legal institutions only when they don’t go after your friends and your political allies then maybe you don’t believe in the rule of law,” he said. “I just think if you try and figure out what advances we’ve made as humanity since the Holocaust, since slavery, since colonialism, I would point to the UN charter and the aspirations in that, and I would point to the ICC and this idea that we as humanity will not put up with certain crimes. “They are crimes against humanity. This is something that protects us all. “It may be a kind of rickety, underfunded, frail protection, but it is all we’ve got. “I think if you’re prepared to give that up for political advantage, for your political allies, then I think that’s just the height of short-sightedness.” Asked whether the ICC prosecutor’s decision to announce the arrest warrants together for two Israeli leaders and the three Hamas leaders put them on a level playing field and was optically a problem, Mr Borger said that was his job. “His mandate is to look at the crimes committed on a certain territory, by all parties — that’s literally his mandate,” he said. “They’re not accused of the same things. There’s some overlap.” Maher Mughrabi, from The Age, said the term “moral equivalence” was an insult to people’s intelligence. “I think if you had on the same docket, on the same day, a person who was a career criminal and a person who was being charged for the first time, the person who is being charged for the first time and the career criminal are not morally equivalent,” he said. “The only equivalence that they have is that they’re both subject to the rule of law. “I think what really outrages the US and Israel about this decision is that for the first time Israel has to be accountable to someone other than itself.” Human rights advocate Deborah Cheetham Fraillon added: “It would be so convenient for Australia to opt-out and there will be a day of reckoning here for the crimes committed against First Nations people.” Mr Mughrabi was also critical of Mr Dutton for saying there was peace on October 6 before Hamas attacked Israel. “On one level, that’s palpable nonsense,” he said. “The fact is that 2023 on the West Bank, which is not the place that’s being bombarded now, was the most violent year since 2005. “Hundreds of Palestinians were killed, 80 children were killed on the West Bank in 2023. There was no peace on October 6. “On the crude level ... Hamas understood, for better or worse, what would create a disturbance, what would disturb the surface and that was the deaths of large numbers of Israelis, and so that’s what they did. “They did something that couldn’t be ignored because the deaths of Israelis count and the deaths of Arabs don’t count.” Mr Mughrabi said Hamas was willing to fight and kill people to make their point. “I hear people here say all lives matter and I hear people say they cringe and recoil when they see the violence of the Israeli state ... but I have to say, I don’t hear anybody who is willing to stand up and fight for the Palestinians,” he said. “I don’t hear anybody who is willing to put their political or their economic credentials on the line to save Palestinians lives. “If you leave a vacuum where you’re not fighting for the Palestinians, yes, Hamas is going to fill that vacuum every single day of the week. That’s the tragedy. “The tragedy is that you have left the field as an international community to Hamas. If you don’t want Hamas in the centre of the field, take the centre of the field. Fight for the Palestinians.” Ms Sopova agreed, adding people were still conflating Hamas and Palestinian civilians. “I think if we are still not distinguishing between Hamas and Palestinian civilians, and also between the state of Israel and Jewish people elsewhere, and then every criticism of the Jewish state suddenly becomes anti-Semitism as if you forget that there are so many Jewish people, including myself, who do not support what the state of Israel is doing,” she said. “If we are still committing so easily this very simple, illogical mistake, I don’t know if the narrative has really improved.”",

        "content": "THE sun has set on another series of TOWIE and there is no love lost between Ella Rae Wise, and the cast of ‘girlband’ who’ve been locked in a bitter feud ever since. But now that the show’s over, the 24-year-old has wasted no time saying what she really thinks about her love rival, Amber Turner and her group of friendS dubbed girlband, including, Courtney Green and Chloe Meadows. During an Instagram Q&A, Ella was asked what she thinks of her TOWIE co-stars, to which she replied: “All I will say is that they think they’re bloody perfect, but the sun doesn’t shine out of their arses trust me.” The reality star-turned fashion entrepreneur also confirmed that she’d split from Dan Edgar, after their fling had ignited her feud with his ex girlfriend of six years, Amber Turner, 30. In the same interview she answered the question about her relationship status by saying: “I am happily single and focusing on myself and my brand.” In recent weeks Ella Rae has launched her own online fashion brand Bermee, offering women of all ages, accessible glamour. But the birth of her new brand and her success on this season of ITVBE's TOWIE, has been overshadowed by the toxic atmosphere that followed her fling with Dan Edgar, 34. Romance blossomed between the pair during the cast trip to Bali, but Dan had not long broken up from his girlfriend of six years Amber Turner. The petite blonde's relationship with Dan Edgar has divided the cast, coming as it did on the tag end of his break up with Amber Turner, with whom he’d been in a relationship for six years. During the Bali trip, the pair found their chemistry was undeniable and they got together. But back in Blighty the knives were out, with various members of so called girlband- Amber, Dan’s Ex, Chloe Meadows and Courtney Green, making digs as their relationship blossomed onscreen. But then it transpired that Dan had been two-timing Ella Rae, after he hooked up with Hannah Rally Dan was first spotted with Hannah just weeks after he and Amber Turner ended their six-year relationship in 2023. A source told The Sun: \"Dan was dating Hannah for around nine months, they got together shortly after he split from Amber. Two weeks ago, The Sun revealed how Ella , 24, was left furious after finding out Dan , 34, had hooked up with Hannah Rally while she was away in Dubai. The reality star shared a cryptic quote on social media which seems to suggest that she is moving on with her life following the breakdown of her last relationship. The quote read: “Her plans: Private. Her moves: Silent. Her life: Lowkey. She's a peace.\" But then Hannah has since taken a brutal swipe at Ella after reposting a quote that read: \"Your man was in my DMs again sis.\" Hannah added: \"More than DM's but now you can get out of mine love.\" Dan confirmed that he's single amid the cheating scandal. A rep for Dan told The Sun: \"There is no issue between Dan and Ella, they both speak regularly, but are very much still single.\"",

        "content": "Mysore/Mysuru : Following reports of a memorial being constructed for elephant Arjuna , social media has been rife with allegations that lakhs of rupees were deposited into the private account of H.N. Naveen, a social media influencer, under the pretext of funding the memorial. People have alleged that funds were misappropriated even before the memorial’s construction began. A WhatsApp group named ‘Arjuna Pade’ was created to solicit money for the memorial. Many donations were made, with cash being deposited into Naveen’s personal Bank account, according to the allegations. Sagar Janekere, President of the Malenadu Rakshana Vedike, has complained to the Forest Department in Sakleshpur, seeking action against Naveen. He has urged people not to donate money to the memorial and called for Government intervention to seize the collected funds. ‘Allegations unfounded’ Refuting the accusations, Naveen informed Star of Mysore this morning that while he indeed initiated a WhatsApp group to gather funds for establishing a permanent memorial for Arjuna, the allegations of misappropriation are unfounded. “We began accepting contributions from May 1 and till date, we have collected over Rs. 80,000,” he stated. “We procured black granite stones from Bengaluru, which amounted to over Rs. 50,000, including transportation costs. However, we only accepted Rs. 30,000 from the Forest Department, which covers the actual expense of the granite.” “Due to the Forest Department’s denial of permission to construct a permanent memorial, which would have included granite slabs and a statue of Arjuna, we have decided to drop the project,” Naveen clarified. “All financial transactions have been conducted transparently and I will provide a detailed statement to the media at a press conference tomorrow. Any surplus funds that have not been utilised will be refunded to the donors, as we have a record of all online transactions,” he said. Dasara Elephant Arjuna Sakleshpur",

        "content": "King Charles is reportedly prioritising his royal duties over the drama surrounding his broken relationship with his son, Prince Harry. It is pertinent to mention that the Duke of Sussex recently visited the UK to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. It was highly expected that Harry would meet his cancer-stricken father during his trip. However, the father-son duo did not meet due to the Monarch's 'busy schedule.' Now, Sunday Times royal editor Roya Nikkhah shared on the podcast The Royals with Roya and Kate that \"the narrative from the moment he [Harry] touched down and we got that statement from Harry's spokesperson saying it's not possible for Harry to see his father, his father is too busy, he completely understands.\" \"And that turned everything on its head because the narrative from Harry that I wanted to see my father but he is too busy to see me, actually the reality was Charles said yes please do come and stay in a royal gaff and that would make it much easier for me to see each other,\" Roya shared. Moreover, a close royal family friend now told The Daily Beast , claiming that the Monarch has shifted his focus from Harry and Meghan Markle's strained relationship to his official engagements. The source shared, \"Relations are as bad as they have ever been. Nothing has been resolved. But Charles does not spend a great deal of time dwelling on the matter because he is so busy.\"",

Callendar Park's high flats have about 1000 residents and many say they have witnessed \"drug-dealing, intimidation and other anti-social behaviour on a day to day basis\". In recent weeks, members of Falkirk District Action Group (FDAG) have been so concerned by the reports of anti-social behaviour they are handing out personal alarms. Read more: New distillery near 'Outlander' castle will be 'good for Falkirk and Scotland' These alarms have been donated by well wishers after a plea from the action group in a bid to help the worried residents feel safer. But FDAG founder, Sharron McKean - whose mum lives in the flats - says more needs to be done and she is keen to work with the council to improve the situation. The high flats were once reserved by Falkirk Council for the over-60s and there was a waiting list of people keen to become part of a tight-knit, supportive community. But changes to legislation and a high demand for housing saw the age limit lowered to 50 - which is when many long-term residents say the problems began. The ongoing issues are making many of the elderly residents feel incredibly vulnerable - and many say it will only get worse as more and more people leave the flats for good. The Local Democracy Reporting Service has spoken to several residents who do not want to be named but have confirmed how bad the problems are. One resident said they could tell me which flats are occupied by drug dealers; others have seen people lying unconscious on the stairwell; and some have seen people urinating and defecating in lifts and other communal area. Many say they hear people buzzing the intercom or banging on doors \"all day and night\". Sharron said: \"It's not just the people who live here - it's the entourage they bring. They bring their pals and they cause havoc - they don't realise the damage they are doing.\" The action group is now circulating a letter around residents which makes clear many of them are becoming anxious about leaving their flats, even during the day. Falkirk District Action Group (FDAG) say copies of the letter have now been signed by more than 250 residents, with more to come. Eleanor Paterson, who lives in one of the towers, has been helping gather signatures. She said: \"We shouldn't have to live like this. We know the world is changing - there's probaly not a street without the same problem - but this is like our own wee village and it's worrying us.\" For months now, Sharron has been visiting the tower blocks every week, talking to residents. When she advertised a 'surgery' to talk about individual issues, she says the communal area of one tower was packed with people keen to tell her their experiences. Sharron arranged a meeting including officials from Falkirk Council's housing and Police Scotland. It was also attended by Sandy Ballingal from one of the park's residents groups who is keen to get more involved in tackling the issue. At the meeting, Sharron was pleased with the response from both the council and said the Community Policing team have been \"fantastic\". Sharron says she will now work with the council's Conflict Resolution Team, not just to highlight the problem but also to try to find solutions. She recognises trust is wearing thin between residents and the local authority and she hopes she can help to rebuild it. Sharron says she will continue to support residents who want to report incidents but feel unable to, working with the council and residents' groups to find answers. She said: \"The council is saying that it is vital that people report issues and incidents - but elderly people don't always find that easy. \"We need to help them and make sure they can report issues so that something can be done. The action group recognises that it's a complex issue and there are no easy solutions. They also recognise much of the work the council does is necessarily 'behind the scenes' and confidential - and no public services, including the police, have the resources they once had and are very stretched. Councillor Euan Stainbank, who also attended the meeting, said it was very productive and he is hopeful better partnership working will begin to make a real difference to finding solutions to \"complex, wide-ranging problems\". The councillor, who is also the Labour candidate for Westminster in the forthcoming election, said: \"Communication is key and FDAG have been fantastic at bringing people together.\" A spokesperson for Falkirk Council said: “We are committed to working together with our partners, such as Police Scotland, and the tenants and residents to find ways that help them to report concerns to us and take action to help people feel safe and enjoy their homes.” To date this has included: For more Falkirk stories, sign up to our newsletter here .",

And it could see plans for an attempt to replace the Champions League with a new tournament as soon as the 2025-26 season. Madrid’s Commercial Court found Uefa and Fifa were guilty of “abusing their dominant position” in their attempts to strangle the rebel competition at birth in 2021. Judge Sofia Gil Garcia was asked to make a final ruling following the verdict of the European Court of Justice in December. The ECJ found that Uefa and Fifa had acted “unlawfully” when it threatened to punish the breakaway rebels and sanction any players who took part in the competition. That decision was confirmed by the Spanish court, preventing the European and world governing bodies from taking steps to prevent the establishment of a new competition. It will embolden Real Madrid and Barcelona, who are banking on Super League as the way to generate hugely greater revenues than offered by the Champions League. But Prem clubs and their German counterparts have already given public declarations that they will not be part of any such plot , with similar regulations now being discussed by Italy’s Serie A. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, City, United and Spurs were badly bruised by the massive fan backlash at their initial decision to jump aboard the Super League train in 2021. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Prem clubs agreed unanimously to new rules meaning they must give three years’ notice before joining any breakaway competition, or be deducted 30 points and hit be swingeing financial penalties.

Super League and their PR arm, Madrid-based A22, were delighted with the verdict, with one senior figure claiming the ruling had detonated a “bomb” under Uefa. While a launch in just 15 months may not be possible, Super League chiefs are not dismissing that they could be able to aim for that start date, after unveiling a revised version of the plans in December. Under the latest plans, 64 clubs will be split into three divisions, with the top tier “Star” league having 16 clubs in two groups of eight, playing 14 games in the initial phase before the top four in each of them going to a quarter-final stage. Super League insists its scheme will allow for some promotion and relegation but admit that “historical” criteria would apply to the initial entry list and that domestic performances in the previous season would not directly determine access.

        "content": "A WOMAN has shared how you can make your very own ‘busy box’, to ensure that your little darlings stay entertained this half term. So if you are worried about how to keep your kids busy this week, then don’t worry, you’ve come to the right place. And fear not, you won’t need to go out and splash the cash on pricey toys or books , as with this ‘busy box’, your little ones will have things to do without needing to leave the house , and it’s perfect for those on a budget . A mother named Nini took to social media to show off the items she puts in her child’s ‘busy box’, leaving many open-mouthed. The savvy mum posted her clip online and said: “With a new baby on the way, and the fact that Archie is not needing as long to nap anymore, I thought this little box might be an effective way to switch up entertainment and keep him busy for a while. “I'm hoping to get a \"quiet time\" into our routine once the naps have stopped, where he goes to do some nice , quiet, independent play. \"Hoping\" being the key word. “Obviously, you can do these using normal toys, but we love getting creative, and I also really like the idea of sharing budget friendly ideas as I know that toys can be expensive. “I hope this helps! But please remember, they are not necessary for healthy growth and development. Simple toys work just as well.” In the short video, Nini shared a variety of different DIY toys, games and activities that parents can make, to ensure that their children will be kept busy when off school. The first one used a piece of Lego Duplo and some stickers, creating a fun and simple ‘dot match’ game, whereby kids have to twist the Lego to match the coloured stickers. As well as this, Nini made a fun game using two items you probably already have at home - pasta and string. To make her pasta threading game, Nini simply added pieces of penne and a thread of string into a bag, creating a fun, looping game. In addition to this, Nini cut up pieces of velcro and added them to a bag alongside some wooden sticks, which can then be used to make shapes. Nini also made a shape shadow match game, whereby she got a collection of her son’s wooden shapes and drew around them on a piece of paper. The mother then added the piece of paper, alongside the shapes, into a bag, for a simple pairing activity game. 1) HOLD A SWAP SHOP: Invite friends round for a play date then arrange a week-long toy exchange, so everyone gets to keep something new until the hols end. 2) EAT OUT FOR FREE: Many big names, including Asda , Dunelm and Future Inns, are offering “kids eat free” or £1 meal deals. See netmums.com. 3) ENJOY A TRIP FOR LESS: Take advantage of National Rail ’s Days Out 2 For 1 deal, with up to half-price entry at top attractions, hotels and theatres around the UK. See daysoutguide.co.uk 4) BECOME BUDDING ENTREPRENEURS: Ask your children to clear out any unwanted clothes, toys and books , then hold a yard sale or list the items online. Give them any profits as pocket money . 5) CHECK OUT YOUR COUNCIL: Most local authorities put on free or low-cost activities, from arts, crafts and cooking classes to sports clubs. Visit your local council website for details. 6) HAVE AN EAT-UP WEEK: Make a list of what food you have and ask the kids to help you prepare meals from whatever is there, only buying in fresh ingredients. 7) USE FAMILY VOUCHERS: Seek out special half-term discounts on Groupon , Vouchercloud and vouchercodes.co.uk. Another easy game that Nini created used another two items that you will probably already have indoors - a wooden tube (from your kitchen roll) and a pack of colourful hairbands. For her ‘colour sort tube’, Nini drew rings around the tube in colourful pens corresponding to the hairbands. Her son could then use the hairbands to place over the rings, for a fun pairing game. Once all of the activities were made, Nini added each of her DIY games into separate ziplock bags, and put them into a plastic box. As well as this, she also added a selection of sensory tiles and books into the box, to ensure that her little one has enough to keep himself entertained. Nini later added: “Although play with everyday objects has been widely recognised as very beneficial for children - they do need close monitoring. Please decide for yourself what you feel comfortable and appropriate, and what you feel is a potential hazard.” The TikTok clip, which was posted under the username @early.explorer , has clearly left many open-mouthed, as it has quickly gone viral and has since racked up a whopping 1.5 million views. These are genius! Parents were stunned at the busy box activities and many were keen to praise Nini for her creativity in the comments. One person said: “As a preschool teacher, I love how easy to make and simple these activities are! Yet, so enriching!” I’m going to try with my toddler Another added: “This is so good for in the car for holiday !! Amazing, thank you.” A third commented: “Great ideas!!” Whilst one mother shared: “Oh my goodness these are genius! I especially love the Duplo one.” Meanwhile, one mother beamed: “I’m going to try with my toddler.” Fabulous will pay for your exclusive stories.

        "content": "RAPPER Travis Scott enjoyed a day out with his daughter, Stormi Webster, on Sunday. The music superstar has not been seen in public since his public bust-up with Kylie Jenner 's ex, Tyga , after the pair were captured in a brawl. Travis sat next to his daughter at the Monaco Grand Prix as they enjoyed some bonding time. The father of two showed his 6-year-old daughter how to use a rubix cube as they watched the Formula One race. Stormi dressed casually for the outing in a white tank top and a huge pair of headphones to protect her ears from the noisy track. Travis donned a red tank top which he covered with a faded brown jacket. The star also wore a brown baseball cap and a designer bag over his shoulder. Travis shares his daughter and son, Aire , with his ex-girlfriend, Kylie. The pair shared a relationship since 2017 after meeting at Coachella and welcomed Stormi less than one year later. The couple called it quits in 2023, just one year after their son was born. Kylie has since been romantically linked to Timothee Chalamet , but the pair haven't been spotted together for months. Travis has been keeping a low profile since he was involved in a physical altercation with Tyga. The fight took place in a swanky club in Cannes during the iconic film festival. The video shows several people, including Travis and Tyga, piling into the fight, which began behind a DJ booth at a party hosted by promoter Richie Akiva and nearly spilled out into the crowd. Before the altercation, rapper Richie Akiva grabbed the microphone at his party and gave props to both Travis and Tyga. \"We got T-Raww, AE, and Travis in the building,\" he said, referring to Tyga's nickname. TMZ reported that Travis didn't like being lumped in with Tyga, so he snatched the microphone out of Richie's hand. A source told the outlet that Travis then threatened Tyga's security, asking them if they \"wanted to die\" before storming off the stage. Alexander \"AE\" Edwards, Cher 's boyfriend, was also there and told Travis, “Let him show love,\" according to a source for Page Six . Kylie Jenner is the youngest of Kris Jenner‘s children.

The 39-year-old had arrived at Pittsburgh International Airport Friday earlier in the day, hugging his kids and wife in an emotional reunion. It was the first time he'd seen them since his overseas arrest in February, for stray bullets found in a suitcase. The father of two from Pennsylvania was spared a lengthy prison sentence after paying a fine and pleading guilty, as four other Americans remained detained and charged on the same charges. Hagerich, a former professional ball player once drafted by the Marlins, is the first to be returned to the US. He was released from custody on a 12-month suspended sentence, while the four others await sentencing. He called his experience at an unspecified facility in the Caribbean country the 'hardest... of [his] life', before shedding more light on his ordeal. Scroll down for video: Bryan Hagerich - a 39-year-old former baseball player who was arrested in Turks and Caicos earlier this year - spoke to reporters outside Pittsburgh International Airport Friday after reuniting with family. He is seen being interviewed here with his wife, Ashley The former Miami Marlins draftee called his experience at an unspecified detention facility the 'hardest... of [his] life', expressing relief at being back home. The dad of two from Pennsylvania was caught with ammo in his baggage, but was spared a prison sentence after paying a fine The Walt Disney Company Privacy Policy 'The weight of the world has been lifted off my shoulders,' Hagerich told reporters at the airport after reuniting with family. 'I'm so thankful to be home here with my family and friends but we still have three other Americans in Turks and Caicos,' Hagerich said, in reference to one of the offenders - able to return to the US due to medical reasons. 'It was tough, the darkest days of my life,' he continued of his arrest. 'You think you're on this beautiful island but there's nothing beautiful about it when you don't have your family.' When asked if he would visit again, he joked, 'I think we'll be looking for somewhere else.' Earlier in the day, a judge sentenced Hagerich to a suspended 52-week sentence with a fine of $6,700 for possessing guns and ammunition, under a strict statute aimed at addressing rising gang violence in the Caribbean nation. He faced a minimum of 12 years - a fate that could still await the four others. Before that, he was being kept at a facility in Turks and Caicos - a more than two-month ordeal he called the 'hardest time of my life.' 'As a father, as a provider, and to not be that figure in my family's life, it's a very tough pill to swallow,' Hagerich said outside the airport. He is one of five Americans arrested for such offenses in the county, which has strict gun laws. The other detained Americans are Ryan Watson, 40, of Oklahoma; Sharitta Grier, 45, of Florida; Tyler Wenrich, 31, of Virginia; and Michael Lee Evans, 72, of Texas. All face a minimum of 12 years in a Caribbean prison if found guilty He had faced a minimum of 12 years - a fate that could still await the four others. Before that, he was being kept at a facility in Turks and Caicos - a more than two-month ordeal he called the 'darkest' of his life After agreeing to plead guilty, he received a suspended 52-week sentence and a $6,700 fine - allowing him to be reunited his children, Caroline, 6, and Palmer, 4, his wife, and Gisele Fetterman and husband John Fetterman, and fellow state rep Guy Reschenthaler Video footage captured the heartwarming moment Hagerich, 39, arrived at the airport and immediately hugged his kids and wife, seeing them for the first time since his arrest 'Its just amazing how, just in the matter of 12 hours, looking at 12 years to now. My biggest concern is coaching my kids' baseball games tomorrow, and that is such a relief.' He added how the conditions of his detention were 'tough', calling them the 'darkest days' of his life. Not offering more detail, he said he was thankful to be home, and stressed that other Americans are still stuck on the islands. However, remaining positive, he said they 'will be home soon.' The other detained Americans are Ryan Watson, 40, of Oklahoma; Sharitta Grier, 45, of Florida; Tyler Wenrich, 31, of Virginia; and Michael Lee Evans, 72, of Texas - all of whom have been arrested within the past few months. Their arrests come as part of crack down on firearms and weapons within the country after implementing harsher gun laws in 2022, emphasized in September 203 with a national alert. Wenrich, Watson, and Grier all remain trapped on the island, while Evans was bailed and allowed to fly back to the US as he has a serious medical condition. All were charged with possession of firearms for loose bullets allegedly found in their luggage, and all claim they didn't know they were there. Arguments in defense have ranged that they could have been left there after hunting trips or simply by mistake, with Hagerich the only one among them to plead guilty. Hagerich - seen here Friday with his son - was the only to secure such a deal with a judge, after pleading guilty to possession of firearms When asked why he owned up to his guilt, he told ABC News in an interview alongside his wife Ashley earlier this month. 'I'm a man of integrity, character. I did not have intent in this' After his sentencing Friday and time served, a Turks and Caicos Islands' premier said that 'justice has been served as the law intended.' In response, Hagerich said at least officials have 'set some precedent' with his sentencing He thus was the only to secure such a deal with a judge, issued a suspended 52-month sentence Friday that was suspended for 12 months, essentially erasing the sentence. Upon paying his fine, he was given his passport and returned to the United States without issue - something he said 'absolutely elated' him.

READ MORE: Nudist resort owner reveals the do's and don'ts of holidaying naked By Jessica Hamilton Published: 15:02, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 15:04, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments If it's your naked ambition to get married in the nude, then this Italian destination wants to hear from you. Italian authorities announced plans for Is Benas Beach, a designated naturist area located on Sardinia's southwest coast, to become a destination for nudist weddings. Luigi Tedeschi, the mayor of the nearby town San Vero Milis, said the four-mile beach had been a popular nudist hotspot for years. After it officially opened as a nudist beach in 2022, he claimed naturist weddings were the next logical step. Tedeschi, who is credited with having the idea to designate part of the beach nudist, said authorities decided to open it up to nude weddings when a German couple wrote to ask whether it would be possible to marry on the beach in their birthday suits. Naturist couples will soon be able to get married in the buff on Is Benas Beach (pictured) in Sardinia. The four-mile beach has been a nudist hotspot for years He told CNN : 'Nudity has nothing to do with sex. For [naturists] it's a philosophy of life, and is linked to nature.' 'It should be respected - so why not? We have this beach, a place that lends itself brilliantly to naturism. And then we thought, let's make a beach for weddings. If people want to marry nude, they can.' He added: 'If anyone has a problem, they can walk on past or look at the sea.' CNN, however, reported that out of the 2,500 residents in the nearby town, there have been no complaints.

While there were reports that brides would still have to wear veils, Tedeschi confirmed: 'People can wear what they want.' The mayor said the aim of hosting nudist weddings at the beach is part of a greater initiative to provide more nudist spaces on the Italian island. He hopes it will attract a 'respectful' kind of tourism, unlike the clothed areas of the beaches, which he said are often left covered in rubbish. The proposal was backed by Gabriele Rosetti, head of the Italian Federation of Naturists, according to The Times . 'This is a first for Italy and we are totally here for it,' he said. According to the website, Rossetti said Italy was ready for nudist beach weddings, but claimed that other European nations were far ahead of Italy when it came to naturist culture. 'I had a house guest from Holland who came to breakfast naked,' he said. 'We don’t all do that.' Italy CNN Share or comment on this article: Want to get married naked?

        "content": "Protecting endangered species in Africa is crucial for maintaining bio-diversity and preserving the delicate balance of eco-systems. Africa is known for iconic species such as African elephants, black rhinos, gravy zebra and lions. In Kenya, these animals over the centuries have encountered numerous threats, including poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflicts. But recently, owing to stringent laws protecting them, wildlife populations have increased significantly. During this year’s wildlife environment day event, Lewa conservancy programs and partnership coordinator Mr John Kinoti confirmed wildlife populations have increased due to the measures put in place to protect them. He attributed the positive trajectory to a combination of research, cut-edge technology and community engagement. Meru sits intact in undiluted natural beauty, hosting wildlife species including elephants, gravy zebra and black and white rhinos. Mr. Kinoti noted that the rhino sanctuary at the conservancy offers one of the best rhinos viewing experiences in the world. “The sanctuary has twenty-four-hour surveillance by officers put in-charge to monitor the well-being of the rhinos.” “Through this effort and dedication, the rhino’s population is thriving and has increased by 38 percent over a five-year period,” he said. Additionally, Mr. Kinoti said that efforts to save more endangered wildlife species are also gaining momentum. “Through the five-year period, measures to protect the animals have been adhered to. The elephant population has increased and so far, Lewa hosts over 400 migratory elephants,” he noted. Mr Kinoti notified members of the public that the conservancy has monitored elephant numbers and poaching incidences and through this analysis they reduced resource-based conflicts resulting in a 12 percent increase in the elephant population, across Northern Kenya over the last five years. “The Lewa -Borana landscape is home to 11 percent of global population of the gravy zebra. Lewa wildlife conservancy works with communities who live in close-quarters with these critical endangered species to ensure that they have good pasture and are not poached. Safeguarding these endangered species and the eco-system they inhabit has yielded good numbers of the gravy zebra over the last four years,” the coordinator added. “Other endangered species are the large carnivores (lions, cheetahs, hyenas and leopards) and 488 registered birds. Through collaboration with neighboring communities to prevent these species from extinction, Kinoti added, their numbers have increased rapidly.",

        "content": "The establishment of a maternity wing at South Ngariama Health Center, in Mwea, Kirinyaga County has turned out to be one of the most impactful projects implemented by the County Government in the recent past. Commissioned in October 2023 by Governor Anne Waiguru, it has become a haven for expectant mothers who now have a conducive environment to deliver their babies under the care of skilled birth attendants. Provision of skilled care at birth is considered the single most important strategy in preventing neonatal morbidity and mortality thus contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals on health. South Ngariama health facility that is situated in the far flung Mwea East Sub-County, serves a population of 7,000 residents drawn from villages such as Morgan, Ikulungu, Itangi, Kadawa, Miatuini, Makuti and Kiumbu. Before its establishment, residents used to travel long distances to seek services in hospitals such as Gathigiriri, Kimbimbi and Murinduko, almost 10 kilometers away. Five Months after the maternity wing was opened, over 60 successful deliveries have been conducted there. About 250 women have sought antenatal clinic services, representing a substantial rise from the previous year’s attendance of 229 women. Postnatal clinic attendance has also risen to 359 mothers, compared to a mere 107 in 2022. Additionally, 658 women have accessed family planning services at the facility. Governor Anne Waiguru has hailed the maternity ward as a game-changer for mothers emphasizing the importance of providing accessible and affordable maternal and neonatal services as a way of preventing home births and reducing mortality rates. “The South Ngariama Maternity wing offers comprehensive services, including antenatal, postnatal, and mother and child health services. Our specialists ensure continuous care for both mothers and children up to five years after delivery,” stated Governor Waiguru. Evelyn Kahare, the Nurse-in-charge noted a marked increase in patient numbers since the maternity wing was launched compared to the previous year, attributing this surge to heightened awareness of the services offered by the facility. She emphasized the importance of the maternity wing in averting potential home births. “Mothers used to journey from South Ngariama to distant locations like Kiumbu, Murinduko, Gathigiriri, or Kimbimbi. The 51 deliveries we’ve conducted would most likely have ended up as home births were it not for this facility. We aspire to achieve zero home deliveries as Governor Anne Waiguru has empowered us with specialists and skilled personnel to serve the community,” she noted. The success story of this project cannot be told without the mention of Community Health Promoters (CHPs). They play a critical role in provision of primary healthcare since they are the link between the community and the health facility. The CHPs attached to this facility have been identifying expectant mothers within their villages and ensuring that they attend the minimum required antenatal clinics and also deliver in hospital. They also make follow-ups to ensure that the mothers attend postnatal clinics and that their babies are immunized accordingly. Phyllis Karinga, a CHP attached to the facility said that they have been doing a lot of sensitizations among mothers and the community at large as far as health matters are concerned. “Mothers in this region previously had a challenge whereby many of them gave birth at home, but that has changed with the opening of the maternity wing. “The distance to the health facilities was the biggest challenge; before getting there, you’d find the mother has already delivered. Giving birth at home had detrimental results such as infection, stillbirths, excessive bleeding, and even maternal and infant mortality.” Karinga noted. She also thanked the County Government for the recent training offered to them as well as the monthly stipend they are now receiving, saying it has gone a long way in boosting their morale. Stephen Kinyua, a village elder, reiterated the sentiments expressed by the community health promoter. He pointed out the dire situation prior to the facility’s establishment, saying that their village is now changed. Another beneficiary of the maternity wing, Emily Wanjiku, said that the facility was the best gift to mothers in the area. “The facility has facilitated all my eight antenatal clinics. Prior to its operationalization, I would spend Sh 800 traveling to hospitals in Murinduko, Kiumbu, or Kimbimbi from Ngumano area. Now, I spend as little as Sh 200 to access the facility. The doctors provide excellent services, and we are even provided with a balanced diet.” Wanjiku said. South Ngarima Health Center is one of Kirinyaga county projects aimed at strengthening primary health systems in the county, with 20 dispensary projects having been undertaken within the last three years.",

        "content": "A severe power outage continues to affect residents of Masalani town leading to break down of water, health and security services in the town located in Ijara constituency Garissa County. A spot check by KNA shows that power outage started on Sunday forcing businesses like barber shop, garages, cyber cafe vegetable and milk vendors out of business except for those who have backup power such as generators or solar energy. The chairman of Masalani town watchdog Mr Abdullahi Abdi said Kenya Power Company is losing millions of shillings while the residents are suffering due to lack of water and health services. He called upon the Cabinet Secretary for energy Mr Davies Chirchir and the managing director of Kenya power and lighting company to establish a power station in Masalani town. Mr Abdi acknowledged that the solar energy is the remedy if the intermittent power failure continues in Masalani which he says had 17,000 power connections. Abdi pointed out that solar energy outlets have long queues of people lining up to charge their phones due to outage. Residents of Ijara town, which is 48 km from Masalani town, have also complained of power blackout for the last two weeks. Other areas affected are Hulugho Sub County, Sangailu and Bothai Sub County forcing them to resort to generators and delight solar energy panels. Contacted for comment Kenya power and lighting company officer in charge of Masalani Mr Silas Limo said three power poles have collapsed due to flood waters and they are expected to be repaired on Monday. Masalani Airport which was constructed by engineers from Kenya Airport Authority was also affected forcing them to use backup generators during the intermittent power blackout. Masalani sub county referral hospital medical officer of health Dr Abdimalik Ibrahim appealed to Garissa County government to equip the hospital with a standby generator as service have been paralysed. Dr Ibrahim said nurses were last week forced to use torches to assist a woman who was in labour to deliver at the facility. Mr Silas Limo, the KPLC manager, said the distance between Boji-Masalani bridge and the town is only 5km and they are planning to erect concrete electricity poles after the floods subside to mitigate the frequent power outage.",

        "description": "MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Customs (BoC) is confident that it will reach and even surpass its P959 billion collection target for the year amid a strong revenue performance and initiatives to facilitate trade and further enhance collections.Commissioner Bienvenido Rubio said that the bureau's strategy to increase collections by 15 to 20 percent for 2024 is being done on several fronts, including vigilant monitoring and continuous improvement of modernization projects.Also, the strategy aims to intensify efforts against smuggling and speed up upgrade facilitation with less human intervention.\"We are committed to contributing to the Department of Finance's goal of fostering national socio-economic growth by collecting additional revenue for our fellow Filipino people and guarding the country's borders,\" he added.Based on preliminary reports, Rubio said, the BoC collected P330.27 billion between January and May 13, 2024, exceeding its target of P317.87 billion by 3.90%, or P12.41 billion.He said the figure represents a 7% increase from the same period last year when collection was at P308.65 billion.Through the BoC's enhanced border protection, he said, 132 apprehensions were conducted in the first quarter, resulting in seizures worth P28.02 billionMeanwhile, under the fuel marking program, 7.01 billion liters of fuel were marked for the current calendar year and fuel worth P908.52 billion marked from 2019 to May 9, 2024.Rubio said his \"personal\" goal is to collect P1 trillion.\"Collecting P1 trillion is a formidable task but with hard work and with the collective support of our officials and employees in the bureau, there is nothing impossible,\" he added.Rubio said that among the key initiatives the BoC is undertaking to further ramp up revenue collection is the Enhanced Value Reference Information System (e-VRIS), which is a critical risk assessment tool for safeguarding government revenues and facilitating trade.The BoC is also actively working on implementing an ICT-enabled clearance system for express shipments and in the process of drafting Customs Administrative Orders and Customs Memorandum Orders for e-Commerce to prevent revenue leakages.Addressing the issue of smuggling, Rubio said the bureau will strengthen border control by engaging and collaborating with other law enforcement agencies for seamless coordination and information sharing against the entry of illicit goods, contraband, drugs, and high-value commodities that pose a significant threat to the agency's revenue collection performance.The BoC will fully implement the National Customs Intelligence System to enhance actionable intelligence, support case build-up, and conduct risk profiling and analysis to curb smuggling effectively.",

        "content": "Bronze age burial mounds, Roman roads and deserted medieval villages are among almost 13,000 previously-unknown ancient sites and monuments that have been discovered by members of the public in recent months, it will be announced this week. Truck drivers and doctors are among more than 1,000 people who participated in Deep Time , a “citizen science project” which has harnessed the power of hobbyists to scour 512 sq km (200 sq miles) of Earth Observation data, including high-resolution satellite and lidar – laser technology – imagery. Participants were searching for ancient features across three distinct landscapes: the Peak District, an area spanning Derbyshire and Yorkshire; Wallington in Northumberland; and Purbeck and Studland in Dorset. They have found 262 possible Bronze age barrows and three Roman roads, among other discoveries. The project is a partnership between DigVentures, an archaeology social enterprise, and the National Trust, which owns and manages large areas of those landscapes. Maiya Pina-Dacier, a senior archaeologist with DigVentures, said: “We’ve now got the preliminary results in and they’re really impressive. Our citizen scientists – or ‘Pastronauts’ as we call them – identified 12,802 ancient sites and monuments that were previously unknown.” Pina-Dacier said the discoveries were particularly exciting because “all of this was achieved within just three months and included local, national and international citizens, many of whom had never done any archaeology before”. Dr Brendon Wilkins, founder and co-chief executive of DigVentures, said: “Thanks to our Pastronauts, we were able to map much larger areas, in much greater detail, and much more quickly than professional archaeologists alone could have done. “I’m really excited by the scale of the features that have been found ... We can go out now into the field, with many of the participants who have helped us find these sites ... field-check them and potentially also excavate them. It’s the prehistoric landscape that’s emerging from beneath the modern field system.” Founded in 2012, DigVentures enables public participation in archaeology. Thousands of people are drawn to its activities. The archaeologists have not given precise locations of the latest discoveries to deter illicit excavations. The project, which is funded by Innovate UK and the Heritage Innovation Fund, also relates to the impact of the climate crisis on our landscapes: “the interconnectedness between our historic environment and our natural environments”, Wilkins said, noting that mapping archaeological and ecological “assets” can better plan reforestation work, for example, without damaging existing archaeology. He added: “To meet its net zero goals, the UK needs to transform at least 700 sq km of land a year. Citizen science programmes like this can directly support these efforts by helping to map and increase our understanding of the landscapes in question before work begins. “All three landscapes that we searched are already being impacted by climate change, and the National Trust is doing a huge amount of work in each of them to implement nature recovery and landscape resilience measures, such as reforestation, coastal defences and carbon sequestration.” Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Tom Dommett, head of historic environment at the National Trust, said: “Climate change already affects some of our most distinctive landscapes, and we’re taking significant steps to make them more resilient. We’re absolutely thrilled by the huge collective effort that went into this project from citizen scientists to help us do even more of this work.” The National Trust cares for 123 sq km of land across the Peak District national park, within an area that has been occupied since the Mesolithic. Searching for its archaeology – including Palaeolithic cave sites – supports plans for conservation and habitat restoration, to help slow the effects of climate breakdown. The Purbeck and Studland mission area covers 35 sq km of National Trust property on the Isle of Purbeck, which was already known to be home to a huge variety of ancient sites and unique habitats, now vulnerable to rising sea levels and rapid coastal erosions. Dr Martin Papworth, the National Trust archaeologist for the south-west, warned that coastal sites would disappear in “as little as 30 years”, which means that the area’s monitoring and management are crucial. This project has involved identifying previously undiscovered sites before they are lost.",

        "description": "The Japanese Government has ordered residents to take refuge inside a building or underground after a missile was launched from North Korea.",
        "content": "The Japanese government has issued an emergency warning for residents in the south to take cover. All TV channels cut abruptly to the announcement that North Korea just fired a ballistic missile toward Okinawa and that people there should take shelter in concrete buildings. North Korea had earlier notified Japan's coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket” during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Joe Biden makes massive Kim Jong-un gaffe in latest embarrassing moment American soldier's mom arrested in Russia said son caught in 'set up' plot Japanese Prime Minister's Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea's launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. In phone talks earlier Monday, senior diplomats from Japan, South Korea and the United States agreed to call on North Korea to abandon the launch. South Korea’s Unification Ministry, which deals with North Korea, separately called a satellite launch by the North “a provocation that seriously threatens our and regional security.” Later Monday, South Korea mobilized 20 fighter jets for a drill meant to demonstrate its resolve to punish North Korea in the event of provocation, according to South Korea’s military. Japanese officials said their missile interceptors remain ready to shoot down any debris from a North Korean rocket if it falls on Japanese territory. Last November, North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a governing party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. Whether the North Korean satellites can produce militarily meaningful imagery is widely doubted, but some civilian experts say operating several satellites could help North Korea continuously monitor big enemy targets.",

        "content": "“I’m baffled how they can live there, but they have no other place to go” Sewage coming up through a shower Open pipes in one garden Gardens are flooded with raw sewage A dead rat by a manhole cover These pictures show the horrific conditions residents in Tipperary town are enduring as raw sewage floods their properties. With human waste coming up through toilet bowls and shower trays for the past two years, for the residents of one house, they are sick to the stomach and cannot live there anymore. That’s according to one neighbour, Stevie O’Donnell, who lives across the road from the blighted properties on Cashel Road. He had been asked to visit one of the homes as he is known in the area for his local work in the community. “The man who lives there, a Lithuanian man, showed me around his house,” Stevie said. Open pipes in one garden “I have been in poor conditions before but this was the worst I have ever experienced. Inside the bathroom, the sewage is coming up through the toilet, the shower tray was full of it and the smell was horrific. “I guarantee you, if you went into that house, you would not be able to stay more than three minutes. You’d have to get rid of your clothes afterwards because the smell would travel with you. It’s horrendous. “There is no way you could sit down and enjoy a meal. There is no way you could lie on a bed and have comfortable night’s sleep. I’m baffled how they can live there, but they have no other place to go. Gardens are flooded with raw sewage “It was the most toxic contamination I’ve ever seen,” Stevie added. “I literally felt sick. I decided to go to the back garden and, again, it was disgusting. For any person having to live in these conditions is unacceptable. “The gentleman was so upset that he couldn’t speak to me about it. “If they remain there in that house, we will have (a) fatality.” Stevie said that while there are several properties affected, this one house was the worst. He added that other houses had sewage in the back gardens that had dried up in the recent warm weather but that when it rained it was worse. A dead rat by a manhole cover He also said rats were a major problem in the area. “Another resident told me this had been going on for two years now,” Stevie added. “He told me the council keeps making excuses and are putting the onus on Irish Water. “The big issue now is that the affected residents may have to evacuate their homes due to the deadly toxic fumes, it’s a major health hazard and it’s unacceptable.” Tipperary County Council has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "My father owned clubs in Montreal, so I was DJing by the time I was 15. And then I started making music videos. Propaganda Films called me to go to work in Los Angeles – which for a young director was like a soul singer being called to Motown. But I would always fly back to the east coast and hit the DJ booth: Drinking In LA is the culmination of that journey back and forth. I remember waking up face down on a lawn in West Hollywood after a night of drinking. I’d wandered into this area with big houses – like the TV show 90210 – and was probably passed out for four or five hours in the hot sun with nobody bothering me. I woke up and thought “What the hell am I doing, drinking in LA at 26?” Those words and the melody were already in my head. Shortly after that I was in the Sam Ash Music store in Times Square in New York, where people such as DJ Premier were playing about with samplers. It was that 90s period of DJs making music, so I bought some gear and in my little flat started swirling up Bran Van 3000. I’d known EP [Bergen, DJ] since we were kids in clubs and he taught me to use the sampler. Once the vocalists Sara Johnston, Jayne Hill and others came on board we were a collective, like Massive Attack or Wu-Tang Clan, telling hip-hop stories. Drinking in LA is about a young director who never finishes the script because he’s having so much fun. The line about sipping on juice and gin is a nod to Snoop Dogg, who was huge then. I was enamoured of LA but there’s a certain melancholy to the song as well. The characters are kind of blase – like Jim Morrison sang in LA Woman: “City of night, never saw a woman so alone.” We put a breakbeat in and my roommate Adam Chaka put down the piano solo. Stéphane Moraille came over one night to do the power soul chorus and she just killed it. I gave Moby a cassette tape at South by Southwest. He gave it to someone at Geffen Records, and a bidding war started. Drinking in LA was a minor hit in the UK in 1997 but two years later – after it was picked up for a beer advert – it went Top 3. The irony was hilarious. To this day we still hear from people around the world who’ve got drunk and messaged us. I guess everyone’s woken up somewhere and thought: “How did I get here?” When I was 16 I hitchhiked from Peterborough in Ontario, to Montreal. Since I was 13 I’d been rhyming “ice tea” with “OG” to get free bevvies, so when I arrived in Montreal I asked where I could get on the mic. Everyone said Di Salvio’s. I was wearing hand-me-down clothes and they looked at me and said: “Not a chance.” But James’s dad gave me a try. Then he gave me $600 to buy some clothes and said: “You’re hired – every Wednesday.” That’s how I met James. We worked up Drinking in LA in the basement of a townhouse I was renting in Montreal. There was a jam/open mic concept, and people would just come in. James is the kind of guy who would run into a Mexican brass section and invite them to play with us. He heard Nervous Duane Larson playing the guitar lick on the Metro. He’s an interesting character. Trying to find him in the Metro system was like catching a squirrel in traffic, but without that guitar lick, Drinking in LA would be a different song. When I asked James if I could be on it, he said: “It’ll cost you a case of beer.” I came back with three cases for three songs. I did the radio caller voice going “This is Liquid ring-a-ding dinging ...” and the shouts of “Beer!” and such. James directed the video in a Montreal apartment with a very low budget and again beers were opened. In Canada they told us the song would never get played on the radio. Five months later all those radio programmers were going, “We have a hot new band from LA”, because they thought that’s where we were from. And whenever anyone says we’re a one-hit wonder, I always say it’s better to be a one-hit wonder than wonder why you never had a hit. Liquid Ltd’s single I Walked is out now. Drinking in LA appears on Bran Van 3000’s 1997 debut, Glee. A new album is due later this year",

        "content": "Best News Website or Mobile Service WAN-IFRA Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Best News Website or Mobile Service Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Fiorentina's painful defeat last season will inspire them in this year's Europa Conference League final against Olympiakos, where they will bid to lift the trophy for their late general manager Joe Barone and loyal fans, captain csaid. Biraghi required medical attention when hit by a cup thrown by opposition fans during last year's final. The captain soldiered on, but his side lost 2-1 to West Ham United, going down to a penalty and a 90th-minute goal. Fiorentina also lost the Coppa Italia final last season, but Biraghi does not feel any extra pressure and believes the lessons learned can help them against the Greek club on Wednesday. \"I wouldn't say pressure, but there is definitely even more desire for revenge, getting to the final is certainly beautiful but losing hurts very, very badly,\" Biraghi told Reuters in an interview. \"We certainly have more experience, we know what we did wrong and what we shouldn't do again, playing a final has always taught us something, both positively and negatively.\" This year has brought more than its fair share of pain, as Fiorentina lost their general manager Barone, who died after suffering a cardiac arrest in March while with the team for a league game at Atalanta. \"Joe was a point of reference for us, a central figure. Together with our owner, Rocco Commisso, they have done incredible things to grow the club,\" Biraghi said. \"We had a special, intense relationship with Joe. We said things to each other frankly but always for the good of Fiorentina. \"He was like a father to us all, he always defended us and never left us wanting for anything. Now we have to do something for him.\" Fiorentina's last trophy came back in 2001 and they have since suffered relegation and serious financial problems. They made it back to Serie A, and to European football, but silverware still eludes them. The team will not only have a large number of fans behind them in Athens, but their stadium in Florence will be packed with locals watching the game on large screens. \"We know what it would mean for our fans and the city of Florence,\" Biraghi said. \"It's been more than 20 years since Fiorentina won a trophy and we know that the city would go crazy with joy because Fiorentina is a religion here, so we will really do our best to give great satisfaction to all of Florence.\"",

        "content": "recently hosted a community celebration to officially open the City’s new “all-wheel” Fernie Skate Park. The newly redeveloped Skate Park has been designed for a variety of “all-wheel” sports including skateboarding, inline skating, BMX biking, and scootering. It features accessible design and progressive features intended for all-ages, skills, and abilities to enjoy, making it an inclusive recreation amenity and community hub in the heart of downtown Fernie. The redevelopment of the Skate Park was made possible by $1.28 million in provincial and federal grant funding through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program. In addition, a $250,000 donation from Teck, $210,000 from the Province of British Columbia’s Resort Municipality Initiative and $100,000 from Columbia Basin Trust supported the development of the roof structure over a portion of the Skate Park. The covered area will further enhance accessibility for families and visitors by providing additional protection from weather,extending the park’s seasonality. Following six months of community engagement on the design of the Skate Park, the city broke ground on the project last summer. With the finishing touches finalized this spring, the new “all-wheel” Skate Park is a milestone achievement in line with the City of Fernie’s goal of encouraging healthy living and community participation in recreational activities through accessible and inclusive amenities. Fernie Skate Park will become a hub for Fernie’s youth programming initiatives, community events, and local competitions. To celebrate the grand opening of the Fernie Skate Park, the City of Fernie, Teck, Columbia Basin Trust, the province of British Columbia, the Canadian Government, and New Line Skateparks, hosted a grand opening event Thursday, May 16, for the public at the Skate Ppark. The event was family friendly and will include demonstrations by semi-pro skaters and local talent, live music, food trucks, prize draws and free swag. “We are thrilled to celebrate the opening of Fernie’s new all-wheel skate park. This skate park was designed with extensive input from our community, and provides an inclusive space for skateboarders, BMX riders, and scooter riders alike to hone their skills and connect with fellow riders. We are grateful to our funding partners for their contributions, and are looking forward to the Fernie Skate Park becoming an animated recreation hub, and seeing the positive impact on our residents and visitors for years to come,” said Nic Milligan, Mayor of Fernie. “Teck is dedicated to making a positive impact in the communities where our employees, and their families, live, work, and skate. We are proud to have worked with all partners to support the development of the new Fernie Skate Park, helping to increase more recreational hubs in the Elk Valley,” said Robin Sheremeta, President, Coal Business Unit, Teck.",

The two NBA legends have provided fans with ceaseless entertainment on the popular TNT show, which faces the axe , and sparked hilarity once again during their coverage of the Minnesota Timberwolves' playoff game against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night. Ahead of Game 3, which saw Luka Doncic and co take a commanding 3-0 lead in the Western Conference Finals, Shaq seized the chance to roast his fellow analyst. Shaq couldn't resist poking fun at Barkley as the analyst regaled the crew, which featured beloved studio analysts O'Neal, Kenny Smith, host Ernie Johnson and guest Draymond Green, about his pregame walk on a scorching Sunday in Dallas. 'I was taking my daily walk and I made about half a block and I said, abort, abort,' Barkley said, talking about the heat. Chuck: “It’s hot as hell down here in Dallas. ... I walk every day to get peace and quiet by myself but I aborted today.” Shaq: “You walked to get what? Pizza and quiet?!” 🤣 pic.twitter.com/2Vmg75xko4 — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) May 26, 2024 Shaquille O'Neal (L) provided an all-time one-liner at the expense of Charles Barkley (R) Read More 'Inside the NBA' stars Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal given glimmer of hope over TV deal as NBA chief Adam Silver says talks with TNT are still alive 'I walk every day to get peace and quiet by myself but I aborted today,' he went on to explain, before Shaq quipped: 'You walked to get what? Pizza and quiet?' The one-liner had fans in stitches on social media as many clamored for the show's survival. 'The NBA has to find a way to keep this show on the airwaves. It's just too good,' one user posted in response to the clip on social media. 'This has to be saved,' another said before a third added, 'They can not get rid of this!!' 'This is what they’re trying to take from us,' one fan wrote, referring to the banter between the co-hosts, while another chimes in, saying, 'I will miss this banter next year.' Another posted: 'It will be a tragedy if this show just ceases to exist one day lol.' The one-liner had fans in stitches on social media as many clamored for the show's survival Meanwhile, one social media user had a slightly stronger reaction, channeling a Batman villain. 'nba cancels this show I’ll go full Joker,' they said. Last week it emerged that the NBA was formalizing written contracts with ESPN, NBC and Amazon over new TV deals worth a combined $7.4billion per year. According to Sports Business Journal , negotiations with all three companies were entering the 'final stage' in what was a massive blow for TNT and their long-running show 'Inside the NBA'. However, there may still be life in the show yet as NBA Commissioner Adam Silver offered TNT a glimmer of hope. Outside of Thursday's White House state dinner in Washington D.C. last week, Commissioner Silver said: 'We're all still talking. Who knows how it's going to work out?' Adam Silver (pictured with wife Maggie Grise) has revealed talks with TNT are still ongoing ESPN, NBC and Amazon appeared to have beaten TNT and its show 'Inside the NBA' to rights It was reported that ESPN will pay $2.8bn per year for the league's most prized set of games, including the NBA finals, a conference final, weekly primetime clashes and the WNBA . NBC, meanwhile, is set to fork out $2.6bn annually for the 'B' package, which would likely include a show called 'Basketball Night in America', airing on Sunday evenings after the NFL season. According to SBJ, NBC would also secure a conference semifinals, a conference final and two primetime slots per week. Amazon's deal - said to be worth up to $2bn - would come with the In-Season Tournaments, first-round playoff games and the WNBA.

        "content": "The Benin Royal Family on Monday announced the suspension of embattled Professor Gregory Akenzua, one of the suspended enigie (duke) who had taken the Oba of Benin to court challenging their suspension as enigie in the kingdom. Professor Gregory Akenzua, a professor of Gynecology, former Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University of Benin and former chairman of the Governing Council of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma is a younger brother to Oba Erediauwa, the father of Oba Ewuare II. Addressing a press conference, members of the royal family including descendants of Oba Ovonramwen, Oba Eweka, Oba Akenzua II, Oba Erediauwa and others, the family said Professor Akenzua against all entreaties have chosen to challenge the Benin Traditional Institution through his acts “that are utterly at variance with the customs and tradition of the Benin people, and the core values of the Benin Royal Family.” The press statement read on behalf of the royal family by Prince George Eweka said “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua, has betrayed the core values of respect for the Benin Customs and Tradition; devotion and submission to the customary hierarchy of the Benin Kingdom; and respect for customary arbitration process. Instead, he has chosen the path of rebellion; “ For the avoidance of doubt, the Royal Family wishes to emphasize that His Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin occupies a unique position as the father of every member of the Benin Royal Family irrespective of age. Hence the Royal family does not have an Okaegbe, like other families in Benin Kingdom but Odion Egbe who is required by tradition to defer to His Royal Majesty; “The Royal Family also notes that in utter violation of the hierarchy of succession to the Odion-Egbe position of the Benin Royal Family, Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua has been parading himself as the Odion-Egbe of the Royal Family, and has held meetings to assert himself as such when he knows that he is not rightfully entitled to the position being far lower in the hierarchy of seniority in the Benin Royal Family; “The Benin Royal Family has given ample opportunities to Prof.Gregory Idurobo Akenzua to retrace his steps and return to the path of honour and dignity; “ Prof. Gregory Idurobo Akenzua has snubbed and rejected the opportunities provided by the Royal Family for him to retrace his wrongful steps. “After a careful review of the facts, the Benin Royal Family has decided as follows: Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua is hereby suspended from the Benin Royal Family for his acts of rebellion against the Benin Traditional Institution; “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua is no longer to participate in any activity connected with the Benin Royal Family. “All members of the Benin Royal Family are strongly directed not to relate, associate, or engage with Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua for as long as he remains suspended from the Benin Royal Family.” When contacted for his reaction, Professor Akenzua said he was in Lagos “for an engagement” and requested time.",

Among them, two individuals still receive treatment at the Taluk Hospital and the Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences. “The Chamarajanagar district administration is taking proactive measures to ensure availability of clean drinking water,” stated DC Shilpa Nag. “In the light of disruptions in the regular Cauvery water supply due to ongoing road development, we will be distributing water via tankers for the upcoming week, and this water must be utilised for drinking purposes,” she said. Dr. Arun Rate, Medical Officer at the Primary Health Centre, said that a door-to-door awareness programme was conducted. Medical staff have collected samples of borewell water and sent them to lab for testing. As a precautionary measure, supply of borewell drinking water has been temporarily disconnected and tanker water is being provided to the village, he said.

        "description": "Brits are very particular when it comes to making tea, and this American TV report's technique has left people 'sobbing and throwing up' in British",
        "content": "People have been left \"sobbing and throwing up in British\" after an American woman shared her unique method of preparing the perfect cup of tea. Brits are notoriously particular about their tea, demanding nothing less than perfection. So, when Penny Kmitt, a television reporter for CBS, shared her tea-making process on TikTok, she was met with a wave of shocked responses from tea enthusiasts. Kmitt often shares glimpses into her daily life as a TV reporter, including get-ready-with-me videos, news updates, and behind-the-scenes footage. Recently, she showcased her early morning routine, which included making a cup of tea - not with a kettle, but with a microwave. Read More Related Articles Man's attempt at huge breakfast challenge branded 'pathetic' after sharing 'after' photo Despite owning a kettle, Kmitt prefers to heat cold water in a microwave for two minutes before adding an Earl Grey teabag. She insists that this method saves time, as waiting for the kettle to boil takes over six minutes, and says \"not only does this take much longer, but it is way too hot to drink right away,\". After taking a sip of her microwaved tea, she declared: \"This is ready to go, I rest my case.\" However, viewers were quick to express their disbelief at her unconventional tea-making technique. One individual highlighted the benefits of an upgrade, remarking: \"Girl, there are electric ones. They literally boil the amount of water in like two minutes.\" A Brit chimed in: \"You need it boiling hot so the tea bag infuses. Trust me I'm a Brit.\" \"My kettle takes 20 seconds,\" another boasted. Meanwhile, someone else advised: \"If you don't have time to make tea in a kettle, then you don't have time to drink tea. Not everything about life is go go go! \". \"Sobbing and throwing up in British,\" another lamented. \"Microwaved water is just wrong,\" one person declared. Echoing the sentiment, another said: \"My English heart can't take this, those poor tea bags! \". Yet, some came to Penny's defence with one supporter saying: \"I love making tea in the microwave.\" Another, puzzled by the uproar, added: \"Literally it's hot water why the f*** does it matter? \". \"I might try this,\" someone contemplated. Another was convinced: \"Microwave is better.\"",

        "content": "The security guard who was seen arguing with Kelly Rowland on the Cannes red carpet last week has been caught up in another spat with Dominican actor Massiel Taveras. Last week, the former Destiny’s Child star was attending the premiere of the film Marcello Mio , a French-Italian comedy written and directed by Christopher Honoré. Footage from the event revealed that Rowland got involved in a heated exchange with the female usher, who appeared to be guiding her into the venue before the singer raised a finger and seemingly engaged in a verbal dispute. Rowland later addressed the incident with the Associated Press on the red carpet of Cannes’ amfAR gala event. “The woman knows what happened. I know what happened,” she said. “I have a boundary. And I stand by those boundaries. And that is it.” Now, the same security guard has been involved in another incident with Dominican actor and presenter Taveras, who was attending the premiere of the French film The Count of Monte Cristo at the French film festival on May 22. pic.twitter.com/cdtwLHGZFv — v (@ViralThingz) May 25, 2024 As the star was posing on the stairs of the red carpet, footage shows Taveras trying to unfurl the train of her dress to reveal an image of Jesus Christ. However the security guard was seen ushering her towards the venue as the actor tried to pose for photos. At one point, the guard appeared to put her hand on Taveras’ back to move her along, before the actor shoved her away and exchanged some heated words. The actor has since responded to the incident and the subsequent news coverage on her social media, writing: “I want to thank all of you for this incredible support, today more than ever we need to stay together, suport eachether protect our souls , have strong boundaries and stand for our rights, let’s show some love and respect to the extraordinary @kellyrowland a pure soul, a talented, classy, educated woman of color that represents with respect all of US.” She continued: “I’m impressed how you handled sister I didn’t now that happened to you first I was very impressed how calm and genteel you wr because in my case I was tired of the abuse. -BLACK WOMAN MATTERS- we are not going to be in silence on situations like that, we need respect it’s enough. I hug you queen #kellyrowland, thanks for giving us sooo much god bless your heart.” After Rowland’s own incident, she responded that there were “other women that attended that carpet who did not quite look like me and they didn’t get scolded, or pushed off, or told to get off. I stood my ground and she felt like she had to stand hers. But I stood my ground. And that was it.” K-pop star and actor Yoona was also recorded being ushered along in the same way from the same security guard. Publisher",

        "description": "(The Center Square) – The price of homes in Wisconsin continues to go up.",
        "content": "The latest report from the Wisconsin Realtor Association, for April’s home sale numbers, shows the median price for a home jumped again last month. “A comparison of April housing prices in Wisconsin shows median prices up just over 40% since the pandemic hit in 2020,” WRA Consultant David Clark said in the report. \"A lot of that increase took place between 2020 and 2022, when median prices rose almost 25% in total. In contrast, the last two years have seen 12-month home price increases of just 5.4% in April 2023, and only 6.4% in April 2024.\" The median price for a house in Wisconsin is now $300,000. That’s up $100 from April’s report on the sales figures from March. The higher prices, the realtors say, is a reflection of both higher interest rates and a lack of homes for sale. “We’ve got a way to go before the market becomes balanced, but at least it’s moving in the right direction,” Realtors board chairwoman Mary Jo Bowe added. \"The growth trend in listings has really helped our sales this year, and it bodes well for robust growth this summer.\" The report said there were 17,203 homes listed for sale in April, that’s up about 6% from April of last year. Of those, the report said 5,532 homes actually sold. There is more inventory in Wisconsin. According to the realtors, there’s a little more than than three months of homes on the market, that was just under three months in April of last year. South central Wisconsin, the Madison area, continues to have the most expensive median home price at $375,000. Last month, that median price was $354,900. Southeast Wisconsin is next with a median price in April of this year $315,000, compared to $300,000 in March. But the strongest sales numbers are in other parts of the state. The report said, “The strongest growth was in the more rural regions with the Central region up 43.5%, the West region increasing 40.4%, and the North region growing 37.9%. More urbanized regions also grew at a healthy pace. The Northeast and South Central regions increased between 25% and 29% over the last year, and the Southeast region was up 16%.” The association's CEO said home sales are strong, despite the high prices and high interest rates, because buyers continue to be interested in buying a home. “There are significant unmet housing needs for millennial buyers, the oldest of whom are now in their early 40s,” Realtors President & CEO Tom Larson said in the report. \"Even though average monthly mortgage rates have been increasing throughout 2024, millennials remain committed to homeownership, which is a big reason home sales have rebounded this year.\"",

        "description": "Two Alba candidates will stand in the Yes City, where Alex Salmond is targeting \"demoralised\" SNP voters.",
        "content": "Alex Salmond blasted the SNP’s independence strategy as “ludicrous” as he urged demoralised voters to back Alba in Dundee. Describing the Yes-voting City of Discovery as his “favourite” city, he said it was a visit there in 2014 that made him realise the scale of momentum behind the Yes movement. And it’s a momentum he’ll need to resurrect to make a dent in the general election. Alba candidates Alan Ross and Ghazi Khan are seeking support in the city’s two constituencies, Dundee Central and Arbroath and Broughty Ferry. Launching Alba’s General Election campaign outside the V&A museum, a relaxed-sounding Mr Salmond told The Courier he’d be appealing to disaffected SNP voters. He described his former of “relying on Keir Starmer to allow a referendum” as “ludicrous”. Mr Salmond said: “It’s obvious the SNP are losing about half the vote they had 10 years ago. “Our message is not to waste your vote on the unionist parties and vote for a real independence party in Alba.” The party is standing 20 candidates across Scotland, including Cowdenbeath and Kirkcaldy where incumbent MP Neale Hanvey is seeking re-election. Mr Salmond isn’t among the candidates though. He , where he aims to stand for the North East region which stretches from Dundee to Fraserburgh. He hopes to use the Westminster ballot to “introduce the idea that independence will have to be won at the ballot box”. Mr Salmond continued: “We’re not going to be granted a referendum by Keir Starmer, the SNP policy on that is just ludicrous.” Mr Salmond admitted that even if 20 Alba candidates were elected, Scotland would be no closer to independence than if they voted SNP. But he said: “There’s two options here. You can do the same thing over and over again expecting a different result, that’s what the SNP is doing, which is madness. “Or alternatively you can use elections as the mandate, and it has to be a popular mandate. I’m not claiming we can do that at this election but we can introduce the argument. “If we can get that across in this election here in Dundee, then in two years time that argument will sweep the country.” The SNP has been approached for comment. Alan Ross and Ghazi Khan also spoke to The Courier about their priorities. Mr Ross, who is standing in Dundee Central, said: “I’ll be campaigning on drugs and alcohol related deaths. “I currently work in the only rehab facility in Dundee, and the Scottish Government have admitted themselves they’ve taken their eye off the ball. “I’ll be campaigning for a lot more residential rehab. [The SNP] have taken their eye off the ball with just as they have with Scottish independence. Arbroath and Broughty Ferry candidate Mr Khan added: “I’ve been speaking to constituents and there is four key policies; independence, education, affordable housing and tackling poverty. “People are saying three different things, that the Conservatives have become complacent, that they don’t believe in the SNP and they don’t believe in Keir Starmer. “They are thinking about spoiling their ballot but i’ve been out engaging with them and saying their vote does matter if they give it to the right person.” Elsewhere on the campaign trail, SNP leader John Swinney conceded his party “has a lot of ground to cover” to catch up with Labour. Asked if that meant the SNP was now fighting this election as the “underdog”, he pointed to his campaign in Perth in 2017. “It is quite a good way to fight an election campaign, if I think back to the contest in 2017 in my own local area, Perth and North Perthshire.” Meanwhile Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey visited Fife, where he predicted there could be “more liberals than nationalists” in the new parliament. Sir Ed said: “I think there is a massive desire to get rid of the Conservatives in Westminster and also, actually, to get rid of the SNP “I think the Liberal Democrats can be the third party in UK politics again.”",

        "description": "The iconic pub was popular with students due to its location and cheap offers",
        "content": "Mystery surrounds the sudden closure of a popular bar in Manchester city centre . The Footage, on the corner of Grosvenor Street and Oxford Road , has been a popular drinking spot for students for years , boasting offers and being close to the Manchester Metropolitan University campus and the University of Manchester . But the venue - operated by Crafted Social, part of the Stonegate Group - has been listed as ‘permanently closed’ on its website. There has been no other announcement on social media about the closure. READ MORE: Manchester's 'biggest' beer garden to launch next week just in time for summer A pop-up message on the website’s booking form tells guests that the venue, which it described itself online as 'the greatest bar in Manchester', closed on Saturday (May 25) and thanked guests for their custom. The pop-up said: “We will no longer be trading after the 25th May. It has been a pleasure serving the community and we shall miss you!” Just four days earlier (May 23), the venue had been sharing posts on social media promoting the upcoming Euro's and encouraging people to 'secure the best seats and deals' by booking spots at the pub. The Footage pub and bar was based within the former Grosvenor Picture Palace cinema building (Image: The Footage) Posting on social media, one person said they felt that The Footage’s closure was the ‘biggest loss to Manchester since Font’. Just last week, it was announced that the former The Font bar on New Wakefield Street, which closed at the start of 2023, will reopen at the end of June as a new Irish bar. The history of the Footage building dates back to 1915 when it first opened as the Grosvenor Picture Palace cinema. The largest cinema outside of London at the time, the first film screened at the venue was the silent historical film Jane Shore, starring British actress Blanche Forsythe. Through various incarnations, the venue was last used as a cinema in 1968 before it was taken over as a bingo hall and then a Riley’s Snooker Club. It began a new life as a pub, under the name of the Flea and Firkin, in 1990. The Footage has permanently closed, according to its website (Image: The Footage) A few years later, the pub was rebranded into The Footage and Firkin, before it was taken over by new owners and renamed The Footage. Stonegate gave the venue a £360,000 refurbishment ten years ago, promoting it as a craft beer and live sports venue. The neo-classical building, designed by Percy Hothersall, was also designated with Grade II Listed status by English Heritage in the 1990s. Just last month, the Stonegate chain announced it was grappling with £2.3bn in debt that it was struggling to refinance and ‘[casted] doubt on the company’s ability to continue’. It is not yet known if this has contributed to the closure of Footage in any way. The Manchester Evening News tried to contact Footage directly and was told that the venue is permanently closed, but no further details were made available. Crafted Social have also been approached for comment and further information.",

        "content": "A gang who committed a series of violent armed robberies in the north-eastern corner of the Netherlands have been given jail sentences of up to 29 years. A 72-year-old man was shot dead in his home when the men broke in and demanded cash and valuables. Other victims were beaten with crowbars and a hammer, while another had a hot iron pressed against his arm. The six men, aged between 27 and 39, broke into seven people’s homes and raided a petrol station looking for cigarettes during the crime spree in an area stretching from Hoorn to Alkmaar in 2020 and 2021. Judges at the high-security district court at Schiphol said they had “never come across such a gang” and described the violence as “in the absolute highest category”. Prosecutors said the victims’ lives had been left in tatters by the experience. “There are victims who still sleep every night in a barricaded panic room and don’t dare to go outside,” a prosecution lawyer said. The longest sentence of 29 years was handed down to 31-year-old Glenn V., while three men who together with V. formed the “hard core” of the gang were jailed for between 20 and 27 years. Two men who were involved in one of the robberies received sentences of 6 and a half years and three years and nine months respectively. The men were also ordered to pay compensation to several of their victims.",

        "content": "Chelsea have reportedly dropped their interest in Ipswich Town Manager, Kieran McKenna, who they were pushing to sign to replace the sacked Mauricio Pochettino. Kieran McKenna, who was first known as a coach at Manchester United, where he served as the club’s assistant coach, made a big mark in his managerial career when he led Ipswich Town to promotion back to the Premier League. Due to his team’s performance in the Championship, Chelsea reportedly shortlisted the 38-year-old tactician among the coaches they are considering for the vacant position at the club. However, a BBC report claimed that The Blues had backed out of the deal. Other shortlisted coaches under review are former Brighton manager Roberto de Zerbi, Leicester’s Enzo Maresca and Brentford’s Thomas Frank. Reports claim that Ipswich Town are making efforts to keep the coach beyond this season. His current contract with the newly promoted club will expire on June 30, 2027. Ipswich Town are also making efforts to renew his contract, which could increase the compensation his suitors will pay for his services. Currently, if Kieran McKenna decides to move to another club, his potential new club will pay at least £4 million in compensation. De Zerbi and Maresca are reportedly interested in moving to Chelsea, and they are favourites for the coaching job as the Stamford Bridge side are making efforts to sign a new coach as soon as possible.",

        "content": "Stephen Mulhern has revealed an interesting detail about his teenage years (Picture: ITV / This Morning) Stephen Mulhern has revealed his youth was spent ‘looking out for police’ to protect his father. The TV presenter, 47, began his career presenting the children’s television shows Finger Tips and Tricky TV. In the years since he’s fronted Britain’s Got More Talent, Deal or No Deal, Catchphrase and Dancing on Ice. However, he’s now revealed his early years saw him helping to keep an eye on approaching authorities while his dad was earning a living. Born in Stratford, East London, Stephen’s parents were market traders whose work risked them getting in trouble with the authorities at times. He’s now explained how he and his brothers would be kept on watch for his father on the streets of London, likening them to Only Fools and Horses wheeler-dealer Derek ‘Del Boy’ Trotter and his younger brother Rodney. The presenter used to keep watch for police while his father worked as a flypitcher (Picture: Kieron McCarron/ITV/Shutterstock) ‘My dad was a flypitcher on Petticoat Lane in east London. If you’re not sure what a flypitcher is, my dad was Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses and I was Rodney,’ he said. ‘Crack of dawn, dad was out there selling novelty toys or them slice-and-dice vegetable choppers – me and my brothers looking out for the police,’ he added when speaking to The Sunday Times. The presenter then explained working for his father offered some valuable lessons. ‘Dad would let me have a go on the stall, and that’s where I learnt how to perform in front of the hardest kind of audience: real people,’ he said. After becoming infatuated by magic aged 11, Stephen went on to become a Redcoat entertainer at Butlin’s in Somerset six years later. However, he said he ‘didn’t get into magic to be cool’ and was simply entranced by the hobby. He now fronts shows including Dancing on Ice, alongside Holly Willoughby (Picture: Kieron McCarron/ ITV/ Shutterstock) Stephen said magic was still a ‘huge part’ of his life and he continued to hone his skills and always walked around with a pack of cards in his pocket and liked to try tricks on fans who stop and ask him for a chat or selfie. Read More Stories ‘Other kids watched Match of the Day and got into football, I watched Paul Daniels and decided to learn magic. And it was the magic that led me to be a Redcoat at Butlin’s. It gave me a career,’ he added. After leaving school, Stephen created a magic show and won a TV talent show hosted by Jonathan Ross in 1997, leading him to be invited to take part in the Royal Variety Performance at the Victoria Palace Theatre. His The Quick Trick Show then hit screens in 1999 and featured magic tricks, ‘wicked wind-ups’, illusions, and step-by-step guides to tricks. It ran until 2004. Deal or No Deal, Catchphrase and Dancing on Ice are streaming on ITVX. Publisher",

        "content": "ODM party legislators in Kisii say overtaxing Kenyans signals a turn in the wrong direction for the Kenya Kwanza administration. They consequently vowed to oppose the proposed Finance Bill 24 when it shall be brought before Parliament for approval. \"I did not go to Parliament to betray the poor. I am going to fight until all forms punitive taxation embedded in the bill are removed,\" Kitutu Chache South MP Anthony Kibagendi said. The government, he said was in the business of rail-loading harsh taxes on voters. \"It did the same last year and it wants to do so this year. I will say nay again to protect my people,\" Kibagendi said. Similar sentiments were echoed by Bomachoge Borabu MP Novalson Barongo who was present at a fundraiser at Nyabururu Catholic Church on Sunday. Barongo said the proposal to tax bread for instance marks a low for the Kenya Kwanza administration. \"By doing so he wants to make bread return to the table of the rich. Already Kenyans are becoming poorer... Let's not forget again and vote for regimes that are aloof to the plights of their people,\" said Barongo. The two ODM MP spoke as Education CS Ezekiel Machogu separately defended the Kenya Kwanza government over its 'remarkable progress in addressing economic woes that had bedevilled the country' since Ruto assumed helms of power \"Judging by the phenomenal results the government has registered so far, we are definitely on the right trajectory. Let nobody cheat you,\" the CS said on Friday. He was speaking at Mokoroinwa in Masaba South in Kisii during the burial of a kin. He implored Kenyans to incessantly pray for their leaders so that they could make right decisions on governance. \" Up to where we are it is God, let's petition him always to grant us wisdom,\" he said.",

        "content": "1,119 students receive degrees at 16th Graduates’ Day ceremony Mysore/Mysuru : A.S. Kiran Kumar , former Chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), has given a clarion call to the graduates to explore the benefits of technology for the uplift of society, especially when even the unlettered are making judicious use of Science and Technology for a better livelihood. He was addressing a gathering of students during 16th Graduates’ Day ceremony held at JSS College of Arts, Commerce and Science, Ooty Road in the city recently. The country is making a rapid progress in all the fields including Science and Technology. The Chandrayaan Mission conducted in August 2023 indeed made the whole world look at India, with the successful landing of Vikram Lander and Pragyan Rover on the Moon. Even when Coronavirus pandemic struck the country, the Science and Technology came in handy in leveraging the progress of the country by adopting new technologies in making vaccine and giving impetus to digital transactions making life easy for all. Reminiscing the historical Sputnik launch and the visionary work of renowned Space Scientist Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, which set the foundation for India’s space endeavours, Kiran Kumar elaborated on the various social technological experiments conducted by ISRO in the 1950s and highlighted recent advancements, such as the initiative to aid fishermen with technology for locating fish shoals and navigation. Come 2047, the country will be celebrating centenary year of becoming independent, that sets the tone for realising the dream of ‘Viksit Bharat’ in commemoration of the proud moment. By utilising the tools of Science and Technology, we should spend all our energy towards the growth of the country and society. You are capable enough not just to bring changes in your own life, but in the life of others too, added Kiran Kumar in his advise to the students. The graduates must recognise their duties and contribute to the nation’s development across various sectors, underlined Kiran Kumar. He drew a parallel between robots with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and human sensory organs, emphasising the importance of holistic development, before concluding his speech by reminding the graduates of India’s foundational principles, which prioritise nature and collective well-being over individual gains. A total of 1,119 students including 571 Under Graduate (UG) students and 548 Post Graduate (PG) students received their degrees. READ ALSO ‘Success is not a destination but a journey’ Dr. C. G. Betsurmath, Executive Secretary of JSS Mahavidyapeetha, administered the oath to all the graduates, emphasising their responsibilities and roles as future leaders and contributors to society. Dr. B. Prabhuswamy, Controller of Examinations, presented the list of toppers and dignitaries awarded prizes to the winners. Suttur Mutt Seer Sri Shivarathri Deshikendra Swamiji, Chief Executive of the College Prof. B.V. Sambashivaiah, Principal Dr. M. Prabhu and Dr. N. Rajendra Prasad were present. A.S.

        "content": "There is the option of an additional 12 months in the deal for Gibson, who arrives after a three-year stint at Carlisle United, where he was promoted via the League Two play-offs in 2022-23. The Cumbrians were relegated last term. Gibson, 26, whose arrival follows on from the capture of midfielder Joe Sbarra, said: “It’s been in the works for a while.

It’s a good club with a good manager and I’m hoping we can do good things.” Birmingham-born Gibson came through the ranks at Rangers before joining Bradford as a 19-year-old. After three years at City, Gibson has time in the League of Ireland with St Patrick’s Athletic and Sligo Rovers before joining Carlisle in August 2021.

He’s very direct, wants to get at people, can score, can set goals up. \"He’s got a swagger about him, which I like and an air of confidence. I think he’s a very good signing for us.”",

        "description": "Latest news regarding Celtic target emerges following his promotion to the Premier League",
        "content": "Southampton boss Russell Martin has said he wants to tie down Celtic -linked Alex McCarthy to a new deal this summer. The veteran stopper sees his contract with the Saints expire at the end of next month and he is yet to pen an extension meaning he will become a free agent as things stand. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to GlasgowWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. McCarthy, 34, has a big decision to make regarding his future and will be weighing up his options. Premier League pair Liverpool and Newcastle United have also been mentioned as potential suitors over recent times. The Guildford-born man played the full 90 minutes for Southampton in their play-off final win over Leeds United at Wembley as they booked their place back in the top flight. In fact, he featured in all of their play-off outings following Gavin Bazunu’s injury. Adam Armstrong scored the winner for them in the first-half against the Whites. Speaking after the match about McCarthy’s situation, Martin said, as per a report by the Southern Daily Echo : “I know that there will be offers for all of them and probably offers that will pay them more than we can. Hopefully the feeling they have and all that stuff will outweigh financial gain but maybe there'll be other things about it too. “Big Al, I guess I'm a bit of an idiot for not playing a bit sooner but I think we have such a brilliant goalkeeping department here with Gavin [Bazunu] and Joe [Lumley] as well. I'm so pleased for Al that it finished in this way. As I said, maybe it was meant to happen that he came into the team at some point. Advertisement Advertisement “He's been immense since he came in so we'll try and keep Al as well and we'll keep our fingers crossed. It's my job now to try and squeeze more money out of Phil (Parsons, CEO) and the board and everyone and see where it takes us.” Celtic could see McCarthy as a replacement for Joe Hart, who has played his last game for the Hoops. The once-capped England man has been a great servant to Southampton and has been with them since 2016. He has played 147 matches for the Hampshire outfit in all competitions, nine of which came in this pst campaign. Advertisement Advertisement McCarthy rose up through the academy ranks at Reading and went on to play 75 matches for them earlier on in his career, as well as having loan spells away at Brentford, Leeds and Ipswich Town to boost his development. The Royals sold him on a permanent basis in 2014 and he had stints in London at QPR and Crystal Palace before Southampton came calling. It remains to be seen whether he will be staying put with the Saints for next term amid links to Celtic and others. The Hoops will no doubt monitor what happens as Brendan Rodgers hunts for a new number one. Celtic beat Rangers in the Scottish Cup final over the weekend at Hampden Park with Norwich City loanee Adam Idah bagging the winner.",

        "content": "Seven years since he became French Open junior champion and dreamed idly that it would be the launch pad for a Carlos Alcaraz-style, rocket man ascent, Alexei Popyrin offers a reflective smile. \"Yeah, it is a long time ago ... and it feels like a long time ago,\" he sighs. They seem like ancient history, those pictures of that long-haired, stick-thin 17-year-old with a beaming smile, holding aloft the boys' prize previously won by the likes of Ken Rosewall, John Newcombe, Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe. Even the arena where it happened, the beloved old Court 1 'bullring', has long since bitten the dust. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. \"And if you told myself back then how much work there was to be done to get to where I have, I wouldn't have believed you,\" Popyrin, now a battle-hardened 24-year-old, two-time ATP tournament winner who's still dreaming big dreams, tells AAP. \"Going into becoming a pro, I expected big things for myself. I expected, somewhat unrealistically, to have a Carlos Alcaraz career. \"But everybody has their own path, and on mine, there's been a lot of lessons learned, a lot of right and wrong decisions made, and now I think I'm on a really good path to just try to get to where I want to get, where I believe I can get to -- and that's still the top of the game.\" And each time he enters the Roland Garros grounds, those memories of 2017 act as a reminder of what's possible. \"Although the court that I won on is not even there anymore, when I'm in the grounds, I feel good all the time, it's great. \"That junior win was extra special, being the first Aussie in I don't know how long to have won the title was something amazing. \"And the biggest memory was after I won. I looked into my player's box and saw how happy my parents were, how proud they were. \"That was something for me that I'll never forget; the look on their face. Then after I shook hands with the umpire, I went straight to them, gave them a hug, thanked them for all the sacrifices they'd done, and they were just super proud and happy.\" \"My parents made the decision to leave Australia, which didn't have too many clay courts, when we were super young to go and focus to play on the clay in Spain and that propelled my career to where it is right now.\" Seven years on, his mum and dad will take a trip from their base in Nice in the south of France to watch their boy again in first-round action against Thanasi Kokkinakis in a terrific all-Australian first-round ding-dong on Tuesday. A domestic dust-up against a pal isn't exactly ideal for Popyrin and neither was a recent food poisoning episode and an abdomen muscle tear that interrupted his encouraging start to the season. \"But I feel like my game is somewhat back to what it was early on in the year,\" enthuses the man who earned his biggest win on clay against the defending champion Andrey Rublev, then the world No.6, in Monte Carlo in April. \"I definitely do feel anything's possible this fortnight. For example, (Nicolas) Jarry last week in Rome reached the final and he hadn't won a match since Miami. \"You're always going to have at least one or two surprises in the tournament. Who's to say somebody who's not top-seeded won't make semi-finals. I think it's possible; hopefully it's me.\"",

In its advice, the DWP stated that verifying a claimant's identity \"helps to link the right person to the right claim and reduce identity fraud \". There are several methods you can use to verify your identity for Universal Credit, including online identity verification, face-to-face appointments, documentary evidence, and biographical interviews. In a recent update, the DWP has released a comprehensive list of ID documents that new claimants will need to bring to the Jobcentre if they are asked to attend a face-to-face interview. You'll need to provide three pieces of evidence at your face-to-face interview: one photo ID, one proof of address, and one additional \"further proof of identity\". The DWP stated: \"Depending on your circumstances, details of what evidence you need to provide will be discussed with you when you apply for Universal Credit.\" Below, we've outlined the updated and official list of ID documents you'll need to confirm your identity when claiming Universal Credit. Photo ID This can include any of the following: Passport from any country Photocard driving licence (full or provisional) NHS identity card with a biometric chip Armed forces or police identity card PASS card (National Proof of Age Standards Scheme) Biometric residence permit (BRP) showing you’re allowed to stay in the UK for six months or more Foreign national identity card (but not identity cards issued under the UK National Identity Scheme) Immigration status document or other travel document showing you’re allowed to stay in the UK indefinitely Certificate of naturalisation as a British citizen, which shows you’re allowed to work in the UK Foreign photocard driving licence with an international driving permit, valid for up to 12 months from the date you entered the UK A residence permit, registration certificate or other document showing your right to live permanently in the UK, if you’re a national of the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein Permanent residence card issued to a family member of a national of the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein Proof of address This can include any of the following: Mobile phone, landline phone, gas, water or electricity bill dated within the last six months Bank, building society, credit card or credit union statement, dated within the last six months Current Council Tax statement UK full or provisional photocard driving licence (if not already used as photo ID) UK full paper driving licence Vehicle registration documents Your most recent tax notification from HMRC (for example, tax assessment, statement of account, notice of coding) Any other correspondence from HMRC (but not a P45 or P60) Mortgage statement Letter from your employer Letter from a school, college or university Buildings, contents or vehicle insurance policies Life insurance or assurance policies Council rent card or tenancy agreement Proof from the electoral register that you live at the address Personal loan account statement Student loan documents Letter from an accountant or solicitor Certificate from a utility supplier showing you use a pre-payment arrangement at your address, dated within the last six months Further proof of identity This can include any of the following: Current debit, credit, or store card with a statement confirming the details on the card P45 or P60 Savings account book Personal cheque book Or any of the following if not already used to prove your address: Mobile phone, landline phone, gas, water or electricity bill dated within the last six months Bank, building society, credit card or credit union statement, dated within the last six months Current Council Tax statement Current or recent payslip or pension statement, dated within the last six months Your most recent tax notification from HMRC (for example, tax assessment, statement of account, notice of coding) Student loan documents Mortgage statement Council rent card or tenancy agreement Personal loan account statement Buildings, contents or vehicle insurance policies Life insurance or assurance policies Certificate from a utility supplier showing you use a pre-payment arrangement at your address, dated within the last six months Utility bills can be used for proof of address and as further proof of identity if they are from different suppliers",

        "description": "The Raiders are moving their training camp from Henderson to California this summer. It’s not the only time they’ve switched locations in their history.",
        "content": "The Raiders will move away from their Henderson facility this summer and take their training camp on the road to Costa Mesa, California . It’s a decision that returns the franchise to their roots. The Raiders have prepared for upcoming seasons away from their usual home base for much of their history. Here is where the team has held training camp over the years: 1960-1962 The Raiders spent their first three seasons training about 70 miles south of Oakland in the coastal town of Santa Cruz, California. The team worked out at Santa Cruz High School while trying to gain a foothold in the American Football League. The surf town’s climate was ideal. The field was anything but. Divots and gopher holes littered the grass surface. 1963-1984 The story goes that new coach Al Davis was driving north on Highway 101 when he first spotted the El Rancho Tropicana Hotel in Santa Rosa, California. It was a sprawling property with 50 rooms spread out over several buildings. It also had enough space to build the practice fields and team facilities the Raiders would need for training camp. It served as the team’s summer workout spot for the next two decades. There were several legendary stories that came out of the Raiders’ years in Santa Rosa. Hall of Fame linebacker Ted Hendricks was responsible for several of them. Hendricks once brought an umbrella, a table and two chairs from a local restaurant and set them up on the field. He then had a rookie serve as his waiter between practice sessions. Hendricks also famously rode a horse he borrowed from a local resident onto the field one day. He dismounted at the 50-yard line and declared himself ready to practice. 1985-1995 The Raiders moved on from Santa Rosa in 1985. But they stuck to the concept of hosting their training camp at a hotel next to their practice fields. The Raiders’ next summer home was Oxnard, California. They stayed at the Hilton in 1985 and 1986, then set up shop at the Radisson Suite Hotel from 1987 to 1995. The city, which now hosts the Cowboys’ training camp, offered the Raiders a favorable deal soon after the franchise relocated to Los Angeles in 1982. The team paid just $1 per year in rent to Oxnard. The city also footed the bill for maintaining the fields and helped finance the construction of the Radisson Suite Hotel. 1996-2019 The Raiders returned to Oakland for the 1995 season. They brought camp back to Northern California the following summer, this time staying at the Marriott Hotel in Napa. It was a great setup. A walking path led to the practice fields and an outdoor weight room at Redwood Middle School. The site became the longest-running training camp location in franchise history. The irony is it wasn’t the Raiders’ first choice. The team hoped to return to Santa Rosa after moving back to Oakland. But the El Rancho Tropicana Hotel had closed down and been cleared away to make room for the Santa Rosa Marketplace discount shopping center. Redwood Middle School ended up becoming a fortuitous host in more ways than one. One of its alumni is Brock Bowers, the Raiders’ 2024 first-round pick . 2020-2023 The Raiders still hoped to have their training camp in Napa after relocating to Las Vegas in 2020. There was also talk Reno or Southern California could be in the mix as potential hosts. The COVID-19 pandemic changed that. The Raiders stayed put and held camp at their spectacular state-of-the-art facility in Henderson instead. The sweltering heat was not ideal, but the comforts of being at home (not to mention the cost) gave the organization little reason to move elsewhere its first few years in Las Vegas. 2024 This year the Raiders will take over Jack Hammett Sports Complex , the training-camp home of the Chargers for the last decade, for several weeks during the summer. It’s a short-term deal that will make the Raiders one of five teams to hold their training camp in Southern California. The other clubs holding workouts in the area are the Chargers, Rams, Saints and Cowboys. Contact Adam Hill at ahill@reviewjournal.com. Follow @AdamHillLVRJ on X.",

        "description": "These women chose to embrace their body hair – bush and all. Despite being trolled for ditching the razor, they are certainly unflappable forces to be reckoned with",
        "content": "The bush is back – and has been for some while as women ditch the razor in their droves. However, just because many are opting to embrace their natural body hair, it doesn't mean that female body fuzz is accepted by all. These beauties have to battle off trolls on the regular but often get the last laugh by earning a fortune on adult sites. And they are also hounded by admirers willing to pay hundreds for snaps. Here, we take a look at three models from across the globe who have decided to embrace the bush and beat off trolls trying to stop them in their tracks. Cam girl Maya Petite doesn't have any plans on shaving her pubic hair – unless the price is right. The 24-year-old, who lives in Yorkshire, ditched the razor just before she sacked off medical school six years ago. Since then, the new mum has let her body hair flourish in the name of being fully natural. Despite believing her body hair is 'sexy', one bloke – who is both a fan and a hater – once managed to convince Maya to get rid of her pits and bits hair. He trolled Maya calling the model \"disgusting\" for not shaving. But ridicule wasn't the factor that made her trim off the bush and underarm hair – it was the £10,000 he paid her to do it. : \"I was doing a cam show and the client in question saw my hairy armpits at the time. He told me he found them disgusting but was still attracted to me, and asked me to shave. \"I told him I’d consider it for £10,000 and the rest is history. They wanted me to shave because, in their words, I was perfect apart from my body hair... \"It grows back pretty quick on me seeing as I have thick Pakistani hair, so I didn’t even think twice about shaving it for that much money.\" Down Under's fuzziest model Aimee feels sexy with her bushy below – or her 'furry mic' as she calls it. Like Maya, the Aussie's opinions of her own body seem to not matter to The brunette, who boasts thousands of social media followers, admitted that she's heard every insult and joke \"under the sun.\" But she's the one who is truly laughing after being able to quit her full-time childcare job for modelling thanks to her natural beauty. \"I have probably heard every insult, joke, comment under the sun about being a woman with hair,\" Aimee told Daily Star. \"It never fails to humour me how triggered a little bit of hair can make people...it's literally just hair. \"If you head to my you will be inundated with comments, most of which either refer to my armpit hair making me 'unhygienic and gross' or others referring to how my bush is displeasing to the eye and that men would never want to 'explore my jungle' so to speak. \"And to this, I just have to laugh.\" Hairy by name, hairy by nature. Self-titled 'Hairy Cherry' proved that leaving her bikini line alone was a choice well made. The American model and content creator claimed to make £39,000 a month from her fuzzy photos. She was even paid £5,500 to never touch her body hair again, and it turned into a very profitable venture for Cherry. But, with success – jealousy and hate surely follow. Cherry often gets comments on her social media profiles from strangers and that she looks like she \"smells.\" The model even gets laughed at on the bus by kids who say she has \"monkey arms.\" Luckily, this doesn't dampen Cherry's spirits. She told us: \"Mostly guys (and some girls too) telling me to shave, calling me gross and unhygienic, that I look like I smell. \"Men seem to have this idea that when women have hair it’s unhygienic, but when they have it it’s just normal and fine. \"Sometimes I try to encourage them to do some research and discover it’s actually less hygienic to shave. \"Having razor burn sucks and I refuse to experience that ever again just so a man can feel a 'prepubescent' smooth vagina. \"I think it’ll only be normalized when more women start doing it [not shaving].\"",

        "description": "Over 70 initiatives are set to receive funding from the county after commissioners voted to award $1.5 million in grants.",
        "content": "Emergency housing assistance, case management for individuals experiencing addiction and music education programs are among some of the over 70 initiatives set to receive funding from the county. County commissioners voted Tuesday to approve awarding $1.5 million in outside agency grant requests, many of which will support specific initiatives of nonprofit agencies and local governments. Over 200 applications with $14.6 million in funding requests were received by the county, but just 73 were selected for the board’s consideration. Many organizations requested more than what was approved, but nonprofit leaders said they were grateful for the county’s support nonetheless. Some of the recipients: -Project REAL, an organization that aims to inform youth about the law,received a little over $47,400 for a teen independence initiative. Despite the grant amount being significantly less than the approximately $150,000 requested, the organization is “incredibly grateful,” said Mike Kamer, the organization’s executive director. The initiative provides high schoolers with a 200-page “Adulting 101” book and aims to reduce poverty and improve workforce readiness by providing people with information that hasn’t generally been taught in schools, Kamer said. The funding will go towards paying a staff member to deliver the books and give a presentation on preventing domestic violence at those schools. -Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation of Nevada, an organization that provides resources to families with children that have been diagnosed with cancer, was awarded $10,000 to support its emergency housing assistance program. Candlelighters CEO Kimberly Kindig said children’s cancer treatments can last between two and half to three years and often one parent has to quit their job to care for the child, which places a large financial burden on families. “Having a safe place for their family, especially when your child is medically fragile, it’s the utmost important thing for these families as they’re trying to do this,” she said. The program allows families with a child currently being treated for cancer locally to request rental or mortgage assistance twice a year. Kindig said the organization is “really thrilled” to receive the funding. -Life By Music received $75,000 to fund instrument donations, scholarships for music programs and several of the organization’s music education programs, many of which teach children about dance and music instruments. Ryan Boylan, the founder of Life By Music, said the county’s grant is “life-changing.” “We’re in Las Vegas, and boom, we hit Megabucks as far as having a support team with the commissioners, the county, to say ‘Hey, we believe in what you guys are doing. We see your track record,’” Boylan said. “There is nothing more, in my opinion, more empowering for a young child and adult to have the option to express themselves through music and the arts,” he said. -Vegas Stronger, a nonprofit focused on homelessness and addiction treatment, received $20,000 for its comprehensive case management program. CEO Dave Marlon said the program can mean helping clients obtain housing and identification, which is often offered alongside critical care. “No one should be sleeping outside while they’re going through a recovery process, so helping them get housing, to sleep in a bed, is of critical importance to us,” Marlon said. -Nevada State University received $15,000 to support tuition needs at its Early Childhood Center preschool program. Professor of Early Childhood Education Youngae Choi said many students at NSU are non-traditional students, and many have children of their own. “I think this might be a really great opportunity for student parents,” Choi said.",

        "description": "WARNER BROS.With 'Furiosa' in theaters, 'Fury Road' is back in action, too. We rounded up the rest of the most popular TV shows and movies now.",
        "content": "Every single week, our TV and film experts will list the most important ten streaming selections for you to pop into your queues. We’re not strictly operating upon reviews or accrued streaming clicks (although yes, we’ve scoured the streaming site charts) but, instead, upon those selections that are really worth noticing amid the churning sea of content. There’s a lot out there, after all, and your time is valuable. Some flavor is on display here, this time with a skeptical psychologist joining a Catholic priest-in-training while they dive into alleged demonic possessions and other such unexplained mysteries inside the church. It’s the fourth and last season of this streaming series, and if you are so inclined, hop on board before you miss catching any “live” discussions. Can logic or the supernatural eventually prevail as official explanations, or why not both? It’s a dynamic that never gets dull. Luca Guadagnino’s quickly Zendaya’s “threesome” movie even though the movie does not actually deliver on that suggestion, which makes the movie . Z stars as Tashi, a tennis dynamo who suffers a career-ending injury. She later coaches her husband, Art (Mike Faist), whose rivalry with Patrick (Josh O’Connor), reignites on the court. Cue explosive potential and Tashi as a force of controlling nature. A little bit of surfaces in this at-first overlooked series (created by Jez Scharf) about podcasters going into detective mode in an Irish town that harbors secrets. Will Forte stars alongside Siobhán Cullen and Robyn Cara, and here’s an unexpected development: this is the first Netflix-produced drama series from Michelle and Barack Obama’s Higher Ground production house. No Marvel movie wants to be , but that’s precisely what happened here as soon as Dakota Johnson was heard uttering that line about researching spiders in the Amazon. It’s safe to say that this show will not receive a hopeful re-release in theaters like its Jared Leto-starring Sony predecessor, but there are still enough people that either want to watch ironically or simply see what the anti-hype was all about. Quite handily, Netflix has the movie as part of its streaming package. If it feels like David Dastmalchian is low-key everywhere these days, well, that’s kind-of true. The and actor is popping up in a zillion projects, but here, he gives a masterful leading man performance as TV host Jack Delroy, whose quest to fix his ratings takes a turn into Hell. This movie is a rare found-footage project that does that gimmick right, and whether Delroy is speaking to his TV audience (such as it is), or Dastmalchian is winking and nodding to those of us in our real homes, this film is riveting while playfully batting around the horror tropes of yesteryear. This show simply will not stop riding the top of Netflix’s charts, and surely, creator, writer, and star Richard Gadd never expected to land on the all-time Top 10 list, which is due to happen pretty damn soon. In other words, watch out , , and . Meanwhile, Gadd is moving past the trauma of his past to work on his next project, , in which he will not star but will still no doubt compel viewers. If you haven’t caught yet, know that it’s an intense and stressful watch, and it’s not exactly a true-crime series, but the public’s fascination with the based-on-real-life story could arguably qualify it as such. This story is totally not based on Harry Styles but is, yes, pretty much based on Harry Styles in his One Direction days. Nicholas Galitzine portrays the pop singer who falls for a cool Coachella mom because, c’mon, she looks exactly like Anne Hathaway. Readers of Robinne Lee’s May-December novel have been pleased by the leading pair’s chemistry and the escapism while romance seems to be ruling in May like it’s February or something. With (starring Anya Taylor Joy and Chris Hemsworth) out there in theaters now, there’s no time like yesterday to refresh on the action extravaganza starring Charlize Theron, Tom Hardy, and Nicholas Hoult. Enjoy watching Charlize in total badass mode and Tom Hardy hopping aboard with Imperator Furiosa while they zoom around the Wasteland in the War Rig and attempt to evade Immortan Joe. Now that Josh Brolin’s Royal Abbott has put his true “time traveler” identity out there, get ready for this neo-Western series that remains the most show currently on TV. As viewers recall, the reappearance of “the void” coincided with the arrival of the mysterious Autumn (Imogen Poots), and the chess (and poker) game that followed kept everyone on their toes. This season, Autumn’s true identity is now under the microscope. We also we learn whether Cecilia will continue to put up with Royal’s long-standing BS and whether she (or Autumn) will push Royal right back where he came from. The wait for the final four episodes of the season is on, but for now, viewers are content to relive their favorite moments so far of the Penelope-Colin story, which reached the halfway point with a rocking’ Carriage Ride that lived up to the expectations of Julia Quinn’s readership. Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton must now go forth to stumble into the reality of her alter ego becoming public. This promises to be a giddy and possibly heartbreaking endeavor, but surely, Shondaland will not disappoint viewers who want these two together, so that the fourth season can revisit them as newlyweds. This show has persisted marvelously after some predicted that The Duke’s departure would not bode well. Fortunately, Anthony and Kate dispelled that myth, and Queen Charlotte kept the franchise fires hot in the interim.",

        "description": "The Dodgers have one of the best records in baseball, but are they really as good as that so far this season?",
        "content": "Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston Mitchell , and on this Memorial Day, let us remember what is truly important: not whether the Dodgers win or lose, but those who died in service to this country so we can sit around and worry about the Dodgers. The Dodgers are 33-22, on pace to win 97 games, have a 51⁄2-game lead in the NL West and the sixth-best record in baseball (second-best in the NL, tied with Atlanta, which just lost Ronald Acuña Jr. for the season with a torn ACL). In light of their recent offensive slump (they are 7-8 in their last 15 games, scoring 3.7 runs per game in that span), how much of that record is a real reflection of how good they are? The team with the best record in the NL, the Philadelphia Phillies (38-16) share one thing with the Dodgers: Neither have played a game against a team that is in first place. They are the only teams in baseball that have yet to do that. Here’s how the Dodgers have fared against teams this year, with run differential against that team included. vs. Arizona, 3-3 (+3) Atlanta, 3-0 (+14) Chicago Cubs, 1-2 (-6) Cincinnati, 3-4 (-4) Miami, 3-0 (+11) Minnesota, 2-1 (+4) New York Mets, 1-2 (+3) San Diego, 3-5 (-2) San Francisco, 5-1 (+14) St. Louis, 3-1 (+9) Toronto, 2-1 (+10) Washington, 4-2 (+13) Against teams that are .500 or better, the Dodgers are 14-9 (.609) with a +24 run differential. Against teams below .500 they are 19-13 (.576) with a +45 run differential. They have played a soft schedule, but have actually done better against winning teams. They play to the level of their opponent. And they are only 11-9 (.550) against NL West teams, when they usually clean up against their own division. A look at their record against NL West teams in previous years: 2023: 34-18 (.654) 2022: 54-22 (.711) 2021: 50-26 (.658) 2020: 27-13 (.675) 2019: 51-25 (.671) 2018: 45-32 (.584) The Dodgers play only 52 games against the NL West this season. It’s a strange schedule. They play San Francisco June 28-30 and July 22-25 and then don’t play them again. Meanwhile, they play Colorado 13 times the rest of the season, including six of the last nine games. At their current pace, the Dodgers would be expected to go 29-23 against the NL West. You have to go back to 2018, when the Dodgers finished with 92 wins, to find a record close to that “bad.” They’ve won 100 games in a season every full year since then (and were certainly on pace to in 2020). (Gee, I’m using a lot of parentheses in this newsletter.) Let’s see how the Dodgers have done in other situations: Home: 19-11 Road: 14-11 March: 4-2 April: 15-11 May: 14-9 Extra-inning games: 3-3 One-run games: 6-5 Blowout (win or lose by at least five runs): 10-4 Interleague: 4-2 Record in one-run games is often a sign of a quality team. The teams that succeed often in those are usually the teams that do all the little things right and have a good bullpen. Let’s look at how the Dodgers have done in those games the last few years. 2023: 16-15 2022: 16-15 2021: 24-24 2020: 7-5 2019: 27-22 2018: 22-22 Hmmm, perhaps we see at least one reason why the Dodgers struggle in the postseason. They are used to bludgeoning their opponent with their offense, so when the postseason comes around, and the games get tighter, the Dodgers get tighter. The Dodgers of the last few seasons have never been good at situational hitting and manufacturing runs. I’m not talking about bunting. No team does that anymore, and few players are able to do it well. The White Sox and Cardinals lead the majors with nine each. The Dodgers have two. No, I’m talking about the things that often go unnoticed that can hurt them in the postseason. Take, for example, Saturday’s loss. The Reds brought reliever Sam Moll in to pitch the eighth inning. It was Moll’s third consecutive game, and he hadn’t pitched in three consecutive games in two years. Chris Taylor , the number nine hitter in the lineup, leads off. Now, a hitter there might think to himself, “Hey, this guy might tire easily today. The best hitters are coming up behind me. I’ll try to work the count and see if we can tire him a bit.” But, Taylor swung at the first pitch and flied out. A complete waste of an at-bat. Remember Kirk Gibson backing out of the box before the full-count pitch from Dennis Eckersley in the 1988 World Series? As he backed out, he was remembering the words of scout Mel Didier . Before that game, the Dodgers were going over the A’s pitchers and what to look for. Didier recounts, “When we got to Eckersley, and it was my turn to speak, I used my best Southern drawl and said, ‘Pardners, you can bank on this as sure as I’m standing here. If you’re a left-handed hitter and you get in a tough, tough situation with Eckersley, he’s going to throw you that back-door slider.’” Well, when the count went full on Kirk, the players tell me that everyone on the bench was whispering, ‘Back-door slider,’ and Kirk told me later that he stepped out of the batter’s box and kind of laughed and smiled to himself because he could see me standing there talking about it. He said: ‘Mel, I knew what I was going to get, picked it up as soon as it left his hand and hit it as hard as I could.’ ” You have to wonder if anyone even told the Dodger hitters that Moll would be working his third straight game for the first time in two years, and depending on the game situation, it might be wise to work the count. And that brings me to the bigger point here. The Dodgers are going to win the division. They will make the postseason. Will they win the World Series? I have no idea. And neither do you. But I do know that they make it awfully difficult on themselves by not always doing the little things right, like situational hitting. If you noticed Shohei Ohtani running at less than full speed during the triple he hit during Saturday’s game, there’s a reason. Dave Roberts said after the game that Ohtani has a bruised right hamstring. “It’s more of just kind of managing that hamstring,” Roberts said. “But today was better than yesterday. And we just need him in there. So we didn’t want to push it. ... It was in the homestand where he got hit when he was on first base on a throw over, and it hit him in the right hamstring. And I think that’s where it kind of started. So, the good thing is that it wasn’t a strain. It was a contusion that we’re just trying to manage.” Maybe it’s just me, but I might sit him a game or two just to be on the safe side. The almighty, invincible (at least, that’s what many told me before the season) Dodgers have lost five in a row. Not a time to panic yet, but as we’ve discussed many times in this newsletter already, the bottom of the lineup is going to kill them if they don’t figure out a solution. Anyway, here are the longest losing streaks each season since they started making the postseason in 2013: 2024: 5 2023: 4 (finished 100-62) 2022: 4 (111-51) 2021: 4 (106-56) 2020: 2 (43-17) 2019: 6 (106-56) 2018: 6 (92-71) 2017: 11 (104-58) 2016: 6 (91-71) 2015: 5 (92-70) 2014: 3 (94-68) 2013: 8 (92-70) The team that had the longest losing streak in that span is the team that many consider the best: 2017. They lost 11 in a row and 16 of 17. That’s why it’s far too early to panic. Concerned, yes. Panicked, no. Were you wondering why Dave Roberts went to the mound Sunday after Yohan Ramirez hit two batters with pitches, and basically embraced him? Jack Harris asked him after the game : “He’s emotional and cares, and he’s trying to impress with a new ballclub,” Roberts said. “I just tried to reassure him and give him some confidence, love on him a little bit, and try to take a little bit of pressure off.” “You just see the player, and you kind of feel what he’s got going on in his brain, in his heart, all that stuff,” Roberts added. “Sometimes I’m sure — I’ve never thrown a major league inning — but you feel like you’re on an island. So I wanted to show that we were all behind him.” Ramirez hit two batters in Friday’s game too and has hit seven batters in 17.1 innings with three teams this season. Those of you hoping for a computer-called strike zone will have to wait a while longer. Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said that he doesn’t expect something like that in the majors until 2026 at the earliest. And Manfred would rather see it as a challenge system, where the batter can dispute a strike call, rather than a computer making all the calls (which sounds like a great way to slow down the game again). “There’s a growing consensus in large part based on what we’re hearing from players that the challenge form should be the form of ABS, if and when we bring it to the big leagues, at least as a starting point,” Manfred said . “I think that’s a good decision.” An interesting part of Steve Henson’s story : Since the beginning of the pitch-tracking era in 2008, MLB umpires have improved their accuracy in calling balls and strikes every year, according to FanGraphs . Accuracy has spiked from 81.3% to 92.4%. Expressed another way, incorrect calls have been reduced by nearly 60% in 15 years. The Fangraphs study also noted that before pitch tracking, umpires were much better at identifying balls than strikes, meaning that the improved accuracy of the last 15 years has increased the number of strikes. That likely is a contributing factor to the current cumulative batting average of .240, the lowest since 1968. “If the league were to implement a robo-zone tomorrow without changing the strike zone at all, the offensive environment would instantly get even tougher,” Davy Andrews of FanGraphs wrote a year ago. “I’m not trying to scare anybody away from our techno-future, but maybe we should all watch Terminator one last time before we flip the switch.” Are you in favor of an automated ball-strike system, or would you prefer it to remain with the umpires?

        "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya, May 27 – The National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA) has ordered the closure of pubs near schools. The authority said the move is aimed at protecting school children from alcohol and drug abuse. “The initiative is anchored on the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act of 2010, which stipulates that such establishments must be situated no less than three hundred (300) meters away from nurseries, primary schools, secondary schools, or other educational institutions serving individuals below the age of eighteen (Section 12(1)(C)),” NACADA noted. NACADA Chief Executive Officer Anthony Omerikwa said the agency is conducting a crackdown in coordination with relevant national and county government agencies to ensure strict adherence to the legal criteria for the placement of these establishments. Omerikwa emphasized that the strict crackdown will serve as a reminder to all community members of their responsibility to promote the safe growth and wellness of children. The Alcoholic Drinks Control Act of 2010 imposes criminal penalties on anyone who distributes alcoholic beverages in prohibited areas. The penalties can include a fine of up to Sh500,000, a maximum three-year jail sentence, or both. See author's posts",

        "content": "Some of the areas for which drones are being deployed in Dublin include mapping, inspecting dangerous buildings and emergency response services. Dublin City Council (DCC) has published its first strategy on drone technology today (27 May) that will see the creation of a dedicated drones unit to oversee their use in emergency services and building inspections. Known as the Drone and Urban Air Mobility Strategy 2024-2029, the plan aims to put Dublin “at the forefront of this urban innovation” according to Eileen Quinlivan, assistant CEO and chair of the drones high-level steering group at DCC. “This strategy marks a significant milestone for Dublin City Council. By embracing drone technology, we are not only enhancing our service delivery but also paving the way for a smarter, more sustainable city,” Quinlivan said. “Drones will revolutionise how we approach various tasks, from emergency response and infrastructure inspections to environmental monitoring and urban planning. The benefits for our staff and citizens are immense.” According to the DCC, the strategy will inform how Dublin utilises drones to enhance public services as more and more of the mobility technology gets applied in city services ranging that increase efficiency, reduce costs and streamline operations. Some of these areas include mapping, inspecting dangerous buildings and emergency response services. They are also being used to access to hard-to-reach areas for surveys and environmental monitoring to provide better oversight and management of urban spaces. Jim Gavin, CEO of the Irish Aviation Authority, expressed his support for the strategy – which was led through the Smart City programme to bring emerging technologies to Dublin – and said it will “drive innovation and development” in the drone sector. “By harnessing the potential of drones, Dublin City Council is taking proactive steps to enhance public safety, improve efficiency, and foster economic growth,” Gavin said. “We believe that this initiative will pave the way for advancements in urban air mobility, benefiting both the public and the broader aviation industry.” One of the experts who provided DCC with guidance for the strategy was Julie Garland, CEO and founder of former Start-up of the Week, Avtrain. “Drones are revolutionising how we think about urban mobility and public service delivery. Dublin’s strategy is a step towards a future where drone technology can improve our daily lives, enhance safety and contribute to a more sustainable environment,” Garland said. “By integrating drones into various city services, cities can streamline operations, reduce response times in emergencies, and provide more efficient monitoring of infrastructure and environmental conditions.”",

        "description": "The 64-year-old Italian, heading into his ninth Champions League final, says the fear will always come nearing the final, ‘but before it does, I’m going to enjoy it’.",
        "content": "The best advice Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti can give his players as they prepare to face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final is to enjoy the moment, he said on Monday. Heading into his ninth Champions League final – his sixth as a manager and third with Real, who are bidding for a record-extending 15th European crown and sixth in 10 years – the 64-year-old Ancelotti believes his players have the experience to cope with the emotions. “It is a week to enjoy. The challenge, the opponent ... We’re going to enjoy it until Friday. Reaching a final is always a success,” the Italian told a news conference on Monday. “We have a lot of confidence. As for being favourites, we don’t think about that. We have to play against a team that has done very well in eliminating PSG ... Atletico Madrid. They have shown commitment and attitude.” Known for his calmness and tactical acumen, Ancelotti is one of the most successful coaches in the world, the first manager to win titles in each of Europe’s top five leagues. When he was lured back to Madrid for a second spell in 2021 following the departure Zinedine Zidane, he knew his only mission was to increase Real’s trophy haul. Having won the Champions League twice as AC Milan manager and with Real in 2014, the Spaniards’ “Decima” (10th) European crown, before being sacked 12 months later, Ancelotti led the Spanish giants to their 14th title in 2022. They knocked out Chelsea, Paris St Germain and Manchester City to reach the final in Paris, where they beat Liverpool 1-0. After securing the La Liga title with four games to spare, Ancelotti has been able to rest players. “The build-up to the big game is always the same, the excitement to be a protagonist in the most important match of the season,” Ancelotti said. “This is my ninth final if I count those as a player. The three as a player and the sixth as a coach. It’s always the same week: happiness and then worry. The fear will come, but before it does, I’m going to enjoy it. “The cold sweat comes on Saturday afternoon. It’s quite normal, it comes every match and I have experience. I have a lot of confidence in my team. They are in Champions League mode.” Ancelotti kept his cards close to his chest over who will be Real’s goalkeeper at Wembley. Thibaut Courtois has started four games since returning from a serious knee injury but Andriy Lunin was Real’s hero when they beat Manchester City on penalties to reach the semis. “Both deserve to play in the final. Lunin has done spectacularly and Courtois – we all know the quality he has,” Ancelotti said.",

        "description": "Jung Hoo Lee, Austin Slater and Luis Matos all had run-ins with the chain-link portion of the outfield fence on the Giants' past home stand.",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO — When Austin Slater, and then Jung Hoo Lee, and then Luis Matos, who miraculously escaped unscathed, went crashing into the same vicinity of the outfield fence of Oracle Park on the same home stand earlier this month, it elicited a new topic of discussion among the Giants’ fan base. What purpose does that chain-link portion serve? Why not pad the entire wall? If that quirk contributed to the Giants’ growing list of injured players, should it exist at all? Turns out, fans weren’t the only ones asking those questions. Before first pitch this past weekend at Citi Field, Slater huddled outside the third base dugout with the head of the club’s training staff, Dave Groeschner, and its second-ranking baseball official, general manager Pete Putila. They checked in on Slater’s progress in concussion protocol, and then Putila shifted gears to his curiosity regarding what could have potentially led to the third and most severe concussion of Slater’s career and the stunning string of injuries. “It’s something that I think we need to talk about. I mean, there’s other fields like that around the league. But we had three plays like that in the span of, what, three days?” Slater said. “It’s something that I think was on Pete’s mind. He was asking about it. I think if the front office believes that it’s something that could help, I would imagine that they’ll make a change. If they think it was just a freak play, maybe that didn’t have an impact, then maybe they won’t. I don’t feel super strongly about it one way or another. If there’s a way to reduce potential risk, then it’s worth exploring.” Putila confirmed that he raised the topic with Slater, but said it was more of a fact-finding mission. The front office is open to hearing from its players and wants to maximize their health and safety — they’re paying them to be on the field, after all — but they weren’t considering any immediate changes. The segment of the wall in question exists in two places along the flat stretch in center field, 391 feet from home plate, where the green padding present in the rest of left and center field recesses into two cutouts that provide each team’s relievers a view of the game from their respective bullpens through the chain-link. It would hardly be unprecedented to adjust the alignment of the bullpens or the outfield wall at Oracle Park. In 2020, the team moved the bullpens from foul territory, where they had existed since the ballpark opened in 2000, to their current location, reducing the distance from home plate to the center field wall by 8 feet and the height of the wall, from 8 feet tall to 7 feet. To consider another change, the front office would have to determine what impact the original alterations may have had. As reliever Ryan Walker noted, “I don’t remember anything like that happening last year.” “Obviously what’s happened is unfortunate and we don’t want that to happen at all, but I think the make of the fence isn’t really the pure reason for that,” added outfielder Mike Yastrzemski. “It’s just bad luck.” Assistant pitching coach J.P. Martinez was positioned on the bullpen bench inches beyond the warning track as Slater gave chase to a deep drive from Cincinnati’s Spencer Steer. He yelled, “Fence!” as Slater quickly closed ground, but it was too late. The outfielder’s body sank into the chain-link and his head collided with the top of the wall. In Lee’s case, two days later, the rookie center fielder attempted a home run robbery of the Reds’ Jeimer Candelario but hit the wall awkwardly, separating his left shoulder from its socket. Lee will require season-ending surgery, and while Matos averted a similar fate making a spectacular leaping grab in the same area later on the home stand he still banged up his knee going into the chain-link. “Slater probably hits his head on the wall there, regardless. Jung Hoo’s arm is still going to hit the wall when he’s coming down. So it’s not necessarily a construction issue,” Yastrzemski said. “It’s just unfortunate accidents where guys are playing as hard as they possibly can and putting their bodies on the line. Sometimes that’s what happens.” Yastrzemski has become a master at navigating the unique dimensions of the Giants’ home ballpark, especially its trickiest areas around Triple’s Alley and the brick wall in right field, but it’s something he’s learned through trial and error in five-plus seasons of playing there. He once sprained his thumb jumping into the bricks, so when Mookie Betts lined a ball toward the wall when the Dodgers were in town this month, Yastrzemski instead planted a cleat in the bricks and used that to leverage his body upward, rather than into the hard surface. “Having already experienced that before I tried to use my surroundings a little better and recognize that I could put a cleat in the wall to get myself going vertical,” Yastrzemski said. “I think any outfielder will tell you no matter what wall is out there, you’ve got to figure out a way to play it. It’s just a matter of putting in as many reps and as much effort into know your surroundings and trying to play as safely and aggressively as possible.” In the aftermath of his injury, Lee acknowledged that he would maybe have to think twice about going all-out for fly balls in the future, which might have comforted the Giants, coming from a man in whom they invested close to $130 million and who in six weeks had numerous run-ins with outfield walls. One complicating factor in Lee’s case, he told team officials, was that home run robberies weren’t a common occurrence in Korea. The outfield walls are typically much taller, making any effort to bring one back negligible. Slater also mentioned the height of the wall, that chain-link cutouts are common around the league — they existed at both ballparks the Giants visited on their most recent road trip — but where they are at Oracle is lower than most other parks. The chain link also isn’t aligned with the padding, creating a gap of 6-8 inches. Bringing the opening flush with the wall “potentially” could help, Slater said. “Just to help you keep your body square. I think what happened with me was my body went in (to the cutout) and my head just hit the top of the wall,” Slater said. “Maybe there is something with the indent of the fence and how that can affect how you bounce off the wall. But I think one of my other concussions I ran into a flat-facing wall, too. A lot of it is just how your body is positioned when you hit it and how fast you’re going when you hit it.” Not to be forgotten: the dozen or so pitchers and coaches on each side who use the cut-out as their viewing angle for the game. Without the see-though chain link, the only options for watching the action from the bullpens would be to perch high up on a bench to peek over the wall or to tune in on a television monitor. Related Articles “Is there anything more important than keeping our outfielders healthy?” Walker asked, answering his own hypothetical. “No.” “I mean, Jung Hoo’s had nothing to do with the chainlink fence. It could’ve been plastic,” added Sean Hjelle. “It’s just a super unfortunate moment. It’d be nice to be able to watch the game still. I’d rather be able to see the game and know what’s going on than all of a sudden hear a phone call to get loose.” “If they were to pad it, I don’t know where we’d be able to watch,” Walker continued. “Their health is more important than us watching the game. If it comes to that, I’ll all for it.” So, should the Giants consider changes? Would it help? Or was it just another string of random events in a sport full of them? “It’s hard to say,” Slater said. “But it’s worth exploring.”",

As reliever Ryan Walker noted, “I don’t remember anything like that happening last year.” “Obviously what’s happened is unfortunate and we don’t want that to happen at all, but I think the make of the fence isn’t really the pure reason for that,” added outfielder Mike Yastrzemski. “It’s just bad luck.” Assistant pitching coach J.P. Martinez was positioned on the bullpen bench inches beyond the warning track as Slater gave chase to a deep drive from Cincinnati’s Spencer Steer. He yelled, “Fence!” as Slater quickly closed ground, but it was too late. The outfielder’s body sank into the chain-link and his head collided with the top of the wall. In Lee’s case, two days later, the rookie center fielder attempted a home run robbery of the Reds’ Jeimer Candelario but hit the wall awkwardly, separating his left shoulder from its socket. Lee will require season-ending surgery, and while Matos averted a similar fate making a spectacular leaping grab in the same area later on the home stand he still banged up his knee going into the chain-link. “Slater probably hits his head on the wall there, regardless. Jung Hoo’s arm is still going to hit the wall when he’s coming down. So it’s not necessarily a construction issue,” Yastrzemski said. “It’s just unfortunate accidents where guys are playing as hard as they possibly can and putting their bodies on the line. Sometimes that’s what happens.” Yastrzemski has become a master at navigating the unique dimensions of the Giants’ home ballpark, especially its trickiest areas around Triple’s Alley and the brick wall in right field, but it’s something he’s learned through trial and error in five-plus seasons of playing there. He once sprained his thumb jumping into the bricks, so when Mookie Betts lined a ball toward the wall when the Dodgers were in town this month, Yastrzemski instead planted a cleat in the bricks and used that to leverage his body upward, rather than into the hard surface. “Having already experienced that before I tried to use my surroundings a little better and recognize that I could put a cleat in the wall to get myself going vertical,” Yastrzemski said. “I think any outfielder will tell you no matter what wall is out there, you’ve got to figure out a way to play it. It’s just a matter of putting in as many reps and as much effort into know your surroundings and trying to play as safely and aggressively as possible.” In the aftermath of his injury, Lee acknowledged that he would maybe have to think twice about going all-out for fly balls in the future, which might have comforted the Giants, coming from a man in whom they invested close to $130 million and who in six weeks had numerous run-ins with outfield walls. One complicating factor in Lee’s case, he told team officials, was that home run robberies weren’t a common occurrence in Korea. The outfield walls are typically much taller, making any effort to bring one back negligible. Slater also mentioned the height of the wall, that chain-link cutouts are common around the league — they existed at both ballparks the Giants visited on their most recent road trip — but where they are at Oracle is lower than most other parks. The chain link also isn’t aligned with the padding, creating a gap of 6-8 inches. Bringing the opening flush with the wall “potentially” could help, Slater said. “Just to help you keep your body square. I think what happened with me was my body went in (to the cutout) and my head just hit the top of the wall,” Slater said. “Maybe there is something with the indent of the fence and how that can affect how you bounce off the wall. But I think one of my other concussions I ran into a flat-facing wall, too. A lot of it is just how your body is positioned when you hit it and how fast you’re going when you hit it.” Not to be forgotten: the dozen or so pitchers and coaches on each side who use the cut-out as their viewing angle for the game. Without the see-though chain link, the only options for watching the action from the bullpens would be to perch high up on a bench to peek over the wall or to tune in on a television monitor. “Is there anything more important than keeping our outfielders healthy?” Walker asked, answering his own hypothetical. “No.” “I mean, Jung Hoo’s had nothing to do with the chainlink fence. It could’ve been plastic,” added Sean Hjelle. “It’s just a super unfortunate moment. It’d be nice to be able to watch the game still. I’d rather be able to see the game and know what’s going on than all of a sudden hear a phone call to get loose.” “If they were to pad it, I don’t know where we’d be able to watch,” Walker continued. “Their health is more important than us watching the game. If it comes to that, I’ll all for it.” So, should the Giants consider changes? Would it help? Or was it just another string of random events in a sport full of them? “It’s hard to say,” Slater said. “But it’s worth exploring.”",

        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO — When Austin Slater, and then Jung Hoo Lee, and then Luis Matos, who miraculously escaped unscathed, went crashing into the same vicinity of the outfield fence of Oracle Park on the same home stand earlier this month, it elicited a new topic of discussion among the Giants’ fan base. What purpose does that chain-link portion serve? Why not pad the entire wall? If that quirk contributed to the Giants’ growing list of injured players, should it exist at all? Turns out, fans weren’t the only ones asking those questions. Before first pitch this past weekend at Citi Field, Slater huddled outside the third base dugout with the head of the club’s training staff, Dave Groeschner, and its second-ranking baseball official, general manager Pete Putila. They checked in on Slater’s progress in concussion protocol, and then Putila shifted gears to his curiosity regarding what could have potentially led to the third and most severe concussion of Slater’s career and the stunning string of injuries. “It’s something that I think we need to talk about. I mean, there’s other fields like that around the league. But we had three plays like that in the span of, what, three days?” Slater said. “It’s something that I think was on Pete’s mind. He was asking about it. I think if the front office believes that it’s something that could help, I would imagine that they’ll make a change. If they think it was just a freak play, maybe that didn’t have an impact, then maybe they won’t. I don’t feel super strongly about it one way or another. If there’s a way to reduce potential risk, then it’s worth exploring.” Putila confirmed that he raised the topic with Slater, but said it was more of a fact-finding mission. The front office is open to hearing from its players and wants to maximize their health and safety — they’re paying them to be on the field, after all — but they weren’t considering any immediate changes. The segment of the wall in question exists in two places along the flat stretch in center field, 391 feet from home plate, where the green padding present in the rest of left and center field recesses into two cutouts that provide each team’s relievers a view of the game from their respective bullpens through the chain-link. It would hardly be unprecedented to adjust the alignment of the bullpens or the outfield wall at Oracle Park. In 2020, the team moved the bullpens from foul territory, where they had existed since the ballpark opened in 2000, to their current location, reducing the distance from home plate to the center field wall by 8 feet and the height of the wall, from 8 feet tall to 7 feet.

In Lee’s case, two days later, the rookie center fielder attempted a home run robbery of the Reds’ Jeimer Candelario but hit the wall awkwardly, separating his left shoulder from its socket. Lee will require season-ending surgery, and while Matos averted a similar fate making a spectacular leaping grab in the same area later on the home stand he still banged up his knee going into the chain-link. “Slater probably hits his head on the wall there, regardless. Jung Hoo’s arm is still going to hit the wall when he’s coming down. So it’s not necessarily a construction issue,” Yastrzemski said. “It’s just unfortunate accidents where guys are playing as hard as they possibly can and putting their bodies on the line. Sometimes that’s what happens.” Yastrzemski has become a master at navigating the unique dimensions of the Giants’ home ballpark, especially its trickiest areas around Triple’s Alley and the brick wall in right field, but it’s something he’s learned through trial and error in five-plus seasons of playing there. He once sprained his thumb jumping into the bricks, so when Mookie Betts lined a ball toward the wall when the Dodgers were in town this month, Yastrzemski instead planted a cleat in the bricks and used that to leverage his body upward, rather than into the hard surface. “Having already experienced that before I tried to use my surroundings a little better and recognize that I could put a cleat in the wall to get myself going vertical,” Yastrzemski said. “I think any outfielder will tell you no matter what wall is out there, you’ve got to figure out a way to play it. It’s just a matter of putting in as many reps and as much effort into know your surroundings and trying to play as safely and aggressively as possible.” In the aftermath of his injury, Lee acknowledged that he would maybe have to think twice about going all-out for fly balls in the future, which might have comforted the Giants, coming from a man in whom they invested close to $130 million and who in six weeks had numerous run-ins with outfield walls. One complicating factor in Lee’s case, he told team officials, was that home run robberies weren’t a common occurrence in Korea. The outfield walls are typically much taller, making any effort to bring one back negligible. Slater also mentioned the height of the wall, that chain-link cutouts are common around the league — they existed at both ballparks the Giants visited on their most recent road trip — but where they are at Oracle is lower than most other parks. The chain link also isn’t aligned with the padding, creating a gap of 6-8 inches. Bringing the opening flush with the wall “potentially” could help, Slater said. “Just to help you keep your body square. I think what happened with me was my body went in (to the cutout) and my head just hit the top of the wall,” Slater said. “Maybe there is something with the indent of the fence and how that can affect how you bounce off the wall. But I think one of my other concussions I ran into a flat-facing wall, too. A lot of it is just how your body is positioned when you hit it and how fast you’re going when you hit it.” Not to be forgotten: the dozen or so pitchers and coaches on each side who use the cut-out as their viewing angle for the game. Without the see-though chain link, the only options for watching the action from the bullpens would be to perch high up on a bench to peek over the wall or to tune in on a television monitor. “Is there anything more important than keeping our outfielders healthy?” Walker asked, answering his own hypothetical. “No.” “I mean, Jung Hoo’s had nothing to do with the chainlink fence. It could’ve been plastic,” added Sean Hjelle. “It’s just a super unfortunate moment. It’d be nice to be able to watch the game still. I’d rather be able to see the game and know what’s going on than all of a sudden hear a phone call to get loose.” “If they were to pad it, I don’t know where we’d be able to watch,” Walker continued. “Their health is more important than us watching the game. If it comes to that, I’ll all for it.” So, should the Giants consider changes? Would it help? Or was it just another string of random events in a sport full of them? “It’s hard to say,” Slater said. “But it’s worth exploring.”",

        "description": "Jung Hoo Lee, Austin Slater and Luis Matos all had run-ins with the chain-link portion of the outfield fence on the Giants' past home stand.",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO — When Austin Slater, and then Jung Hoo Lee, and then Luis Matos, who miraculously escaped unscathed, went crashing into the same vicinity of the outfield fence of Oracle Park on the same home stand earlier this month, it elicited a new topic of discussion among the Giants’ fan base. What purpose does that chain-link portion serve? Why not pad the entire wall? If that quirk contributed to the Giants’ growing list of injured players, should it exist at all? Turns out, fans weren’t the only ones asking those questions. Before first pitch this past weekend at Citi Field, Slater huddled outside the third base dugout with the head of the club’s training staff, Dave Groeschner, and its second-ranking baseball official, general manager Pete Putila. They checked in on Slater’s progress in concussion protocol, and then Putila shifted gears to his curiosity regarding what could have potentially led to the third and most severe concussion of Slater’s career and the stunning string of injuries. “It’s something that I think we need to talk about. I mean, there’s other fields like that around the league. But we had three plays like that in the span of, what, three days?” Slater said. “It’s something that I think was on Pete’s mind. He was asking about it. I think if the front office believes that it’s something that could help, I would imagine that they’ll make a change. If they think it was just a freak play, maybe that didn’t have an impact, then maybe they won’t. I don’t feel super strongly about it one way or another. If there’s a way to reduce potential risk, then it’s worth exploring.” Putila confirmed that he raised the topic with Slater, but said it was more of a fact-finding mission. The front office is open to hearing from its players and wants to maximize their health and safety — they’re paying them to be on the field, after all — but they weren’t considering any immediate changes. The segment of the wall in question exists in two places along the flat stretch in center field, 391 feet from home plate, where the green padding present in the rest of left and center field recesses into two cutouts that provide each team’s relievers a view of the game from their respective bullpens through the chain-link. It would hardly be unprecedented to adjust the alignment of the bullpens or the outfield wall at Oracle Park. In 2020, the team moved the bullpens from foul territory, where they had existed since the ballpark opened in 2000, to their current location, reducing the distance from home plate to the center field wall by 8 feet and the height of the wall, from 8 feet tall to 7 feet. To consider another change, the front office would have to determine what impact the original alterations may have had. As reliever Ryan Walker noted, “I don’t remember anything like that happening last year.” “Obviously what’s happened is unfortunate and we don’t want that to happen at all, but I think the make of the fence isn’t really the pure reason for that,” added outfielder Mike Yastrzemski. “It’s just bad luck.” Assistant pitching coach J.P. Martinez was positioned on the bullpen bench inches beyond the warning track as Slater gave chase to a deep drive from Cincinnati’s Spencer Steer. He yelled, “Fence!” as Slater quickly closed ground, but it was too late. The outfielder’s body sank into the chain-link and his head collided with the top of the wall. In Lee’s case, two days later, the rookie center fielder attempted a home run robbery of the Reds’ Jeimer Candelario but hit the wall awkwardly, separating his left shoulder from its socket.

        "content": "J ust a few days after arriving at a hospital outside Rafah in the Gaza Strip, Dr Omar El-Taji – a urologist who usually works in Manchester – was woken up at 2am to operate on an urgent case. “A man in his 30s was brought in after his entire building was bombed,” he says. “He had an open wound to his abdomen, his hand was falling off, and his ankles were completely mangled.” The man was quickly taken into the operating room. “The shrapnel had completely sliced through him – I had never seen anything like it,” says El-Taji. The patient survived the surgery, but died two days later after he went into renal failure due to sepsis as there was no dialysis available. “This would not have happened in a healthcare system that was adequately resourced,” he says. El-Taji was part of a group of international doctors who spent three weeks in Gaza, operating under the umbrella of the World Health Organization. It has given them a first-hand look at a health system that has been shattered by Israel’s continuing offensive in Gaza, where two dozen hospitals are no longer operating. The team of medical workers arrived at the European hospital near Khan Younis at the beginning of May with suitcases filled with essential items, including medication, surgical instruments, and boxes of Quality Street. “For the kids,” says El-Taji. “I thought I was mentally prepared,” he says. “But what we witnessed in Gaza was beyond anything I could have imagined.” About 36,000 Palestinians in Gaza have died since Israel started its military offensive last October, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. There have also been more than 400 reported attacks on healthcare facilities and personnel and, according to the ministry, at least 340 healthcare workers have been killed . A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said it was “committed to mitigating civilian harm during operational activity” and “respecting all applicable international legal obligations, including the law of armed conflict”. They said IDF lawyers were also “on hand at all levels of command to ensure that strikes comply with international legal obligations, including proportionality”. As the doctors made their way into the hospital for the first time they say they found thousands of desperate Palestinian families packed into tents and cardboard shelters. Inside, they say they saw displaced families occupying corridors and stairs, making it difficult for them to even get in. “Nothing, absolutely nothing, justifies what we have witnessed here,” says Dr Mohammed Tahir, an orthopaedic surgeon from London. “People bring in their children, who are dead on arrival, and want us to try to resuscitate them – even though their bodies show no sign of life. They then leave carrying the limbs of their dead children in cardboard boxes.” For the doctors, making triage decisions was one of the hardest aspects of the mission. Often decisions had to be made instantly, which in some cases meant leaving severely injured patients to die in order to preserve dwindling resources. The foreign doctors worked alongside Palestinian doctors, many of whom were themselves displaced and living in tents outside the hospital. A key part of the mission is to teach and train local medical staff and students. “The Palestinian medical students are the real heroes,” says Tahir. “They have had their universities destroyed and flock to us for any knowledge we can impart that may help them, help others. They are young volunteers, who aren’t getting paid, but turn up to work every day, trying desperately to prop up a failing health system because the world has failed them.” One day, the doctors say they visited the sites of the destroyed Nasser and al-Shifa hospitals, where the mass graves of hundreds of Palestinians were recently discovered , many stripped naked with their hands tied, according to reports published by the UN human rights office. “It was apocalyptic,” says Dr Laura Swoboda, a wound care specialist from Wisconsin. “The sheer destruction was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Decomposing bodies still stuck beneath the rubble. All around us, we could smell death.” Sign up to Global Dispatch Get a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development team after newsletter promotion As she walked among the debris, Swoboda says she saw overturned ambulances and a burned-out dialysis centre; medical supplies scattered everywhere and the sound of black body bags flapping in the wind. “There were notes scribbled on the walls of theatre rooms by doctors who had been hiding there,” says Swoboda. “And then in the rubble, I came across a human finger. It was like a horror movie.” When Dr Ahlia Kattan and her husband Dr Sameer Khan decided to join the mission, their parents offered to babysit. After months of seeing horrific videos of injured and dead Palestinian children on their social media feeds, the couple from California were left wondering, what if these children had been their own. During their time in Gaza, the couple, who are both anaesthetists, saw hundreds of patients – the majority of them women and children. But there was one case in particular that Kattan says she cannot get out of her mind. “One day I went to the emergency room and lying on a stretcher was a small boy, the exact same size as my four-year-old son; his ashened baby hands were becoming toddler hands,” says Kattan. “His name was Mahmoud and he was a victim of an Israeli bombing campaign that left more than 75% of his body burnt. His eyebrows were singed off, his hair smelt of smoke.” Mahmoud lay crying in pain as Kattan unwrapped his wounds; an ultrasound revealed a shattered spleen and crushed lungs. “We did not have the resources to save him and he died in front of us – cold and in pain with no one who knew him,” she says, holding back tears. “I wish I could have protected him. He was only four.” As Israel began its assault on Rafah in May, the doctors say bombs started landing a few hundred metres from their clearly marked safe house. Loud explosions shook the walls of their rooms while outside, the sound of artillery fire became constant. One night, the doctors decided it was no longer safe and scrambled out, still wearing their scrubs, and moved into the European hospital, where they slept on the floor. From there, the doctors say the situation steadily worsened. The hospital became low on fuel and the generator often stopped working during surgeries, plunging theatre rooms into darkness. The medical supplies the doctors had bought were also running out. Since their evacuation, they say no one has been able to replace them – leaving the European hospital with even fewer workers to look after patients with increasingly fewer resources. Despite the danger they faced, since returning home, many of the doctors have had mixed feelings about leaving Gaza. “As I woke up for the first time without the sounds of airstrikes and gunfire, my thoughts immediately went to those I left behind” says El-Taji. “We can’t look away. In the face of such immense suffering, we all have a duty to act.”",

        "description": "Erik ten Hag has guided Man United to two trophies in two years and the club is reviewing his second season before deciding his future.",
        "content": "Manchester United are considering retaining Erik ten Hag as their manager for next season. United officials have notified representatives of potential replacements that they have not discounted the possibility of keeping the Dutchman after he guided the club to their 13th FA Cup triumph over Manchester City on Saturday. Ten Hag, 52, is under contract at United until next year and the club has the option of an additional year. United have assessed a number of possible successors and have held dialogue with intermediaries in recent weeks. The club have stressed a review of the season will begin this week and no decision or action will happen before that review is complete. Ipswich Town manager Kieran McKenna withdrew as a candidate to take over at Chelsea as his preferred destination would be United. Former United coach McKenna is reluctant to rush into a decision after leading Ipswich Town back up to the Premier League , though. READ MORE: Amrabat and Mainoo great - United player ratings vs City READ MORE: United get a glimpse of a possible new era after stunning City Chelsea favour the Leicester coach Enzo Maresca as Mauricio Pochettino's successor, with former Brighton coach Roberto De Zerbi also under consideration. Leicester are already scouring for a new coach. Former Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel and Pochettino, jettisoned by Chelsea last week, would relish the chance to manage United . Pochettino has coveted the United job for years and the majority of the players were in favour of the Argentinian taking over in the summer of 2022. United's then-football director John Murtough opted for Ten Hag . A report on Friday claimed Ten Hag would be sacked no matter the result of the FA Cup final. External sources have expected Ten Hag to be dismissed on account of United's failure to qualify for the Champions League . United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has declined to offer Ten Hag assurances over his future as United consider their options since he agreed a minority stake on Christmas Eve. Ratcliffe and the Ineos Group members now involved in the running of United have hired a new chief executive in Omar Berrada and head-hunted Dan Ashworth to become their inaugural sporting director. Former chief executive Richard Arnold and football director Murtough have both left, as have interim chief executive Patrick Stewart and chief financial officer Cliff Baty. Despite United's dismal league form, Ratcliffe feels the club's structure has been more problematic than the manager and he has resolved to address it through the appointment of Berrada, who will officially start work on July 13. Dan Ashworth is still on gardening leave at Newcastle and United have failed to make any headway with his intended appointment. This season's eighth-place finish was United's lowest since 1990 and they suffered a Premier League-era record 14 defeats. United's uplifting FA Cup victory secured Europa League qualification and Ten Hag is the first manager to secure silverware in successive seasons since Sir Alex Ferguson in 2011. United are preparing for another squad rebuild and are open to offers for every player apart from Andre Onana, Kobbie Mainoo, Alejandro Garnacho and Rasmus Hojlund. The club have invested more than £400million in signings under Ten Hag.",

        "description": "It's taken Game Dev Tycoon studio Greenheart Games a full decade to put this thing together, and it shows.",
        "content": "Game Dev Tycoon was a bit of a phenomenon back in the day. Released in 2012, Greenheart Games' first major title quickly achieved viral success due, in part, to being a neat little management game about the industry itself—making it a popular choice for YouTubers and streamers. Over a decade later, the studio's ready to put its next game out into the wild: Tavern Keeper, a game about, well, keeping taverns. I had the chance to sit down with Patrick Klug, director and manager of Greenheart Games, and had an early peek into the game itself. At a glance, Tavern Keeper looks like a cosy little inn management game—and it is—but the more time I spent looking at it, the more little elements of craft revealed themselves to me. In Tavern Keeper, you're given run-down inns to manage as you progress through a small handful of key locations. Think Two Point Hospital, but you're running a bar full of unruly patrons rather than a medical nightmare. To progress, you'll need to accrue stars by fulfilling various objectives—hiring staff, designating and decorating rooms, and making sure your guests are happy with their ales and sundry. Your first fix'er upper is in a little muddy swamp called Riverbottom, and I'm immediately charmed when a lovingly-animated ogre paddles down the river to sell you casks of ale. The game's clearly flooded with little touches like this—and while I think the cinematic trailer Greenheart Games showed back in Gamescom 2023 is cute, it doesn't quite sell how nice everything looks in practice. Everything's got this OSRS style low-poly look to it that's like liquid nostalgia. I was shown a hiring list as Klug made his first step towards building up his tavern—and there's a lot of character injected into these funny little guys already. Your staff come with various traits and aptitude in different skills, as well as complicated histories: Consider Bron, who was let go from his past two taverns for \"making patrons disappear\" and \"booby-trapping the tavern\", or Gavin, who hates riddles. Me too, Gavin. It's all very Discworld in nature, which is something Klug emphasises as a key inspiration: \"I think it's much more towards Discworld than Lord of the Rings. Our stories are not really about heroes and adventurers, it's more like this anachronistic, quite modern kind of thing with a bit of heart and humour.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As you continue to refit and rehome your inn, you'll also be presented with \"stories\", little choose-your-own adventure vignettes that can do everything from providing brief mechanical bonuses to giving you unique staff, such as a skeleton who got tired of guarding a dungeon and wants to pursue his dreams. \"There isn't really a story where you 'fail',\" Klug explains: \"If you make stories too mechanical, then you get players not actually caring about the story—they care about the outcome, so they click through and get to what they want, like, 'I want plus two food'.\" If you've ever played Wildermyth (which I highly recommend), Tavern Keeper's stories appear to work very similarly. The more Klug plays, the more I get a sense for the level of detail at play—later in the game, players can toy with not only drinks, but food recipes too. Cut to a bespoke, fully-animated and rendered section of the menu where he hucks some swamp rats into a bowl with water, each ingredient having its own varying trait Potionomics-style. Neat, I think so far. This all looks like it's had a lot of care gone into it. Klug then selects a cabinet, goes into \"detail mode\", and nonchalantly reveals to me that it comprises 114 pieces he can grab, scale and rotate at will. Excuse me? Tavern Keeper buries the lede a lot with its furniture customisation, which is about as granular as you can get. Players can create their own pieces for their tavern by clipping, rotating, and scaling various assets to their heart's content. The same kind of ingenuity that can be found in MMO housing communities is also explicitly possible here. Players can save templates they create in design mode (or grab a share code to allow other players to use them) and bring them into their next tavern. There's even a debug-style grid map with every single asset loaded in that's available to players, giving them carte blanche to tinker with infinite money. Tavern Keeper will be heading into early access late this year—though Klug and his team plan to release a demo before then. I'm personally very impressed already by what Greenheart Games had to show off, and I hope that the full game will stand up to scrutiny once the general public gets their hands on it, especially since it's been in the oven for so long.",

        "description": "How should a station improve its chances, asks radio columnist Richard Wagoner.",
        "content": "It could be a sign of the times or an indication that I’m not far off. But when I say that talk radio KABC (790 AM) — the station that originated the format in Los Angeles if not the world — has become irrelevant , few emails arrived with ideas to make it better. I’ll still give you a chance to respond before printing the replies, so make sure you send over your thoughts if you have them. But let me take a little time to spark the creative forces. First off, talk radio is definitely not dead. Far from it: KFI (640 AM) is consistently a top-five station and often higher than that in the local Nielsen radio ratings. This is similar to the heyday of KABC itself when it often was found at the top of the ratings in an era when Top 40 KHJ (930 AM) ruled the world. One thing that history has shown, however, is that being the second talk station in this town is exceedingly difficult. Those that have come and gone in the format, to varying degrees, include KLAC (570 AM), KMPC (now KSPN 710 AM) ... twice ... and others long lost to memory. Currently, we have KRLA (870 AM), and KEIB (1150 AM) ... neither of which make what I would consider an appreciable mark in the ratings. It seems that no matter what, Los Angeles has the capacity to host only one English-language talk station at a time. Or more accurately, more than one full-time English-language talk station at a time. There are examples of stations with other formats running special talk programs, such as when KFI added sex advisor Dr. Ruth Westheimer to the evening shift while still playing music for the rest of the day. KMPC itself was tremendously successful playing music with various talk shows and sports programming sprinkled throughout the broadcast day or on weekends during much of the 1970s. Would a modern version of “full service” work today? I believe so, and it is definitely one of the directions KABC could move. The music played would be determined by the desired audience, as could the topics discussed between the songs. Imagine a modern version of Wink Martindale or Gary Owens complete with advertisements personally read by the host — so you can justifiably charge more for the advertising — and you get the idea. In fact, you don’t have to imagine: It’s done every morning and afternoon on multiple stations (KLOS 95.5 FM, Alt 98.7 FM, KROQ 106.7 FM). People don’t tune in to “The Woody Show,” “Klein/Ally,” “Kevin and Sluggo” or “Booker and Stryker” for the music or the conversation ... they tune in for both. And the personally read advertisements are more entertaining than anything prerecorded. Current KABC afternoon star John Phillips, with his quick wit and ability to have fun with important topics, could do this very easily. Add in a few specialty shows, a solid news department, and perhaps even popular sports teams play-by-play, and I believe you’d have a winning combination. The key, of course, is to make it fun and appeal to a younger, or at least wider, audience. The banter could be silly, or serious, or both. Today’s younger generation is concerned about or interested in the same things as older generations were when we were younger: the economy, housing affordability, careers, dating, marriage, children, places to go, what to see, what to drink. Let them connect to others going through the same thing. Sound too difficult? It’s not. But one format missing on local AM is music, and it is another direction KABC could move. Again, depending on what age of audience you want to attract, you could easily run anything from oldies to progressive metal. The sound-quality issue is moot due to the way so many listen to music or podcasts – on phone speakers, using sub-par headphones, or portable Bluetooth speakers. We’re not talking hi-fi here. Further, I have long held that programming on AM pushed listeners to FM in the past just as so much of FM programming today pushes listeners to online music services. But it’s not impossible to get them back. Personally, I’d run a format of adult Top 40 ... harder than KOST (103.5 FM) and My FM (KBIG, 104.3), a little less edgy than KIIS (102.7 FM), a few of the better hits from Alt 98.7, and importantly, far more current than all of them. The vast majority of music should be from the last year or at most two, with a few oldies each hour for spice. Use weekends for special presentations, such as the Guilty Pleasures Weekend – songs you love but would never admit to your friends that you like. That basic premise is the format that made KHJ and KCBQ famous. Want a younger audience? Stop playing so many songs that appeal primarily to older listeners. Once the format is set, I’d turn my attention to marketing. You have to get the word out as to what you offer, otherwise people won’t find you. Go to the high schools and colleges with your air staff that includes high school and college-aged young men and women. Host special fun events that bring communities together. Present concerts. Have contests at the local beaches. Hang out with the station van at various Original Tommy Burgers. Hit every community. Get bumper stickers out and use them for contests as well. Marketing is so vitally important, and yet it is the first thing too many radio stations — and other businesses — cut ... perhaps the most ironic move ever made by radio stations that exist solely to market and promote. Is it risky? If the station already had ratings, yes. But it doesn’t. It has been decades since KABC even tried. So there is absolutely no risk ... and a chance to set the radio world on fire.

        "description": "How should a station improve its chances, asks radio columnist Richard Wagoner.",
        "content": "It could be a sign of the times or an indication that I’m not far off. But when I say that talk radio KABC (790 AM) — the station that originated the format in Los Angeles if not the world — has become irrelevant , few emails arrived with ideas to make it better. I’ll still give you a chance to respond before printing the replies, so make sure you send over your thoughts if you have them. But let me take a little time to spark the creative forces. First off, talk radio is definitely not dead. Far from it: KFI (640 AM) is consistently a top-five station and often higher than that in the local Nielsen radio ratings. This is similar to the heyday of KABC itself when it often was found at the top of the ratings in an era when Top 40 KHJ (930 AM) ruled the world. One thing that history has shown, however, is that being the second talk station in this town is exceedingly difficult. Those that have come and gone in the format, to varying degrees, include KLAC (570 AM), KMPC (now KSPN 710 AM) ... twice ... and others long lost to memory. Currently, we have KRLA (870 AM), and KEIB (1150 AM) ... neither of which make what I would consider an appreciable mark in the ratings. It seems that no matter what, Los Angeles has the capacity to host only one English-language talk station at a time. Or more accurately, more than one full-time English-language talk station at a time. There are examples of stations with other formats running special talk programs, such as when KFI added sex advisor Dr. Ruth Westheimer to the evening shift while still playing music for the rest of the day. KMPC itself was tremendously successful playing music with various talk shows and sports programming sprinkled throughout the broadcast day or on weekends during much of the 1970s. Would a modern version of “full service” work today? I believe so, and it is definitely one of the directions KABC could move. The music played would be determined by the desired audience, as could the topics discussed between the songs. Imagine a modern version of Wink Martindale or Gary Owens complete with advertisements personally read by the host — so you can justifiably charge more for the advertising — and you get the idea. In fact, you don’t have to imagine: It’s done every morning and afternoon on multiple stations (KLOS 95.5 FM, Alt 98.7 FM, KROQ 106.7 FM). People don’t tune in to “The Woody Show,” “Klein/Ally,” “Kevin and Sluggo” or “Booker and Stryker” for the music or the conversation ... they tune in for both. And the personally read advertisements are more entertaining than anything prerecorded. Current KABC afternoon star John Phillips, with his quick wit and ability to have fun with important topics, could do this very easily. Add in a few specialty shows, a solid news department, and perhaps even popular sports teams play-by-play, and I believe you’d have a winning combination. The key, of course, is to make it fun and appeal to a younger, or at least wider, audience. The banter could be silly, or serious, or both. Today’s younger generation is concerned about or interested in the same things as older generations were when we were younger: the economy, housing affordability, careers, dating, marriage, children, places to go, what to see, what to drink. Let them connect to others going through the same thing. Sound too difficult? It’s not. But one format missing on local AM is music, and it is another direction KABC could move. Again, depending on what age of audience you want to attract, you could easily run anything from oldies to progressive metal. The sound-quality issue is moot due to the way so many listen to music or podcasts – on phone speakers, using sub-par headphones, or portable Bluetooth speakers. We’re not talking hi-fi here. Further, I have long held that programming on AM pushed listeners to FM in the past just as so much of FM programming today pushes listeners to online music services. But it’s not impossible to get them back. Personally, I’d run a format of adult Top 40 ... harder than KOST (103.5 FM) and My FM (KBIG, 104.3), a little less edgy than KIIS (102.7 FM), a few of the better hits from Alt 98.7, and importantly, far more current than all of them. The vast majority of music should be from the last year or at most two, with a few oldies each hour for spice. Use weekends for special presentations, such as the Guilty Pleasures Weekend – songs you love but would never admit to your friends that you like. That basic premise is the format that made KHJ and KCBQ famous. Want a younger audience? Stop playing so many songs that appeal primarily to older listeners. Once the format is set, I’d turn my attention to marketing. You have to get the word out as to what you offer, otherwise people won’t find you. Go to the high schools and colleges with your air staff that includes high school and college-aged young men and women. Host special fun events that bring communities together. Present concerts. Have contests at the local beaches. Hang out with the station van at various Original Tommy Burgers. Hit every community. Get bumper stickers out and use them for contests as well. Marketing is so vitally important, and yet it is the first thing too many radio stations — and other businesses — cut ... perhaps the most ironic move ever made by radio stations that exist solely to market and promote. Is it risky? If the station already had ratings, yes. But it doesn’t. It has been decades since KABC even tried. So there is absolutely no risk ... and a chance to set the radio world on fire.

        "content": "A LASH artist has weighed in on what to avoid when getting lashes done. She gave the 411 on achieving a more glamorous look without sacrificing what you were born with. Redditor Wise-Grapefruit7817 asked the question on the social media platform. A Redditor asked for advice for growing back natural eyelashes after having extensions Like many beauty fans, she found that getting the cosmetic treatment made her natural hairs a bit weaker than before. \"I started extensions for the first time a few months ago and I just stopped getting them refilled to find my natural lashes are basically gone,\" she said. \"Is this normal? Any tips for regrowth?\" A professional lash artist came through with advice on how to get natural eyelashes back to their former state. \"Hi, lash artist of 11 years here, and I just wanted to say first you can use a serum to grow your lashes however you have to be careful of which one you choose,\" she said. \"Some of them have irreversible side effects such as skin and eye discoloration/color change.\" She offered up her go-to product to regrow lashes. \"The best one is called RevitaLash, if purchasing in California , it’ll be called RevitaBrow,\" she said. A six-week supply of RevitaLash Advanced is sold for $59. However, the pro said she wouldn't go straight for the big guns. \"I personally would say just let your natural lashes grow back without the use of any serums,\" she said. The lash artist also gave some recommendations for looking for an eyelash technician in the future. She advised to \"search for an artist that uses some type of magnification to do lashes, preferably surgical loupes.\" The surgical loupe technique can help with lash loss, she added. \"If you’re lucky enough to find a tech who uses surgical loupes, it significantly cuts down on damage because they can see each and every hair like a surgeon would,\" she said. \"Damage can also happen if multiple natural lashes are glued together, each natural lash is on its own growth cycle. \"So let’s say three lashes are glued together and two of the lashes are ready to grow, that thirrd lash is going to slowly and painfully be pulled out prematurely. This is how 80% of damage happens. \"A client can contribute to this by not washing their lashes everyday. \"Lashes can be stuck together with eye mucus, blepharitis, and makeup — and just like the glue — [those] can make you lose lashes prematurely.\"",

        "description": "Jessica Ellis, a combat medic, was killed in action in Iraq in 2008 after she volunteered for a mission.",
        "content": "The knock at the door came at nighttime on Mother's Day 2008 in Oregon, where Jessica Ellis' parents lived. It was around 9:20 p.m. and his wife, Linda, was already in bed; her father Steve Ellis told CBS News, that he thought someone let their animals out — but two soldiers in Class A uniforms were standing at the door. \"You know why they're there. I mean, they don't have to say a thing,\" Steve Ellis said. Corporal Jessica Ellis was killed in action in Iraq in 2008. She was 24 years old. Military Women's Memorial Ellis , a combat medic assigned to the 2nd Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division in Iraq, had volunteered a second time for a mission to clear a route. It was her second deployment to the region. She primarily accompanied combat engineers on clearance missions to look for roadside bombs, but this time, their vehicle was hit by three projectiles. Everyone had to exit through a back door. Ellis didn't make it. She was 24 years old. \"Neither one of us envisioned losing a daughter in combat,\" her father said. \"Life is never really the same after that.\" Rising numbers of women in the military, rising fatalities Women make up about 16% of the nation's military – the largest percentage in America's history, partly fueled by the opportunity to serve in all positions including combat. But as the number of women serving in the military has grown, so have fatalities. Since the global war on terror began in 2001 , 179 female military members have been killed in action – surpassing other U.S. wars or engagements. Eight military women were killed in Vietnam. \"The Department of Defense is proud of the bravery and sacrifice made by all service members who have given their lives in defense of our nation,\" a spokesperson told CBS News. A special tribute exhibit at the Military Women's Memorial on Jessica Ellis and the women military soldiers killed in action during the Global War on Terror. Military Women's Memorial Still, said Marilla J. Cushman, the president's senior adviser at Military Women's Memorial, a D.C.-based organization that tells the collective story of women's service, women have made great strides and are now serving at every level in the military. She said women are \"driving tanks, commanding thousands of people, and flying fighter planes,\" something that wasn't possible when she served in the Army for 25 years. \"I would be proud to stand beside any of these women,\" Cushman said. The ultimate sacrifice Ellis' parents met their daughter's colleagues at Fort Campbell in Kentucky so they could learn more about what happened that night. \"She was such a happy child, she had a warm personality and she lifted her unit up – we got met by hundreds of men and women there,\" said Steve. Her father said they gave her the nickname \"Doc Ellis.\" He said her buddies told them that even after she was gone \"she kept saving lives.\" They explained to her parents that she trained them all to stop bleeding and they used her technique often after she was gone. Corporal Jessica Ellis received a combat medic badge. Courtesy Steve Ellis Just a few weeks before she was killed in action, her father said she had gone out on a similar mission. Her vehicle got hit and she called her parents to them, her father recalled. \"She said her vehicle burned and her aid bag burned,\" Steve said. \"We told her to be careful. But that was the last time we ever talked to her... about three weeks later she was killed.\" Her colleagues helped them piece together what happened. Ellis borrowed an aid bag and volunteered to go back out again. Last April, one of her female medic buddies told her parents that Ellis' injuries from the first blast were worse than they knew. One of her legs got infected from the burn, he said the friend told them. But she didn't want to let her buddies down, Ellis said.

Courtesy Steve Ellis \"Talk about courage she went back out there, she volunteered to go back to our on the mission. There were 21 guys and her, she volunteered to go out again with burns on her leg,\" said Steve. Ellis was emblematic of a combat military that is sacrificing so much to safeguard our freedoms, he said. These women, he said, were dedicated in their service, their sacrifice, and for some \"the ultimate sacrifice for their country.\" More from CBS News A family lost 2 sons during WWII. 80 years later their last child is home.

        "description": "\"It is frustrating and unfair.\"",
        "content": "Lando Norris felt it was “unfair” how the FIA rulebook allowed Carlos Sainz to reclaim his P3 position in Monaco, while McLaren boss Andrea Stella called him “lucky Carlos” for that and escaping punishment after damaging Oscar Piastri’s car. Sainz and Piastri tangled at the first corner of the Monaco GP as they battled over P2, Sainz picking up a puncture in the process and coming to a stop which promoted Piastri’s team-mate Norris to P3, or so he thought. Further chaos unfolded behind as Sergio Perez was involved in a huge shunt with the two Haas cars, triggering the red flags. Sauber’s Zhou Guanyu had not yet exited the first sector, so as per the rules, the restart order was taken from the last point where all remaining cars had their positions determined, which was the safety car two line. That meant Sainz could bolt on a set of hard tyres and resume the Monaco GP in P3, where he finished, which served to irk Norris. “I don’t think it’s the most fair thing, but I’m sure there’s been moments in the past where maybe I’ve been fortunate from it and they fixed the car a little bit or something like that,” said Norris. “When you think of it in just a blunt way, it is frustrating and unfair, that because someone makes a mistake and because of a certain amount of cars or whatever, whatever the rule is, didn’t cross the line before the red flag and blah, blah, that he gets to undo that mistake and gets a free pit stop. It’s unfair.” 👉 Alarming footage captures F1 photographers’ lucky escape in Sergio Perez crash 👉 Lewis Hamilton explains ‘I told you guys’ message to Mercedes at Monaco GP But while Norris was disgruntled with that perceived instance of good fortune, his McLaren boss Stella highlighted another for Sainz, as he said that he was “puzzled” by the fact that Sainz was not punished by the stewards for that Piastri incident or after an impeding investigation after qualifying, also involving Alex Albon. Stella compared the situation to Imola, where Piastri got a three-place grid penalty for impeding Kevin Magnussen. Piastri continued in the Monaco GP after that Sainz hit and would duly finish P2, though Stella claimed the damage inflicted on Piastri’s McLaren was worth “about half a second” in lost lap time, though they were able to roughly half that with repairs during the red flag stoppage. “In terms of the way in which the restart order was determined, I think what the FIA did was the best thing to do,” Stella admitted. “Also it is in agreement with the precedent, whereby you use the safety car line two when sector times are not available. I don’t think using the mini sectors is a good way of doing that. “Obviously, the whole point that saved Carlos was that Zhou had not crossed the sector time at the time the race was suspended. Lucky Carlos. “I think he was lucky today and also with the lenient approach from the stewards, because the collision in corner one obviously created significant damage to Oscar’s car – and this summed up yesterday’s impeding [investigation, where Sainz was not given a penalty after an impeding incident with Alex Albon]. “Like I say, lucky Carlos, this gained him a podium. “We are happy for him but especially with yesterday impeding, we are still a little puzzled as to what the difference was between yesterday and Imola.” With the red flag period taking away the mandatory in-race pit-stop requirement, the top five ran from the restart to the chequered flag on the same set of tyres, the race won by Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc. Norris admitted that there was “not a lot to aim for” other than getting the tyres to the end, as he congratulated team-mate Piastri on his first F1 podium. “I mean, it’s never like that much going on in Monaco, but I think also the red flag simplifies things and made things even less action packed than whatever it normally is in Monaco,” Norris told Sky F1. “So a good result for us as a team. Not a lot to aim for during the race, it’s just get your tyres to the end, don’t make mistakes, which is pretty simple, but I think for what it is, a fourth and a second. And congrats to Oscar for his podium. It’s always a lovely one to have here in Monaco.” A window to pit so nearly opened up for Norris as Mercedes’ George Russell in P5 dropped over 20 seconds behind, but Norris said it was decided that it “wasn’t worth” the risk to make a pit stop, with track position so crucial in Monaco. “It was cuspy and there was those little opportunities,” said Norris, “but at the same time, if you have a slightly slow stop or something, just wasn’t worth it. “So as much as it can help sometimes, there’s always the risks of doing such a thing and if Carlos said he made a little mistake or touches the barrier a little bit, you’re also like, ‘Well, we should have stayed out and not done it’. “You always think of what could you have done, should you have done and it’s impossible to answer it correctly. “But we did what we could, I think the pace was strong from the car today, which is another good positive thing for the future and in the races we’ve been very strong lately. “So yeah, we’ll keep it up. We’ll keep pushing and as let’s say not happy as I am, a fourth and a second for us is still an amazing result.” Norris sits P3 in the Drivers’ Championship and 56 points behind leader Max Verstappen after the Monaco GP.

        "description": "The National Student Financial Aid Scheme plans to begin paying allowances directly into university students’ bank accounts by September as it heads to court to cancel contracts with irregularly appointed direct payment service providers.",
        "content": "The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) plans to begin paying allowances directly into university students’ bank accounts by September as it heads to court to cancel contracts with irregularly appointed direct payment service providers. NSFAS held its first media briefing on Monday since the appointment of administrator Freedom Nomvalo in April by higher education minister Blade Nzimande. Since then, the financial aid scheme has announced a new payment system for technical vocational education and training (TVET) college students to be rolled out at the end of May, due to students not receiving their funds through the appointed service providers. “As it is the end of May, I’m pleased to announce that the payments that are currently being made are directly into students' bank accounts as announced on April 26. We have requested all TVET students who do not have bank accounts to open bank accounts with banks of their choice to avoid delays in the payment of their allowances,” Nomvalo said. NSFAS filed an application to the courts on Friday to terminate its contracts with four payment service providers. This is part of implementing the Werkmans Attorneys report which was commissioned by NSFAS to identify areas needing improvement concerning procurement services and management. The probe followed allegations of irregularities related to the appointment of direct payment service providers, with former NSFAS CEO Andile Nongogo accused of a conflict of interest in awarding the contracts. The report found that Nongogo actively participated in the presentation of proposals by service providers to the bid evaluation committee, which was a violation of NSFAS’ public procurement process. It also revealed that there appeared to be a conflict of interest in the appointment of the four service providers — Ezaga Holdings, Coinvest Africa, Norraco Corporation and Tenet Technologies. Nomvalo said they worked with the Special Investigating Unit in deciding to terminate the contracts. “I am happy to announce that the process to terminate these contracts has commenced with the filing of the necessary court papers on May 24. In the termination of these contracts, NSFAS collaborated with the SIU. Through our lawyers, we have communicated this decision to all the direct payment service providers [on Monday]. Furthermore, we have made significant progress in subjecting all implicated NSFAS employees in the report to appropriate disciplinary action. Where appropriate, we will also consider laying criminal charges,” he said. In the meantime, university students will continue to receive their allowances through the university, as NSFAS had requested the institutions to assist until the end of July. Nomvalo said the rollout was dependent on whether the transition would cause disruptions to academic time, which was a concern raised by universities when he met them on Friday. “We intend to be ready by the end of July but there may be issues that come into play at that time, which is why we initially said September. What will inform the rollout process in September is the smooth transition that avoids further problems in institutions ... What will guide us is to what extent is the introduction of a new mechanism likely to cause disruptions. If it does cause disruption, we will find ways to make sure it is implemented smoothly.” TimesLIVE",

        "description": "The Raiders’ win total opened at 61⁄2 at several Las Vegas sportsbooks. But there’s reason to believe that the team could exceed expectations.",
        "content": "The odds are stacked against the Raiders having a winning season, let alone contending for a division title or making a Super Bowl run. But at least one prominent oddsmaker and one professional sports bettor expect the Raiders to eclipse their regular-season win total. The Raiders’ win total opened at 61⁄2 at Circa Sports, Station Sports, South Point, Caesars, Boyd Gaming and BetMGM sportsbooks. But the Westgate SuperBook opened them at 7. “Most people had the Raiders 61⁄2. We went on the 7 side just because we think there’s a better shot at 8 than 6,” SuperBook veteran NFL oddsmaker Ed Salmons said. “We think the Raiders are farther ahead than they were last year at this time. To me, it’s over or nothing. There’s no way I’d look to bet the Raiders under.” The Raiders also have climbed to 7 at Caesars after the number sat at 61⁄2 (over -160). They are 61⁄2 (over -125) at the South Point. The Raiders went 8-9 last season. They started 3-5 under former coach Josh McDaniels, but finished 5-4 after McDaniels was replaced by interim coach Antonio Pierce. Pierce, who was named the team’s permanent coach in January , benched veteran quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo last season in favor of rookie Aidan O’Connell. The Raiders released Garoppolo in March . O’Connell will compete with veteran Gardner Minshew for the starting job. “We thought that this year’s version of the Raiders has more potential than last year’s,” Salmons said. “Last year, we were kind of thinking on the negative side on the Raiders. I didn’t like Jimmy (Garoppolo) going into the year. “The Raiders fired (McDaniels) and (Pierce) came in and certainly changed the attitude of the team, and they played well down the stretch. They were willing to run the ball and play really good defense and, if you can do that, you can win games in the league.” The Raiders finished ninth in the NFL in scoring defense last season. They allowed only 19.5 points per game. “The Raiders don’t have much in the quarterbacking (department). But their defense is certainly going to be improved. I like their coach, who’s defensive-oriented,” pro bettor Jeff Whitelaw said. “I’m thinking they’re going to be somewhere in the 7- to 8-win range. I would lean to the over a little bit. “I’m not so sure how they’re going to be offensively. But they’ll be very good defensively. They’ll be competitive in a lot of games.” The Raiders are 3-1 underdogs at the SuperBook to make the playoffs and the +845 third choice to win the AFC West. They’re 100-1 long shots to win the Super Bowl. Here’s a quick glance at the rest of the division: AFC West The Chiefs (111⁄2, under -120) are the -220 favorites to win their eighth straight division title. They’re also the 6-1 second choice to win their third consecutive Super Bowl. The Chargers (9, under -130), under new coach Jim Harbaugh, are the +325 second choice to win the division and are 30-1 to win the Super Bowl. The Broncos (51⁄2, over -130) are 20-1 long shots to win the division and 100-1 to win the Super Bowl. “Harbaugh is building the team the way he likes it, which is a strong offensive line, run the ball, have a quarterback that doesn’t make mistakes and play good defense. It just may take a while to get his team into the fold,” Salmons said. “The Chiefs are the Chiefs as long as (quarterback Patrick) Mahomes is there. But as each year goes by, they lose another guy or two off the defense. “The defense is what’s carried this team. As great as Mahomes is, the defense is what won that Super Bowl last year. They were incredible in the playoffs and even better in the Super Bowl. “Denver looks like a total rebuild. That’s a team the Raiders can easily sweep.” Whitelaw is also down on the Broncos. “Denver looks terrible,” Whitelaw said. “Kansas City will win the division, (the Chargers) will come in second, the Raiders will come in third and Denver in fourth. It seems like a pretty predictable division, to be honest with you.” That exact AFC West outcome is the 2-1 favorite at BetMGM. Contact reporter Todd Dewey at tdewey@reviewjournal.com.

        "description": "China’s C919 home-grown, narrowbody passenger jet completed its first commercial flight between Shanghai and Beijing on May 28, 2023.",
        "content": "The C919 – China’s home-grown, narrowbody passenger jet – is designed to carry between 158 and 192 passengers and compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320. It is built by the Shanghai-based state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac). The C919 completed its first commercial flight at the end of May 2023 after 15 years of development. Bearing the symbolic number MU9191, the China Eastern Airlines craft carried over 130 passengers between the two cities in around two hours. Comac delivered a second C919 jet to China Eastern Airlines in Shanghai. 02:34 Why it took China’s home-grown C919 plane 15 years to start flying passengers China Eastern Airlines said it signed a contract with Comac to buy 100 more C919 passenger planes, in addition to the five it ordered in 2021. The airline said five were to be delivered in 2024, while 10 would be delivered annually in the following three years, and 15 would follow each year from 2028 to 2030. Annual deliveries are expected to reach 20 in 2031, it added. 01:15 A closer look at China’s C919 jet Victoria Harbour flyover Comac delivered its third C919 aircraft to China Eastern Airlines for operation on a route between Chengdu and Shanghai. They also agreed to jointly establish a national research centre. Plateau-suited jets are shorter and carry more oxygen cylinders to ensure the aircraft can maintain a continuous supply of oxygen in the event of a depressurisation, while the engines also have more thrust to support sustained flight at higher altitudes where the air is thinner. They are also equipped with more accurate satellite communication systems to suit the complex terrain. 01:54 A look inside China’s home-grown civilian passenger jets, the ARJ21 and C919 The C919 has only been certified by the Chinese regulator. The regular service was expected to be available for two weeks. Two C919s took part in the 2024 edition of the Singapore Airshow, its first-ever international display. 02:01 China’s C919: first home-grown airliner makes international debut The airline said it had negotiated a “rather large price discount” off the listed total of US$10.8 billion for the order. A crew of more than 60 checked the aircraft – referred to as B-919A by China Eastern Airlines – and tested its engines, landing gear and all equipment in the cabin.",

        "description": "The HF120 is the first engine produced as a result of the joint venture.",
        "content": "GE Honda Aero Engines, formed in 2004, is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Honda Aero. The company aims to manufacture low-thrust class (1,000 to 3,500 lbf, 4.4 to 15.6 kN) engines for business aircraft. According to , “Two of the world's most respected names in propulsion have come together to design and manufacture engines for the next generation of very light jets. The joint venture, GE Honda Aero Engines, combines the strengths of two industry leaders recognized for delivering high performance and reliability.” The HF120 is the first engine produced by the company, capable of producing 2,050 lbf (9.1 kN) of takeoff thrust. The HF120 was developed from Honda’s original HF118 prototype, produced at the GE factory in Cincinnati, Ohio. The engine received the Part 33 certification by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2013 and production certification in 2015. According to GE Aerospace, “The HF120 engine, the first product from GE Honda Aero Engines, epitomizes the strengths of GE Aerospace and Honda — advanced manufacturing, significant R&D investments, technology leadership, and strong commitment to customers. The engine is designed to deliver unparalleled performance, reliability, and value to business aviation.” The engine consists of a two-stage low pressure (LP) compressor and a single stage high pressure (HP) centrifugal compressor. The effusion-cooled combustor design allows for greater operational efficiency and lower environmental footprint. The HF120 engine generates significantly low carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide. A turbofan engine is typically constructed as a modular design, split into four or five core modules: fan module, compressor module (including combustor), high-pressure (HP) turbine module, low-pressure (LP) turbine module, and external gearbox module. GE Honda Aero Engines produced the state-of-the-art design by excelling in all engine modules. Moreover, within the HP compressor section, modern fabrication and processing techniques optimize engine efficiency while minimizing carbon and noise footprint and increasing time between overhauls. Some improvements in each module highlighted by the are listed here. With a wide range of enhancements on the original Hf118 prototype, and continuous improvements have enabled the HF120 to have lower operating costs and remain on wing 40% longer than similar engines. Longer time between overhauls also means greater operational reliability and fewer interruptions. GE Aerospace claims that the design directly affects maintenance costs, particularly those caused by foreign object damage. The engine features an increased damage tolerance thanks to the durable yet lightweight design. The manufacturer claims the engine’s high thrust-to-weight ratio enables greater speed and reduced climb time to the cruising altitude. The innovative design of the HondaJet is well supported by the HF120 engine, providing best-in-class durability and fuel efficiency. Greater aircraft payload is supported economically, and longer range is made possible through the three-dimensional aerodynamic design. According to GE Honda Aero Engines, “By reducing weight and incorporating innovative 3D aerodynamic designs, the HF120’s components interact with greater efficiency while optimizing operability. The engine uses a centrifugal impeller designed to operate at state-of-the-art aerodynamic efficiency levels without the need for variable geometry. This is complemented by a unique, effusion-cooled combustor design to deliver exceptional environmental benefits.”",

        "description": "We got a behind-the-scenes insight into new Aberdeen manager Thelin's methods by watching the Swede take a training session at the Boras Arena.",
        "content": "New Aberdeen boss Jimmy Thelin’s tactical acumen was illustrated when a move he worked on in training paid off with a goal the following night in Elfsborg’s 2-0 defeat of Halmstads BK. I watched the 46-year-old manager take his team through a session at the Boras Arena, Sweden, the day before Friday’s Allsvenskan clash at the same venue. It was Thelin’s final home game The training session in searing 30-degree heat offered a fascinating insight behind the scenes as to what Thelin will bring to Pittodrie. Thelin’s training session was conducted on the artificial pitch at the Boras Arena. Sprinklers doused the surface beforehand to make it slick for rapid passing. Thelin’s Elfsborg do not always train on an articifial surface. Opened in 2005, the Boras Arena sits side by side with the club’s former Ryavallen stadium, which remains open. The old stadium is ringed by an athletics track and is primarily used for track and field, but in the centre a grass pitch remains, and Thelin uses that Ryavallen pitch for training on the eve of a match against any team who play on grass. Ahead of the home game against Halmstads (kick-off 7pm Friday), though, Thelin put his team through their paces at Elfsborg’s current stadium, beginning at 10.30am (Thursday). Drill pays off in Halmstads match During training, Thelin worked closely with his assistants Christer Persson and Emir Bajrami who will both join him at Pittodrie. The session began with three groups of eight or nine players congregated in a circle, with one player in the middle. The ball is then passed at speed with the player in the centre tasked with winning possession. It is a standard drill used by many managers to start training sessions. After 10 minutes, Thelin and his assistants then began working on specific tactics. Football mannequins were set up across one half of the pitch with two players on each. They ran beyond the mannequins and created angles when the ball was in play. Then the ball was delivered at pace out wide before an accurate cross-field delivery was swept into the path of a runner on the opposite flank. Immediately a cross was then fired into the box to players who had burst into the penalty area from their starting spot beside the mannequins. In three passes, the ball went from flank to flank and into the box. The overwhelming outcome was an Elfsborg attacker connecting with the cross and firing a shot into the net. Elfsborg then set up to use the entire length of the pitch and began building from the back. That often involved centre-backs passing back and forth, sometimes along the face of goal. Then there was a quick ball upfield to instigate a counter attack with rapid, accurate passes completed by a delivery to runners into the box. There were different variations, but almost always the same outcome – the ball in the box and then in the net within seconds of the attack starting. Just 32 hours later that practise paid off as The move began by passing along the face of goal before a quick counter. In eight accurate passes, the ball was slid into the path of Ahmed Qasem to fire home from six yards against Halmstad. Compact matches and fast passing After that counter-attack drill, Thelin and Elfsborg moved to play nine-a-side within a tight area. The first goal was in the usual spot on the byline with the second set up around 30 yards out. It made for an extremely compact pitch where the onus was on movement, high-tempo passing and engineering an escape from pressure. There were some superb goals scored. After an hour of training, Thelin called time on the session. The heat was intense, there was no cloud cover and they had a game the next day.",

        "description": "As the summer and the intense heat approaches, drivers may want to consider some smart, cheap, and sometimes free solutions to keep their car cool.",
        "content": "Most of us are familiar with the oppressive feeling of getting into a hot car in the summer. According to testing conducted at the State Farm Vehicle Research Facility, the recorded air temperatures inside cars can exceed 145 degrees Fahrenheit, with surface temperatures exposed to direct sunlight surpassing 195 degrees Fahrenheit. Where you live will determine just how bad it can get. In some parts of the country, you can't touch the steering wheel without burning your hands. You may think shorts and sundresses are a great way to stay cool until you get into your hot car and are unable to let your legs touch the seats because they're just too hot. At times like these, you want to blast the A/C and forget about the heat. If you've recently recharged your car's A/C , you should be good to go. However, you'll still have to wait several minutes for it to cool your car down, and until then, you'll be sitting in what feels like an inferno. That's why many people search for hacks to keep their car cool while it's sitting out in the burning sun. After all, the cooler your car is when you get in it, the less time you have to wait for the A/C to kick in to cool it down, which means a lot less suffering for you and a much more pleasant drive. If you live in a state where temperatures soar in the summer months, you might want to consider tinting your car windows. When your windows aren't tinted, sunlight and UV rays enter your car unobstructed, and the surfaces inside your car absorb it. If your windows aren't cracked, that heat builds up and can't escape, resulting in the high interior temperatures cars experience in the summer. Tinted windows are a relatively inexpensive way to lower the temperature of your car by a few degrees, and they can also slow the fading sunlight exposure can cause to its interior surfaces. Tinting works by decreasing the amount of solar radiation that can enter your car, which helps keep the interior temperature cooler. How much you spend on tinting your windows will depend on whether you do it yourself or hire a professional , but you usually won't have to pay more than a few hundred dollars, depending on the size of your car. Before you begin, you'll want to check the laws in your state and keep in mind that dark window tint is banned in almost every state . Using a reflective windshield sunshade is one of the easiest and cheapest ways to keep your car's cabin cool. You can find sunshades and other car accessories at Costco for a reasonable price, and they require no installation. Sunshades work by absorbing the sun's rays and UV radiation, reducing the heat build-up inside your car. They usually come in three styles: accordion, fold-up, and roll-up. When you're ready to use a sunshade, all you have to do is place it against your windshield with the reflective side facing out and lower your car's sun visors to hold it in place. A sunshade can lower the interior temperature of your car between 8% and 25%. Your car's dashboard, seats, and other upholstery will be less likely to fade or crack when you use a sunshade because it protects these components from direct sunlight. An added benefit of using a sunshade is it reduces how hard your A/C has to work because it won't have to cool your car down as much. If your car has leather seats, investing in seat covers is almost a must if you hope to make it through the hottest months of the year without too much discomfort. There's no getting around it — when your car is hot, your car seats are going to be hot. You've likely experienced sweat running down your back and felt the burn of a hot car seat on your legs. Seat covers for your car can help make that heat more bearable by covering the leather with a breathable, cool material. If you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, you could invest in cooling seat covers designed to dissipate heat and improve air circulation. Some of these seats use built-in fans, and others use cooling materials to regulate the temperature of your seats. Seat covers with built-in fans draw power from the car's electrical system, usually using a 12V plug. These fans provide a constant flow of air to cool down hot seats. Other seat covers use breathable mesh, gel, or memory foam, along with cooling gels or other cooling technology, to keep you cool on hot days. Just like the seats, your steering wheel can become uncomfortable to the touch when your car has been baking in the sun. Depending on where you live, the steering wheel may get so hot you can't touch it for more than a few seconds without risking serious burns, making it impossible to drive until your car has cooled down. While window tinting and a reflective sunshade will help lower your car's temperature, that may not be enough to keep your steering wheel cool. Steering wheel covers can cost anywhere from $10 to $100, depending on the material they're made from and the brand, with vinyl and polyester covers generally being the least expensive. If you're not using a sunshade, you should consider protecting your dashboard with a cover. These covers reduce the amount of heat the dashboard absorbs, helping to keep your car's interior cooler and prevent the dashboard from becoming too hot to touch. Like sunshades, they'll also protect your dashboard from UV rays, which will help prevent cracking, fading, and warping over time. They're inexpensive and a good long-term investment for your car. There are plenty of ways to keep your car cool this summer without spending a dime, starting with parking in the shade. Trees and buildings are the easiest ways to find shade and will help block direct sunlight, keeping your car from getting excessively hot. If you can't find a completely shaded area, even partial shade can make a noticeable difference. The problem with this tip is that many drivers will be using the same strategy, so you might find yourself competing for the little shade available in larger parking lots. If a parking garage is available, use it instead of parking in the sun. Cracking your car's windows is another easy way to help keep your call cool in hot weather. This method creates a venting effect, where hot air escapes and cooler air enters. However, cracking your windows can also be a security risk, making it easier for thieves to break into your car. So, you should be aware of your surroundings and only crack them in areas you consider safe. You should also try to park your car so the front of it faces away from the sun to help reduce direct sunlight on the dashboard and front seats. You can also cover hard surfaces like the dashboard and steering wheel with light-colored towels or cloths to keep them from absorbing too much heat. When you get back to your car, open all of the doors, including the truck, to let the heat escape quickly.",

        "content": "Who Was John List and What Did He Do? By John List was a Sunday school teacher and a Boy Scout troop leader alongside being a rather strict father who imposed rigid rules on his children, according to the . On November 9, 1971, John Emil List murdered his entire family which included his mother, Alma, his wife, Helen, and their three children. He then escaped from the crime scene. List was on the run for nearly 18 years before he was finally caught and convicted. On the morning of November 9, List sent his children to school. He then got hold of two handguns from his garage. He lived with his family in the Breeze Knoll, a luxurious 19-room mansion. List then made his way up and shot his wife, Helen in the kitchen. They had been married for 20 years. His mother Alma was 84 and lived on the third floor which was converted into an apartment. John List made his way up to her room and killed her too, according to magazine. John List reportedly dragged his wife’s body into the ballroom and mopped the kitchen floor. He then made himself a sandwich and ate it as he waited at the kitchen table for his children to return home. 16-year-old Patricia and 13-year-old Frederick were reportedly killed by one bullet each while 15-year-old John, who reportedly put up a tough fight, was shot ten times. He then laid the bodies of his three children beside that of his wife in the ballroom. The List were not exposed until a month after the incident as John List had written to the children’s school that they’d be away for a bit to visit their ailing grandmother. Why did John List murder his family? According to , John List killed his family to spare them the shame of losing their New Jersey mansion. He also claimed it was a way to make sure they went to heaven and said he was waiting to join them there. When authorities discovered the bodies of List’s children and wife, they also found a letter that List had left for his pastor. In the letter, he claimed that he was losing his money and was broke. He claimed that he didn’t want to subject his children to poverty. The letter also revealed that the murders were planned in advance. He also reportedly canceled milk, newspaper, and mail deliveries to his home over the days preceding the murders. This made it unlikely for anyone to find the crime scene. Meanwhile, John List fled to Colorado and began living a new life. He changed his name, remarried, and evaded coming onto authorities’ radar for 18 long years. It was in 1989 that he was finally arrested after a neighbor of his identified him from a profile on America’s Most Wanted. John List was sentenced to five consecutive life prison terms. List’s mother was a strict Lutheran and the family reportedly attended Church every week. List was a symbol of success and propriety in their Westfield neighborhood. He allegedly feared that the loss of money would tear his family apart and lure them away from faith. In 2008, John List died at the St. Francis Medical Center in Trenton while he was serving time at the New Jersey State Prison, the reported. He died from complications of Pneumonia and was 82 years old at the time of death.

John Rankin's side are preparing for life in the Championship next term after winning promotion from League One earlier this month, thanks to a 5-3 aggregate triumph over Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the play-off final. And the first addition to the squad since that success is set to come in the form of Albinson, who would replace regular Accies No.1 Ryan Fulton after he left New Douglas Park for an expected move to Scottish Premiership side Hearts. Lanarkshire Live Sport understands the 27-year-old shot-stopper has been offered a two-year deal and will complete his move once his contract with the Honest Men expires on May 31. Albinson, 27, made 22 appearances for the Honest Men last season, helping them stay in the Championship, and he is now set to come up against his former side in the division next season. He had been at Somerset Park since July 2021 when he joined from English Conference League side Southport and started out his career in the youth set up at English Premier League champions Manchester City.

        "description": "A £16,000 fundraising drive has helped Ardgowan Hospice transform two of its rooms into a pair of fantastic fully-fitted family spaces and refurbish its Nelson Street base.",
        "content": "Last December the vital local cause ran its Big Give campaign, which saw all the donations it received up to £8,000 matched thanks to support from The Reed Foundation and McDonald’s in the Community. The campaign, which was backed by hospice patron and Greenock actor Martin Compston, saw McDonald’s contribute £5,000, while The Reed Foundation added a further £3,000. The money raised from the donation drive has now been used to create a lounge and an overnight room at the hospice, purchase a pair of rise and recline chairs and invest in the hospice’s reception area to create a more welcoming atmosphere for patients and their loved ones. The launch of the two new rooms was attended by hospice staff and local officials, including Inverclyde’s Provost Drew McKenzie. Hospice chief executive Graham Gardiner told the the new facilities would mean they could offer even more support to patients and their families. He said: “This is amazing for patients, they’ve got facilities here that make more sense than they did before. “We have the ability for families to stay over at night in a much more comfortable environment than the one we had. “The fact we have dedicated space that people can come to is amazing. “This room will become much more used by patients and their families, we’ve got a nice space here that they can come and sit in or play some games in. “We had someone in recently who had his mates come round and they were able to have some beers and takeaways. “He was given the chance to just be round his friends and that kind of opportunity can only happen if we’ve got the right space. “It gives them a nice place to do things like that, where it doesn’t feel like a hospice, hopefully it feels like a living room. “We’ve had amazing work from people here to make this happen and we also couldn’t have done it without all the money that we’ve got in. “It’s nice to be able to show people what the money has done. “I want to thank our operations support manager Mairi Harper, our marketing and communications manager Colette Cameron and the hospice maintenance team for executing the refurbishment. \"A heartfelt thank you goes to Finn and Alan from McDonald's and The Reed Foundation, as well as to all our generous donors who went above and beyond to support our Big Give campaign, surpassing our £16,000 target. Your kindness and generosity are truly appreciated.” Provost McKenzie hailed the new facility as a big boost for the hospice and praised the charity’s vital work. He said: “There will be very few people in Inverclyde who have not either had use of this facility or had some sort of engagement with it over the years. “When you look round, they’re making the best of what they have here. “There’s eight beds and there’s need for expansion and modernisation, which is the challenge going forward, but it’s such a welcoming place. “It’s not a place one would perceive as a place to die or a place of sadness, it’s exactly the opposite.”",

        "content": "Jordan McDonough - currently out of prison on a supervised release order regarding another criminal matter - admitted to sending messages that were grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character by swearing and making offensive remarks. McDonough, who was originally charged with repeatedly uttering threats of violence towards the woman, pleaded guilty to the amended Communications Act offence at Greenock Sheriff Court. The court hearing was told that the couple separated when McDonough was locked up for another matter in 2022. A prosecutor said relations between the pair had broken down over child contact before his latest offence on March 5 this year. The woman received a message on her mobile phone stating: \"Dunno what stunt you're trying to pull here, only the wean you are hurting.\" : A further text, to which the woman did not reply, claimed she would 'regret' not allowing him contact with the child and McDonough went on to refer to her as 'evil'. The complainer eventually replied, telling McDonough: \"See you at court, a lawyer will be in contact.\" Defence solicitor Aidan Gallagher said McDonough's ex had been 'seeking to reconcile the relationship, which he made clear was not going to happen, at which point she terminated all contact [with the child]'. Mr Gallagher said: \"Unfortunately, the matter will have to be brought before the court, which he sought to avoid.\" Noting the fact that he has been complying with his current order, Sheriff Anthony McGeehan deferred sentence for three months for McDonough, of Minard Road, to be of good behaviour. He is due to return to court in August.",

        "content": "Are you aware of all the hidden and abandoned London Underground stations? Even for those who relish delving into London's forgotten tunnels and stations, there are likely a few concealed treasures yet to be discovered, which we aim to reveal. One such gem is so transformed that you wouldn't recognise it today - it's now a stunning country house nestled in the heart of the countryside. The tale of this station has been shared by a blogger who has extensively explored the site. Located in rural Essex, maps from 1963 depict it on the Central line, just before the terminus at Ongar. READ MORE: The London train station that's probably the most useless stop on the network The decision to construct a station in such a remote location remains somewhat of a mystery. However, given that Blake Hall station was named after a country house approximately a mile away, it's plausible that the house's owner persuaded the railway company to establish a stop there for transporting his farm produce to London for sale. Constructed in 1865, the station was indeed equipped with a goods yard. The line passing Blake Hall was a single-track extension from Loughton to Ongar, managed by the Eastern Counties Railway company. This provided a direct route from Ongar, through Epping and Loughton, to Central London, with 14 trains daily completing the full journey to Ongar. Even in the 1950s, when the rest of the line was modernised and electrified, goods trains were still operated by steam on this stretch and continued to call at Blake Hall, the station in the middle of nowhere. In 1966 though as more and more transport of goods was moved from rail to road, the goods yard at the station closed and freight trains were stopped. From then on, the station struggled to attract enough passengers as well and had the unwanted accolade of being the least used station on the network. Unfortunately its fate was inevitable and it was announced it would close in 1981. But you can still see the lovely old station building and platform to this day. It's a beautiful setting and the station is now a private house with the owner having rebuilt part of the demolished platform.

The Epping to Ongar extension of the Central Line continued in operation until the September 1994 when it was finally closed. Nowadays you van only get as far as Epping on the Central Line. There was talk of bringing it back as part of a private venture but instead a volunteer group of enthusiasts have restored the line between Ongar and North Weald and now the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society run a weekend steam service on the line during the spring and summer months. This picturesque rural railway stretch and the charming old station at Blake Hall are maintained by dedicated volunteers, many of whom are ex-TfL staff. It's an ideal location for a summer railway adventure.

        "content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers decided on Monday to impose sanctions on Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service and on 19 Russians for human rights violations after the death of opposition politician Alexei Navalny in a prison in February. \"Alexei Navalny’s shocking death was another sign of the accelerating and systematic repression by the Kremlin regime. We will spare no efforts to hold the Russian political leadership and authorities to account,\" EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell said in a statement. The Kremlin has denied any state involvement in Navalny's death. The sanctions include Russian judges, prosecutors and members of the judiciary. Their assets in the European Union, should they have any, are frozen and European companies are forbidden from making funds available to them. The 19 people under sanctions also cannot enter, or transit through, the EU. The new sanctions also restrict exports of equipment which might be used for internal repression and equipment, technology or software for use in information security and the monitoring or interception of telecommunication, the ministers said in a statement.

        "description": "Obama and Biden appointees have now compared a climate protester and an IRS whistleblower to insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol",
        "content": "Last year, Joanna Smith went to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and smeared paint on the case and pedestal of Edgar Degas’ sculpture, “Little Dancer Aged Fourteen.” She did so as a protest urging President Joe Biden to declare a climate emergency. “The Earth is beautiful, and we’re destroying it with climate change ,” Smith said as part of the protest. Smith was sentenced last month to 60 days in prison and two years of supervised release. During her sentencing hearing, the liberal judge specifically compared Smith to several insurrectionists who punched and kicked in windows at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as rioters stormed the building seeking to stop the nation’s peaceful transfer of power from Donald Trump to Biden. “Now, everyone is looking at me — Jan. 6, you can’t compare us to those people. And, yes, some of them were truly violent,” said District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, appearing to realize how strange the comparison sounded. “I do think that the ones who destroyed property are fair comparators,” continued Jackson, a Barack Obama appointee, adding that “this defendant is not in some separate category because of the nature of her cause.” Jackson’s comments mark what appears to be a developing and relatively bizarre trend: Liberal judges are making a habit out of comparing defendants in completely unrelated cases to the Jan. 6 insurrectionists. As liberal tax policy expert Bob Lord noted in a recent commentary piece for Rolling Stone , District Judge Ana Reyes did the same thing as she sentenced Charles Littlejohn, an IRS whistleblower who leaked the tax returns of Trump and other billionaires, exposing their tax avoidance. Reyes asserted that Littlejohn’s actions were a greater “threat to our democracy” than the Jan. 6 rioters she had sentenced herself. “I have reacted so strongly to your case because it engenders the same fear that Jan. 6 does — that we have gotten to [the] point in our society in which otherwise law-abiding, rational people believe that they have no choice but to break the law to further their political agendas,” Reyes said to Littlejohn, telling him that “my Jan. 6 cases to-date are not appropriate comparators for the sentence I will hand down in your case.” Editor’s picks Every Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History Regarding Smith’s case, climate activist Michael Greenberg, the executive director at Climate Defiance, tells Rolling Stone that comparing her to the Jan. 6 insurrectionists wasn’t fair. “The rioters took action because they wanted to see our democracy fail,” he said. “Joanna took action because our democracy has failed.” Phil Andonian, the lawyer who represented Smith in the case, tells Rolling Stone that “the judge was a coward in drawing the comparison,” adding that he was “appalled when the judge went there, and it was all I could do to keep my composure.” Andonian has led two lawsuits against Trump and Capitol rioters over the insurrection — one on behalf of Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) , and the other on behalf of the partner of a Capitol Police officer who died after suffering two strokes one day after the Jan. 6 assault on Congress. He argues members of the judiciary, the Biden administration, and politicians on the left have been “capitulating to this false equivalence of Jan. 6,” and that comparing any actions to it that aren’t an “an out-and-out insurrection is ridiculous.” “I consider myself a liberal Democrat for the most part,” says Andonian. “This is kind of the classic Democratic playbook. You get backed into a corner by a fake argument on the other side that the Jan. 6 people were just protesting, and they’re being treated too harshly, and rather than tell them to go pound sand and continue to treat this as the unprecedented insurrection that it was, they start rushing to say, ‘Well, look, we’re treating people on the left just as harshly, you can’t accuse us of playing favorites.’ And then it turns into this game of false equivalence, which just drives me insane.” He believes that’s what happened with Jackson at Smith’s sentencing: “She was not going to be the judge that let a protester — who did something that I think everybody probably can agree was off-putting — off the hook without referencing J-6 and without appearing to be treating her on the same plane.”",

        "content": "Eikö Salon kuntapäättäjien pitäisi saada selvitys myös vanhan hallin korjausvaihtoehdosta ennen kuin Salon jäähallin tulevaisuudesta nuijitaan lopulliset päätökset? Tätä ihmettelee kaupunginhallituksessa istuva Johannes Alaranta (kesk.), joka luistelee Salossa jäähalleissa useita kertoja viikossa. Keskiviikkona vapaa-aikalautakunta saa eteensä esityksen Salon jäähallin uudishankkeesta, mutta nykyisen hallin peruskorjausmahdollisuus on ohitettu siinä vain ylimalkaisena mainintana. – Vaikka kaupunginhallitukselle oli luvattu, että tämäkin vaihtoehto selvitetään, kritisoi Alaranta. – Kyllähän minä jääkiekkomiehenä luistelisin jatkossa mielelläni uudessa hallissa, mutta nyt tehdään päätöksiä todella isosta investoinnista veronmaksajien rahoilla. Silloin ei riitä, että joku sanoo, että musta tuntuu uudisrakennuksen olevan parempi. Hän olisi halunnut kuulla tarkan selvityksen siitä, mitä vanhan hallin remontointi olisi maksanut ja mitä muutostöitä tarvittu. Vapaa-aikalautakunnan esityksen valmistellut Salon vapaa-aikajohtaja Antti Mattila ihmettelee puolestaan kritiikkiä. Hänen mukaansa vapaa-aikapalveluiden tehtävänä ei tässä kohtaa ole tarjota rinnakkain uudisrakennusta ja peruskorjausta valittaviksi vaan esitellä valmistuneita arkkitehtisuunnitelmia, jotka on laadittu valtuuston vuosi sitten hyväksymän hankesuunnitelman perusteella. Hankesuunnitelmassa taas lainattiin jäähallin vuoden 2021 kuntotutkimusraporttia, joka kuvaili nykyisen hallin kuntoa huonona tai tyydyttävänä. – Tämä meni siis juuri niin kuin ennustin, huokaa Alaranta. Hän penäsi vuosi sitten hallituksessa ja valtuustossa peruskorjauksen tarkempien tietojen perään. – Silloin sanottiin, että vielä ei voi päättää peruskorjauksen ja uudisrakennuksen väliltä. Nyt sanotaan, että on liian myöhäistä. Kuntotutkimusraportin mukaan nykyisen hallin talotekniikka on ilmanvaihdon ja jäähdytystekniikan osalta vanhentunut ja energiaa tuhlaava. Hallin säänvastaiset ja kantavat rakenteet ovat alkuperäisiä, märkätiloissa on vesivahinkoja, ja vesikatto on vuotanut katto- ja seinärakenteisiin. Katossa on huomattava paloriski. Lisäksi hallin toimivuudessa on parantamisen varaa. Alarannan mielestä ongelmat olisivat korjattavissa, tai ainakin hän haluaisi kuulla, millä hinnalla. – Hallia väitetään purkukuntoiseksi, mutta koko ajanhan siellä on annettu lasten luistella. Tässä on ristiriita. Olen itse pahasti homeallerginen, mutta en ole saanut hallissa oireita. Hän painottaa sitä, että vuonna 2007 uusittu jäärata on kuntotutkimuksenkin mukaan hyvässä kunnossa. – Parhaimpien asiantuntijoiden mukaan se on hallin kallein osa, kahden miljoonan euron arvoinen, ja sillä olisi vielä 40 vuotta käyttöikää. On järjetöntä, että jäälaatta menisi murskaimeen. Mattila taas vetoaa tuoreisiin jäähallihankkeisiin, joissa jäälaatan hintalappuna on ollut vain 200 000 euroa. Lisäksi jos Salon jäähalli peruskorjattaisiin, samalla vesittyisivät urheilupuiston yleissuunnitelma sekä jäähallien yhdistämisen hyödyt. Alaranta toivoo, että jäälaattaa voitaisiin hyödyntää myöhemmin edes ulkojäänä. Urheilupuiston yleissuunnitelmassa sen tilalle aiotaan kuitenkin monitoimihallia. Vaakakupissa painaa myös se, että remontin ajaksi syntyisi väistämättä käyttökatko. Alarannan mielestä siksi ajaksi seuroille löytyisi järkeviä treenejä muualta. Mattila taas epäilee, että katkos voisi olla kuolinisku seuroille. – En ole yhtään hallityömaata nähnyt, jossa on purkutyö tehty ja uusi rakennettu alle kahdessa vuodessa, Mattila sanoo. Oma kysymyksensä on, kuka jäähallin jatkossa omistaa. Lautakunnan esityslistalla on vertailtu eri omistuspohjia. Esityksen mukaan yksityisomistuksessa hallin pääsy- ja hallivuoromaksut kohoaisivat. Alaranta penää tälle perusteluja. Salossa on hyvä esimerkki jäähallin pihapiiristä siitä, että näin ei käy. – SSO:n jäähalliahan kaupunki on saanut käyttää puoli-ilmaiseksi. Salon jäähalli toimisi minusta tehokkaammin yhtiömuotoisena. Mattila kertoo arvioineensa asiaa tilastoista. Lopullisesti hintataso selviää vasta, jos kaupunki solmii jonkin yhtiön kanssa sopimuksen hallista. – Yksityinen taho asettaa pääsymaksut ja tuntivuokrat aina markkinaehtoisesti, minkä vuoksi yhtiössä syntyisi ristiriitaa yksityisen tuoton ja kaupungin strategioiden välillä. Vantaalla juuri tästä syystä siirretään halleja takaisin kaupungille, hän kommentoi. – SSO-halli taas on lähes kaupungin omistama yhtiö. Silti sen jäävuorojen hinnat ovat seuroille 84 euroa tunti, kun kaupungin kokonaan oman jäähallin vuorohinta on 0–20 euroa. Uuden jäähallin kustannusarvio on tällä hetkellä yhdeksän miljoonaa euroa. – Kustannusarvioon on tällä valmistelun tasolla täysin mahdoton luottaa, Alaranta sanoo ja veikkaa, että lopullinen hinta on kolminkertainen. Mattila sanoo, että kustannusarvion on tehnyt Rakennuttajatoimisto Protiimi Oy, ja hänen roolinsa on ollut vain antaa se tiedoksi päättäjille. Keskiviikon kokouksessa lautakunnan on tarkoitus merkitä tiedoksi jäähallin valmistelutilanne sekä esittää jäähalli-investointia kaupunginhallituksen ja -valtuuston hyväksyttäväksi. Alaranta kertoo saaneensa jäähallista yhteydenottoja nyt useilta salolaispäättäjiltä eri puolueista. Vuosi sitten jäähalliasiaa käsiteltäessä kolmasosa valtuutetuista oli asettunut hänen ja Mika Nummenpalon (liik.) taakse. Keskustapuolue ei ole tehnyt ryhmäpäätöstä tulevasta kokouksesta.",

        "description": "\"It is now in the middle of the great migrating season, and we are flush with birds,\" Tim Hornseth writes.",
        "content": "I was sold a bill of goods. That is \"old man speak\" for someone getting hoodwinked. I also know that I knew, intellectually, what was up, but still chose to believe in another reality. You see, when the family and I moved up here to Minnesota — were moved, technically, by the wife’s new job — the lure of Minnesota was colored by the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes” slogan. Hand in hand with that was the whole \"Northwoods\" pitch — live in a cabin in the woods, fish out your front/back porch and eat it for supper. \"Minnesota Nice,\" as the saying goes. Hot dishes (not casseroles!) and lefse. Walleye fish fries and schools full of students all above average. Hornseth Oh, sure. Nearly everything I just mentioned is true, basically true, or about true. Just not around me. You see, there are actually over 14,000 lakes — very nearly 15,000 of them — in the state of Minnesota. But 14,000 just doesn’t roll off the tongue as nicely as 10,000. There is some debate on the exact number, partially in how a lake is defined or categorized. But there is a general agreement that there are between 12,000 and 14,000 bodies of water of at least 10 acres or greater. Not counting rivers. Yes, there are cabins or dwellings in the Northwoods that one can almost fish from the back porch and catch a walleye to fry up for supper. If you are visiting a friend and get lost trying to find their cabin, asking for directions from a local will show you that the \"Minnesota Nice\" phenomena is a real thing. But rare is the dwelling that could be considered a cabin anymore. Since before the turn of this recent century, a huge percentage of structures of the kind one would consider calling a cabin have been turned into year-round houses — even mansions. After all, if you have lakeside property, you might as well maximize it. At least, this is what we have been told. For you see, if there are truly 14,000 lakes in Minnesota, we were lucky enough to move to the only county in the state that has no natural lake, and only three manmade lakes, plus a couple of watershed bodies of water. Additionally, when one speaks of the Northwoods, that is literally true. The vast areas of woods and forests do exist — but up north. My visions of a plethora of lakes and forests are all up in the northern part of the state. Way, way up north, and this state is quite large. I guess in the long run, this is just fine. I have heard about owning a boat — the two best days are the day you buy your boat, and the day you sell your boat. I am just not that interested in all the upkeep and fuss about having a boat. Plus, I am not much of a hunter or fisherman. Sitting out in a deer stand at 5 a.m. in the cold just doesn’t interest me, and I really don’t like eating fish very much. Illinois is flat as a pancake, and corn or beans as far as the eye can see. Iowa is like Illinois, except with a few more hills. Here in southern Minnesota, it is just like Iowa — rolling farmland with mostly corn and beans. The only real difference is that it isn’t filled with Iowans.

        "description": "A significant development in the United Airlines flight schedule has led to a daily nonstop flight between Guam and Tokyo Haneda International Airport that started May 1, 2024.",
        "content": "A significant development in the United Airlines flight schedule has led to a daily nonstop flight between Guam and Tokyo Haneda International Airport that started May 1, 2024. That means travelers outbound from Guam will experience a flight time to Japan of just over three hours and arrive at Terminal 3 at the centrally located Haneda Airport. This differs significantly from flying into Japan and landing at Narita International Airport, the sprawling airfield located about 40 miles from central Tokyo. The Haneda destination shaves off almost an hour of flight time compared to Narita. The Narita airfield is so expansive that taxiing from the runway to the disembarkation gate after touchdown may take as long as 30 to 45 minutes. A delegation from Guam, was organized by the Guam Visitors Bureau for a travel mission in mid-May for members of the local media, some staff members from GVB and the A.B. Won Pat International Airport and elected officials from Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to experience the convenience of the new route and Terminal 3 of Haneda International, and assess its potential impact on Guam and the CNMI as tourist destinations. Travelers originating in Guam depart at 7 p.m. local time and arrive at Tokyo Haneda International at 10 p.m. the same day. Arriving at the Haneda destination eliminates the need for a lengthy commute for those traveling further to central Tokyo. Those familiar with the Narita arrival know that a time-consuming commute, at least an hour on the express train and longer on a bus or taxi, is required to get into the capital city of Japan. Narita Airport is located in Chiba prefecture and formerly known as New Tokyo International Airport. At Tokyo Haneda International, travelers are deposited directly into central Tokyo, with easy access to the famed Tokyo train systems that connect the entire city. The return flight departs Haneda at 11:55 p.m. and arrives at 4:45 a.m. the following day in Guam. Years in the making Speaking from the departure gate at Haneda International Airport, former governor and current GVB president Carl Gutierrez said that the slot from Haneda to Guam was years in the making, and there’s more to come. “In September of 2022, I made a courtesy call to the powers that be here at Haneda, along with representatives from GVB and the (Guam International Airport Authority). United Airlines has been trying for several years to get a route to Guam from Haneda to no avail. Our goal focused on getting United a slot from Haneda and having it approved as soon as possible. We have an assurance from the top man here at Haneda, Mr. Isao Takashiro, that Guam will not only get one slot but three,” said Gutierrez. “It’s so competitive and cutthroat that because a slot opens for Guam, that means someone else must be choked out.” “We are looking for new dynamics and passengers, the type of traveler that can jump on a flight at midnight and get to Guam at 4 in the morning and go straight to golf or Don Don Donki because it’s a little too early for hotel check-in. It’s going to be an industry effort as we’re working with hotels to accommodate these early passengers by possibly securing and assisting with luggage. There (are) a lot of adjustments along the way as the focus must be problem-solving when you are building a new route from scratch,” Gutierrez added. Tomoko Kobayashi, a travel agent in Tokyo, has visited Guam more than 10 times. “Haneda is close to the heart of Tokyo and is convenient for people in Tokyo to travel to Guam,” said Kobayashi through a translator. “Guam is so great as a destination because it’s so beautiful, and now it’s really close and a convenient place to relax,” she said. “I think we will be able to book more tickets to Guam for a weekend or short stay now that Haneda has a daily flight,” Kobayashi said. Artemio “Ricky” Hernandez, deputy executive manager for GIAA, was part of the delegation. “It’s important to remember that Haneda is a different catchment area to exploit and an opportunity to be able to market Guam to a different type of passenger because it’s much closer to the Tokyo city center,” said Hernandez. “This airport opens up a lot of opportunities for our market.” “I think the impact is being felt because of the events and efforts of United Airlines and GVB. Several dozens of travel agents are being briefed on the new route, and building a new route is not easy, but we already have a significant presence as a destination,” said Hernandez. “It’s really about building and sustaining the route, and we’re off to a great foundation. We have seen consistent recovery annually with 20-30% increase in tourism data, along with a steady rebound in the Korean market, and we are putting in the work to reestablish our Japanese network right here and now,” said Hernandez. Aubry Hocog is mayor of the island of Rota in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. “We are grateful that GVB is extending their marketing efforts to include the CNMI and more specifically my island, Luta. We are hoping to attract Japanese tourists who will not only visit Guam but also experience the CNMI and Luta,” said the mayor. “We are limited in the numbers, as the flight to Luta can only carry 7 or 8 individuals, so our tourist arrivals are modest at this point, probably in the single digits weekly,” the mayor continued. “Luta is like Guam 50 years ago. We are well known for tranquility and offer a unique island experience.” Sen. Telo Taitague sits on the legislative committee on tourism and sees the Haneda development as something of “great significance.” “It’s a great opportunity for the residents of Tokyo to have the convenience of access (to) the Haneda airport and then (a) short flight to Guam. It’s all about time and convenience for people living in urban areas like Tokyo,” said Taitague. “Summer is coming up, so I think we’ll (be) able to see some immediate impact on families coming over from Japan to enjoy a quick holiday on Guam,” she said. Public welcome at Haneda International A progressive feature of Haneda International is the common area access allowed to the public. Tokyo residents, or any member of the public, can help themselves to the mall in Terminal 3. The Edo Market Place is a large hall with shops and restaurants themed after the historic Edo period of Japan. The Tokyo Pop Town is a shopping area that highlights trendy toys, knickknacks and souvenirs. One of the most popular destinations for visitors to the airport is the Terminal 3 observation deck. This allows for close-up observation of international aircraft taxiing, taking off and landing, as well as views of the control tower, the Tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Skytree. The deck is popular with plane spotters, as they can be seen on the deck observing with high-powered optics and camera gear. The Haneda Nihonbashi Bridge is a massive architectural feature prominently showcased in Terminal 3. The bridge is based on a design of the early 19th century and is constructed of Japanese cypress. The surrounding walls of the bridge are decorated with folding screens depicting various activities of famous places throughout Edo. The bridge has been restored to half its original length and width. The first steps on the bridge are meant to represent the first steps of a traveler’s journey into the skies and beyond.",

        "content": "The has been all over the place—from , to madcap sci-fi silliness, to , and to . But its latest juke lands itself somewhere familiar but entirely new for the series, and finally decides to give Millie Gibson’s Ruby Sunday the spotlight to show what she’s capable of. And boy howdy, did it put her through it. “73 Yards” is, perhaps, the Steven Moffat episode fans looking forward to last week’s Steven Moffat episode were expecting before they got their socks by “Boom”—another twist in this season’s overall vibe with playing with the very foundations and expectations of storytelling. With Russell T Davies back in the writer’s seat, this time we’re pulled back to the UK in the modern day, as the Doctor and Ruby land in Wales and immediately find themselves thrust into a deeply creepy tale that gives Ruby her opportunity to really show the audience what she’s made of. We got some of that last week in “Boom” of course, but “73 Yards” takes it a step further by, not even five minutes into its runtime, completely removing the Doctor from the situation, as the duo encounter a strange ritualistic circle of folk charms and messages that, as Ruby reads one aloud, sees the Doctor suddenly vanish from beside her side... and off in the distance, a strange, out of focus elderly woman watches her, never coming closer, never getting further away, but always gesturing, always signing , but rather, finding fear for the audience and Ruby alike in merely . This is no longer the case of Ruby having to prove herself to someone, or show that she can match her mysterious new friend on an even standing, as it was in “Boom” with the Doctor rooted in one place. She can’t get close enough to the woman to communicate with her, or find out what she wants, and any attempts she tries to make through a third party—other people can see her, but don’t really notice the distant woman until Ruby points her out—to make contact leads to the woman sending them screaming away from Ruby in terror and disgust. So, asks, even this early into her time with the Doctor, what is Ruby’s mettle made of when she can’t rely on him to be there at all? What follows is both an incredibly chilling ghost tale—one where everyone can actually kind of see the ghost—but also a chance for Davies to deliver something in that feels a little closer to his post- career after leaving the show in 2009, especially in the vein of his near-future political drama . Through Ruby, and through this mysterious woman’s ability to essentially get people to somehow suddenly sour on Ruby the second they make close contact, Davies raises an absurdist mirror to modern Britain, and sees how much ugliness is hidden just beneath the surface—and how it doesn’t necessarily a supernatural entity to bring it bubbling up. Really, the fear of “73 Yards” is not the creep factor of this woman perpetually being the titular distance from Ruby, but and isolation her power imparts on Ruby over and over. But that loneliness is twisted even further and more potently by the bitterness it leaves in its wake. First the Doctor goes, leaving Ruby stranded in a tiny Welsh village, where cold, bitter locals gaslight the outsider with tales of an ancient spirit named “Mad Jack” and the real power behind the circle Ruby and the Doctor came across, eventually forcing her out, despite her having no real place to go with the Doctor lost and the TARDIS locked down. When Ruby heads home to London to her mother, Carla not only finds herself afflicted by the mysterious woman’s powers, but amplifies them by not just running away from Ruby, but returning, locking her out of her own home, and then cruelly slinging barbs and insults over her birth mother to push Ruby away even further. Even, years later—scraping by in a dead-end job to make ends meet, utterly cut off—a chance encounter with Kate Lethbridge Stewart and UNIT leads to this one moment of hope, that the Doctor’s world and her association with it could save her, is lost when, for all their own psychic and supernatural safeguards, they too are turned against Ruby, leaving her distraught and ostracized by the passers-by witnessing her breakdown—not the armed police units that just charged through a busy street and then immediately fled, but because this young, distressed woman is brushing up against that stiff-upper reserved nature of public British culture. It’s here that “73 Yards” really takes its biggest step to feeling like a spin on ’ treatise on the UK. As the literal years and years pass, told through a montage of Ruby losing boyfriend after boyfriend as they all chastise her for seeming distant and distracted, as she’s unable to explain the supernatural phenomena causing it, Ruby eventually overhears a news broadcast that puts two offhand elements from early on in the episode together. An interview with an up and coming reactionary Welsh political leader Roger ap Gwilliam (Aneurin Barnard), who the Doctor had jokingly mentioned to Ruby upon landing in Wales as Britain’s — could not have asked for better timing than to have this episode air days after the was called—sees the politician call upon his working class background by invoking “Mad Jack” as an old nickname. With that, Ruby realizes that she has the chance to avoid the crushing loneliness she’s endured the past few years and go be in a story, with a villain to fight, a kernel of hope, a chance to make everything this mysterious entity has put her through seemingly for no reason into context. Instead, it just takes ugliness Ruby has endured on a personal scale and brings it to a national one. Infiltrating ap Gwilliam’s political party, Albion, as a volunteer to get close to him, Ruby and the audience alike are instead exposed to this fascinatingly grim caricature of modern politics. Ap Gwilliam doesn’t have a laid-out manifesto or dream as a politician that’s made clear to us—both because this is an episode of rather than , and because also that’s the point—but he has an absurdly unhinged nationalist vibe. All that’s made clear to us about ap Gwilliam’s desire to lead the UK is to make it a bitter, isolated nation, backed by a comprehensive nuclear arsenal it would be unafraid to use at the drop of a hat. But instead of people questioning it, all we’re shown is that from within his party and beyond into the general populace, there is somehow a feverish for such an evil desire. Other countries are cruel bullies, why not us too? Albion is sweeping the polls, as the Doctor warned, ap Gwilliam becomes Prime Minister handily, and yet all we know of his wants is mass nuclear destruction for little reason other than hate—and with that hate, he’s commanding the rapt attention of tens of thousands of bitter British citizens that want the world to notice them. It’s only Ruby that sees ap Gwilliam for what he is—and eventually clicks that before he can lead Britain into a horrific new age, having purchased a huge nuclear arsenal for the country to deploy, she has to use the presence of the mysterious woman, and her supernatural fear induction, by standing 73 yards away from the now-leader of the UK and get her to work on . “73 Yards” doesn’t immediately end there though, and it’s where the episode gets a little messy falling over itself in the wrap-up: there’s not some sudden snap-back as time corrects itself, that Ruby has saved the day and gets to be immediately rewarded with being back to normal. The mysterious woman might have been the tool she uses to stop ap Gwilliam, but it’s still after he’s fled and resigned in sudden, fearful disrepute. She’s still isolated and cut off from the Doctor, and her family, and UNIT, and countless other people from the years of this entity’s existence alongside her, and still has to keep living. It’s only as we flash forward another 40 years to an elderly Ruby (now played by Amanda Walker)—and see that she’s had to live that life alone and be at peace with it, returning to Wales one last time to say goodbye to the Doctor and the overgrown TARDIS for good. Ruby did the right thing, but she still had to suffer terribly for it. It’s that the episode unveils its final twist: the entity itself was some paradoxical version of the older Ruby, who had to become her and face all that grief and ugliness in the first place, so she could be sent back to that moment Ruby and the Doctor came across the fairy circle in the first place and stop it from being disturbed. It’s here the episode takes a bit of a minor stumble. That supernatural loop is closed, sure—Mad Jack’s mysterious spirit, and whatever connection it had to ap Gwilliam, is left to rest, and the entity disappears as the Doctor and Ruby go off on whatever their adventure was going to be in the first place, left unseen. But we spend so little time with the older Ruby that a few things don’t quite click the way they did in the earlier beats of the episode. The political commentary about ap Gwilliam’s rise is kind of left to fall apart in the background—cut off by a single newscaster line in the background about Britain making a sudden pivot to kinder, nicer politics (the Government he left behind still bought all those nuclear missiles though, so how kinder is left unknown!). Similarly, we largely quickly move on from the sudden twist about the entity’s true nature, left to vanish in whatever caused the close loop with little in the way to satisfyingly or emotionally build up its connection to Ruby’s part in that loop, leaving the episode’s ending feel a little too sudden for its own good. These stumbles aside however, the real creepiness of “73 Yards” we’re left with as it ends is that Ruby has some vague remembrance of this avoided timeline—and with it, all the ugliness that was dredged up in the name of preventing it. An ugliness, that, for all we know, is still buried just underneath the surface, from the tiniest village, to the people we love most, to the general populace, waiting for anything to dredge it up into plain sight. A fitting fear for to leave us on through this twisted lens, perhaps—a creeping wariness that is perpetually just out of sight. Muddled as its conclusion might be, in making that fear just an inherent reflection of human nature, rather than some supernatural evil, might be one of the most compelling steps this new era of the show has taken so far. New episodes premiere Fridays at 7 p.m. ET on , and will broadcast through the BBC iPlayer at the same time in the UK, at 12 a.m. local time on Saturdays before broadcasting on BBC One later that day.",

Market Dynamics Drivers: Increased demand for energy efficiency The surge in demand for energy efficiency has become a crucial catalyst propelling the rapid expansion of the dry-type transformer market. With nations worldwide confronting the challenges of climate change and striving to cut down on carbon emissions, there's been a notable shift toward adopting sustainable energy consumption practices. This escalating demand for energy efficiency is driving the widespread adoption of dry-type transformers. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global energy demand is projected to increase by 1.8% annually from 2021 to 2030. In 2022, global investments in energy efficiency soared to USD 560 billion, marking a 16% increase from 2021, and this upward trajectory is expected to persist in the years ahead. Various countries have implemented measures to enhance energy efficiency. For instance, American households are eligible for a tax credit covering up to 10% of the expenses for energy-efficient upgrades. Additionally, in 2021, the European Commission revised its eco-design and energy labeling regulations, introducing new standards for various products. Dry-type transformers boast higher energy efficiency because they eschew the use of oil for winding cooling, thereby eliminating a significant source of energy loss. Restraints: Increased installation and maintenance costs The expansion of the dry type transformer market faces several challenges, with one prominent hurdle being the significant cost difference between dry type transformers and their oil-filled counterparts. This price gap considerably limits their widespread adoption across various industries and applications. Dry type transformers require a larger initial investment due to their reliance on specialized materials, advanced insulation techniques, and intricate manufacturing processes. Furthermore, these transformers rely on materials with excellent heat conduction and dissipation capabilities, such as aluminum or copper, which often undergo special coatings or unique designs to enhance heat transfer from the windings. Opportunities: Rapidly growing power grid infrastructure As the global transition to cleaner energy sources gains momentum and decentralized power generation becomes more prevalent, there's a growing need for transformers that can effectively handle fluctuating loads and power variations. Dry-type transformers are exceptionally suited to meet these demands due to their adaptability and resilience, making them a preferred choice for accommodating the diverse energy requirements of modern power grids. With the widespread adoption of smart grid technologies and initiatives aimed at grid modernization, there's an increasing demand for transformers that offer both flexibility and high performance. This evolving landscape presents a significant opportunity for manufacturers specializing in dry-type transformers, especially as the expansion of electrical infrastructure worldwide continues to advance. Challenge: Lack of access to power ratings and preference of oil-filled transformers in the global market The prevalence of oil-filled transformers, rooted in their extensive use and established market position, can impede the uptake of cast resin transformers. Customers may hesitate to transition to cast resin alternatives without readily available and detailed power ratings and specifications. Additionally, the longstanding history of oil-filled transformers may imbue them with a perception of tradition and reliability, potentially fostering reluctance among customers to embrace cast resin transformers, especially if they are unfamiliar with their performance attributes or perceive them as less established.

        "content": "When Queen Camilla's brother died a few years ago, it was a shock for their whole family. Mark Shand, a conservationist and writer, fell and struck his head outside a New York hotel at the end of a night of partying following a charity auction. He sadly passed away from the head injury he suffered, aged 62. The following year, Queen Camilla - then Duchess of Cornwall - said : \"My brother was a larger-than-life character who left a mark on everyone he met,\" movingly adding: \"I miss him every day.\" Despite the big space that Mark left in his family upon his untimely death, the Queen has worked hard to keep his memory alive, with the support of King Charles and other members of the Royal Family. Prince Harry's 'hurtful' Camilla comments still 'sticking point' for King Charles One of the ways that Camilla has worked to keep her brother's impact on the world alive is through his charity Elephant Family, which he founded in 2002. Charles and Camilla are the royal presidents of the charity and have taken part in extensive projects to promote the cause and help preserve Asia's wildlife. This includes the CoExistence project, which saw life-sized elephant sculptures made from an invasive weed called Lantana camera displayed across London. They were sculpted by indigenous artisans and transformed into stunning pieces of art. Four of these incredible sculptures now have found a home at Highgrove house - Charles's Gloucestershire residence - where they can be seen by visitors in the Orchard Room Meadow. Camilla was 'utterly devasted' by the sudden loss of her brother, who she is pictured with here in 2010 ( Image: Getty Images) The CoExistence project raised over £3 million for the Elephant Family, which is part of the British Asian Trust - founded by King Charles - and has raised over £20 million to \"support our magnificent wildlife and their precious habitats,\" - per the charity's official website. Last year King Charles and Queen Camilla celebrated 20 years of the charity with the Animal Ball, where they presented an award in Mark Shand's name which recognised \"contributions to protecting Asian wildlife.\" Princess Eugenie has also thrown her support behind Elephant Family, as one of its royal patrons. Earlier this year she launched the charity's Little Egg Hunt, where she read the classic children's book, Elmer the Patchwork Elephant by David McKee. Eugenie said of the engagement to ITN: \"It was so important to be here because I've worked with Elephant Family for so many years now and they're a charity so close to my heart, so close to my family's heart, and Mark Shand, who started the charity, was a dear friend.\" Do you have a story to tell?

        "description": "Posting the Ten Commandments is an essentially religious act — not only because it favors religion over non-religion, but also because it invariably favors one faith tradition over others.",
        "content": "“I’m not concerned with an atheist. I’m not concerned with a Muslim,” Louisiana State Rep. Dodie Horton (R), explaining why she sponsored a bill requiring every public school in the state — kindergarten through college — to display the Ten Commandments. “I’m concerned with our children looking and seeing what God’s law is,” the Republican from in the northwest corner of the state. Although Horton may not hold Catholics and Jews in similar disregard, her statute raises problems for their faiths, and others, as well. Veto-proof in both houses of the state legislature passed , with the only opposition coming from a handful of Democrats. Once it is signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, Louisiana will be the only state to mandate , “on a poster or framed document that is at least 11 inches by 14 inches” in every classroom, “printed in a large, easily readable font.” The very specificity of the bill, which includes a governmentally endorsed religious text, may prove its undoing. Civil liberties organizations in Louisiana have already issued a calling the law unconstitutional. “Our public schools are not Sunday schools,” it reads, “and students of all faiths — or no faith — should feel welcome in them.” Classroom displays of the Ten Commandments were held unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in . Nonetheless, Horton and her colleagues “the landscape has changed,” thanks to the conservative supermajority now controlling the court. Even conservative judges may not be willing to go that far. The statute’s religious purpose is evident from its sponsor’s . “I hope and I pray that Louisiana is the first state to allow moral code to be placed back in the classrooms,” Horton said in the legislative debate. “Since I was in kindergarten [at a private school], it was always on the wall. I learned there was a God, and I knew to honor him and his laws.” Posting the Ten Commandments is an essentially religious act — not only because it favors religion over non-religion, but also because it invariably favors one faith tradition over others. The Louisiana requires a distinctly Protestant text, with Elizabethan language based on the King James Bible, which differs significantly from the versions used by Catholics, Jews and others. Some differences are inconsequential, but others have deep theological implications. The Ten Commandments first appear in , and again in . Although it is clear that God gave Moses a covenant of Ten Commandments, the relevant Exodus chapter comprises 17 verses, with no instructions for numbering or organizing them into 10 laws. It is an act of interpretation to reduce the 17 verses to 10 poster-sized commandments, omitting some while abbreviating or combining others. Thus, any specific text always denotes a choice for one tradition or another. The “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.” This commandment is missing from Christian texts, as it is from the Louisiana statute, likely because it is not considered an imperative (the Hebrew speaks of 10 , or words, rather than commandments.) The Jewish — “You shall have no other gods before me”– is where Christians begin, as does the Louisiana legislature (using King James’s “thou” and “shalt”), with numerical adjustments down the line. Theological disputes then arise, as the leading Christian texts diverge. For Protestants, the is a variation on “Thou shalt not make for yourself a graven image,” which is also used in the Louisiana statute. This commandment, however, is found in Catholic iterations, which instead divide the erstwhile 10th Commandment — against coveting — in two. I cannot say why or how this difference began, but I know it has provided grist for anti-Catholic bigots, who exploit it to accuse Catholicism of idolatry. Virulent examples are distressingly easy to find on the internet, often using vulgarisms to charge the church with removing the second commandment to profit from selling statues of saints. I would not attribute these sentiments to members of the Louisiana legislature, but they illustrate how easily textual differences can reinforce religious contempt. To the faithful, scripture matters. That is why we have the First Amendment. The framers of the Bill of Rights were acutely aware of the denominational struggles that afflicted Europe, and they understood that the entanglement of government and religion often led to strife. They agreed, therefore, that “no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The framers did not mean to undermine religion, but rather to save it from the lure of secular power. When there is no establishment of religion — enshrining the tenets or commandments of one denomination — no group needs to fear official domination by another. That is where the Louisiana legislature went badly wrong. Even the simple act of posting the Ten Commandments in schoolrooms can signify centuries-old religious discord. In contemporary America, Hindus and Buddhists may also be wary of a government command to reject figures and imagery. One of the few votes against the Decalogue bill came from Democratic State Sen. Royce Duplessis, who identified himself as a practicing Catholic. “I didn’t have to learn the Ten Commandments in school. We went to Sunday school,” he to his colleagues. “You want your kids to learn about the Ten Commandments, take them to church.” He didn’t specify any particular house of worship and, more importantly, he didn’t care.",

Jakarta sees tourism as a vehicle to boost its creative economy, a concept first defined by UK author John Howkins to describe ways of utilizing creative assets for economic growth and development. The concept was deployed by the former conservative Park Geun-hye government in 2014 as a key national agenda. The Indonesian government has prioritized the creative economy sectors in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2023, Indonesia initiated the \"Promoting Creative Economy for Sustainable Development\" resolution at the 78th UN General Assembly, marking the first UN resolution specifically addressing the creative economy. Indonesia's creative economy contributes close to 8 percent of the nation’s GDP. The minister was in South Korea to attend the Seoul International Travel Fair 2024 earlier this month. The number of Korean travelers to Indonesia reached 347,185 in 2023, a 284 percent increase from the previous year. Korea is now eighth in the top 10 foreign tourists visiting Indonesia,” Uno said. “Indonesian youth love Korean food, music and films, while Koreans are eager to explore Indonesia’s tourist destinations and cuisine. This mutual interest is the future of our relationship,” he said. “I'm very optimistic about the future of Indonesia-Korea relations,\" the minister said. “Just as Korea has promoted its culture and identity, we aim to do the same with our natural and cultural treasures,” he stressed. Bali has been a top tourist destination, but Indonesia has more to offer than just Bali, he said. “We have five super-priority destinations beyond Bali, like Flores Island with the Komodo dragons, and Lake Toba, the largest volcanic lake in the world in North Sumatra,” said Uno. Highlighting other unique destinations, Uno mentioned Borobudur, the largest Buddhist temple in Central Java, and North Sulawesi, known for its dive sites, natural parks and volcanic mountains. “These are areas where we should enhance our partnerships within the Indonesia-Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, involving small-medium enterprises and young entrepreneurs,” he said. When asked about the number of Korean tourists visiting Indonesia, Uno said the number has reached 90 percent of pre-pandemic levels. “However, more Indonesians visit Korea, driven by the influence of Korean dramas and K-pop. We can focus on promoting high-quality experiences like golf tourism, which appeals to Korean travelers,” he said. Uno also discussed strategic initiatives to attract more tourists, such as the management transfer of Batang Airport to Incheon Airport Management. “This will bring more high-quality tourists to the Riau Islands,” he said, adding that the younger generation’s love for ecotourism and sustainability aligns well with Indonesia’s offerings beyond K-dramas and K-pop.",

Sunday saw the start of Coppet Week, with 52 entries. Dan Jackson reports: Well Coppet Race 1 turned into a proper thrash off! Starting in a SW 2-3 all very gentlemanly with us as leading Osprey at the first windward mark, only to be quickly passed by Gareth Caldwell with the kites up. On the second reach we briefly regained the lead after a gentle bit of luffing but lost it again with Dave/Maurice and the Chessnuts closing up all the time. On the second beat Carpé Diem played a blinder up the left with some great shifts to take the lead at the next windward mark, we rounded second in a rapidly increasing breeze and both boats opened up a large lead on a full on flat wire blasting reach to the gybe mark where we had a synchronised swim alongside Steve Leach in the 600, leaving Dave and Maurice to loosely cover Gareth Caldwell and Oscar Chess to theFinish. All great fun!",

        "content": "A MECHANIC was followed home by cops who arrested him on his driveway after an alleged error on his vehicle. Shawn Bresnahan from Greenbriar, Arkansas , has launched a legal battle against the local police department and the officers involved in the incident on July 3. Bresnahan's day got worse when his $30,000 vehicle got impounded and he was cited for allegedly driving on a suspended license. Reporting officer Lucas Emberton stated in his incident report that he had seen Bresnahan exit a gas station in the vehicle which had expired tags. After losing sight of the vehicle, Emberton later saw it and claimed he then \"attempted to make a traffic stop\" but \"the vehicle continued driving\" until it reached the driver's house. It was in the driveway that the officer learned that the driving license had allegedly been suspended. However, Bresnahan claimed he had paperwork in his other vehicle proving that the issue with the license was solved. \"I have the paperwork to show my license is not suspended. It was suspended in error,\" he told the officer, body cam footage shared by The Real News Network revealed. Despite these claims, Emberton refused to allow Bresnahan into his house to get the keys to the truck where the documents were allegedly being kept. Instead, \"after several minutes of non-compliance,\" Emberton detained the driver and cited him for driving on a suspended license, not having insurance, and for expired tags. Bresnahan has claimed that the police department \"unlawfully seized\" the vehicle and violated his constitutional rights, according to a GoFundMe page . The driver is hoping to raise $20,000 to help with his legal fight against the city for the arrest and to get his vehicle back. In September 2023, Bresnahan filed a petition for replevin to get the vehicle back in which he claimed Emberton and other officers from the Greenbriar Police Department \"acted under color of state law.\" The complaint further alleges that the officers seized the Ford Mustang GT from Bresnahan's property without a warrant. Bresnahan \"was in lawful possession of the vehicle,\" and the \"seizure and continued possession of the vehicle is unlawful,\" the petition claimed. It added that \"despite demands, defendants have refused to return the vehicle.\" The petition sought the immediate return of the vehicle, a judgment from the court for damages, costs and attorney fees to be paid back to Bresnahan, and \"all other relief that is just and proper.\" Exhibits submitted to the court show that the towing and storage charges for the vehicle by JT Recovery and Towing LLC exceed $3,200. July 3, 2023 Sometime after 6 pm Officer Lucas Emberton spots a vehicle with expired tags at a gas station and later attempts a traffic stop on Linder Road. However, the vehicle kept going until it pulled into a driveway further down the road. Emberton realized that Shawn Bresnahan's driver's license was suspended, which the driver claims is untrue. Bresnahan is arrested and cited for driving on a suspended license, not having insurance, and for having expired tags. September 12, 2023 Bresnahan filed a civil suit with the Faulkner County Circuit Court against Officer Emberton and other related parties. September 19, 2023 The driver's request to proceed with his complaint in Forma Pauperis (in the manner of a pauper - without incurring costs) is granted by the court. October 17, 2023 J.T. Recovery and Towing has its motion to quash allegations made against it by Bresnahan accepted by the court and it is dismissed from the action. January 13, 2024 Bresnahan gets the vehicle back in his possession and has raised over $15,000 on GoFundMe to help in his legal battle. The court case is ongoing. However, the towing company claims the mechanic \"failed to exercise his right to reclaim his vehicle within 45 days of receiving notice that the vehicle would be sold an auction.\" It added that Bresnahan \"failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to the immediate possession of the property and has no valid right or title in the vehicle.\" An update on Bresnahan's fundraising page shows that he has raised over $15,240 and that the Ford Mustang has been returned to him. On January 13, he wrote: \"After a long day and night my car is now safely back in my possession! \"The junkyard owner finally let me come by the car back.\" \"There is a few issues with the car that weren't there before the cops took it, but its nothing I can't fix over time,\" he claimed. \"Now it's time to focus on the upcoming legal battles with the city, police department, and the officers. \" It's going to be a long and expensive fight, however, it has to happen. \"Otherwise it will get worse and more people will suffer for no legitimate reason.\" The court case remains open and all defendants including Greenbriar Police Department and Officer Emberton deny any wrongdoing. The U.S. Sun has contacted the attorneys of the defendants for comment.",

        "content": "The path to aespa’s debut album has been chaotic, to say the least. Whispers about their first full-length have been circulating since 2021 – the year after they debuted with ‘Black Mamba’ – but were continuously silenced in favour of a series of up-and-down mini-albums instead. Last year, when they were apparently set to put out an LP for real, internal drama at SM Entertainment saw aespa’s album seemingly become collateral damage. At last, though, the time has finally arrived for the girl group to share a more fleshed-out statement than their previous releases have afforded them (although, with 2022’s ‘Girls’ clocking in at nine tracks, there’s only a difference of one song). ‘Armageddon’ has high expectations to beat, both because of the time it’s taken to get here and the quality aespa have shown they can achieve. Thankfully, for the most part, it doesn’t let the group down. Across the album, the four-piece follow a narrative of once being insecure and uncertain in themselves, only to blossom into unwavering new levels of confidence. ‘Mine’ has the women reflecting on growing up with fear and feeling like the “fake portrait” that was their reflection in a “broken mirror” was “going to swallow me up” . By the time the song’s layers of bass-y cool have wrapped up, though, they’re standing tall. “Won’t bow my head anymore / No I won’t,” they vow. ‘Prologue’, a lilting, la-la-la-ing pop waltz, finds them getting even more comfortable with following their own path. “I don’t need to compare / My life with someone else,” aespa tell us, sharing a valuable lesson we could all learn from in our social media-reliant age. ‘Live My Life’, too, is full of strong resolutions to do things on their own terms. After all, each member is “the main character in my life” . ‘Armageddon’ begins with a group of supremely confident tracks that more than scratch the itch for the experimental pop aespa do so well. ‘Supernova’ feels both high fashion and grimy and gritty at the same time, thanks to its revving sound effects and poised swathes of synths. The title track continues that low-slung, high-attitude approach, seamlessly weaving out of softer moments, while ‘Set The Tone’ could be the group’s intro music for a big fight, full of boasts like, “We set the tone / Music on where we go / Crazy beat drum” . Elsewhere, the album dips into sonic territory that is more widely accessible but a little more hit-and-miss. ‘Bahama’ is a breezy and bright summer pop song that details taking a friend on a trip to the titular island. “Take me, take me / Take me on an / Ocean blue / Bahama, ba ba / Bahama, hama,” the group coo cheerfully over handclaps and sunkissed, sparkling melodies, forming an instantly infectious new addition to your summer playlist. ‘Licorice’ sits in the middle ground between accessible and experimental, still packing in the energy of aespa’s artistry but making it more universally palatable. On the other hand, though, there are some less successful tracks. ‘Live My Life’’s stomping pop-punk influence and the poignant glitter of ‘Melody’ are fun and sweet respectively, but both feel a little pedestrian compared to the rest of the album. ‘Long Chat (#♥)’, too, is a cute moment on the record, diving into the all-night conversations of friends. It’s a shame, then, that it struggles to make an impression that lasts as long as those streams of messages. Over the last four years, aespa’s release history has been a little checkered, with the group often sharing a record that knocks your socks off and then, on the next, losing that quality again. Happily, much of ‘Armageddon’ falls into the former camp and reinforces what we already knew – that when aespa are allowed to run free in the sounds and sonics they’ve made their trademark, they’re nothing short of exquisite.

        "content": "Inside the love life of Aussie playboy billionaire after he split from his wife - as he lives it up with a string of glamorous younger girlfriends Laurence Escalante made his fortune through gaming apps Since his divorce, the mogul has been linked to a string of women By Lucy Manly For Daily Mail Australia Published: 14:52, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 15:12, 27 May 2024 e-mail 30 shares 22 View comments The Australian billionaire behind an online gaming company is turning heads on the French Riviera alongside a bevy of beauties following his marriage split. Laurence Escalante is fast earning a reputation as a ladies' man after attending the Cannes Film Festival alongside OnlyFans 'creator' Corinna Kopf. He is believed to have wooed Ms Kopf by offering to fly her from the U.S. to Perth to check out his car collection - and his bold gambit seems to have worked a charm. Mr Escalante, 42, is the founder of one of the country's largest private companies, Virtual Gaming Worlds (VGW), which operates the wildly popular app Chumba Casino that lets players 'experience the thrill' of pokies without spending real money. Customers at the virtual 'Chumba Casino' can play games such as poker, bingo and slots without parting with their hard-earned cash - although gamers do have the option to buy virtual currencies to play with if they wish. Thanks to the success of his pseudo-gambling empire, Mr Escalante is one of the country's youngest billionaires with an estimated fortune of $3.9billion, according to the Australian Financial Review . Corinna Kopf is said to be the latest girlfriend of Perth billionaire Laurence Escalante Ms Kopf, 28, is an American OnlyFans model known for being the ex-girlfriend of YouTuber-turned- WWE superstar Logan Paul . According to a well-placed source, the pair met through social media and the billionaire flew Ms Kopf out to Perth to view his extensive car collection. The two were last week seen lapping up the French Riviera sun in Cannes and Monaco alongside fellow Australian Rich-Lister James Packer. Since splitting from his wife and mother of his four children, Sarita Escalante, in 2018, Mr Escalante has been linked to a number of women. Escalante was in a long-term relationship with Perth lawyer Sian Whyte after his marriage ended, with the pair sharing loved-up photos together on social media. They quietly split in 2022 and he moved on with Erin Snape, who is understood to be an acquaintance of Ms Whyte's. Sarita Escalante (pictured) is the ex-wife of Laurence Escalante. The former couple share four children together Perth lawyer Sian Whyte was Mr Escalante's long-term girlfriend after he split from his wife Mr Escalante dated Erin Snape for several months before she disappeared from his Instagram Model Jacinta Constantine attended the Melbourne Grand Prix with Mr Escalante in March However, she too disappeared from his Instagram in recent weeks, and he was soon spotted with a series of young women, including Perth model Jacinta Constantine. Ms Constantine was spotted by his side at the Melbourne Grand Prix in March. The two also later travelled to Japan for a holiday. In 2022, Escalante joined the ranks of Australia's richest people , with an estimated net worth of $2.15billion. Mr Escalante, known for documenting his lavish lifestyle on social media, is unafraid to spend his money and regularly shows off his expensive toys on Instagram, including a Lamborghini Tecnomar 63 yacht and a Bombardier private jet. He is also passionate about fast cars and has invested in a car modification business, Beyond Custom, as well as a training and coaching business, Arise Racing. He is said to have Australia's biggest private supercar and 'hypercar' collection, and has signed a sponsorship deal with the Ferrari F1 racing team. Last year, two of his Lamborghini Aventador Ultimaes were involved in a bungle at the hands of Crown valet staff in Perth. The two supercars, each worth $1million, are the last iteration of the Italian car manufacturer's popular Aventador model - but they are just two of the many expensive items the billionaire owns. While he now lives a luxury lifestyle with regular superyacht trips from Western Australia's beautiful beaches, the businessman has humble beginnings, having started his professional life flipping burgers at Hungry Jack's. But as his partying and spending heats up, investors are becoming increasingly concerned Virtual Gaming Worlds may never go public. Some investors were unhappy with Mr Escalante's decision, announced last March, to sponsor the Ferrari F1 team. They argued it was more based on his personal passions rather than widening VGW’s recognition in the U.S., a contention that was disputed by Mr Escalante.

        "content": "To counter this disturbing trend, California launched the California vs Hate programme in 2023, aiming to combat hate crimes. The initiative received over 1,000 reports in its inaugural year and offers a hotline and online portal for anonymous reporting, providing support to people and communities targeted by hate. New Delhi: A report by the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) suggests that anti-Hindu hate crimes have surged in the US state of California, becoming the second most reported form of religious bias. The unsettling trend unfolds amidst a broader rise in hate crimes across the state, with anti-Semitism ranking as the top form of religious hate, followed by Islamophobia. To counter this disturbing trend, California launched the California vs Hate programme in 2023, aiming to combat hate crimes. The initiative received over 1,000 reports in its inaugural year and offers a hotline and online portal for anonymous reporting, providing support to people and communities targeted by hate. Among religiously motivated incidents, anti-Hindu bias ranked second, comprising 23.3 per cent of reported cases, while anti-Semitic crimes constituted the highest at around 37 per cent and anti-Muslim hate crimes came third at 14.6 per cent. However, many hate crimes often go unreported due to various factors such as fear of retaliation, lack of culturally sensitive resources, immigration concerns and distrust of police Combatting hate crimes Governor Gavin Newsom said that “CA vs Hate” aims to uphold the diversity of California and sends a resolute message that hate will not be tolerated. The initiative responds directly to the escalating number of reported hate crimes, which saw a staggering 33 per cent increase from 2020 to 2021, reaching the highest levels since 2001. These hate crimes predominantly occur in residential areas (29.9 per cent), workplaces (9.7 per cent), and public facilities (9.1 per cent). The reports indicate that discriminatory treatment, verbal harassment and derogatory slurs are the most common forms of hate incidents. Rising threats against American Hindus Concerningly, incidents targeting Indian-Americans, particularly Hindus, have provoked significant fear and anxiety within the community. Some incidents, like the attempted burning of the Indian consulate in San Francisco and threats against Indian diplomats, have raised questions about law enforcement’s response and protection of the community. In response to these challenges, an Indian-American Democrat Congressman, alongside Hindu leaders and organizations, has called attention to the growing “Hinduphobia” in the United States, stressing the urgent need for protective measures for the community.",

        "content": "Lando Norris was frustrated with race control's decision in Monaco (Image: Getty) Lando Norris and George Russell have questioned the stewards’ decision to allow Carlos Sainz to retain third place at the Monaco Grand Prix red flag restart, with the latter labelling the decision as ‘strange’ and ‘not correct’. Sainz lined up third on the grid and challenged second-placed starter Oscar Piastri when the lights went out. However, the pair made light contact with the Ferrari driver picking up a puncture as a result. This sent him straight on into the run-off area at Casino, dropping him to the back of the running cars.

With significant debris strewn across the Monte Carlo tarmac, the stewards were left with no option but to throw the red flag. Previously, Sainz’s race looked to be all but over, but the red flag recount meant that when the cars lined up on the grid to take the restart, the 29-year-old Spaniard was allowed to return to his P3 grid slot. Norris, who would have been promoted onto the podium if his rival was forced to start at the back, was less than impressed with this decision. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114291&playerApiId=v114291');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114291\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) Don't miss...

        "content": "Former India cricketer has sent two separate legal notices to two Delhi-based real estate firms invoking arbitration clauses over alleged violation of his privacy rights in promotion of construction projects and for delayed delivery of possession of a dwelling unit to him in the national capital. One of the legal notices, sent by Delhi-based law firm Rizwan Law Associates on behalf of the cricketer, has sought \"adequate damages in terms of delay caused in completion of the Project and issuance of the Letter of Possession in the absence of any reasonable cause or extension in timeline.\" It has also sought \"delivery of proper quality, standard, class and grade of the Apartment to My Client who was promised a premium quality Apartment and has been offered an extremely inferior quality Apartment.\" According to the notice, the cricketer had booked a dwelling unit in 2020 at Hauz Khas, New Delhi in one of the projects of a real estate firm. M/s Brilliant Etoile Private Limited and M/s Uppal Housing Private Limited are the noticees in one of the legal notices pertaining to the delayed possession of the dwelling units. The second notice of the cricketer was issued to Brilliant Etoile Private Limited only and it pertained to infringement of his privacy rights. \"That this dispute principally concerns with the violation of Intellectual Property Rights with respect to the Personality Rights and misuse of Brand Value of the Celebrity i.e., My Client in contravention to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding dated 24.11.2020, however, My Client reserves the right to add the detailed instances and elaborate in further specificity in the Statement of Claim,\" the second notice said. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), the cricketer was to promote and endorse the project and the MoU expired on November 23, 2023. He is aggrieved by the alleged continued commercial use of the services provided by him, including the use of his photographs on billboards, project site, social media posts, and articles despite the expiry of the MoU, the notice said. The former India all-rounder said the alleged continued use of his image and others was in complete violation of his Copyright, Personality Rights, and Right to Publicity enshrined under the laws and protected as his Intellectual Property Rights.",

        "description": "Baroness Hale also discussed how laws around domestic abuse have changed in the UK over the years",
        "content": "As the first woman to serve as president of the UK Supreme Court, Baroness Hale has become a significant figure. She has been called the “Beyonce of the legal world”, with her eclectic choice of brooches making her an unsuspecting fashion icon. But when she became the first woman judge in the House of Lords in 2004, her arrival was not met with quite such excitement. Lady Brenda Hale, who is now Baroness Hale of Richmond, told Hay Festival audiences that she had discovered what her male colleague Lord Hope thought of her appointment upon reading his published diaries. “When I joined the House of Lords as the first woman judge, they all seemed to be extremely welcoming and friendly, these very, very bright, intelligent men – a bit scary, of course. But one of them later published his diaries. He had been keeping a diary throughout his time, he’s now published five volumes. “His entry, just before three new lords turned up, he said: ‘X’ – the man – ‘will add to the sense of good humour along the Lords corridor. Y will become our man from Northern Ireland. And Brenda will be a source of some anxiety.’” she revealed. Speaking on The News Review panel, an event in partnership with The Independent and chaired by chief book critic Martin Chilton, Baroness Hale confirmed that it was her feminist principles “that he was afraid of”. Baroness Hale made headlines in 2019 when she ruled that Boris Johnson, the prime minister at that time, had acted unlawfully in asking the Queen to prorogue Parliament. In 2021 she published her memoir, Spider Woman , with the title being a nod to the nickname she earned after she wore a spider brooch while delivering her verdict. Throughout her career, she has advocated for the rights of women. Asked if things had improved in Britain in regards to domestic abuse, Baroness Hale said progress had been made, but there was still work to do. “We started from a position when I first started writing and teaching about domestic abuse, where the police were saying, ‘Oh, we can’t interfere between man and wife because we’re in danger of breaking up the marriage.’ “When I first started as a baby barrister going to magistrate’s court, where women were bringing cases against their husbands with a long list of specific incidents of horrible things having happened to them, the magistrates were still obliged to lean over the bench and ask, ‘Now, is there any chance of your reconciling?’” She noted that in recent years the definition of abuse has expanded beyond physical violence, citing a case in 2013 “where we said that violence is a wider concept than hitting. Men are afraid of being hit, but women are afraid of much more subtle forms of what we now call coercive control.” More women would be encouraged to report cases of rape or sexual assault if the earlier stages of the investigation were more effective, she added, stating that things are “not always as thorough as they should be – all these horror stories about samples being in overflowing fridges and going off and things like that”. Hay Festival runs from 23 May to 2 June in Hay-on-Wye; hayfestival.com.",

        "content": "Joshua Zirkzee hinted that he’d stay with this summer despite widespread interest from Italy and abroad, calling their Champions League qualification ‘unforgettable’. The 23-year-old Dutch striker was a key figure behind the Rossoblu’s Cinderella story in Serie A this term, netting 11 goals and providing five assists across 34 league matches to help the club qualify for Europe’s premier club competition. Over the last few months, much has been written about Zirkzee’s future, his €40m release clause and the interest of a long list of clubs including Arsenal, , , and more. He is contracted to to June 2026. Speaking to Corriere di Bologna via , Zirkzee was first asked if he believes he can reach the top level following his work with Bologna this campaign. “I have to believe in it, I have to be convinced of it, as a player I have to have faith in my abilities and say: ‘Yes, I can get to that level’. It wouldn’t make sense for me to think otherwise. In Italy we already play against Champions League teams. “Ok, we don’t know the competition, but the level yes, because Serie A is high quality, difficult. It will be a great challenge, very exciting. “I dreamed of playing it since I was a child, I won it with Bayern Munich, but now it will be exciting to play it, because with the German club it’s as if I hadn’t done it. Now I’ll be on the pitch living the moment.” Zirkzee was then posed the idea of leaving the Rossoblu this summer. “At the moment my mind is only in Bologna. I want to recover from the injury, have some nice holidays in the United States with my childhood friends and then we’ll see what happens.” He was asked what he’d choose, if it was up to him. “I’d choose the best for the club. I will only do what makes sense in my heart.” Finally, Zirkzee spoke about how it would feel to play in the Champions League with Bologna. “Exactly, that’s what I said, and I’ll repeat it. It’s clear that for me it would be wonderful to defend this goal achieved together. What we experienced in Piazza Maggiore was unforgettable.”",

        "content": "The billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has just unveiled his latest summer reading list, featuring a blend of books and a TV show emphasizing service and human connection. Gates, who frequently shares his top book picks, highlights one book in particular this season. On his blog, he described it as a must-read that has profoundly impacted him. The book is “How to Know a Person” by David Brooks, a bestselling author and New York Times op-ed columnist. In this compelling work, Brooks offers insights into becoming a better listener, prompting Gates to reflect on his communication skills in lasting ways. Bill Gates’ summer reading list ‘The Women’ by Kristin Hannah Kristin Hannah’s bestseller, set during the Vietnam War, follows Frances McGrath’s harrowing experiences as an Army Nurse Corps member. Gates read it while vacationing in Vietnam. ‘Infectious Generosity’ by Chris Anderson In this new book, TED Conference head Chris Anderson redefines generosity, urging everyone from individuals to corporations to embrace broader acts of kindness. Anderson explores how to inspire generous actions beyond financial donations, emphasizing time, skills, and compassion. “If you want to help create a more equitable world but don’t know where to start, ‘Infectious Generosity’ is for you,” Gates wrote. ‘Slow Horses’ on Apple TV+ Streaming on Apple TV+, “Slow Horses” is a spy series based on Mick Herron’s “Slough House” novels. It centers on MI5 agents stuck in career limbo yet determined to serve their country. ‘Brave New Words’ by Sal Khan Sal Khan, founder of Khan Academy, makes a compelling case for AI’s potential to revolutionize education in “Brave New Words.” Gates, a supporter of Khan Academy, underscores AI’s ability to assist teachers and provide personalized tutoring, thereby narrowing the education gap. ‘How to Know a Person’ by David Brooks David Brooks’ guide to becoming a “loud” listener goes beyond active listening to engaging deeply with others’ stories. Gates finds it transformative, highlighting how such engagement can enrich relationships.

        "content": "LAPORAN Bank Dunia di tahun 2022 menyebutkan, saat ini populasi dunia mencapai lebih dari 7,9 miliar jiwa, dan terus meningkat setiap tahunnya. Angka tersebut berbanding terbalik dengan ketersediaan dunia. Indonesia sendiri diperkirakan akan mengalami krisis air bersih pada tahun 2040. Ancaman ini tentunya memerlukan penanganan dan antisipasi khusus agar masyarakat tidak kekurangan air bersih. Pakar hidrologi sekaligus Dekan Sekolah Vokasi , Prof Dr. Ing. Ir. Agus Maryono, IPM. ASEAN.Eng. dikenal sebagai orang yang memperkenalkan Gerakan Indonesia dan Gerakan Restorasi Indonesia. Lewat siaran pers, Agus Maryono mengatakan, air hujan dapat menjadi salah satu sumber air alternatif, terlebih dengan kondisi dua musim yang dimiliki Indonesia. \"Sebenarnya air tanah itu tidak hanya dipompa, dipakai, dan diukur, tapi perlu dikonservasi. Salah satu konservasinya adalah dengan air hujan,\" kata Agus. Menurut Agus, air hujan yang turun setiap periode musim penghujan selama ini langsung dialirkan ke saluran tanpa adanya upaya pengolahan kembali. Padahal, rata-rata curah hujan Indonesia mencapai 2.000-3.000 millimeter per tahun. Air hujan yang dikonversi bisa diinjeksikan ke dalam tanah itu akan bisa memperbaiki kualitas dan kuantitas air tanah. Selain memanen air hujan, Agus Maryono juga menyampaikan upaya restorasi sungai. Menurutnya, sungai memiliki peran strategis bagi kehidupan masyarakat, termasuk dalam hal ketersediaan air bersih. Sayangnya, kondisi sungai-sungai di Indonesia justru sangat memprihatinkan dengan adanya tumpukan sampah dan ekosistem yang tidak terawat. Untuk itu, ia menawarkan lima konsep restorasi sungai, yakni restorasi hidrologi, restorasi ekologi, morfologi, sosial ekonomi, serta restorasi kelembagaan dan peraturan. Kedua, solusi menghadapi ancaman krisis air ini sudah diterapkan bertahun-tahun di masyarakat dan menuai hasil yang signifikan. Kecamatan Tegalrejo, Yogyakarta dan Glintung, Malang menjadi dua desa yang memelopori Gerakan Memanen Air Hujan. Komitmen Kecamatan Tegalrejo menerapkan inovasi tersebut membuat daerah ini mendapat predikat Kampung Ramah Air Hujan. Ide untuk memberikan solusi menghadapi ancaman krisis air bersih ini juga sudah disampaikan Agus Maryono dalam workshop internasional Groundwater Sustainability in Indonesia: A Scoping Study to Pilot a Participatory Groundwater Management Approach pada 7-8 Mei 2024 lalu di Jakarta. ini menjadi salah satu respons terhadap isu ketersediaan air beserta penanganannya, khususnya di Indonesia. yang berlangsung selama dua hari ini merupakan hasil kerja sama dari beberapa lembaga, antara lain Western Sydney University, Indonesian National Committee of UNESCO International Hydrology Program (IHP), Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN), Kementerian Pekerjaan Umum dan Perumahan Rakyat (PUPR), dan Pusat Riset Limnologi dan Sumber Daya Air (PRLSDA). Selain itu, Departemen Urusan Luar Negeri Australia melalui Australian Water Partnership (AWP) juga menjadi sponsor utama dalam workshop ini. Kesadaran akan ancaman krisis air bersih diharapkan dapat tumbuh di masyarakat, sehingga memunculkan kebiasaan bijak menggunakan air bersih. \"Krisis air itu akan terjadi, karena perubahan iklim. Masyarakat akan tergantung pada air-air yang dari PDAM, lama-lama tidak bisa memenuhi kebutuhan. Saya harap pemerintah bisa mendesain untuk memaksimal air hujan ini untuk kebutuhan masyarakat,\" tutup Agus. (H-2)",

        "content": "A warning has been issued after a missle has appeared to be launched from North Korea . \"Please take refuge inside a building or underground,\" a media alert issued in Japan warned. It comes after North Korea earlier announced their plans to launch a rocket during an eight-day period starting from today ( Monday, May 27). Their plans sparked backlash from both South Korea and Japan but their anger hasn't seemed to deter the country from using the missle. The equipment is believed to be carrying a military spy satellite despite the U.N banning North Korea from conducting such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology . North Korea test fires ballistic missile as tensions mount over jet drill A military spy satellite was launched late last year ( Image: AP) North Korea has continuously backed its plans to launch satellites and test missiles. The country explained that spy satellites will allow it to thoroughly monitor the U.S. and South Korea. North Korea also believes such tests will help them improve its strike capability of its nuclear-style missiles. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida met Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Seoul for their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. \"Any launch (by North Korea) using ballistic missile technology would directly violate U.N. Security Council resolutions and undermine peace and security of the region and the world ,\" Yoon said at the start of the meeting with Kishida and Li. \"If North Korea presses ahead with its launch despite the international warning, I think the international community must sternly deal with it.\" Kishida strongly urged North Korea to cancel the launch. China is a North Korean ally, and Li didn't mention the North Korean satellite. In phone talks earlier Monday, senior diplomats from Japan, South Korea and the United States agreed to call on North Korea to abandon the launch. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol warned North Korea to step down ( Image: Getty Images) South Korea's Unification Ministry, which deals with North Korea, separately called a satellite launch by the North \"a provocation that seriously threatens our and regional security.\" In an updated tweet, local media confirmed that the missle isn't expected to settle in Japan. UN Nerve wrote: \"The missile that was just launched is not expected to land in our country. The call for evacuation has been lifted.\" Last November, North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a governing party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024.",

        "description": "She said it had left her 'distraught'",
        "content": "A single mum-of-three lost her £6,000 life savings to a Tinder crypto scammer. Natalie Foster, 42, matched with a man on Tinder three weeks ago. The pair hit it off immediately before the man, 'James', began talking incessantly about crypto. He convinced Natalie to get a crypto wallet – a virtual wallet which allows you to buy and keep cryptocurrency. She was convinced to upload money and 'trade' crypto - with the scammers initially making it look like she had made profits up to $86,000. But this quickly dropped to zero before she was able to withdraw any cash - with her losing a total of £6,000. Natalie, from Winsford, Cheshire, said: “I feel stupid, I feel ridiculous – I can't believe I'm one of these women I read about in magazines.” Natalie, who is signed off work due to her MS, said once she matched with “James”, he began being very forward. She added: “He looked like a really good-looking guy, he had nice dogs, and was being very forward – I wasn’t that into that\". A week into them chatting James brought up that he had an uncle who had made a fortune in the crypto world. Natalie said: “I’m not a gambler, but he was very convincing. He told me to put in £300 and then transfer it to a trading platform. I did it and then made £80 profit.\" Natalie then invested another £100 on the trading platform and made another £93 though she would never receive the money. A few days later, James said that the following evening would be “a very big night.” She said: \"He convinced me to put in even more money, so I put £2,000 down. He then said he had been in touch with his uncle who had told him there was a once-in-a-century deal about to go down and I could make 800 per cent profit.” Natalie then withdrew all the money she had left from her savings and transferred it to the crypto trading account – totalling £3,500. She was then added to a WhatsApp group with a man purporting to be her Tinder match’s uncle and another person. According to Natalie, they then did a trade which bagged $86,000 profit on her trading platform account. When she went to look at it herself it briefly said she had exceeded the amount she could hold in it before her total funds suddenly changed to zero. Natalie said: “I then contacted customer services, who said I owed them 20 per cent tax to a New York Bank account totalling £20,000.\" But then James transferred $5,000 into her trading platform account. Natalie said: “At this point I thought it was still legit, but I then talked to my ex-partner and he gave me a reality check. I realised I had literally fallen for a textbook crypto scam.\" None of the profits from the trades ever went back to her apart from the initial £80, with Natalie losing £6,000 in total. She then went back to James to confront him about the scam to which he told her to “go and die quickly”. He then unmatched her and vanished without a trace. Natalie said looking back there were “all these red flags” including James saying he was German, but not having a German accent, and even getting the names of his own pet dogs mixed up while his pictures, Natalie said, were “clearly just downloaded from somewhere online\". She has since reported what happened to her to Action Fraud and has instructed a solicitor, who is hopeful Natalie will be able to get her money back. Natalie said: “It was my whole life savings which I inherited off my grandad - it’s left me totally distraught.\" It has led to mum-of-three Natalie having suicidal thoughts. She added: “I just feel stupid and ridiculous. It's so awful - I don't know how they can do this to other people.”",

        "description": "Tom Brady's media colleagues have high hopes for his upcoming performance as Fox's lead in-game NFL analyst.",
        "content": "Well-known media personality Erin Andrews of Fox Sports is among those who believe retired quarterback Tom Brady will impress as Fox's lead in-game NFL analyst later this year. \"I’ve sat with him at lunch before and he’s been telling stories about his career,\" Andrews said about Brady during a recent appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" per Christian Arnold of the New York Post and Reice Shipley of Awful Announcing. \"And it’s stuff we just die for. Love the inside information. And you are just hearing stuff that you’ve just always wanted to know.\" Brady and Fox agreed to a 10-year deal reportedly worth $375M that was announced in 2022 before he called time on his playing career \"for good\" in February 2023. He's set to replace fan-favorite Greg Olsen on Fox's No. 1 NFL broadcasting team, and Olsen has insisted he will \"be as much of a resource as I can\" for Brady from now through the 2024 season. \"Everybody’s worried about the commentating,\" Andrews joked about certain attributes Brady is bringing to Fox broadcasts. \"I’m just like, 'The guy’s skin. I have to deal with this, him being on my crew.' I know because we talk about it a lot on our podcast.\" Charissa Thompson of Fox added during the segment that Brady's résumé \"supports that he is great at everything he does\" and suggests that the seven-time Super Bowl champion will also excel calling games alongside play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt. Arguably the biggest unknown about Brady's next career step is related to his attempt to purchase a minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders. At least some owners reportedly aren't keen on any part owner of a team having inside access to other clubs via production meetings, and it remains unclear when a vote among the rest of the league's owners regarding Brady's proposed transaction will occur. While Olsen became an award-winning announcer in the role that's no longer his, the harsh truth of the matter is that he lacks Brady's star power among both diehard and casual football fans. Brady likely won't be as sharp in the booth as Olsen in Week 1 this coming September, but Fox is banking on viewers tuning in to see if TB12 will either flop or flourish calling games for worldwide audiences.",

        "content": "Mysore/Mysuru : Personalities such as Bangalore North University Vice-Chancellor Dr. Niranjan Vanalli , Karnataka Nataka Academy Chairman K.V. Nagaraja Murthy, former NAAC Director Prof. S.C. Sharma and former Rangayana Director Rajaram have demanded that the Government should frame a ‘Clear Cultural Policy’ for promotion of Arts, Literature, Drama, Music and other forms of Art. They spoke on the topic “The influence of the power structure on the representation for lower sections of the society in Performing Arts and Media” at the two-day National Seminar organised by Karnataka State Mass Communication and Journalism Teachers Association at KSGH Music and Performing Arts University on JLB road here on recently. Dr. Vanalli, in his address, observed that of late, private visual and the print media are neglecting Arts, Literature, Drama and Dance. Noting that cultural events and activities used to get importance in the earlier days, he lamented that today the media are showing disinterest for telecasting such events. Karnataka Nataka Academy Chairman Nagaraja Murthy said it is matter of joy that the Karnataka Government declared Basavanna as the cultural leader of the State. A great social reformer Basavanna can even become a global cultural icon, he added. Former NAAC Director Prof. Sharma said that the Music University has earned name for promotion of Arts. Observing that the University can earn more name and fame if it promotes Hindustani Music and Performing Arts on a much higher scale, Prof. Sharma asserted that a firm cultural policy was needed for reaching out the Government’s cultural events and activities to a larger population.

Bettakote has put the Varsity on track by overcoming the hurdles and problems that surfaced. Stressing that the co-operation of Government is vital for youths to take a broader and deeper interest in Arts and Culture, he noted that a firm cultural policy is needed for this to happen. Music University Registrar K.S. Rekha, Karnataka Sangeetha Nruthya Academy Chairperson Dr. Kripa Phadke and others were present. Dr. Niranjan Vanalli",

        "content": "Norwich City are interested in signing Nordsjaelland left-back Martin Frese, according to reports from Denmark. Frese worked under Johannes Hoff Thorup since 2015, when the prospective next Canaries head coach was working in the academy at Nordsjaelland. The 26-year-old became a regular after Thorup was appointed as assistant manager and continued to be one when he got the top job, playing 29 league games last season. He's available on a free transfer this summer after allowing his contract with the Superliga club to run down, with City looking for a left-back after announcing the departures of Sam McCallum and Dimitris Giannoulis. Bold have reported that they sent a scout to Scandinavia earlier in the spring, introducing Frese to the club as they aimed for Premier League promotion. They claim that talks went quiet after Norwich failed to do so, but that Frese is keen to move abroad. He's spent the entirety of his senior career with the Tigers, progressing through their academy before making his debut in May 2017 and going on to play 131 times. Speaking before his final home game for the club, Nordsjaelland director of football Jan Laursen said of the full-back: \"Frese has a long history here at the club, and you can't give him enough credit for being the team player and club man he is and always has been. \"He always gives 100pc and has shown enormous mental strength, not least when he has had to fight back from serious injuries. He has grown big and strong - and has developed into an absolute key player. \"At the same time, Frese has been through pretty much the entire academy and taken the steps we would very much like to see - both in terms of playing and as a person - and therefore we clearly hope that it will be a 'see you' instead of a goodbye. \"It will be exciting to follow him and hopefully see him back in FCN at some point.
