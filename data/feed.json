        "description": "The College Football Playoff is getting a makeover in 2024! Check out the new format, bracket, selection committee, schedule and other details.",
        "content": "For the first time in a decade, college football has changed the way it determines its champion. In case you've been living off the grid, the field will expand from four to 12 teams in the fall of 2024. The 13-member selection committee remains in place, and its mission is essentially the same as it's always been, according to the College Football Playoff: \"The selection committee's task will be to select the best teams, rank the teams for inclusion in the playoff and selected other bowl games and then assign the teams to sites.\" Here's everything you need to know about how that will actually work. The five highest-ranked conference champions and the next seven highest-ranked teams will earn a spot in the 12-team bracket. There is no limit to how many teams from one conference can qualify. The rules also don't guarantee spots for certain conferences. The champions of the Big 12, SEC, ACC and Big Ten will almost certainly routinely qualify, though, along with the highest-ranked champion from the Mountain West, American Athletic Conference, Sun Belt, Mid-American Conference or Conference USA. There is no minimum ranking requirement for the five highest-ranked conference champions. There could be a conference champion ranked No. 23, for example, that's the fifth highest-ranked league winner and earns a spot in the playoff -- at the expense of the committee's No. 12 team. The four highest-ranked conference champions will earn the top four seeds and receive a first-round bye. The other eight teams will play in the first round, with the higher seeds hosting the lower seeds either on campus or \"at other sites designated by the higher-seeded institution.\" That means any team that doesn't earn the luxury of a first-round bye will have to win four straight games to win the national championship. If a team lost in its conference championship game and played in four straight playoff games, it would have played an unprecedented total of 17 games. Be careful not to confuse the seeding with the selection committee's ranking. The 13-member committee will still issue its weekly top 25, which will be used to determine the highest-ranked conference champs. That means, though, that if Georgia wins the SEC and is ranked No. 1 by the selection committee, and Alabama loses that game and is No. 3 in the CFP ranking -- or even No. 2! -- the Tide will be seeded No. 5 behind three other conference champs and Georgia. (Read that again, please.) Any independent like Notre Dame cannot earn a first-round bye because it cannot win a conference title. That also applies to Washington State and Oregon State, which have a temporary scheduling arrangement with the Mountain West and can compete for the national championship but aren't eligible to win the MWC and don't constitute a league of their own, per NCAA and CFP rules. Once the teams are seeded on Selection Day, the seeds are final. There won't be any reseeding. There won't be any modifications made to avoid rematches or games between schools from the same conference.

The committee members meet every Monday and part of Tuesday morning to determine each of their six weekly rankings, starting on Nov. 5. When circumstances indicate that teams are comparable, committee members must consider: Championships won Strength of schedule Head-to-head competition Comparative outcomes of common opponents (without incenting margin of victory) Other relevant factors such as unavailability of key players and coaches that might have affected a team's performance during the season or likely will affect its postseason performance These factors are not weighted, and an individual committee member can place a greater value on one factor than the person sitting next to them might. If a committee member or an immediate family member is (a) compensated by a school, (b) provides professional services for a school or (c) is on the coaching staff or administrative staff or is a player at a school, that committee member will be recused. Recused members aren't allowed to vote for those teams and are allowed only to answer factual questions about that school. Recused committee members aren't allowed to be in the room during any deliberations about that team's selection or seeding. They also aren't allowed to participate in discussions about what bowl game that team might be assigned to. The voting is done electronically on the members' individual laptops and is done by secret ballot. Nobody knows how anyone else in the room voted unless they choose to share that. Voting generally includes about seven rounds of ballots. The voters start with a small pool of teams, rank them and begin with the top-ranked teams placed in the rankings in groups of three or four. They continue to repeat that process until 25 teams have been ranked. There isn't one metric that earns a team its spot over another. Instead, it's a subjective analysis of a plethora of statistics available to the committee members from a company called SportSource Analytics. Each FBS team has a \"team sheet\" with its statistics and schedule strength listed, along with its situational record (i.e., 3-1 vs. current CFP Top 25 teams). There are ranks for offense, defense, special teams and efficiencies. The New Year's Six bowl games -- Rose, Orange, Sugar, Cotton, Fiesta and Peach bowls -- are still a part of the CFP. For the quarterfinal games, the committee will assign the four highest-ranked conference champions to four of those bowls on Selection Day immediately after the bracket has been set. Those teams will be slotted with consideration of historic bowl relationships and seeding. The No. 1 seed will earn preferential treatment for its bowl slot and will not be put at a geographical disadvantage. Recently, the Sugar Bowl has had a contractual agreement with the SEC and the Big 12, while the Rose maintains a relationship with the Big Ten (or Washington State and Oregon State from what's left of the Pac-12). The Orange hosts a semifinal this year, along with the Cotton Bowl. The selection committee will release its first of six rankings on Nov. 5. They are released each following Tuesday. The final ranking will be released on Dec. 8.

        "content": "HONG KONG , May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- With generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) transforming the social interaction landscape in recent years, large language models (LLMs), which use deep-learning algorithms to train GenAI platforms to process language, have been put in the spotlight. A recent study by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) found that LLMs perform more like the human brain when being trained in more similar ways as humans process language, which has brought important insights to brain studies and the development of AI models. Current large language models (LLMs) mostly rely on a single type of pretraining - contextual word prediction. This simple learning strategy has achieved surprising success when combined with massive training data and model parameters, as shown by popular LLMs such as ChatGPT. Recent studies also suggest that word prediction in LLMs can serve as a plausible model for how humans process language. However, humans do not simply predict the next word but also integrate high-level information in natural language comprehension. A research team led by Prof. Li Ping , Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Sin Wai Kin Foundation Professor in Humanities and Technology at PolyU , has investigated the next sentence prediction (NSP) task, which simulates one central process of discourse-level comprehension in the human brain to evaluate if a pair of sentences is coherent, into model pretraining and examined the correlation between the model's data and brain activation. The study has been recently published in the academic journal Sciences Advances . The research team trained two models, one with NSP enhancement and the other without, both also learned word prediction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from people reading connected sentences or disconnected sentences. The research team examined how closely the patterns from each model matched up with the brain patterns from the fMRI brain data. It was clear that training with NSP provided benefits. The model with NSP matched human brain activity in multiple areas much better than the model trained only on word prediction. Its mechanism also nicely maps onto established neural models of human discourse comprehension. The results gave new insights into how our brains process full discourse such as conversations. For example, parts of the right side of the brain, not just the left, helped understand longer discourse. The model trained with NSP could also better predict how fast someone read - showing that simulating discourse comprehension through NSP helped AI understand humans better. Recent LLMs, including ChatGPT, have relied on vastly increasing the training data and model size to achieve better performance. Prof. Li Ping said, \"There are limitations in just relying on such scaling. Advances should also be aimed at making the models more efficient, relying on less rather than more data. Our findings suggest that diverse learning tasks such as NSP can improve LLMs to be more human-like and potentially closer to human intelligence.\" He added, \"More importantly, the findings show how neurocognitive researchers can leverage LLMs to study higher-level language mechanisms of our brain. They also promote interaction and collaboration between researchers in the fields of AI and neurocognition, which will lead to future studies on AI-informed brain studies as well as brain-inspired AI.\" Media Contact Ms Annie Wong Senior Manager, Public Affairs Tel: +852 3400 3853 Email: anniewy.wong@polyu.edu.hk",

        "content": "Guizhou event showcases ethnic cultures and province's charming vibrancy GUIYANG, China , May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- A news report from Publicity Department of the CPC Guiyang Municipal Committee: Moved by the cheerful rhythm of song and dressed in a traditional costume, Chen Chuanqian, along with many others from different ethnic groups, sang and danced in Guiyang , capital of Southwest China's Guizhou province. At 9:30 am on May 18 , thousands of people from various ethnic groups from all over Guizhou gathered and paraded in Guiyang . Wearing different costumes, they assembled on a parade square, playing a traditional musical instrument known as the lusheng (reed-pipe flute), banging gongs and drums, and singing and dancing. The parade route stretched more than 2 kilometers in the downtown area and served as a \"mobile grand stage\" for showcasing the ethnic cultures' diversity. Hu Xiaohua , a 56-year-old resident at the front of the crowd, enjoyed the show, saying that \"I'm particularly impressed seeing such a grand event in the central urban area.\" The event's director, Tang Huang, says that, themed around ethnic unity and collective celebration, the carnival not only focused on showcasing the colorful ethnic cultures of Guizhou , but was also aimed to let more people see the open, confident and vibrant side of Guizhou . In addition to the carnival, Guiyang caters to younger tourists by incorporating various activities like city walks, a unique way to experience urban culture and lifestyle, vintage markets and trendy exhibitions. Abundant in tourism resources, Guizhou features attractive natural scenery and rich ethnic customs. The province boasts internationally renowned sites, such as the Huangguoshu Waterfall in Anshun and the Xiaoqikong (seven small arches) scenic area in Libo county, as well as diverse forms of ethnic intangible cultural heritage. With an average altitude of 1,100 meters above sea level, Guizhou has pleasant summer temperatures averaging 22.3 C and more than 55 percent of the province is covered by forests, making it one of the country's best summer tourist destinations. The grand parade celebration held in Guiyang was part of the countdown city relay for China Tourism Day, which fell on Sunday and is organized by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Celebrations were conducted in six cities — Guiyang , Chaozhou, Guangdong province; Shenyang , Liaoning province; Shijiazhuang , Hebei province; Ningbo , Zhejiang province; and Ordos in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.",

Two-time PGA Tour winner Grayson Murray died Saturday morning, May 25, 2024 at age 30, one day after he withdrew from the Charles Schwab Cup Challenge at Colonial(AP Photo/Matt York, File) Grayson Murray’s parents said Sunday their 30-year-old son took his own life, just one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event. The family asked for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. “If that becomes his legacy, we could ask for nothing else,” Eric and Terry Murray said in a statement released by the PGA Tour. Murray, a two-time PGA Tour winner, spoke in January after winning the Sony Open in Honolulu about turning the corner in his life, his golf and battles with alcoholism and mental health. He died Saturday morning. A statement below from Grayson's parents, Eric and Terry Murray. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, please call the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the United States at 988 or visit their website at https://t.co/j0traBx8ia . pic.twitter.com/wPsaYMrWrH — PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) May 26, 2024 Murray had to go through the Korn Ferry Tour to get his PGA Tour card back. And then he birdied the last hole at the Sony Open to get into a playoff, and made a 40-foot birdie putt on the first extra hole for an emotional win. “It’s not easy,” Murray said immediately after winning. “I wanted to give up a lot of times. Give up on myself. Give up on the game of golf. Give up on life, at times.” Murray tied for 43rd last week in the PGA Championship, which enabled him to hold his position among the top 60 to earn a spot in the U.S. Open next month at Pinehurst No. 2 in his native North Carolina. He shot 68 in the opening round at Colonial. The next round, he was 5 over and coming off three straight bogeys when he withdrew citing an illness. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said he spoke with Murray’s parents about halting play at Colonial and they insisted the golf tournament continue. Monahan flew to Fort Worth, Texas, to be with players. Many of them wore black-and-red pins on their caps Sunday in honor of Murray. Those are the colors of the Carolina Hurricanes, his favorite NHL team. “We have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone. It’s surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It’s a nightmare,” his parents shared in their statement. “We have so many questions that have no answers. But one. Was Grayson loved? The answer is yes. By us, his brother Cameron, his sister Erica, all of his extended family, by his friends, by his fellow players and — it seems — by many of you who are reading this. He was loved and he will be missed. “Life wasn’t always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now.” Grayson was a raw talent after taking up golf at age 8. He won his age division three straight years at the prestigious Junior World Championship in San Diego. But he struggled to fit in at college, going to Wake Forest, East Carolina and then Arizona State. His first coach was Ted Kiegel in North Carolina, who like so many others was devastated. “Words cannot express the tragedy of this moment,” Kiegel said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. “Grayson came from something that was ordinary and made it EXTRAORDINARY. ... He burned bright for the 30 years he gave us.” Murray won as a 22-year-old rookie at the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky, and frustration began to set in as he didn’t improve as quickly as others whom he routinely beat as amateurs. He was always open about depression and anxiety, and his bouts with alcohol. One of his darker moments was at the Sony Open in 2021 when he was suspended for an incident in a Hawaii bar. Murray took to social media to say, “Why was I drunk? Because I’m a (expletive) alcoholic that hates everything to do with the PGA Tour life and that’s my scapegoat.” He also accused the tour of not giving him proper help, which the tour denied. Monahan said Saturday at Colonial that he called Murray right after that posting and subsequently spent a lot of time with him. “I think one of the elements of his legacy is his resiliency,” Monahan said. “So you think of going back to 2017, winning the Barbasol Championship, going back and forth between the Korn Ferry Tour and the PGA Tour. ... self-assessing, coming back, becoming in his own eyes a stronger human being, and then winning three times in the past year. “To me, that’s a level of resiliency that is extraordinary.” When he won on the Korn Ferry Tour last year, Murray talked about his parents having “been through hell and back basically for the last six years for me fighting some mental stuff.” “Everyone has their battles,” Murray said a year ago. “Sometimes people are able to hide them and function, and sometimes you’re not. I think our society now is getting better about accepting that it’s OK to not be OK. I’ve embraced that mentality. I’m not ashamed that I go through depression and anxiety.” He also used social media to reach out to others dealing with similar issues in a sport where losing takes place far more than winning. Murray said in January after he won the Sony Open that he often felt like a failure who had wasted his talent. “It was a bad place, but like I said, you have to have courage,” he said. “You have to have the willingness to keep going. Lo and behold, that’s what I did, and I’m here, and I’m so blessed and I’m thankful.” Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

He said he had become a Christian and was engaged to Christiana Ritchie. He said in January the wedding had been planned for late April. “My story is not finished. I think it’s just beginning,” Murray said in Hawaii. “I hope I can inspire a lot of people going forward that have their own issues.”",

        "content": "Unnikrishnan and Soumini wanted a beautiful house in the countryside to spend their life after retirement in a peaceful ambience. The couple roped in noted architect Shyamraj to design their dream abode at Thamarappilly near Manalur in Thrissur, Kerala. The house named ‘Harsham’ stands in the centre of a spacious plot. ‘Harsham’ features the classic elements of traditional Vastusastra and has all the facilities to enjoy a peaceful life, away from the buzz of the city. Moreover, the couple who loves greenery and organic farming has enough space in the yard to indulge in their favourite activity. Beautiful mango trees, with thick foliage, offer shade while drawing instant attention. The house basks in the glory of such fabulous greenery that surrounds it. The yard and the garden have been designed in such a way to make the interiors cosy and warm. The house and the surrounding nature look like perfect scenery in an impressionist painting. The sit-out feels cool as it is under the shade of the mango tree. Meanwhile, leftover clay tiles, have been polished and paved in the front yard in unique designer pattern. The pond close to the sit-out improves the ambience of the front yard. The windows and doors in the house have been designed to suit the modern age. Meanwhile, old timber is reused to exude an old-world charm. The living areas, dining space and the kitchen are open and spacious. The dining area has an extension that is used as a utility space. The couple mostly eats at the quaint table in the kitchen when they are alone. However, when their children and grand children come, the family arranges the dining table in the spacious courtyard. The custom-made furniture pieces are extremely attractive. Meanwhile, the wooden ceiling grants a classy ambience to the interiors. Minimalism seems to be the basic theme as it is quite evident in the incredible furnishing, furniture, flooring works and even the colour palette. Moreover, the spaces are arranged to make maintenance and cleaning easier for the old couple. The beautiful courtyard is the soul of this house. The long windows and the amazing jali works let natural light and cool breeze into the interiors. A layer of protective netting has been fixed over the jali for additional safety. The rays of sunshine that come in through the small glass openings create a fabulous chiaroscuro of shadows on the walls. The bay windows in the three bedrooms in the house are amazing additions. There are two bedrooms on the ground floor and one on the upper floor. The bay windows that open to the mesmerizing nature outside are perfect spots to relax. The modern kitchen is separated using a small partition. The open spaces allow good view of the entrance area from the kitchen. Meanwhile, the wash area is arranged in the dining area, close to the kitchen. A glass bay window could be seen at the first landing of the staircase. From here, you could enjoy the fabulous view of the charming mango tree. The hand railing of the staircase is designed as a continuation of this bay window. The balcony features a unique design in order to ensure connectivity between both floors. The owner says that he enjoys reading and spending time here. The walls with cement finish look rustic. ‘Harsham’ stands out for its harmony of scintillating greenery, cool water bodies, abundant supply of fresh air and natural light as well as spectacular design elements. The pictures of this splendid abode have already become viral on social media.

        "content": "During the post-show media scrum for AEW Double or Nothing, Tony Khan gave an update on ROH Women’s Champion Athena, who suffered an injury earlier this month . He also spoke about the possibility of more championships, noting that he has considered mixed tag team titles. Here are highlights: On the possibility of a tag or trios titles for the women’s division : “Absolutely. We’ve talked about that. We’ve talked a lot about potential additions in terms of championships. I think right now, we have some really strong rivalries emerging amongst the world championship, TBS championship and also with ROH. You can’t deny that ROH has great champions now. We just crowned a new Ring of Honor women’s world television champion in Billie Starkz.” On the status of Athena : “[Starkz’] mentor, Athena, might be the best wrestler in the world and is the Ring of Honor Women’s World Champion. She is a little beat up herself right now, but she is going to be 100% very soon as we are bringing ROH and AEW to Texas, her home state and actually Dallas, her home city.” On trying to build a deep women’s division : “There’s a lot of great things happening in AEW and ROH in the men’s and women’s divisions. I think it’s something that could be very good possibilities down the line. But we’re also still really trying to build the depth back to the strongest I think it’s ever been. There was a point, All Out 2021, where I was coaching the Casino Battle Royale and we had 21 women in that battle royale and a great Britt Baker vs. Kris Statlander championship match. I think that was, top to bottom, up until now, the deepest the division has ever been. A lot of great people from that match have been out or injured for various reasons and not with us. We’re going to keep getting depth back and division’s gonna keep getting stronger and stronger.” On new titles : “Those are both very interesting championships, I also think something different we could do here, that I have interest in, would be mixed tag team championships. I think we have a lot of people would be interested in that too. That’s different than what other major promotions have, and I think it would set AEW apart. So I’m also interested in mixed tag team championships.”",

        "content": "People have been left \"sobbing and throwing up in British\" after an American woman has shared how she prepares her version of the perfect cuppa. When it comes to a cup of tea, us Brits are so fussy about our precious drink. We want it done to our liking, and we don't appreciate anything less than perfection. Perhaps that's why one woman has been inundated with gobsmacked tea lovers commented on her video when she shared how she likes to prepare her tea . Penny Kmitt, often shares what life looks like day-to-day as a television reporter for CBS. The news reporter often conducts get-ready-with-me videos, news updates, and what goes on behind the scenes on her TikTok page. Recently, the TV star was showcasing her early morning routine. To the dismay of many Brits, she did not use a kettle to prepare her morning cuppa, but used a microwave. Man tries gut-busting breakfast challenge - but is roasted when 'after' photo is shared Despite owning a kettle, Penny puts cold water into a mug before heating it up in the microwave. She warms up the water for two minutes before dropping an Earl Grey teabag into it. Penny insists she does not have time to wait for the kettle to boil, and believes using her microwave saves her time. She explained that her kettle takes over six minutes to boil. \"Not only does this take much longer, but it is way too hot to drink right away,\" she explained. As she took a sip of her microwaved tea, she added: \"This is ready to go, I rest my case.\" But people couldn't believe the way she prepares her tea, and rushed to shared their thoughts. One individual pointed out that she could get a better kettle, and said: \"Girl, there are electric ones. They literally boil the amount amount of water in like two minutes.\" One Brit added: \"You need it boiling hot so the tea bag infuses. Trust me I'm a Brit.\" \"My kettle takes 20 seconds,\" pointed out another. One other commented: \"If you don't have time to make tea in a kettle, then you don't have time to drink tea. Not everything about life is go go go!\" \"Sobbing and throwing up in British,\" wrote another. \"Microwaved water is just wrong,\" said another. One other commented: \"My English heart can't take this, those poor tea bags!\" But a number of people jumped to defend Penny as one said: \"\"I love making tea in the microwave.\" Another, not understanding people's frustration, added: \"Literally it's hot water why the f*** does it matter?\" \"I might try this,\" one other said. Another insisted: \"Microwave is better.\" Do you have a story? Get in touch via Lucy.Marshall@reachplc.com. I'm a beauty lover and swear by these 6 Urban Decay products I've used for years",

        "content": "ENZO MARESCA has gone from forgotten Football League youngster to working under Pep Guardiola and now Chelsea's top managerial target. The Blues have asked Leicester for permission to speak to their Championship-winning boss as they look for Mauricio Pochettino's successor. It could bring Chelsea's search for a new manager to a close with Maresca the latest in the ever-changing Stamford Bridge hotseat. But who is the 44-year-old Italian? Well, Maresca actually started his professional playing career at 18 with West Brom after coming through Cagliari's youth system. That was despite not speaking any English when he first arrived in the West Midlands. In an interview with Manchester City , Maresca recalled: “When you move from, in my case Italy to England directly to Birmingham, you can adapt immediately to the language and to the country. “My English was not so good and also I learned a lot when I was there, though I struggled a bit at the beginning but after it worked quite well.\" Maresca had two seasons with the Baggies before moving to Juventus in 2000 for what was a West Brom record £4.5million deal. He played under two of football’s managerial greats in Turin, in Carlo Ancelotti and Marcello Lippi. Enzo Maresca is considered among the most exciting young coaches on the planet. Born in Italy in 1980, he managed to guide Leicester to the Championship title in his first season as Foxes boss. His management career started at Italian minnows Ascoli before he was snapped up by Man City in 2020 to manage their Elite Development Squad. He guided the youth team to the Premier League 2 title in his one season working for the Citizens - with Cole Palmer in the side. His first senior job was with Parma but he was sacked after just a few months after failing to impress. Despite the team playing in Serie B and Maresca having an impressive squad he was unable to get them on course for promotion. He returned to Man City and worked as one of Pep Guardiola's assistants for the 2022/23 season as they won the Treble. He took over relegated Leicester last summer and made an immediate impact, with the Foxes winning the Championship title. Maresca showed his dedication to the job by living at the training ground for the first two months after his appointment. He's considered something of a Pep disciple and has said: \"For a coach, it’s important to have the mentality of a chess player.\" During his playing career he played under Carlo Ancelotti and Marcello Lippi - and alongside ex-Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Maresca told SunSport in September : “Ancelotti was just starting his career as a manager but you could see clearly how he wanted to coach. “He was so straight, honest and humble — and unbelievable in terms of relations with his players. “Lippi was much stronger but fantastic in terms of motivation.” Maresca bounced around Europe playing for Bologna, Piacenza, Fiorentina, Sevilla, Olympiacos, Málaga, Sampdoria and Palermo. He then ended his playing career in 2017 with Hellas Verona in Italy's second division. Maresca had three years away before returning to football with City's Elite Development Squad, winning the Premier League 2 in 2021. He also coached current Chelsea stars Cole Palmer and Romeo Lavia during his time at the Etihad. The tactician had a short spell in charge of Parma before going back to City in 2022 as Guardiola's assistant. It gave Maresca the chance to learn from the Spanish legend up close and personal, as Mikel Arteta once did before taking the Arsenal job. So before long it was Maresca's turn to take the leap of faith when Leicester - who had just been relegated from the Premier League - came knocking. He said at the time: “Coming to Leicester was an easy decision because our ideas are perfectly aligned. \"They wanted to change the way they play and refresh things. And the most important thing is that they’re patient. “The club knows sometimes it’s not so quick to change things, they’re aware of that. “When the club is aware and patient, the only target is to realise what you want to realise. \"The problem is when people start to get nervous, this can be a big problem.” City recruited assistant managers Carlos Vicens and Juanma Lillo after Guardiola gave his blessing for Maresca to leave. “From the very first moment Pep knew that I really wanted to go on to be a manager,” Maresca told The Telegraph . “He knew that I think he is the best coach in the world and that I went there to help and work with him. \"But he always encouraged me to keep progressing.” Maresca turned the Foxes into a possession-based side who regularly lined up with 4-3-3 or the occasional 4-2-3-1 while being known to play with inverted full-backs. His side went from strength to strength and ultimately pipped Ipswich to the title by just a point. But Maresca's revolutionary football at the King Power came at the cost of top clubs suddenly taking notice. And for Chelsea, Maresca fits their criteria. Experienced former Tottenham and PSG boss Pochettino left the club after just one season and a clear falling out with the board. So for the third time under co-owners Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali, they were seeking a permanent replacement. But the board were not out for a serial winner who would demand a say in the running of the club. Instead, they turned their attention to a young boss with fresh ideas who would do their part to turn things around of the field and leave the rest to the hierarchy. Kieran McKenna - whose Ipswich were just pipped by Maresca's Leicester - was an early favourite. But Chelsea informed McKenna - a former United coach who is linked with replacing Erik ten Hag - that he was no longer being considered. Brentford's Thomas Frank was another appreciated by the Blues board. But none made as bigger impact than Maresca, who is now closing in on a deal to take over at Chelsea. It will cost the West Londoners around £10million in compensation but the board will feel it is money well spent. They have been encouraged by how Guardiola's protege Arteta turned Arsenal into title contenders. And Maresca faces an equally challenging task following Chelsea's underwhelming sixth-placed finish. Pochettino lasted a season, Graham Potter just over half a year and Thomas Tuchel just four months working under Boehly and Eghbali. Now it is just a matter of time until Maresca becomes the latest to try and take Chelsea back to their trophy-laden glory days. He is to be offered a three-year deal - a mark of the Blues' commitment to make the appointment part of a long-term plan. And Chelsea hope to wrap the deal up in just a matter of days.",

Looking forward, the 7MM is forecast to reach US$ 11,282.5 Million by 2034, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 13.57% during 2023-2034.Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-Cell Therapy market is currently driven by factors such as the rising incidence of cancer, a strong drug pipeline, rising number of healthcare settings that administer CAR T, improving safety and efficacy of current and emerging therapies, etc. CAR T-cell therapies have a potential to transform cancer treatment by using the immune system to fight diseases. CAR T therapy requires genetically engineering T cells (either a patient's own or a donor's) to express a chimeric antigen receptor that targets a particular tumor antigen.The biggest factor catalyzing the growth of the market is the strong efficacy of these treatment.

        "content": "TASHKENT - Russia will build a small nuclear power plant in Uzbekistan, the first such project in post-Soviet Central Asia, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said on Monday at a meeting with visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin. The nuclear deal, if implemented, will showcase Russia's ability to export not only energy, but also high-tech products to new Asian markets, at a time when the West is increasing pressure on it through sanctions. Mirziyoyev also said Tashkent was interested in buying more oil and gas from Russia, a reversal of decades-long practice where Moscow imported hydrocarbons from Central Asia. The Uzbek president described Putin's visit as \"historic\". \"It heralds the beginning of a new age in the comprehensive strategic partnership and alliance relations between our countries,\" he said. Putin also called Tashkent Moscow's \"strategic partner and reliable ally\". The leaders gave no details of the planned nuclear project, although Mirziyoyev's comments indicate it has been scaled down from the one they agreed in 2017, but never finalised. There are no nuclear power plants in any of the five ex-Soviet Central Asian republics, although Uzbekistan and its neighbour Kazakhstan, both uranium producers, have long said their growing economies needed them. The Kazakh project, however, can only move ahead after a national referendum which has not yet been scheduled. ENERGY SUPPLIES Taking advantage of Russia's campaign to redirect its gas exports to Asia amid a rift with the West over Ukraine, Uzbekistan last October started importing Russian natural gas via the same pipeline which had previously pumped it in the reverse direction. Although its own gas production remains substantial at about 50 billion cubic metres a year, Uzbekistan struggles to fully meet domestic demand, and Russian supplies have allowed it to avert an energy crisis. \"(Gas) exports are running well ahead of schedule and we are ready to increase their volume if needed,\" Putin said. According to Mirziyoyev, Tashkent is also keen to increase imports of Russian oil. The two leaders also said their governments were working on large projects in mining, metals, and chemicals. Uzbekistan, whose economy depends heavily on remittances from migrant labourers working in Russia, has maintained close ties with Moscow after it invaded Ukraine in 2022. However, Mirziyoyev and other leaders in the region have never spoken in support of what the Kremlin calls its special military operation in Ukraine, and all countries in the region are also working with the West on projects such as cargo shipping routes designed to bypass Russia.

        "content": "The Azerbaijan Embassy said it hopes to join hands with South Korea on climate action while marking its Independence Day in Seoul on Wednesday. The annual event commemorates the establishment of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic on May 28, 1918, which ended nearly two centuries of Iranian and Russian rule and marked the restoration of Azerbaijan's statehood. \"It (Azerbaijan) was the first republic ever in the entire Muslim world. It granted its female citizens the right to vote, ahead of most Western democracies,\" underlined Azerbaijani Ambassador to Korea Ramin Hasanov in his remarks. Despite its collapse due to Soviet occupation in 1920, the Republic achieved significant diplomatic recognition from the Paris Peace Conference, according to Hasanov. Azerbaijan regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The country faced grave domestic and geopolitical challenges such as military conflicts, due to territorial disputes but consolidated thanks to far-reaching reforms and resolute leadership, said Hasanov highlighting Azerbaijan's role as a solid energy supplier and a vital bridge between Asia and Europe. \"Azerbaijan accounts for around 70 percent of the region's total economic power,\" he stated. Hasanov was referring to the Caucasus region, which encompasses parts of Russia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkey and Iran and is often characterized by its mountainous terrain and strategic location between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Citing the declaration of 2024 as a Year of Solidarity for a Green World to foster momentum on climate action by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, Hasanov reiterated his country’s consistent initiatives on global climate action and green growth with Korea. Azerbaijan has been elected by the parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to host COP29, the largest global event ever hosted by the country. The conference will be held at Baku Stadium. “We need to work together constructively to agree on a new collective quantified goal on climate finance,\" said the ambassador, stressing climate financing as a key topic of discussion under Azerbaijan’s presidency. “We hope to actively cooperate with Korea, which has great experience and excellent know-how in the said fields,” said Hasanov, recalling 32 years of positive experience and diplomatic ties. According to the embassy, Azerbaijan is South Korea's largest economic and trade partner in the South Caucasus, with 82 Korean companies operating in trade, industry, construction and services. “Dozens of Azerbaijani young people are studying in Korean universities, with most of them in Korean,” added Hasanov, applauding KOTRA and KOICA for promoting public interest and awareness of Korea in Azerbaijan.",

        "content": "Prajwal Revanna says he will appear before SIT May 31 PTI Updated: May 27th, 2024, 19:12 IST in Home News , National 0 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Bengaluru: Exactly a month after he left the country, Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of sexually abusing several women, has said he will appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT), probing the cases against him, May 31. Terming the cases against him as “false” and part of a “political conspiracy”, he said he had gone into depression. Also Read Kejriwal’s close aide Bibhav Kumar to move HC against rejection of bail: AAP 47 mins ago Cyclone Remal: 24 blocks affected, nearly 15,000 houses damaged in Bengal 4 hours ago “I will personally come before the SIT Friday, May 31 at 10 am and cooperate with the investigation and also respond to it (charges). I have faith in the judiciary and I am confident that I will come out of false cases, through court,” Pajwal said in a video statement that is now widely being circulated. There was no independent confirmation from the JD(S) or the family of the suspended party MP immediately over the matter. “Let the blessings of God, people and my family be on me. I will surely appear before SIT May 31, Friday. After coming, I will try to put an end to all this. Keep faith in me,” he added in his video statement in Kannada. Apologising to his parents, grandfather Deve Gowda, uncle H D Kumaraswamy, people of the state, and party workers, Prajwal said, “I have come before you to share information, as I had not disclosed as to where I’m in foreign (country).” Noting that he had sought a week to respond to the SIT notice through his ‘X’ account and his lawyers, Prajwal said, “Despite seeking time, the very next day Congress senior leaders including Rahul Gandhi started discussing things (about me), at public meetings.” “They indulged in political conspiracy. Looking at all this, I went into depression and isolation. So, I sought your apology first and your forgiveness,” he said. Alleging that a political conspiracy was hatched against him in his constituency of Hassan too by some forces, the MP said, “As I was growing politically, to diminish me, they all got together. Looking at all these things, I was shocked, so I was a bit away. So, no one should mistake (me) for it.” Prajwal (33), the grandson of JD(S) patriarch H D Deve Gowda and the NDA candidate from Hassan Lok Sabha segment, is facing charges of sexually abusing women. He reportedly left for Germany on April 27, a day after Hassan went to polls, and is still at large. A ‘Blue Corner Notice’ seeking information on his whereabouts has already been issued by Interpol, following a request by the SIT via the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A Special Court for Elected Representatives issued an arrest warrant May 18 against Prajwal Revanna, following an application moved by the SIT. The Congress-led Karnataka government has urged the Centre to cancel his diplomatic passport, even as it has stated that there has been no official communication from the union government over the matter yet. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has served a show cause notice to Prajwal asking why his diplomatic passport should not be cancelled as sought by the Karnataka government in view of allegations of sexual abuse against him. The election took place April 26, at that time there was no case against him, and SIT was also not formed, he said. “My trip abroad April 26 was also planned earlier. So, I left (abroad) after three or four days... when I was watching YouTube, a news channel, I learnt (about the development back home). After that SIT also issued a notice.” The scandal triggered a political storm with the ruling Congress and BJP-JD(S) engaging in a slugfest. While the Congress government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the cases, the BJP and JD(S) — NDA partners — have demanded that it be handed over to the CBI, and action be taken against those behind the circulation of explicit videos. The cases of sexual abuse came to light after number of pendrives allegedly containing explicit videos involving Prajwal were reportedly circulated in Hassan, ahead of Lok Sabha polls there April 26. Recently, Deve Gowda had issued a ‘stern warning’ to Prajwal Revanna, asking him to return to the country and face the probe into sexual abuse allegations, while asserting there will be no interference from him or other family members into the enquiry. The JD(S) supremo reiterated that his grandson should be given the harshest punishment under the law “if found guilty”. Kumaraswamy too had repeatedly appealed to his nephew Prajwal to return to the country and face the probe. JD(S) has suspended Prajwal from the party after cases against him came to light.

        "content": "Kiru Singh Sahota MMA fighter used Indian nationality to take part in the 'Road to UFC' Tournament in Shanghai, China. New Delhi: Massive controversy erupted as MMA fighter Kiru Singh Sahota changed his nationality to the United Kingdom after taking part as an Indian fighter in the Road to UFC tournament. It all started when Kiru was denied to hold the Indian flag in the photo shoot before his first fight in the tournament, and then UFC India deleted his post from all the social media handles. UFC India has promoted Kiru earlier but reports claim that he supports Khalistan that why he refused to hold the Indian flag. The first round of the Road to UFC tournament was organised in Shanghai, China and this event is all for Asian MMA fighters only but Kiru used his Indian nationality to participate in this event and now after participating he changed his nationality to a UK-born MMA fighter. Kiru won his first fight against China’s Yin Shuai with a split decision and now faces Ruel Panales in the semifinal whose first bout was cancelled due to the opponent didn’t make the weights. Angad Bisht enters semi-final India’s Angad Bisht also secured his place in the semifinal, after beating John Dave Almanza in the first round by Knockout. In the fight, Almanza came out guns blazing and threw his punches but the power and strength of Bisht were too much for the Philippines’ fighter, Bisht forced Almanza to the canvas, worked his way to a good position, and began unloading a torrent of strikes, ultimately securing the stoppage in the first round itself. Angad is now the heavy favourite to win the tournament. Angad can become the third Indian fighter to fight in the UFC. If all goes well it will be a hell of a match between Angad Bisht vs Kiru Sahota in the finals and fans from India can’t wait to witness the match.",

Royal author and biographer Tom Quinn issued all these insights into the couple’s dynamic with the Duke’s friends. During Mr Quinn’s interview with The Mirror he was quoted saying, “He is aware that Meghan detests many of his old woke-hating, pheasant-shooting friends and those old friendships are still intertwined with a past that Harry is, in many ways, happy to leave behind.” “The truth is that many of Harry's old friends especially from the military and Eton just don't get on with Meghan.” “Hugh van Cutsem's decision to work with Jeremy Clarkson famous for his savage attacks on Meghan is seen by Harry as an unforgiveable betrayal,” Mr Quinn also added. “The only thing that makes it bearable is that Harry knows Meghan dislikes van Cutsem and his one claim to fame: his ability to shoot deer.” All in all, “For Harry the end of his friendship with van Cutsem is just cutting one of the last few ties with his old life; a life he never much enjoyed anyway.”",

Xavi Hernández was kicked out from Barcelona last week after he agreed to stay in the club till June 30, 2025. He said on Sunday that his skills were not valued in Barca, according to DAZN . \"I don't think the work we have done has been sufficiently valued considering the adverse situation we came into,\" Xavi told the outlet after his team crushed Sevilla at Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán. \"Barça were ninth in the table when we arrived at the end of 2021. We finished second. Then, in the first full season [in charge], we won two trophies [LaLiga and the Spanish Supercopa],” the 44-year-old said. \"This year has not been at the level required, but it's come down to details in several key games. It's a shame. I am sad, but this is the job of a coach.\" Reports from ESPN suggested that Xavi is set to be replaced by Hansi Flick, and the official announcement is expected soon. \"They have to know it is a difficult situation because Barcelona is a difficult club, but also because of the adverse financial situation, above all [LaLiga's] financial fair play rules,\" Xavi told the outlet about his successor. \"It won't be easy at all. They will suffer and they will need patience because it's a really difficult job. The only thing that can save them is winning, whether they have been part of the club or not [previously].”",

        "description": "Following meeting with ministers, CM Gandapur says they have found way through which KP people will get relief",
        "content": "Following months-long tussle and exchange of heated arguments over arrears, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Centre have finally agreed to bury the hatchet and work together for public relief. The development came during a meeting between KP’s firebrand Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in Islamabad on Monday. Federal Minister for Energy Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari and the federal interior secretary were also among the attendees of the meeting. It is pertinent to mention here that the KP government and the Centre had been at odds over multiple issues, including the prolonged power cuts in the province with CM Gandapur even threatening to take control of the power distribution company, the Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) after decrying the excessive power outages in the province. In addition to this, the KP government and Centre have been engaged in a verbal spat in recent days with the former complaining of dues that are owed to the province by the federal government. In March, CM Gandapur threatened to take the Centre to court over the arrears issue. Addressing a joint presser, following a “meaningful” dialogue, CM Gandapur said: “The federal and provincial institutions will work together. [We] will work together to remove the causes of line losses.” Referring to the “consensus” developed between the two sides, the provincial chief executive said that they had found a way through which people would get relief. \"Even though KP provides electricity to the entire country,” he said, \"the province itself is experiencing prolonged power cuts.\" The chief minister further said that he engaged in talks to solve the problems being faced by the province. “We will have to come to the table for the rights and issues of the province.” Since KP itself generates electricity, he said, the people of the province wanted to end loadshedding and seek cheap electricity. CM Gandapur also thanked the federal government for realising the grievances of the people of the province. Quoting PTI founder Imran Khan, he said that their \"fight is not against the state's intuitions\". On his part, the energy minister thanked Interior Minister Naqvi for playing a key role in defusing tensions between KP and Centre and bridging the gap between the two sides. Without revealing details, the federal minister said: “We have found a solution to the problems.” A uniform model will be implemented in KP and other provinces, he added. Referring to the decisions made in the meeting, the minister said that PTI, PML-N and allied parties have taken a “big step” to recover the economy and steer the country out of crisis. Despite having a different political narrative, the energy minister said that they agreed on this agenda for the sake of the people and the country. “We have found a solution to the problems. The solution will be applied to other provinces too.” He vowed to address the issues of power theft and line losses across the country. “The PTI and the PML-N have jointly taken this step to improve the country’s economy.” Talking to journalists, the interior minister revealed that the meeting concluded with a “breakthrough”. He, however, did not give details about the breakthrough and said that the session was held in a pleasant atmosphere. Matters related to public relief were discussed in the meeting, he added. Ahead of the crucial huddle, Naqvi welcomed CM Gandapur upon his arrival at the Foreign Ministry. During his interaction with the media, the chief minister said: Our cases are in the courts and we hope that we will get relief from the courts. I am sitting with them [federal ministers] to solve the problems of the people of his province. In political matters, different things should not be mixed.”",

I’m getting emotional talking about it. I was just, I couldn't have been more proud of her.” Tina, who shares Beyoncé and Solange with her ex-husband Matthew Knowles, then went on to reveal her second daughter’s fondest memory. “Solange, was her signing a petition in school, she was only in like fifth grade and she was out getting petitions signed.

        "description": "Skin allergies and heat rashes are most common during the scorching months, says skin specialist",
        "content": "ISLAMABAD: Skin specialists have warned that citizens need to adopt adequate steps to avoid skin ailments during the current weather conditions as harsh ultraviolet rays and the increasing humidity can lead to a lot of sweating, which in turn results in skin ailments like skin burns and infections. Talking to PTV News channel on Monday, a renowned skin specialist Dr Mubashir Mushtaq Daha said that skin allergies and heat rashes are most common during the scorching months when the mercury shoots up, adding, that sunburn can increase the chance of skin cancer. However, citizens should protect their skin from harmful rays all year round, but especially in the extra-sunny days of summer, he added. The specialist further explained that the sun and heat can dry out your skin. Dry skin in the summer can occur due to a variety of factors, such as excessive sun exposure, hot showers, and not drinking enough water. The cases of fungal infection are at their peak this summer. The cases are common in all age groups, mostly in the moving population from one city to another, he added. Aloe vera and rose water can soothe the skin, so people can apply them to the skin to bring relief from itching, he advised. Citizens should wear lightweight and breathable fabrics like cotton or linen which allow human skin to breathe and prevent the build-up of moisture. Wearing tight clothes can cause more sweating which creates an ideal environment for growth, increasing the susceptibility to infection, he warned. Insects become more active during the summer, and their stings or bites can cause allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Bee stings, ant bites, and mosquito bites are common triggers. These reactions can vary from mild redness to severe swelling, Dr Khurram Mushir, another skin specialist added. Seasonal allergies can also affect the skin, especially during the high pollen season. Allergic individuals may experience contact dermatitis. The typical symptom is an itchy rash after contact or indirect exposure to plants or grasses, he mentioned. Additionally, keep in mind that home remedies provide soothing relief for mild reactions, but for severe symptoms, it is best to seek medical attention, the expert added.",

        "content": "RESIDENTS of a posh town have found themselves locked in a war with cyclists and their local council, claiming they are being forced off the roads. Drivers have been banned from a road in an exclusive neighbourhood to provide more space for two-wheelers. Motorists in Poole, Dorset have been left furious after council bosses voted to permanently close a set of gates along the route. The street provides access to Sandbanks, a \" millionaire's playground ' peninsula stretching off the Dorset coast into the sea. Local officials argued that the narrow road was being used as a rat run and that the closure would improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. But car owners are now threatening to take them to court to get it reopened, claiming it has worsened congestion and pollution in surrounding areas. Quite a few people who were spurred into objecting to the closure really found it rather pleasant to be able to hear the birdsong and changed their minds. Campaign group Leave Poole Park Alone has begun a campaign to reopen the gates. Chairman Bob Lister slammed the council for keeping the road closed despite a consultation of locals throwing up several objections, calling the decision \"undemocratic\". He told MailOnline : \"The council said it was the largest questionnaire they have ever had. \"They created it and now they have ignored it. \"They had already made up their minds, the whole thing is a whitewash. \"There is now only one entrance and exit and there is not enough room for two cars to pass so you have queues of traffic either side and cars idling for long periods.\" Poole resident Karen Leahy added: \"I cannot believe the sheer arrogance of the council and the thrall the cycling lobby has.\" However, council bosses were quick to point out that the consultation was not binding. The decision also enjoys support from a rival campaign group, BH Active Travel, who called the decision a \"no-brainer\". Andy Hadley, cabinet member for the environment at Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, told the Mail: \"We did an experimental closure so that people could experience it and what we found was that quite a few people who were spurred into objecting to the closure really found it rather pleasant to be able to hear the birdsong and changed their minds. '\"A consultation is not a vote, it never was a vote, it was part of the decision-making process. \"There were a lot of other factors to consider. \"The park is there as a leisure facility but it has gotten busier and busier because people expect to be able to drive through it. \"Strategically, we have to do what we can to preserve our green spaces so that they are a better place to spend time in.\" The Sun has contacted BCP Council for comment.",

        "content": "Davis Riley had a lot on his mind despite cruising to victory at the Charles Schwab Challenge on Sunday for his first solo PGA Tour win. The event will forever be remembered as the week golf lost Grayson Murray. The 30-year-old two-time PGA Tour winner took his own life after withdrawing from the tournament after 16 holes of his second round. Players and fans were left devastated by the news, but the tournament continued in line with Murray's family's wishes. These have been trying times for the Riley family, too. Just days before the event at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas, his 28-year-old sister Caroline suffered a seizure at work. She was quickly diagnosed with a brain tumour and was taken into emergency surgery in New York City.

The surgery was successful and lab tests found the tumour was benign. Speaking with feelings of relief and satisfaction, Riley reflected on a week that put a lot of things into perspective. \"Unfortunately, [my parents] weren't able to be here,\" he said at his winner's press conference. \"My sister, it was kind of a crazy turn of events. She was at work one day and had a seizure and I got a call. I was out practising. When someone close to you is suffering, you kind of hit the panic button. \"It escalated to her getting CT scans and a lot of blood work and they found a brain tumour. Less than 24 hours on from the seizure, she got pulled in for surgery and when you have somebody that close to you, all the worst-case scenarios are going through your head. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US . Riley claimed his first solo title on the PGA Tour after winning the Zurich Classic of New Orleans with Nick Hardy last year ( Image: George Walker/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) \"It was certainly a scary feeling thinking about how you could lose your sister. Thankfully, my parents were up there and she was around some amazing doctors and they took really good care of her. We had some great news earlier this week. She had a successful surgery and they removed the brain tumour. They sent it off for a pathology report and it came back non-cancerous, which is amazing and a big sigh of relief. \"With that news last week, I didn't even know if I was going to be able to play this week. Honestly, I was a little beside myself for most of the week, but my parents told me that my sister would want me to go out there and compete and do what I love and that meant the world to me. I'm very fortunate and excited that she was in really good hands and everything is moving in the right direction.\" While it proved to be a special week for the Riley family after his breakthrough win and his sister's clean bill of health, he was quick to send his condolences and support to Murray's loved ones. The golf world is in mourning after Grayson Murray's suicide ( Image: Tim Heitman/Getty Images) \"It's a super sad day in the golf world but my heart just goes to [Murray] and his family,\" he said. \"There was definitely a little extra to play for today. Sad day and I have a heavy heart for his family and I hope for the best.\" Riley had made a poor start to the season on tour, missing seven cuts with a best finish of tied 14th at the Texas Children's Houston Open. He admits his struggles on the course had taken their toll, and he thanked his support next work for pushing him through. \"The last six months, I've just struggled with the golf part,\" he said. \"My wife's great, I've got an amazing wife and an amazing team that pushes me to be the best that I can and I'm very fortunate for them.

        "content": "ONE of the Motherland fan favourites have ruled out returning for the spin-off. The hit BBC comedy was previously given the axe by the corporation after four series . Anna Maxwell-Martin , 47, played the role of Julia Johnstone in Motherland , which first appeared on the box in 2016. Viewers loved to watch her grasp the concept of parenthood as she was forced into a more active role in her children's lives. However, the series came to an end after the second Christmas special in December 2022. Instead, the publicly funded corporation announced for a new spin-off series which will focus on the character of Amanda (played by Lucy Punch). The series in the works is called 'Amandaland,' and it will see the character undergo a huge change in lifestyle after her divorce from Johnny. Although fans but expect to see Anna reprise her role in the new show, unfortunately she has poured cold water on any speculation. She confirmed that she has no intentions to make a cameo on the new show when she spoke to Alex Jones and Roman Kemp on The One show last night. The actress explained: \"No, I don’t think Julia or Kevin or Liz are popping in. \"But I'll be really happy to see those two, because I really love them and I think they are so brilliant as well.\" She had nothing but praise for her former co-stars - which also includes Philippa Dunne - who will be the main figures of the new show Sher added: \"Phil and Luce are brilliant comediennes and brilliant actresses, so yeah it's good.\" Former Absolutely Fabulous star Joanna Lumley , 78, will also return to the series as Amanda's mother Felicity. The show will see Lucy Punch's character relocate to South Harlesden as she raises her teenagers. She will grapple with problems of modern motherhood including \"teenage drinking, fake Instagram accounts and eco anxiety\".",

(Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND / AFP) From Australia, China and the United States, Rafael Nadal fans descended on a chilly and damp Roland Garros on Monday, hoping to inspire their “super hero” to victory at the French Open. Nadal, the record 14-time champion, was taking on Alexander Zverev in a tough first round encounter for a player whose career twilight has been stalled by injury. His army of fans hope that whatever happens on the Philippe Chatrier Court, which the Spanish star has dominated for the best part of 20 years, he will remain true to his word and not retire despite his 38th birthday fast approaching. Chills ❤️ #RolandGarros @RafaelNadal pic.twitter.com/K44H0v2wrD — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 “You always have to keep the faith in Rafa, he will win,” Hazel, a 28-year-old fan who had flown in from China for a second straight year after being left disappointed when Nadal withdrew in 2023, told AFP. “The most important thing is that he stays healthy,” she says, as she proudly showed the banners she had made with the colors of Spain, Nadal’s face and the message “Welcome back my super hero”. Nadal has only lost three times in 115 matches at the tournament since his title-winning debut as a 19-year-old in 2005. He said at the weekend that there was a chance this may be his last French Open but insisted he was still keeping the door “100% open” on continuing his career. “You see a lot of ‘Thank you Rafa’ shirts. He’s a monument at this tournament,” said 41-year-old Manolo who has come to Europe from the United States to watch Nadal and then Real Madrid play in the Champions League final in London this Saturday. He has seen Nadal win at Wimbledon and the US Open as well as Paris but admits Monday’s clash with world number four Zverev “will be very difficult”. “I hope he beats Zverev... Rafa is Rafa,” he said. “It’s possibly the last time he plays here, so we’re very happy to watch him,” said Alsi, a 40-year-old fan living in Australia.

        "description": "The industry produces popular Ceylon Tea and employs about 615,000 workers.",
        "content": "COLOMBO - Sri Lanka’s tea producers on May 27 condemned a government order to increase wages by 70 per cent, saying it would make their tea globally uncompetitive and reduce dollar earnings essential for the island nation to emerge from a financial crisis. The US$1.3 billion (S$1.7 billion) industry produces popular Ceylon tea and employs about 615,000 workers. The island annually exports about 95 per cent of the 250 million kilos of tea it produces. The government has ordered worker salaries be increased to 1,700 rupees (S$7.63) per day from 1,000 rupees, which the industry says will increase tea production costs by 45 per cent. The fallout from Sri Lanka’s protracted financial crisis, caused by a severe shortfall of foreign exchange in 2022, has also hit the tea industry, quadrupling fertiliser, fuel and power costs, said the Planters’ Association of Ceylon (PAoC). “This is unsustainable and unfair. This decision was made without proper consultation and will result in the quality of Sri Lanka’s tea declining,” PAoC spokesman Roshan Rajadurai told reporters. “Sri Lanka’s key rivals, India and Kenya, have lower prices and higher productivity.” The industry must start paying the salary increase from June, Sri Lanka’s Labour Ministry said on May 26, warning that plantation companies refusing to comply could be taken over by the government. Implementing the wage hike will cost plantation companies an additional 35 billion rupees, the association said. Plantation companies and worker unions have been negotiating for months to increase salaries, which unions contend is essential as Sri Lanka’s financial crisis plunged around a quarter of the population into poverty in 2023.

        "content": "Dublin, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Financial Advisory Global Market Report 2024\" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The financial advisory market size has grown steadily in recent years, growing from $206.76 billion in 2023 to $215.92 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.4%. The financial advisory market is forecast to grow to $261.95 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%. The anticipated growth in the forecast period can be attributed to factors such as the evolving regulatory landscape, the increasing emphasis on sustainable and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) investing, the demand for retirement planning services, a focus on personalization and customization in financial services, and collaborative efforts with fintech companies. Major trends expected in the forecast period include ongoing digital transformation, technological advancements in the financial industry, a growing emphasis on ESG investments, the rise of robo-advisors, and an increased focus on personalized financial planning services. The surge in high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) is anticipated to propel the expansion of the financial advisory market in the foreseeable future. Individuals with liquid assets of at least USD 1 million fall under the category of high-net-worth individuals (HNWI). Those with substantial HNWI often seek the assistance of financial advisors to effectively manage their wealth, unlocking additional advantages and opportunities. For instance, in December 2022, as per the World Wealth Report 2022 presented by Capgemini, a France-based information technology company, the global count of HNWIs witnessed a 7.8% increase, reaching $22,459 billion in 2021 from $20,838 billion in 2020. Moreover, in 2021, North America maintained its dominant position with a 13.2% growth in HNWI population and a 13.8% increase in wealth. Consequently, the upsurge in high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) stands as a driving force behind the growth of the financial advisory market. The anticipated surge in demand for alternative investments is poised to drive the expansion of the financial advisory market in the coming years. Alternative investments encompass non-traditional opportunities that extend beyond conventional asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash. In the realm of alternative investments, financial advisors play a pivotal role, serving as invaluable guides through the intricate and often opaque landscape of assets such as hedge funds, private equity, real estate, and commodities. For instance, in September 2023, Forbes, a US-based global media company, reported that as of 2022, financial advisors allocate 14.5% of clients' portfolios to alternative investments, marking an increase from 10.5% in 2021. Projections suggest that allocations to alternative investments are expected to rise further, reaching 17.5% by the year 2024. Consequently, the growing demand for alternative investments stands as a driving force behind the growth of the financial advisory market. The financial advisory market is witnessing a significant trend towards technological innovations. Major companies in this sector are actively embracing new technologies to maintain and strengthen their positions. As an illustration, in March 2022, SRG Financial Advisors, a US-based holistic financial planning firm, introduced the 'Mile Marker Digital Vault Technology' in collaboration with FutureVault, a Canada-based provider of secure document exchange and digital vault solutions. The SRG team is initiating several next-generation process and technology changes for their clients, with Marker Vault being the first of these innovations. The primary goal of this technology is to enhance clients' asset management and financial planning experiences while optimizing operations, allowing clients to focus on their priorities. FutureVault provides SRG Financial Advisors and its clients with a secure, shared platform that facilitates more efficient management of information and documents, leading to a significant streamlining of interactions between the two parties. In the financial advisory market, major companies are directing their efforts toward developing innovative solutions, and one such trend is the integration of virtual video studios. A virtual video studio refers to a digital or computer-generated environment that replicates the appearance and functionality of a physical video production studio. As an example, in February 2023, Merrill, a US-based investment management company, unveiled 'Merrill Video Pro'. This virtual video studio is tailored for financial advisors, providing them with the tools to create content and engage with clients and prospects on a broader scale. Merrill Video Pro empowers advisors to produce videos using a growing library of customizable content, covering topics such as managing retirement goals, implementing wealth transfer strategies, navigating markets during challenging times, and more. These customized videos can be effortlessly shared via email, LinkedIn, advisor websites, and seamlessly integrated into events and seminars. In April 2022, Goldman Sachs, a prominent US-based investment banking company, completed the acquisition of NN Investment Partners for approximately $1.9 billion. The primary objective behind this strategic move is to enhance Goldman's capabilities in sustainable investment practices and expand its footprint in asset management across Europe. NN Investment Partners, based in the Netherlands, is an asset management company offering a range of financial advisory services.

        "content": "Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress: Where Is the Memphis Belle Aircraft Now? By Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress first chronicled the journey of the historic aircraft in 1944. The 45-minute-long is the work of legendary Hollywood director William Wyler. Per , . The airplane is known for completing over 20 combat flights over Nazi-occupied Europe during World War II. The outlet stated that Memphis Belle was on outdoor display in Memphis, Tennessee, for decades. There, the aircraft’s condition worsened after moving to Ohio in 2005 and went through 55,000-hour-long restoration process. According to , Charles Leighton was the aircraft’s navigator during the bombing raids while Robert Morgan served as pilot. He was also behind the aircraft’s famed name and artwork, stated CNN. In 2018, Erik Nelson’s The Cold Blue paid tribute to William Wyler and the Memphis Belle crew from the 8th Air Force. It restored the footage from Wyler’s documentary to look into the lives of the crew members and the aircraft’s wartime service. Memphis Belle: When was the B-17F Bomber’s final mission? CNN stated that Memphis Belle’s final combat mission was on May 17, 1943. The aircraft completed 25 successful combat flights over Nazi-occupied Europe during the Second World War. According to , each B-17F bomber was expected to complete 25 missions before the aircraft, along with the crew members, could return home safely. According to National Museum of the United States Air Force, Robert Morgan, Memphis Belle’s pilot, named the airplane after his then-girlfriend, Margaret Polk. The bomber returned to the US in June 1943, after which the crew from the 8th Air Force flew it across the country. The crew members and the aircraft gained recognition during the three-month war bond tour. In the following years, William Wyler dropped his color documentary The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress. The film featured actual combat footage from the raids and celebrated the historic aircraft’s legacy. Wyler and his filming crew were also present during Memphis Belle’s tours over Europe. While shooting footage, one of his crew members, a World War I veteran, Lt. Harold Tannenbaum, died during the process. They returned home during mid-1943 and joined the war bond tour. In 2018, Erik Nelson created The Cold Blue in honor of the 1994 Memphis Belle documentary. He stated how William Wyler “went to Europe” and “risked his life” to make the film. Nelson claimed Wyler “lost his hearing” after making the documentary. But he “came back and made The Best Years of Our Lives.” The legendary director bagged a Academy Award for The Best Years of Our Lives. Nelson added that the film is about “the legacy of the war experience for men who flew in B-17s.” He believes Wyler made it “to sort out his ghosts and deal with his PTSD.” Jeff Duford, the curator of National Museum of the US Air Force where the Memphis Belle is on display now, called the aircraft an “icon.” Duford stated, “The B-17F Memphis Belle is an icon that represents the thousands of bomber crews, maintainers, and others supporting the bomber mission, whose service and sacrifice helped win WWII.” William Wyler’s Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress is available to watch on YouTube’s Library of Congress channel. The B-17F bomber was also the subject of a 1990 Hollywood film. Another documentary on the aircraft includes History Rediscovered: The Memphis Belle.

        "description": "CAIRO/OCCUPIED JERUSALEM: An Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt the assault.In scenes grimly familiar from a war in its eighth month, Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after the strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.Israel said initial investigations showed an attack against commanders of the Hamas group set off the fire.Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit.“We were praying...and we were getting our children’s beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,” said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf.ICC prosecutor says Israel not ‘akin’ to Hamas“All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.”The attack took place in the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames.More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns.Despite UN court orders to halt offensive, Israel’s aggression continues in RafahIsrael’s military said Sunday’s strike, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind attacks on Israelis.That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area.Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there.French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged” over Israel’s latest attacks. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,” he said on X.Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said.No safe zoneBy daylight, the camp was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings.Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds.Israel official says ‘intention’ to renew Gaza talks ‘this week’Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas.

Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said.“What have they done to deserve this?

        "content": "COUNTRYFILE viewers have slammed the BBC for broadcasting a 'disgraceful and misleading' episode. Some fans of the nature programme have accused producers of showing bias when covering a controversial topic. On the most recent episode of the long-running nature series, presenter Charlotte Smith , 60, investigated the latest plans to tackle TB in cattle. She conducted a variety of interviews focussing on Bovine Tuberculosis in England and Wales . This is a chronic bacterial disease, for which cattle are the main source of infection for humans. The programme noted how badgers can be infected and transmit the disease to cattle, which in turn could transmit the disease to humans. Countryfile investigated whether the policy of badger culling could help to curb the spread of the infection. The long-running BBC nature show used scientific and governmental sources and statistics to show the different sides of the debate. Although the programme presented arguments both in favour and against the policy of 'badger culling', viewers were not impressed. They took to social media in their droves as they claim the programme was 'misleading' as they accused the BBC of favouring one side of the argument over the other. One viewer claimed: \"#Countryfile Misleading and biased in favour of badger culling once again.\" A second user stated: \"#Countryfile still spring out the same old badgerphobic bile that they have done for the last 10/15 years. Farming, and defra, have learnt NOTHING. Badgers are not the problem. Farming practices are.\" \"I see #Countryfile is editorialising for killing badgers again. F*** biodiversity the minute it inconveniences farmers, eh lads?\", exclaimed a third. As a fourth nature fan fumed: \"@BBCCountryfile glad to see you’re covering TB but you shouldn’t allow the badger trust or Welsh govt to misrepresent TB stats, badger trust suggesting cleanliness is the issue & badgers aren’t is quite ridiculous.\" As someone else claimed: \"Once again @BBCCountryfile are getting their facts wrong in connection with #bTB and badgers. There is no evidence that badger culling has ever worked to curb the disease.\" They added: \"Farmers have consistently and wrongly argued this point. Culling is being done to appease farmers.\" The Sun has approached the BBC for comment. What is Bovine TB? According to the government, Bovine TB is a disease that is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium bovis, (M. bovis). This is closely related to the bacteria that can cause tuberculosis in humans, whereby all mammalian species, including humans, are susceptible to the disease. The disease is mainly of a respiratory nature and transmission usually occurs through nose to nose contact, but also through contact with saliva, urine, faeces and milk. According to the government's website, Bovine TB can survive in the environment for a long time. The length of time varies and conditions affecting the longevity include factors like temperature and moisture. Can it spread to humans? Cattle can become infected when directly exposed to infectious cattle (or other infectious animals) and their excretions. The movement of cattle with undetected infection is the most likely way that disease spreads to new areas. Transmission of bovine TB from infected cattle can happen through the consumption of raw (unpasteurized) milk or raw milk products which contain the bacteria. Transmission can also occur through prolonged exposure to bacteria in the air in the immediate vicinity of live infected cattle or their carcasses. What usually happens to cows with TB? According to the government website, Animals that \"fail any statutory diagnostic test for bovine TB, including the interferon gamma and the IDEXX antibody tests\", will be slaughtered. The 'Tuberculosis Order' mandates for compulsory slaughter of these animals to help stop the spread of infection.",

        "content": "Kavya Maran gave an emotional speech as she addressed the Sunrisers Hyderabad players in their dressing room after her team's defeat against Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL 2024 final on Sunday. New Delhi: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) co-owner Kavya Maran gave an emotional speech in the dressing room after her team’s crushing defeat in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 final against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on Sunday, May 26. KKR thrashed SRH by 8 wickets in a one-sided final at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai to lift their third IPL title. It was a humiliating defeat for SRH, who were outclassed across all three departments by KKR. The KKR bowling attack brought down the high-flying Sunrisers batting line-up at Chepauk as they were skittled out for a paltry 113 runs to record the lowest-ever score in an IPL final. KKR rode on impressive knocks from Venkatesh Iyer and Rahmanullah Gurbaz to chase down the target with as many as 57 balls to spare to record a dominant win. Kavya was heartbroken after the final and was spotted breaking down in tears in the stands following her team’s loss. However, the SRH owner wiped her tears and addressed her players in the dressing room to applaud their effort in what was a brilliant season for the Orange Army. Kavya heaped praise on the players and credited them for redefining T20 cricket with their aggressive style of play. “You all have made us so proud. I had to come here and tell you that. I mean you have redefined the way we play T20 cricket and everyone is talking about us. The off-day had to happen today, but a really great job, all of you with the bat and ball. Thank you so much,” Kavya said in a video shared by SRH on their social media handles. “And I think even though we finished last place last year, I think all the fans came out in huge numbers because of the potential you guys had. Everyone’s talking about us and even though KKR won, I am sure everyone’s still going to be talking about the style of cricket we have played. Thank you guys, take care and don’t look like this. We played the final, it wasn’t just any other game. I mean all the other teams have been watching us tonight. Thank you guys, I will see you soon,” she added. “You’ve made us proud.” 🧡 – Kaviya Maran pic.twitter.com/zMZraivXEE — SunRisers Hyderabad (@SunRisers) May 27, 2024 SRH did redefine T20 cricket with some outlandish batting throughout the league stage of IPL 2024. With Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma going all guns blazing at the top, they twice broke the record for the highest-ever total in IPL history. However, their star-studded batting line-up flopped in the playoffs as they missed out on lifting their second trophy despite coming agonisingly close.

        "content": "A BASKETBALL pro plunged 66 feet to his death, possibly falling from a wall, after he was kicked out of a nightclub. Aurimas Cybas, who reportedly got into an argument with some regulars at the club, could've also been pushed in a violent mugging. Prosecutors are investigating his death after a shocked passerby spotted his body on Saturday morning and called it in. Cops are studying CCTV footage and interviewing witnesses to see if it was an accident or a homicide. Cybas, 27, may have lost his balance and fallen over the wall while under the influence of alcohol, police have said. But prosecutors have ordered an autopsy on the athlete's body to help determine whether or not he could've been pushed. Cybas had been partying with friends at a club in Genoa, Italy, on Friday night. After a few drinks, he reportedly got into a disagreement which escalated. The bouncers then escorted him out of the venue. The basketball pro, from Lithuania, was staying with a friend who played for local team Basket Sestri at the time. According to his social media, Cybas was playing for Bjerringbro BK when he died. It was a Danish siteam de made up of Lithuanians, at the time of his passing.

Deputy Governor Adnan Zaylani Mohamad Zahid said the foreign exchange policy flexibilities, as a package, are expected to reduce the concern of foreign exchange mismatch for both the lender and the borrower. “Another shared priority is our respective focus on green finance and sustainability agenda. “We would also like to welcome greater engagement from multilateral development banks such as the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) to participate in providing financing and critical expertise in the area of sustainable development in Malaysia, particularly in green finance and sustainability,” he said during a keynote address at the roundtable discussion between the IsDB and Malaysia’s Islamic Financial Markets Subcommittee (IFMC) today. According to Adnan, identifying common priorities for the IsDB and Malaysia will enable the banks to channel resources and focus efforts more effectively. “It is instrumental in facilitating a deeper understanding of each other’s investment preferences and risk appetites, paving the way for mutually beneficial investment linkages,” he added. — Bernama",

        "content": "A millennial mom-of-three has shared a story online about how her children under 10 reacted when they found out how she was punished as a kid. Lisa Pontius, 36, told her 9-year-old daughter that she had to stand in a corner for a time-out and had soap or chili peppers put on her tongue if she used a bad word or talked back to her parents. Pontius, from Charleston, South Carolina, said that her child was shocked, to say the least, and extremely grateful that these methods aren't used in their home. discussed the clip that has over 481,200 views on with homemaker Pontius. According to a 2023 study of 1,000 millennial parents across the United States, 88 percent say their current parenting style is different from how they were raised. \"It takes practice!\" Pontius said. \"It took time to rewrite my brain, and I still have more work to do. But perfection isn't the goal. Being human is OK, and no one is too high and mighty to offer an apology when they react out of anger, especially to their kids. \"Over time, I have managed to increase my patience and my reactions to my kids, and they are now coming from a much more logical place than a reactive place—that doesn't mean it's not still driving me nuts on the inside.\" During the video, Lisa said that her daughter asked why her parents would do such things, and she pointed out that they wanted her to \"hurt.\" \"They wanted to cause me suffering as a punishment,\" she said. In the previously mentioned study conducted by Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, 74 percent of millennial parents embrace gentle parenting. This approach involves guiding children through decision-making without resorting to threats or punishment. emphasizes a collaborative relationship between parents and children, prioritizing communication, empathy, respect, and clear boundaries. Pontius told how she disciplines her children without creating fear or pain. \"I set boundaries and follow through with consequences that make sense, not arbitrary punishments,\" she said. \"I always have with my kids about why we have the rules we do, and they are allowed to ask questions or debate a punishment reason; if they make a good argument, I will hear them out. \"I try to guide my kids, who are 9, 8, and 2, to make good decisions and show them why bad decisions will hurt them in the long run. When the consequences are more natural, I feel kids will learn the necessary lesson rather than just be afraid of me as a harbinger of punishment.\" Pontius said that she researched respectful parenting and learned that it requires patience, reasoning and emotional regulation, and apologizing. So far, the clip has over 59,000 likes and more than 2,000 comments—many from parents sharing their childhood experiences. \"The sound of my own belt coming off at the end of the day still scares me sometimes,\" said one TikTok user. Another person wrote: \"And 'talking back' was us defending ourselves or asking more questions.\" \"My dad looked at me one day and told me 'I see you and than we did for you, and I'm sorry.' It was validating,\" said one commenter. A fourth person wrote, \"My kid dropped a plate of food upstairs, on the carpet. No big deal - no need to get upset - let's fix the problem together... vs me would have been grounded for a week and yelled at for a while.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "Robert Way/iStock Editorial via Getty Images Introduction Amer Sports ( NYSE: AS ) is a growing company with a portfolio of diverse brands in the sports and outdoor market that have a strong following with its customers. The company has historically delivered strong growth in revenues and EBITDA, growing 21.3% and 19.6%, respectively. However, I have concerns about the company's outlook going forward, particularly with respect to the company's large interest expense that eats away at cash flow. While the Arc'teryx brand has been going strong, the brand has largely carried results historically, which leaves me concerned about what happens when growth slows down. And with inventory buildup on the balance sheet and weaker performance in the wholesale channel and the Ball & Racquet segment, I see more reasons to be cautious than optimistic. In this article, I'll dissect the latest Q1 2024 results and explain why I'm not buying shares. Background Amer Sports owns a wide range of sports and outdoor brands that includes Arc’teryx, Salomon, Wilson, Atomic, Peak Performance, Armada, and EvoShield which are sold around the world. The company is pretty geographically diversified with about 40% of revenues generated from the Americas, 33% from EMEA, 19% from China, and 8% from Asia Pacific. Amer Sports is also diversified by channel, as its wholesale channel represents 64% of sales, with retail and e-commerce making up 19% and 16%, respectively. It's helpful to breakdown Amer Sports into the three segments it operates under to classify results. These include its Technical Apparel, Outdoor Performance, and Ball & Racquet segments. In the Technical Apparel segment, the main driver of sales comes from the Arc'teryx banner (but also Peak Performance), which sells higher end products that are used for trail, snow, and climbing. Consumer perception is that these are generally higher quality and higher end products. With Arc'teryx specifically, the company competes with the likes of Patagonia and others in the mountaineering and Alpine sports space. The Technical Apparel segment makes up 36% of company sales. In Outdoor Performance, Amer Sports' Salomon, Atomic, and Armada brands are the company's outdoor brands and make up the largest segment. The largest brand in the segment is Salomon, which is a clothing and footwear brand designed around outdoor sport and adventure. The company used to own a company called ENVE in the segment which was sold in May 2024. The Outdoor Performance segment makes up 38% of company sales. Finally, in Ball & Racquet, this includes sports equipment, apparel, and accessories. It consists of the company's Wilson, Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield and ATEC brands, all of which we refer to as the Wilson Sporting Goods portfolio. The Ball & Racquet segment makes up the remaining 26% of company sales. Amer Sports is a growing company in the sports and outdoor brands market. As shown from the chart below, the company has consistently put up strong growth in sales and EBITDA, with margins projected to expand nearly 600bps over the next three years. From 2020-2023, the company has put up a 21.3% CAGR with respect to sales and a 19.6% CAGR in EBITDA. Author, based on data from S&P Capital IQ Recent Results When looking at the recent Q1 2024 results of Amer Sports, at first glance, results appeared to be pretty strong. Revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up about 13% year over year, driven in large part by the company's Technical Apparel segment to $510 million. The adjusted gross margin increased by 1.1% on a year-over-year basis to 54.3% for Q1 2024 and adjusted operating margin came in above guidance at 11%, or down 2%. Within the Technical Apparel segment, Arc'teryx continues to be what I would consider to be its 'crown jewel', given its strong growth, sticky customer base, and brand resonance with consumers. Arc'teryx put up another double-digit growth rate in new store growth while also maintaining its strong omni-channel growth on a year-over-year basis. DTC and wholesale for the Technical Apparel segment were up 46% and 40%, respectively. In the Outdoor Performance segment, revenue clocked in at $400 million, up 6% year over year, driven by strong growth in Salomon soft goods, particularly in Asia. With warm weather and higher inventory levels, the Winter Sports equipment side of the segment offset some of this growth. Channel wise, DTC was up 42% with wholesale down 3%. Finally, the Ball & Racquet Sports segment was where we saw some weakness. Revenue for the segment was down 14% on a year-over-year basis to $273 as almost all categories suffered while the Wilson Sportswear brand helped to mitigate some of the fall. Due to the timing of customer orders, the wholesale channel in particular was weak down 16.6% compared to last year. Investor Presentation Outlook and Valuation Overall, this was a decent quarter for Amer Sports. In my view, Technical Apparel continues to be pretty strong, putting up strong growth, even in the face of tough comps versus last year. The Arc'teryx brand has thus far carried the company's sales and EBITDA growth. That said, the company's wholesale business and Ball & Racquet segment are the weak areas that require attention. As the company's largest channel, wholesale is an important part of the business as Amer Sports sells to various partners in order to move product. In both Outdoor Performance and Ball & Racquet wholesale was down, in large part due to higher inventory levels which slowed purchases from the company's partners. Revenue Segmentation (MD&A) While DTC is still strong (and some of this could be in part to customers moving from wholesale to DTC), I think the weakness in wholesale is a cause for concern if partners aren't able to move product. When we look at inventory as a percentage of working capital, it's increased from 26% in 2021 to 51% today. The average days of inventory outstanding has also increased from 135 days to 176 days, so inventory is sitting on the balance sheet longer. In my view, this is all the more surprising as DTC has grown faster than wholesale. One thing I attribute this to (and has now become a bigger risk) is the Arc'teryx brand slowing down. While Arc’teryx’s footprint is growing, this could impact the exclusivity associated with this name and lead to a decline in brand value. It's hard for any apparel brand to put up 30%+ growth annually so there is a material risk that the multiple on the stock could come down substantially if growth decelerates. We haven't seen that happen in a major way just yet, but it's something to watch for. Going forward, management has revised full year 2024 guidance to reflect mid-teens growth in revenue, a gross margin of 54.0%, operating margin of 10.5-11.0%. If we assume about a 11% increase in cash from operations in 2023 ($199 million) and subtract the company's $160 million of capital expenditures, Amer Sports' free cash flow is barely positive (source: S&P Capital IQ). With minimal free cash flow, even with less debt on the books, it's hard to make the case for buying the stock after heavy dilution. Another factor to consider is the company's debt. Since the IPO, the company's market capitalization has remained unchanged, as growth in enterprise value has come from reducing debt on the balance sheet. Overall, I'm not too concerned about the company's debt as management has de-levered considerably. Long-term debt has reduced from $6.53 billion to $2.02 billion at present (proceeds from IPO were used to pay down $1.4bn debt). Balance Sheet (Company Filings) Amer Sports had debt outstanding of $2.02 billion at the end of the quarter. As this was down materially from the previous quarter of $5.94 billion, the balance sheet is now positioned a bit better. With a market capitalization of $7.52 billion and cash on hand of $337 million, the implied enterprise value is $9.2 billion for a Debt/Enterprise value of 22%, so the company appears to modestly leveraged in its capital structure. The company's notes outstanding are rating BB/B1 by S&P and Moody's with a stable outlook (source: Bloomberg). Amer Sports is not a cheap stock, which is partially why I'll be avoiding the stock for now. On an EV/EBITDA basis, using $417 million of EBITDA in the last twelve months and the $9.2 billion enterprise value calculated earlier, Amer Sports trades at a lofty 22.1x EBITDA multiple. Even if we use consensus estimates for next year's EBITDA of $743 million, the multiple is still expensive at 12.4x. I haven't bothered to calculate a P/E ratio since EPS is negative. Below, I've compared Amer Sports to some of its peers to illustrate its expensive multiple relative to the group. Author, based on data from S&P Capital IQ Conclusion Amer Sports is a well-diversified company of sports and outdoor brands. The company's strong performance in recent years, illustrated by its double-digit growth across sales and EBITDA is impressive, along with its competitive position through recognizable brands and market resonance with consumers. However, when analyzing the latest Q1 2024 results, I see a more mixed picture, especially when looking out a few years. Right now, the company is experiencing strong demand propelled by the Arc'teryx brand, but this is being contrasted by weaker performance in wholesale channels and the Ball & Racquet segment. While management's revised guidance for 2024 still shows a path to continued growth in 2024, I have concerns about inventory levels, potential brand dilution risks, and the company's negligible free cash flow generation. While Amer Sports has made good efforts to de-lever the balance sheet with debt reduction efforts, the valuation from an equity perspective still remains steep. With challenges ahead and challenges today at Amer Sports, I'm leaning towards sitting on the sidelines for now. So while I may love the brands, I'll be staying away from the stock for now. Once debt comes down such that free cash flow is positive, I'd be willing to revisit the story.

        "content": "THE Transportation department is considering the realignment proposal for the Bulacan segment of the Metro Rail Transit 7 (MRT-7). “The Department of Transportation (DoTr) is studying the best possible alignment for San Jose City,” Jeremy S. Regino, undersecretary for railways, said in a Viber message to BusinessWorld . The DoTr has said that the MRT-7 project is experiencing delays due to the right-of-way issues particularly in San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. Last week, Bulacan province said the possible realignment of MRT-7 went through the required consultation process. According to the Bulacan government, it has proposed to divert the Quirino highway route as it is considered a key thoroughfare in the area. The MRT-7 has a total of 14 stations. It will run from Quezon City to San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, and is expected to carry 300,000 passengers daily in its first year, and up to 850,000 passengers a day in its 12 th year. The commuter rail line’s stations are Quezon North Avenue Joint Station, Quezon Memorial Circle, University Avenue, Tandang Sora, Don Antonio, Batasan, Manggahan, Doña Carmen, Regalado, Mindanao Avenue, Quirino, Sacred Heart, Tala, and San Jose del Monte. The project is run by San Miguel Corp., with the company financing the construction and set to operate the 23-kilometer commuter rail system under a 25-year concession agreement with the government. The Transportation department has said it is looking at opening the Quezon North Avenue Joint Station to Lagro by the first quarter of 2025. The full completion of the MRT-7 Bulacan segment is facing some right-of-way issues particularly in its Bulacan segment, the DoTr said, noting that oppositors are saying that the construction will cause heavy traffic flow in the area. The Bulacan leg of the MRT-7 will not be completed by 2025 as only 12 stations of the commuter rail line will be operating by then, the DoTr said, adding that the new target for the line’s full operations is between 2027 and 2028. — Ashley Erika O.

        "content": "With the Boston Celtics cakewalking their way to the NBA Finals, one can’t help but reflect on the seven other playoff teams that couldn’t make the cut in the decimated Eastern Conference. The Pacers and Magic, both brimming with youthful potential, still need reinforcements. The Cavaliers and Knicks, both plagued by injuries, were always more pretenders than contenders. The Heat and Bucks, both victims of aging rosters and injury woes, find themselves in need of something fresh. And then there’s the Philadelphia 76ers. Yet again, they crumbled in the first round, marking the seventh straight season they have reached the playoffs but lost in the first two rounds. But this season felt different, didn’t it? Joel Embiid was outperforming his MVP campaign from a year before, Tyrese Maxey emerged as an All-Star, and Nick Nurse’s system had the team on a blistering 66-win pace when Embiid and Maxey were healthy. But Embiid’s meniscus injury derailed everything, and he and the Sixers never fully recovered. We’re in the middle of the conference finals, and the Sixers are sitting at home again. How can they get over the hump to play this time next year? Or are they destined to restart the Process? For all the talk about how superstars win titles, good health and quality depth are also crucial components of the equation. Even great players like Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic needed the right pieces around them to maximize their potential. Dallas has won every trade in recent years, acquiring Kyrie Irving in an all-time great buy low before last season and adding P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford at the most recent deadline. Boston has assembled a roster of high-caliber players so deep that it can withstand the loss of an All-Star like Kristaps Porzingis. Yes, the Celtics have benefited from the fact that their playoff opponents lost their best players: Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, and Tyrese Haliburton. Their path has been easy, but it speaks volumes that they’ve managed to waltz through three rounds despite the loss of their starting center. Related Contrast that with the Sixers, who plummeted without Embiid this season, playing at a miserable 30-win pace in his combined absences. As good as Maxey was all year, he couldn’t help the Sixers stay afloat by himself. Even more support will be needed in the years to come. (Sorry, Buddy Hield isn’t getting it done.) Embiid, now 30, adds to his list of injuries nearly every year. The Sixers can’t just aim to build a solid roster around Embiid; they must construct a team capable of thriving without him, whether it’s because of an absence or load management. Otherwise, they’ll just keep risking low seeding and grueling paths to the playoffs. To support Tatum and Jaylen Brown, Celtics president of basketball operations Brad Stevens shrewdly targeted undervalued assets like Porzingis and Derrick White. Then he nabbed Jrue Holiday, who surprisingly became available last summer after the Bucks reshuffled. Stevens executed the classic championship strategy, much like Milwaukee once did with Holiday and Denver did with Aaron Gordon: build a robust supporting cast for your stars by turning other teams’ starters into star role players. This is the blueprint for any team aspiring to be a title favorite, but no team with an MVP talent has the flexibility the Sixers will enjoy this summer. The Sixers can create more than $60 million in cap space this offseason; plus, they can deal up to four first-round picks and two pick swaps. With this type of arsenal, Sixers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey is positioned to dramatically reshape the roster around Embiid and Maxey. The question is whether he’ll be able to capitalize on this golden opportunity. Last week on The Bill Simmons Podcast , I shared that sources around the NBA believe the 76ers have a real chance of signing Paul George this summer. Although George just turned 34, he’s still a tremendous scorer, facilitator, and defender. As The Ringer ’s Chris Ryan aptly described him : “The Robin who plays like Batman, he’s capable of MVP-like play, as well as a myriad of complementary contributions.” Spot-on. One night, George plays like an MVP. The next, he’s an elite 3-and-D role player. This type of versatility is exactly what the Sixers need. They’re looking for another star, but they also need players who can fill various roles. PG-13 is both, which is why sources familiar with Philly’s strategy say he is the team’s plan A in free agency. I was floored by some of the responses on X and Instagram to my BS Pod appearance: George is the next Tobias Harris . Sign Kentavious Caldwell-Pope instead . George is washed! There will never be a consensus on anything, but I’m surprised Philly fans aren’t over the moon about George’s possibility. He’s never played with a star like Embiid, and the last time he played with a speedy guard like Maxey, he turned in the best basketball of his career in Oklahoma City. Or maybe it’s more simple: Sixers fans are just traumatized by previous failed acquisitions during the Embiid era. But let’s get real—Harris has never been a top 30 or maybe even top 50 player. George, on the other hand, has been one of the league’s best players for a decade and remains a top 25 guy today. Even if he played a reduced role in Philly’s offense, his knockdown shooting ability is invaluable. George shot 45.4 percent on catch-and-shoot 3s last season, per NBA Advanced Stats. That’s a higher percentage than Harris (36.5) even though George has put up way more attempts per game and faced a higher degree of difficulty; he’s taken a diverse array of shots off movement and garnered more defensive attention than a standstill shooter. From Roy Hibbert to Steven Adams to Ivica Zubac, George has never played with a center possessing the offensive versatility of Embiid. Together, they could form a potent two-man combination, much like Embiid and Maxey did this past season. George has a deep bag coming off actions like handoffs, off-ball screens, and pick-and-rolls. George’s demeanor could be an asset in Philadelphia, too. He’s always been willing to defer, whether it was to Kawhi Leonard or Prime Russell Westbrook. In Philly, Embiid is the man. Maxey is the energizer. George could be that chill presence who offers steady buckets on a nightly basis but can also go off on any night he’s feeling it or has the best matchup. Since he is capable of offering so much as a shot creator himself, he could also support Maxey when Embiid is resting or sidelined. Sure, there’s a possibility that George could go into decline by the end of his next contract. But the Sixers can’t afford to worry about that possible downside. The time to win is now, before Embiid ages further into his 30s and potentially faces the same decline that many players of his height and weight have historically experienced. The Sixers can offer George a deal of up to four years and $212 million this summer. The Clippers can give four years and $221 million, but league sources say they haven’t offered George a dollar more than what they paid Leonard: three years, $152.4 million. The annual salaries of the potential Sixers and Clippers contracts are similar; the big difference is the additional year. If the Clippers insist on keeping Leonard as their highest-paid player while retaining long-term cap flexibility with a shorter-term contract, then he would be in the right to review his options and look for more leverage. So why Philly? So much has been made of location throughout his entire career. When George wanted out of Indiana, he asked to go to the Lakers since he is a native of Palmdale, California. But the Thunder jumped in and acquired him. And then when it was time to leave OKC, he still wanted to return to Los Angeles. But in the five years since the Clippers first acquired him, life has changed. George is now married, and his wife was born and raised in New York. A move east could be more appealing than it was when he was younger. But would he be willing to move across the country for one additional guaranteed year on his contract? I’m reminded of a classic quote from Dave Chappelle on whether he regretted leaving Chappelle’s Show and his large Comedy Central contract: “I don’t have $50 million or whatever it was. But say I have $10 million in the bank. The difference in lifestyle is minuscule. The only difference between having $10 million and $50 million is an astounding $40 million . Of course, I would have liked to have that money.” And George probably would too. It’s possible that the Sixers are being used as leverage by George’s agency, CAA, to secure a longer deal from the Clippers. But if the Sixers do end up putting a huge offer on the table, would Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, one of the richest people on the planet, really balk at George’s asking price as he opens a new arena with no other assets to improve the roster? Would he really let George leave for nothing? I doubt it. George could help L.A. pursue a title, even if he’s more expensive than the front office would prefer. The Clippers could also always re-sign George and trade him down the line, just like they did with Blake Griffin seven months after telling him that he’d be a Clipper for life . Then again, maybe family, money, and location aren’t the only motivators here. After all, even though he didn’t want to land in Oklahoma City, George did end up re-signing there. Perhaps now, it’s about chasing a championship. If that’s the case, then the argument is in Philadelphia’s favor. George would fit seamlessly alongside Embiid and Maxey, without the positional overlap he has with Leonard. Next season, Embiid (30) and Maxey (24) will be much younger than Leonard (33) and James Harden (35). The Sixers have far more assets, including some of L.A.’s own picks, to bolster the roster, too. And in a much weaker conference, George would have to feel better about his title odds. Life is certainly good in Southern California, but George must make a decision that will not only write the next chapter of his life but could also define the story of his entire career. It’s a weak free agent market after George. Unless a surprise is coming, LeBron James is expected to remain with the Lakers. League sources say that OG Anunoby is also expected to remain with the Knicks, although he doesn’t provide the type of scoring punch the Sixers are seeking anyway. Maybe DeMar DeRozan or Miles Bridges would make sense in Philly? Realistically, if George falls through, the Sixers would start looking at trades. Aside from the pipe dream that Kevin Durant or Jimmy Butler would ask to be dealt directly to Philly, sources familiar with the Sixers’ thinking say that Brandon Ingram is the primary fallback plan. Ingram would have to be acquired in a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans since he’s under contract for $36 million with a 15 percent trade kicker through the 2024-25 season. But the Sixers could absorb him without sacrificing any salary, a major benefit to the Pelicans, who could then operate with cap space and receive draft picks from the Sixers. For the same reasons the Pelicans are even considering moving Ingram, he would be an imperfect fit for the Sixers. He brings his own set of durability concerns, defensive shortcomings, and offensive inconsistencies. If there’s any “next Tobias Harris” for Philly, it’s Ingram. But he does provide go-to scoring ability, and maybe Embiid and Maxey, two uniquely talented teammates, could unlock him. Ingram is excellent coming off handoff and screening actions, but the Pelicans don’t have the personnel to feature him at a high frequency in that way like the Sixers could with Embiid. And if Nurse could get him to embrace a shot profile with more 3s and fewer midrange jumpers, then his scoring efficiency could improve. If both George and Ingram fall through, the Sixers would have to get creative or hope for unexpected opportunities. What if the Timberwolves are looking to escape the second apron and move on from Karl-Anthony Towns? If the Hornets draft a point guard, what would that mean for LaMelo Ball? Is there a way to overpay the Spurs for Devin Vassell? Maybe the Nets would move away from Mikal Bridges, who could return home to Philadelphia and the team that originally drafted him. Or how about making the Jazz an offer for Lauri Markkanen that they can’t refuse? These scenarios might sound far-fetched, but they illustrate the level of creativity the Sixers must employ if they whiff on George. They’re also all pretty random. The roster is empty, and anyone can work with Embiid and Maxey. The Sixers just need talent. And if a trade for a key player isn’t available to Philadelphia, then league sources expect the Sixers to target players on one- or two-year contracts, like the Indiana Pacers did with Bruce Brown last summer. Brown (along with other assets) was later dealt ahead of the deadline for Pascal Siakam, who helped guide the Pacers to the Eastern Conference finals. Brown’s deal featured a team option in the second season, a structure that enabled the Pacers to remain flexible, which is precisely what the Sixers would be looking for if they go this route. Then, using that hypothetical player’s salary and draft picks, Philly could be the team that trades for the next All-Star who becomes available. Morey and Nurse are signed through the 2027-28 season, so the Sixers have a lot of time to make this work. But they need to feel urgency because of Embiid’s lack of durability and because of the opportunity that all of this cap space gives them. But after all the hype about retaining cap flexibility and the possibility that they could pursue a star like George, if they stand relatively pat this summer, it would probably cause a riot in Philadelphia. In the end, what truly matters is how Embiid feels about the Sixers’ future. From what I’ve gathered, he has always wanted to be like Kobe Bryant or Tim Duncan, playing his entire career with one team. But as situations evolve, so do perspectives, and the Sixers need to move fast to arm their future Hall of Famer with the strongest supporting cast he’s ever had—especially as they watch the Celtics effortlessly own a battered East. The pressure is on Philly’s front office to make something happen. The time to win is now. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong.

But, both films underperform drastically, sending Hollywood into a frenzy. Furiosa beat Garfield in the first three days by the barest of margins, but the latter could go past the former once the final numbers are reported. Furiosa and Garfield’s opening box office numbers are the lowest in decades The latest Mad Max: Fury Road prequel was expected to bring in between $40-50 million in its first weekend. But, it only brought almost half of that in the first three days (around $25.6 million), and $31-33 million across the four-day Memorial Day weekend. While Garfield lost the match-up in the three-day weekend ($24.7 million), its a $31.9 million run over the Memorial Day weekend. It could end up barely winning against Furiosa, but the numbers are still the lowest for Memorial Day since 1995’s Casper, which opened with $22.5 million. Furiosa’s currently stand at $58.8 million, while The Garfield Movie has made $98.1 million globally, having opened much earlier in several international markets. Will Furiosa and Garfield be successful at the box office? With Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga falling way below its , things look bleak for its worldwide success. Its reported production budget is $168 million, before adding the marketing expenses. If the film continues its box office run at a similar pace, it likely won’t be able to make its money back. Meanwhile, The Garfield Movie, which slightly, could still be a successful venture for Sony due to its reported $60 million production budget. With more families choosing to watch The Garfield Movie, all signs point to its monetary success. Both Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga and The Garfield Movie will continue to play in theaters across June 2024. Vansh is an SEO Contributing Writer for ComingSoon.

        "description": "THE PHILIPPINES needs to do more business with new markets to diversify its economy away from China, whose companies have been willing to invest in areas where other foreign entities have not, raising security concerns, analysts said.",
        "content": "By Kyle Aristophere T. Atienza, Reporter THE PHILIPPINES needs to do more business with new markets to diversify its economy away from China, whose companies have been willing to invest in areas where other foreign entities have not, raising security concerns, analysts said. The Philippines also needs to solidify its industrial base to climb the global value chain in response to Chinese moves to invest in strategic industries here, they added. Brian Poe-Llamanzares, a political scientist and chief of staff to Senator Mary Grace Natividad S. Poe-Llamanzares, said China has made “significant investments” in key Philippine industries like electricity, telecommunications, and water, enabled by the absence of competing foreign investors. “There are only a few investors who are looking at the Philippines, and many of us would question what China’s intention is in investing in these industries,” he said, speaking at a forum organized by WR Numero Research (WRN). The National Grid Corp. of the Philippines, in which the State Grid Corp. of China has a 40% stake, has been flagged in various Senate inquiries as a possible national security threat. China claims the South China Sea almost in its entirety, including areas that are well within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. Its Coast Guard has been performing dangerous maneuvers and deploying water cannon to block Philippine resupply missions to its outposts in disputed waters. Under the previous administration, the Philippines welcomed DITO Telecommunity, in which China Telecom has a 40% stake, as a the third player in the telecommunications market. “In the spirit of a free-market economy and with the lack of competitors, it became necessary to bring in a third telco player that was willing to go through congressional scrutiny and service the unserved and underserved areas,” he said. “It’s not like DITO was our first choice. It was our only option,” he added. “We were yet to see a serious attempt by any American or European player in the telco market.” In 2019, DITO and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) signed a deal allowing the company to build facilities in military camps supposedly to help improve the AFP’s ICT infrastructure. While the Philippines has been touting interest from other countries in helping build the Philippines’ telco and ICT infrastructure, “very few of them actually have put a bet on the table,” he said. “A lot of them talk about building relations economically with the Philippines but we are yet to see the fruits of those economic (pledges),” he added, “and this becomes a problem for us because we’re a free market; anyone can come in.” Mr. Poe noted that under the Duterte administration, China effectively entered the water industry by financing a dam. He was referring to a $283.2-million loan secured by the past administration from China to build a dam to support Metro Manila’s water needs. Chinese contractor China Energy Engineering Corp. Ltd was selected to build the dam on the Kaliwa River, which straddles Rizal and Quezon provinces. “We are facing an impending water crisis. And so we’re pushed against the wall and who comes to save the day? China,” he said. “See if there’s anyone else willing to offer us a loan. No one. And so what happens is, China ends up entering the bid and they get the loan,” he added. “And you can’t fault them for doing it. It’s a free market. They can do it. They can provide it.” Mr. Poe said Manila needs to harness the potential of its amended Public Service Act, which allows full foreign ownership in key domestic industries, by conducting more road shows overseas. “It’s really important that we continue to expose ourselves to the international community because we were closed off for six years,” he said. “Next thing is we must create a competitive business climate.” He noted that red tape continues to be a major concern among investors, limiting the sources of foreign investments. “We need more options,” he said. He said the Philippines also needs to build industry and make its educational system competitive by “removing the stigma of vocational work.” Bernardo M. Villegas, one of the founders of the University of Asia and the Pacific and a framer of the 1987 Constitution, said at the WRN forum that the Philippines can only make critical utilities independent from China if it embarks on road shows in more countries including Spain, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan. “The only way we can make sure that we declare our independence from China with regard to water and electricity is for us in the private sector to have dozens of road shows,” he said. Mr. Villegas said expects the planned establishment of a Luzon economic corridor to help the Philippines bag investments from companies themselves seeking to diversify away from China or do business with friendly nations. The US announced its plan to help establish a Luzon corridor with the help of Japan in April. The proposed corridor seeks to boost connectivity between Manila, Batangas, and two former US military bases such as Subic Bay and Clark, with a focus on “high-impact” infrastructure such as rails and ports and strategic investments involving semiconductors, clean energy, and supply chains. China is the Philippines’ largest source of imports and the second-biggest market for exports. The US, on the other hand, is the largest destination of Philippine products and the fifth-largest source of imports. Mr. Poe said a potential escalation of tensions between the Philippines and China would have little to no impact on the Chinese economy because “what we’re providing them is not critical to China.” “If they decided to stop trading and buying our fresh fruits and products, then it’s not going to hurt their economy too much.” “But if we were to develop something more critical — like Taiwan did — an industry that’s indispensable not just to China but also the international community, then suddenly we’re on negotiating terms.”",

        "content": "Best News Website or Mobile Service WAN-IFRA Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 Best News Website or Mobile Service Digital Media Awards Worldwide 2022 PARIS : Top seed Iga Swiatek cruised past qualifier Leolia Jeanjean 6-1 6-2 on Monday to successfully launch her title defence at the French Open where she seeks a fourth title on the Paris clay. The 22-year-old world number one, who has won the French Open three times in the last four years, arrived in Paris on the back of a 12-match winning streak on clay, having rolled through the tournaments in Madrid and Rome. \"Matches like that give me a lot of satisfaction,\" said Swiatek, who next faces former world number one Naomi Osaka in the second round. \"Overall, I am happy with my performance.\" Swiatek, who has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023, did not need much time to show she was determined to stretch that winning run, breaking her opponent in the first game. A superb forehand down the line put Swiatek 4-1 up before running away with the first set in half an hour. The Frenchwoman, ranked outside the top 100, tried to draw a line under the first set, breaking the Pole at the start of the second outing but was broken straight back. Swiatek, who has now won 29 of her first 31 matches at the French Open, held serve before earning another break to go 5-2 up, having hit 24 winners at that stage compared to her opponents' two. She ended the contest on her first match point and with winner number 26. The Pole's dominance in recent years, especially on clay, has seen Swiatek compared with 14-time men's French Open champion Rafael Nadal, who was due to play his first-round match later on Monday. \"I think it's too early. For sure I' m proud of my achievements,\" said Swiatek. \"It’s always been my favourite surface. It is where tennis gives me the most pleasure.\" \"Comparing me to him, I don't think I am on that level yet. I still have many things to prove. I'm just at the beginning.\"",

        "description": "Very few stocks can be expected to build a million-dollar nest egg over several decades -- but Alphabet just might fit the bill.",
        "content": "Online services giant Alphabet ( GOOG 0.72% ) ( GOOGL 0.83% ) has made plenty of millionaires over the years. You'd have more than a million dollars in the Google parent's stock today if you invested just $15,000 when it entered the public stock market in 2004. If you put the same cash to work in a broad market tracker like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust ( SPY 0.66% ) instead, you'd have a total return of just $105,000: GOOGL Total Return Level data by YCharts The secret sauce in million-dollar portfolios: Time and patience But you can build a million-dollar portfolio without market-crushing stars. Take the index tracker's compound average returns of 10.3% over that 20-year period, commit to making a modest investment every month, and let it run for a few more years. For example, imagine setting up an automatic investment of $100 per month at the age of 20. There's no seed money to start that portfolio, no contribution increases over time, and you're sticking with that S&P 500 ( ^GSPC 0.70% ) index tracker, automatically reinvesting its dividends in more shares of the exchange-traded fund (ETF) along the way. $100 a month isn't nothing, but the commitment is arguably small enough to work for most people with a day job. 44 years later, at the reasonable retirement age of 64, you will have invested a grand total of $52,800 in a simple index ETF. And thanks to the magic of compound returns, you'd have about $1.07 million in your retirement account. The bigger they are, the harder they fall Many diversified mutual funds or ETFs can handle a long-term investment like the example above. Set it, forget it, and laugh all the way to the bank after a few decades. But very few single stocks can carry that load. Oceans rise, empires fall, and even the most robust giants aren't immune to unexpected downturns, shifting consumer tastes, and technological progress. Let's check out a couple of examples. At the turn of the millennium, General Electric ( GE 1.25% ) boasted the second-largest market cap of all at $508 billion. By now, the industrial empire has split into three separate companies whose market caps add up to about half of the January 2000 footprint. Enron or Lehman Brothers are more dramatic examples of crumbling empires, and the list is long. Among the 1,925 stocks in the Russell 2000 index, only 640 have a stock market history of at least 25 years. Once, I bought a couch with a lifetime warranty from what had once been the largest department store of all. Six months and a bad holiday season later, Montgomery Ward filed for bankruptcy and liquidated the whole business. the company couldn't handle the one-two punch of big-box retailers and the early years of online shopping. So much for lifetime warranties. Why Alphabet is built to last In light of these examples, it's clear that very few companies can be expected to thrive over several decades. However, there are exceptions to the rule -- and I believe Alphabet is one of those rare survivors. Built to thrive in a variety of economic environments thanks to the ultra-flexible Alphabet umbrella organization, Alphabet has the ability to expand and explore in many different industries. If the online search and advertising revenues dry up, Alphabet would rely on the Android smartphone, YouTube video platform, and Google Cloud decentralized computing service in the short term. Meanwhile, promising side gigs like the Waymo self-driving taxi service, Calico medical research group, or Verily health data unit could pick up the long-term baton. Or maybe Google Cloud will just run with it instead, powered by its artificial intelligence expertise. Alphabet's portfolio of potential business stars will change over time, and I probably haven't even seen their best ideas yet. And that's exactly why I think the company is ready to run for decades to come. I don't recommend putting your entire nest egg in one basket, unless that basket holds a diversified fund -- but if you absolutely have to do it, Alphabet's stock is at the top of my candidates list. A flexible business model and proven success in building strong technology solutions position Alphabet to match or even exceed the S&P 500's long-term returns. And if the stock can indeed outperform the average S&P 500 returns in the long run, you'll reach your million-dollar retirement goal even faster. And a small boost to the return rate would make a big difference in 44 years -- beating the Street's average returns by a single percentage point gives you a $1.5 million portfolio in the end:",

Pete Wilkins' westerners must go to the RDS on Friday night and conjure up a bonus point victory over Leinster - then hope that results go their way elsewhere over the weekend as they strive to lift themselves into the play-offs from 10th position. However Connacht will make the trip east without talismanic winger Mack Hansen, whose return remains on hold from the dislocated shoulder he suffered against Munster on New Year's Day.

It's a week-to-week prospect but he's not back to the stage where he can be doing his full return to contact work yet, to test out the shoulder. \"There’s no panic but it’s frustrating for him and it’s frustrating for us because we’d prefer to have him available. \"The honest answer is I don't really have a hard timeline for him and it's been very much open-ended for the last six weeks, which has been frustrating but it's just where he finds himself at with the injury. \"So there's nothing to suggest that he wouldn't make it back for the play-offs or the (Ireland) summer tour, but the experience of the last month or so means that we won't take anything for granted and we'll just wait and see.\" Connacht are also likely to be without talented young scrum-half Matthew Devine. \"I don’t expect any change there, he's still struggling with the ribs so we won’t have him,\" said Wilkins. \"Since the Stormers game, Shane Jennings is fit and available again. Denis Buckley comes back into the selection frame, too. \"The mentality is positive and it is last chance saloon. It’s very much a Cup final feel for us. It’s not because of the excitement of achieving a final, it’s because this is it really – do or die. \"We put ourselves in this position and we haven’t got anyone else to blame. \"We've done it before and we’re doing it again so it's all guns blazing, and we need to (hope) a couple of other things go our way in the other fixtures.\" Get the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts .",

        "content": "Dwyane Wade didn’t allow the Chicago Sky’s tough 82-86 loss against the Connecticut Sun to spoil his weekend. Instead, the NBA legend shared a series of photos from the game on his Instagram, showcasing some warm moments spent with his family. The Sky’s second loss of the season didn’t seem to bother Wade as he was in awe of the beauty of his wife Gabrielle Union on the sidelines. The Wade family spent their Saturday night attending the Chicago Sky-Connecticut Sun contest at the Wintrust Arena. While his team suffered a tough home loss, D-Wade drew everyone’s attention to his “beautiful” wife. The three-time NBA Champion posted multiple photos on Instagram of Gabrielle and the entire family enjoying the game from the sidelines. He wrote in the caption, “Let me interrupt this program to say DAMN my wife is Beautiful!” Gabrielle was really looking gorgeous in her black crop top and baggy jeans. On the other hand, Wade looked fly as well in his black jacket and cool shades. Wade always wants to inspire his daughters by showing them what women athletes are capable of doing on the court, which is a huge reason why Kaavia was also present at the contest. However, this won’t be the only game of the Sky that The Flash will be attending. Considering that the Miami Heat legend is part of the franchise’s ownership group, he will be cheering on Angel Reese and Co. from the sidelines on numerous more occasions. Dwayne Wade wants his daughters to be inspired by Angel Reese Dwyane Wade was ecstatic when the Chicago Sky was able to select Angel Reese during the 2024 WNBA Draft. While Reese brings a large number of eyeballs to the franchise, increasing the Sky’s popularity, Wade is more excited for his daughters to get a first-hand POV of Reese as a role model. Since becoming a household name during her college days, Reese has become an inspiration for several young girls across the country and even internationally. Following yesterday night’s game, Wade ensured that his daughter got to meet her idol. Obliging the NBA Hall-Of-Famer’s request, Reese shared a wholesome moment with Wade’s daughter, hugging Kaavia after the game. Wade managed to catch this beautiful moment on camera and put it on his Instagram Story. Wade wrote, “Seeing is believing! Thank you @angelreese5 for being a model for all of our daughters!” Reese has had a huge impact on women’s basketball. Now, the Chicago Sky will hope that the 22-year-old is able to influence the team’s performance into a winning record. Currently, the team is 9 th in the league with a 2-2 record.",

        "content": "Tshegofatso Mabasa, whose non-selection into the Bafana Bafana squad for the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Nigeria and Zimbabwe cause a bit of a stir, has been confirmed as the recipient of the Player of the Month award for his exploits towards the end of the season. “In the Buccaneers' five matches in May, Mabasa led the domestic league with his five goals including one in the final day, which secured a place in the CAF Champions League for his club, narrowly ahead of Stellenbosch FC on goal difference. “His goals in May also saw the formidable Mabasa win the league's top goal scorer award, which was also secured on the last day of the season ahead of his nearest rival. He is the second Pirates player to win a monthly individual award this season, after Thabiso Lebitso,” said the PSL in a statement on Monday afternoon. The Coach of the Season honour has gone to Rulani Mokwena, who has just led Mamelodi Sundowns to a seventh league title in a row. “During the last month of league football this May, Mokwena oversaw four wins, two draws and a defeat from their seven matches, a period in which Sundowns were unstoppable until the slip up to suffer their first defeat of the season to Cape Town City on the last day of the season. During this period, Sundowns scored 10 goals, and only conceded three. “With his May success, Mokwena has won the award for the third time this season, having previously won it in August and April. Mokwena beat Cape Town City's coach Eric Tinkler to the award, with the Citizens also having had a good month and getting the big scalp away to Sundowns,” said the League. Meanwhile, Moroka Swallows midfielder Lindokuhle Mtshali has won the DStv Premiership Goal of the Month award for his strike against Stellenbosch FC. All the three winners will each receive R7000 from league sponsors DStv, for their latest achievements.",

        "description": "Gino and Jasmine's big fight in the latest episode follows even more troubling rumors 90 Day Fiancé fans uncovered in recent days.",
        "content": "Warning! The following contains spoilers for the 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? Episode \"Weeping Beauty.\" Watch the episode with a Max subscription and read at your own risk! Is a 90 Day Fiancé truly underway if Jasmine Pineda and Gino Palazzolo haven't had their first knockdown drag-out fight of the season? Their constant fighting makes them great subjects to pump up the drama in the Happily Ever After? Season 8 cast , but one has to wonder when either will reach a breaking point. The answer may be sooner rather than later as troubling rumors surfaced in the days leading to viewers watching Jasmine walk home barefoot. Jasmine kicked off her shoes and began walking home on the hot pavement after Gino balked at the idea of paying an entry fee for her to take part in a beauty pageant. She was furious her husband was worrying about money when the pageant was one of the only things bringing Jasmine joy since moving from Panama to Michigan. It's fair to say she was also frustrated she had no control over his money. While this spat didn't seem any more dramatic than the wild major fight they had years before , recent rumors suggest there's reason to believe Jasmine and Gino are no longer together. Rumors have sprung up in recent days via @ 90DayFiance update which alleges Jasmine is seeing a man she met at a Planet Fitness in Michigan. The post goes to show alleged evidence of her and this man, reportedly named Matt , having meals in the same place, and there's even a picture of her in lingerie in what is believed to be his couch. Surely, this isn't something Gino would approve of, though he may not be able to publicly address anything due to NDAs he might've signed in his involvement with the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. As mentioned, Gino likely can't talk about anything currently happening with his relationship with Jasmine, as doing so could impact viewer interest in his current storyline in Season 8 of 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? . His most recent post following rumors about Jasmine living with another man in Michigan is very interesting, however, and kind of gives a hint of what he's feeling right now: Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News A post shared by Gino Palazzolo (@gpalazz2) A photo posted by on Those who check out Jasmine's Instagram will notice it takes a long time to scroll to find a post with Gino in it. The most recent one I saw dated back to 2023. While I'll admit I had publicly wished the franchise would move on without them , I can't say this is the way I would've wanted to see it happen. I'm also not shocked they might no longer be together, provided these rumors of Gino and Jasmine being the latest married 90 Day couple to split are accurate. It seemed as though his insistence on trying to have a baby with Jasmine but also dropping the ball on getting the process started on bringing her children over from Panama may have been a powder keg waiting to explode, and could ultimately be what drove them to split. If the rumor is true that Jasmine is dating another man in Michigan, I'm a tad surprised she didn't return to Panama. Season 10 of 90 Day Fiancé showed us a different side of her as a mother , and it's clear she missed her children after going to Michigan. That alone has me a little skeptical about whether or not this rumor is valid, but I will admit there's enough to make me want to keep an eye on both of their pages for more updates. Jasmine and Gino's story continues on 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? , which is on TLC on Sundays at 8:00 p.m. ET. I do hope next week picks up on just how far Jasmine walked without her shoes on because I'm not confident I'd make it all that far myself without accepting a ride home the rest of the way.",

Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. In Brief Telegram Stars, an internal cryptocurrency, will be launched on June 12th, aiming to improve user experience by overcoming limitations from the App Store and Google Play. This development represents a major step toward a more cohesive and exciting user experience inside the Telegram ecosystem. This decision was motivated by a desire to overcome the limitations placed by the App Store and Google Play, which had previously stopped users from connecting directly with Telegram and breaking the rules of both stores. Telegram hopes to address this long-standing problem through the implementation of an internal purchasing system. This will allow a smooth and legal experience for Telegram’s large user base. is launching a new token for Telegram internal payments ☑️ A few large channels report that Telegram will launch an internal currency, Telegram Stars, for paying for digital goods in bots. ☑️ This decision was made due to multiple complaints from , which prohibits... For use in transactions involving digital products and services inside Telegram bots and mini-programs, Telegram Stars will function as a digital currency. Through Apple and Google’s individual payment systems, users will be able to easily acquire Stars. The fact that Telegram Stars is integrated with Toncoin (TON), the native cryptocurrency of The Open Network (TON) blockchain, is one of its main benefits. A blockchain network called was developed by Telegram in 2018 and has the ability to rival Ethereum. For stakes, governance, and transactions, the token $TON is utilized. On the Toncoin blockchain and all other blockchains, it is the sole token that is accepted for the majority of transactions. To conduct transactions, handle data storage, and gain access to a proxy, users must pay $TON. Any owner of $TON, Toncoin’s governance token, is able to cast a vote on ideas for the network’s future. for four years following the first vote, which was held in February 2023. The network employs a proof-of-stake validation process like Ethereum and other large networks, which allows investors to stake their $TON tokens to validate transactions. Staking may be done directly on the network or via cryptocurrency exchanges, with the benefit of earning more tokens for investors. The introduction of Telegram Stars has already caused tremors in the cryptocurrency space, with Toncoin’s trajectory being the most affected. The market’s response to Telegram’s entry into the world of virtual currencies was reflected in Toncoin’s substantial price increase as word of this event spread. Toncoin’s performance is being keenly watched by both fans and investors, as they are aware of the possible ramifications of Telegram’s move to integrate cryptocurrencies into its network. By integrating Toncoin with Telegram’s enormous user base, there’s a chance that the cryptocurrency will be widely adopted and continue to expand. Not unexpectedly, developers in the Telegram ecosystem have responded to the news of Telegram Stars While many people are enthusiastic about the possibility of this new money, some people are worried that it would violate App Store standards. Specifically, the App Store has alerted developers to warnings alleging that certain criteria 4.7 and 3.1.1—which deal with receiving money and services from customers without using Apple’s internal purchase mechanism—have been violated. Telegram has reassured customers in spite of these worries by stating that they would be able to buy Stars through Google Play and the App Store, albeit at the possibility of a 30% service charge. In contrast, developers will be able to easily take their profits in the form of tokens (TON), which offers a more affordable option than traditional payment methods. According to an official message from Telegram to developers, which , Telegram will publish the full updated API documentation within the next few days. Developers are advised to prepare their bots and mini-apps for the upcoming changes. To accept payments for digital goods and services, they will need to use the sendInvoice or createInvoiceLink methods with the currency field set to “XTR” and the provider_token field left empty. Like any major change to the digital world, Telegram Stars’ launch is not without its difficulties. It is impossible to ignore the possibility of regulatory monitoring and compliance problems since the incorporation of cryptocurrencies into mainstream platforms frequently draws increased attention from authorities. However, Telegram is open to innovations with its large user base and strategic approach. It presents itself as a possible innovator in closing the communication gap between conventional messaging services and the crypto sector. In addition, the incorporation of Toncoin into the Telegram ecosystem has the potential to promote a strong and independent economy that will benefit developers and content producers. Telegram’s dedication to fostering a dynamic and interactive ecosystem is demonstrated by projects like the Open League campaign, which intends to provide millions of TON tokens to community members. The smooth integration of these technologies into the Telegram user experience is one of the main elements that might drive the success of Telegram Stars and Toncoin. Telegram has the ability to educate a large audience about cryptocurrencies, many of whom might not be aware of the nuances of the crypto world. The simplicity with which Telegram Stars may be acquired and used inside the well-known messaging program may considerably reduce the barrier to entry for general consumers, leading to a global uptake and comprehension of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, of the advertising revenue from public channels, provides strong motivation for content producers to support and encourage the usage of Toncoin and Telegram Stars. Increased participation, the production of new content, and eventually a flourishing ecosystem inside the platform might be the results of this positive cycle. As the launch date of June 12th approaches, the cryptocurrency community and Telegram users alike will be watching with keen interest, eager to witness the impact of this development on the broader ecosystem. Whether Telegram Stars and Toncoin will catalyze mass adoption and unleash a new era of seamless, secure, and decentralized transactions remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Telegram has boldly stepped into the future, and the ripples of this move are bound to be felt far and wide.

They are parents to son Jack, 22, while Eamonn also has sons Declan, 35, Niall, 31, and daughter Rebecca, 33, from his previous marriage. Insiders claimed on Sunday that the pair have been living separate lives for two years, with their relationship detoriating after they left This Morning in 2021. Eamonn has had a tough two years, losing the ITV show, as well as battling health conditions and grieving the death of his mother. The presenter is said to have been keen to move home to Belfast, but Ruth was adamant they stay put at their Surrey home. A source told The Sun on Sunday night: 'Eamonn and Ruth's relationship changed when they left This Morning. They started moving in different directions in their careers and their priorities started to change.' 'Eamonn was desperate to return to Belfast, which he thinks of as home, but Ruth would never move. It became a bone of contention. 'As her ITV career continued, Eamonn went down another path and they became ships in the night. For the past two years they had led separate lives, professionally and personally.' Eamonn spoke about his desire to return to Belfast last year, revealing how his wife was always 'very irritated' when he called it home. He said last year, when asked where he thinks of as home: 'Well, it's not Surrey. When people ask me what I'm doing at the weekend, I tell them I'm going home. 'Then my wife gets very irritated by this. She says, 'This is your home. And I say, 'No Ruth, this is where I work. This is where I have to be, but home...' Eamonn was forced to sell his beloved house in east Belfast last year to pay off a huge bill after a £250,000 tax battle with HMRC. The TV presenter admitted in January that he felt 'bitter' about having to sell his house after losing two appeals against HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) which set him back 'hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees'. Eamonn is reportedly set to address his split from Ruth on his show on GB News on Monday, after they confirmed the end of their marriage (pictured on his show) The couple tied the knot in 2010 after dating for 13 years - and say that despite their separation, they are 'determined to stay friends' (pictured on This Morning in 2021) It would mark the first time either Ruth or Eamonn have spoken about the split since their initial announcement, but sources close to the pair say that a 'statement is being prepared by Ruth's representatives ', to share the news with their followers Ruth is said to have been the one to instigate the split, with friends saying that while she cares for her husband and has helped him through his recent health battles, she 'knows they can't be together.' Read More Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford look stony-faced as they leave their last public outing separately - before news of their divorce plans emerged following 14 years of marriage The Sun have reported that Ruth has been preparing for the split for over a year, with paperwork from her TV company, Hey Ho Ltd, revealing she paid herself a dividend of £2.2million last year, compared to the £85,000 she claimed the year before. The couple were last seen together at the Tric Awards in 2022. They arrived together and smiled on the red carpet at the event in London but were seen leaving separately. In unearthed photos of the event , Loose Women star Ruth was seen chatting on the phone as she left Grosvenor House Hotel after the bash. Eamonn appeared to have left by the back door before walking down the street on his own while clutching his News Presenter award after stopping to chat to his GB News colleague Bev Turner. Yesterday it emerged Eamonn and Ruth's marriage had been 'over for a year', with friends saying the couple were 'determined to keep it a secret' as they struggled to save their 27-year relationship . So keen they were to avoid it becoming public, both Ruth and Eamonn denied there were any problems when asked in recent months. It has been reported that Eamonn will address the split on his show on GB News on Monday, after they confirmed the end of their marriage. The presenter hosts a breakfast show with Isabel Webster, which sees them talk through the big news stories of the world. Speaking to The Sun , a source said: 'Eamonn is always frank on camera and knows it will be odd for him to discuss the day's news without mentioning his split so he'll say a few words. 'He is putting on a brave face and will be the true professional he always is. Focusing on work will be a welcome distraction.' It would mark the first time either Ruth or Eamonn have spoken about the split since their initial announcement, but sources close to the pair say that a 'statement is being prepared by Ruth's representatives ', to share the news with their followers. The TV couple, who friends say were 'as close to Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan as you could get', have sparked rumours over the last few months as neither appeared on the other's Instagram posts. The famous couple first met in through a mutual friend, GMTV star Sally Meen, while Eamonn was also on the show in 1997. Eamonn broke his silence on social media on Saturday afternoon to celebrate Manchester United's FA Cup win, with no mention of the separation news (Man Utd celebration pictured) Celebrating the team's shock 2-1 over rivals Manchester City, he wrote: 'My God, what a Cup Final, what a Result! #MUFC European football next season too. The Magic of The Cup. Congratulations to the whole squad' Two years later, he had split from his first wife Gabrielle Holmes, the mother of his three eldest children. And despite Ruth and Eamonn feeling an instant connection, he ensured it was the nation's best-kept secret, as he did not publicly confess his love for Ruth for two years. Read More Full timeline of Eamonn Holmes' health battle: From chronic pain to 'life-changing' surgery - as broadcaster splits from his wife Ruth Langsford Eamonn even refused to hold her hand in public or attend events together for the first few years of their relationship in a bid to stay respectful to his ex of nearly 20 years. But after just a year of having their relationship out in the open , they welcomed their son Jack in 2002. But now, more than 20 years later as the beloved pair have split, one friend told MailOnline: 'Ruth and her team have been telling their friends to look out for the comments, which they are planning to put on social media. 'It's a very sorry tale. They are both so loved by the British public, they won over so many people on This Morning which they hosted for more than a decade.' The couple, who live in Surrey, have prompted many rumours throughout the showbusiness industry in recent months by not appearing together on their individual Instagram accounts. Eamonn and Ruth tied the knot in 2010 after 13 years together, in a lavish ceremony at the grand 19th century Hampshire hotel, The Elvetham. Their split comes just days after Ruth revealed she fears Eamonn 'might never be 100 per cent right' after undergoing back surgery due to suffering chronic back pain for almost two years. The GB News breakfast presenter is still recovering from the surgery and an injury to his shoulder, which saw him take four months off work at the end of last year. The former This Morning hosts, both 64, 'are in the process of divorcing' after work commitments 'took their marriage in different directions' (pictured in 2021) The couple are parents to son Jack, 22, while Eamonn also has sons Declan, 35, Niall, 31, and daughter Rebecca, 33, from his previous marriage (pictured in 2001) The couple, who live in Surrey, have prompted many rumours throughout the showbusiness industry in recent months by not appearing together on their individual Instagram accounts (pictured in 2007) A spokesperson for the couple said: 'Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing' He has ongoing daily physio sessions and either uses a cane or wheelchair to get about, with the support of his estranged wife Ruth. Speaking to Woman's Weekly, Ruth said: 'I don't know how much Eamonn's mobility will improve. We live in hope. 'He does the physio, but there might have to be some acceptance that this might never be 100% right. With any care situation - and there are millions of carers in this country - it isn't always easy. It's testing but we manage as a family.' Ruth added: 'I look at Eamonn, who's had his health and back problems, and it makes you realise how important your health is.' Read More Inside Eamonn and Ruth's love story: From dating in secret to romantic wedding - A look back at their relationship as they are set to divorce Eamonn and Ruth hosted This Morning together for 14 years, and were a fixture on the show both on Fridays and during the school holidays. However, in 2020 the pair were dropped from their Friday slot and replaced by Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary. A source close to the pair said at the time they were 'more upset than angry' at being ousted from the show. Since then, Eamonn has been a presenter on GB News' Breakfast Show, while Ruth has been a regular panellist and anchor on Loose Women since 1999. Their romance has sparked concern in recent weeks as Ruth admitted that the last two years have been hard on her relationship after Eamonn suffered from complex health issues.

        "content": "THE RETAIL PRICE of rice is expected to drop by September by as much as 20% due to the impact of improved domestic production and the relaxation of import procedures and tariffs, the Department of Finance said. “We expect rice prices to go down by 20%, maybe by September. This would entail one, increasing production, and second, reducing tariffs,” Finance Secretary Ralph G. Recto said during the Philippine Economic Briefing on Monday. The average retail price of well milled rice was P56.52 per kilogram as of early May, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. A kilo of regular milled rice averaged P51.24 during the period. “I think we have a game plan as far as that is concerned,” Mr. Recto added. National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan said that the domestic price of rice has been a challenge for the past few months. “The forecast on global rice prices by the second half of the year, particularly by September, is going down... It’s past El Niño and the election in India is over,” he added. Mr. Balisacan said that by September, all restrictions on exports by major producing countries will have been lifted. “Domestic prices simply reflect the trends in global prices, particularly for rice. So, as global prices come down, provided our exchange rate does not sharply depreciate, which I don’t expect, then we should see domestic prices coming down,” he added. Separately, Agriculture Undersecretary Asis G. Perez said the decline in rice prices will require not just an increase in rice production, but also imports. “That’s a common aspiration. That’s been discussed, and 20% is around P10 less in price. (We are) looking at whether we can increase our production,” Mr. Perez said on the sidelines of the briefing. He added that rice prices could still be influenced by external factors like global price surges. The Department of Agriculture (DA) downgraded its palay (unmilled rice) target to 20.4 million metric tons (MT) this year, citing the impact of El Niño on domestic production. Its initial target had been 20.8 million MT. It had hoped to exceed the 20.06 million MT recorded in 2023. The reduced tariffs on rice imports were extended until December. Rates for rice imports were kept at 35%, regardless of the minimum access volume and country of origin. Rice imports have totaled 1.89 million MT as of May 9, according to the Bureau of Plant Industry. — Adrian H. Halili",

        "content": "It still remains unclear whether Nigeria men’s U-17 team, the Golden Eaglets, will be a part of the 2025 U-17 AFCON which will also serve as qualifiers for the 2025 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Qatar as the Confederation of African Football is yet to decide on the number of slots for each zone in the zonal qualifiers, The PRIMANEWS reports. The Golden Eaglets were beaten 1-0 by Ivory Coast in the semi-finals of the WAFU B zone on Saturday, dashing the hopes of Manu Garba’s side of advancing to the U-17 AFCON as one of the finallists in the zonal qualifiers. Garba’s team are now clinging to a tiny of expansion by CAF, with the continent’s football governing body still mum on the decision. Two teams were expected to qualify from each zonal qualifier organised by CAF, but many followers are expecting a change in the number of teams for the U-17 AFCON to be increased from 16 after FIFA has also expanded the World Cup to 32 teams. Following their defeat on Saturday in Accra, media officer of the team, Francis Achi noted, “Lifeline for Golden Eaglets. It is likely that three teams will qualify from WAFU Zone B for the U-17 AFCON. There is still all to play for in the third-place game against Ghana. “CAF will confirm in the coming days if three or four teams will qualify from WAFU B,” he added. Ahead of their third-place game on Tuesday against hosts Ghana who were also beaten 2-1 by Burkina Faso, head coach Garba also dropped a glimmer of hope. “There is a plan for everything in life because with God we have trust in him. We appreciate your support. All the boys are saying a big thanks for you guys support once again. “We go again for the third place with Ghana. Your support will go a long way for the third place.” Meanwhile, 1993 U-17 World Cup winner, Festus Odini, has blamed the team’s inability to make the final and its potential damage on age-grade football on lack of adequate preparation. “Everything is down to the schedule for the preparation. The team didn’t use up to a month together before the tournament and look at the issues of MRI they had too,” Odini told our correspondent. “That is what is affecting us. There should be proper and adequate preparations for teams like this. I remember during our time, there were bunch of talents in camp for almost a year before some of us joined as additions.” Aside from the expected decision on the number of slots for the U-17 AFCON, CAF is also expected to make decisions on the schedule of the 2024 WAFCON as well as the 2025 AFCON.",

        "content": "SHARK TWO ONE can strike fear into the bookies with a victory at Leicester on Tuesday. The six-year-old, trained by Jessica Macey, was a course and distance winner in October and bounced back to form when keeping on well to finish second of 13 over six furlongs on this course earlier this month. My selection was always prominent but was just held by the well-regarded Catherine Chroi, who was completing a hat-trick of wins and has now won five out of her last six races. The extra furlong of Tuesday's Sipp Cafebar Handicap can get the son of Adaay back in the winners' enclosure in the hands of Jack Doughty. Leicester hosts a Flat meeting on Tuesday when Newsboy’s nap, Shark Two One, is fancied to win the 6f handicap (4.55) At Brighton, MAYZ (4.45, nb) should go well at a decent price in the Free Digital Racecard At raceday-ready.com Handicap for trainer John Gallagher. The four-year-old daughter of Mayson has been third in her last two races, the latest when three and a quarter lengths behind Flame Of Kodiac at Chepstow on heavy ground a fortnight ago. The better going should suit and she is fancied to be thereabouts.

        "content": "A woman appears to have given birth beside an inner-Sydney river then disappeared, prompting a desperate overnight search for mother and child amid grave fears for their welfare. Emergency services were called to the banks of the Cooks River at Earlwood, near a field where children were practicing soccer, after a person walking their dog found what police described as “evidence of a birth” on Monday afternoon. An area near the Cooks River was taped off on Monday night following the discovery of evidence that a mother had given birth on the banks of the river. Credit: Jordan Baker Burwood Superintendent Christine McDonald said police conducted urgent forensic tests. “I can confirm that a placenta and an umbilical cord of a human has been located,” she told reporters late on Monday night. “Our immediate concern is for the health and safety of the mother and child.” Officers are urging the mother to attend her nearest hospital to seek care for herself and the baby. “It is of extreme urgency that we find the mother and baby as soon as we can,” said McDonald. The red dot marks a spot where police believe a woman may have given birth near the banks of the Cooks River. Credit: Google Maps Police are bringing in lights and will “conduct a large-scale search” of the area overnight, McDonald said. A rising tide is causing concern that evidence may be washed away. Divers might also be called. Police investigations will confirm whether the mother gave birth at that point on the bank of the river. They believe the material is too far from the road to have been thrown from the Wardell Road bridge. That section of the riverbank is lined with mangroves and is behind a rugby field, away from the bike path and homes. The path to the road bridge is steep, so it is more likely she walked a few hundred metres around the river.",

        "description": "An ex-Michigan softball player coaches Duke to its first College World Series",
        "content": "In her seventh season as head coach, a tenure that spans the entire existence of the Duke softball program, Marissa Young has established the Blue Devils as a national power. The former Michigan pitcher led Duke to the program’s first appearance in the College Softball World Series with a thrilling win over No. 10 Missouri on Sunday night. Young was a three-time All-America selection at Michigan during her four-year career. She was the 2003 Big Ten Player of the Year as a senior and the conference’s Pitcher of the Year the season prior. She graduated in 2003 as the program’s all-time strikeout leader. Young could hit, too, matching a then-program record with 13 home runs as a senior. The Santa Ana, California, native played a couple of years of professional softball before eventually getting into coaching, beginning with three seasons at Concordia University, an NAIA program in Ann Arbor. She moved down the road for two seasons an assistant at Eastern Michigan before leveling up to the ACC. Young was an assistant at North Carolina for two seasons before moving across town to rival Duke in 2015. At the time, Duke did not have a varsity softball program. That started in 2018, and Duke finished 13-11 in the ACC. In 2021, the Blue Devils won the conference tournament and reached the NCAA Tournament. They made the Super Regional the next year. They got there again last year and hosted, but lost to Stanford. This past weekend, they topped Missouri in a best-of-three series at Missouri to advance to the College World Series. Duke won the deciding game on Sunday 4-3, with all the scoring coming in the ninth, the second extra inning. Duke is coming off ACC regular-season and tournament titles and is ranked No. 10 in the country. “We’re making history here and we’re excited to take this team to Oklahoma City,” Young told reporters after the game. Duke will play No. 2 Oklahoma, the three-time defending national champions, on Thursday. The World Series is a double-elimination event featuring eight teams.",

        "content": "New Delhi: Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said that no family member of any terrorist nor close relatives of stone pelters will get government jobs in Jammu and Kashmir. Shah also said that the Narendra Modi government has not only targeted terrorists but also eliminated the terror ecosystem, resulting in a drastic fall in terror incidents in the country. \"In Kashmir, we have taken a decision that if someone joins a terrorist organisation, their family members will not get any government job,\" he told PTI in an interview over the weekend. Similarly, Shah said, that if someone indulges in stone pelting, his family members will also not get a government job. He said some human rights activists went to the Supreme Court against the decision but, in the end, the government prevailed. The home minister, however, said the government will make an exception in case someone from a family comes forward and informs the authorities that his or her close relative has joined a terror outfit. Such families will be given relief, he said. Earlier, funeral processions used to be taken out in Kashmir after a terrorist was killed, Shah said. \"We have stopped this trend. We have ensured that the terrorist is buried with all religious formalities but in an isolated place,\" he added. The home minister said when a terrorist is surrounded by the security forces, he is first given a chance to surrender. \"We call family members like his mother or wife and ask them to make an appeal to the terrorist to surrender. If he (the terrorist) does not listen, he dies,\" Shah said. The home minister said terror incidents have gone down significantly in Jammu and Kashmir as the government has not only targeted the terrorists but also eliminated the terror ecosystem. \"Through the NIA (National Investigation Agency), we have taken strong action against terror funding and ended it. We have taken a very tough stand on terror funding,\" he said. In the case of the banned Popular Front of India (PFI), Shah said the government had imposed a ban on the publication and spread of its terrorist ideology. Muslim radical group PFI, founded in Kerala, was banned under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) by the Centre in September 2022 over its alleged links with terror activities. In the case of Amritpal Singh, an alleged pro-Khalistani separatist, \"we have put him in jail under the NSA (National Security Act)\", he said. Singh, the chief of the radical Sikh separatist group 'Waris Punjab De', was arrested in April 2023 in Punjab under the stringent NSA and subsequently shifted to Assam where he is lodged in Dibrugarh jail. He recently filed nomination papers from the jail to contest the Lok Sabha election from Punjab's Khadoor Sahib seat. According to Union Home Ministry data, there were 228 terrorist-initiated incidents in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018 and the number came down to around 50 in 2023. There were 189 encounters between security forces and terrorists in 2018 and it came down to around 40 in 2023. As many as 55 civilians were killed due to various terror incidents in 2018. The number came down to around five in 2023. In 2018, a total of 91 security personnel were killed in terror violence in Jammu and Kashmir, with the figure declining to around 15 in 2023.",

        "content": "The conclusion of the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) might have been anti-climactic, with Kolkata Knight Riders securing their third title in arguably the most one-sided final of this competition, but the preceding 73 matches produced moments aplenty which made the 2024 edition an unparalleled and memorable season. As we draw curtains to the season, here is The Quint 's IPL 2024 Team of the Tournament: ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Openers – Sunil Narine & Abhishek Sharma Sunil Narine had an excellent season with the bat in 2018, but it was followed by a couple of underwhelming campaigns. After the 2020 season, he pulled the plug on his time as a pinch-hitting opener – not because the KKR management wanted him to do so, but owing to a confidence dip in this facet of the game. Returning in KKR colours this season was Gautam Gambhir, who was responsible for Narine’s transition from a specialist spinner to an all-rounder in 2017. Fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate revealed how the management’s pleas to return as an opener the innings fell on deaf ears, until Gambhir somehow convinced him to take the leap of faith. The leap turned out to be an almighty jump, as Narine scored 488 runs this season, finishing as the ninth-highest run-scorer. His strike rate of 180.74 highlights the role he was assigned – numbing any and every threat of the opposition bowlers in the powerplay overs. He scored his maiden IPL century this year – a 56-ball 109 against Rajasthan Royals – and also got three half-centuries. ðð®ð«ð«ððð¥ Narine ð¤ ̄ #RCBvKKR #IPLonJioCinema #JioCinemaSports Â #TATAIPL pic.twitter.com/6dfsPr9S9S — JioCinema (@JioCinema) March 29, 2024 0 Travis Head could easily have been selected for the vacant opening slot, albeit selecting two overseas players upfront runs the risk of strength disparity across departments. Hence, this position goes to Head’s opening partner – Abhishek Sharma. Despite a forgettable campaign in IPL 2023, Sunrisers Hyderabad deserve credit for continuing with him as their opener, whilst skipper Pat Cummins should be credited for giving Abhishek the license to play his natural, uninhibited game. Abhishek Sharma's scintillating knock comes to an end but he's put @SunRisers on ð with his astonishing strokes ð¥ Head to @JioCinema and @StarSportsIndia to watch the match LIVE #TATAIPL | #SRHvMI pic.twitter.com/OoHgAK6yge — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) March 27, 2024 With 484 runs, Abhishek finished as the tenth-highest run-scorer in the season. But that figure, in isolation, does not portray the influence his batting had on his team. The 23-year-old scored those runs at a strike rate of 204.21, which is the highest among any batter who scored over 350 runs. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Number 3 – Virat Kohli IPL 2024 served as a testament to individual brilliance not warranting collective success in a team sport, as whilst Virat Kohli successfully secured his second Orange Cap, his team – Royal Challengers Bengaluru – remained unsuccessful in their search for the elusive trophy. That being said, there was nothing that Kohli could have offered more. He scored 741 runs – 158 more than his nearest competitor. The former Indian skipper had an average of 61.75 – the highest among the players who scored in excess of 500 runs, and for all debates about his scoring rate, he declared the discourse null and void by accumulating those runs at a strike rate of 154.70 – his highest-ever figure in an IPL season.

This year was a deviation from the usual, as for the first time since his debut 11 years ago, Samson crossed the 500-run barrier in a singular IPL edition. He scored 531 runs at an average of 48.27, which also happens to be his best-ever tally in this tournament. The Rajasthan Royals captain might not have led his team to a second title, but he struck five half-centuries – joint-highest alongside Kohli.

It led to incessant scrutiny, as questions were raised on Rajasthan’s decision to persist with the youngster. In his sixth season, Parag proved that eventually, if not immediately, persistence is certain to pay off. ð toð half-centuries for Riyan Parag He continues his good form with the bat ðð Watch the match LIVE on @JioCinema and @StarSportsIndia ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #MIvRR | @rajasthanroyals pic.twitter.com/tAnDaCghYm — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 1, 2024 He scored 537 runs in 16 matches at an average of 52.09, finishing as the third-highest run-scorer. While he scored four half-centuries, it was his consistency which was more impressive, for Parag scored north of 30 runs in 10 of his fourteen innings. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Number 6 – Nicholas Pooran Nicholas Pooran happens to be the only player on our team whose team could not qualify for the playoffs, which might indicate a thing or two about the season he had. Signed for Rs 16 crore in the 2022 mega auction, the Trinidadian wicketkeeper-batter’s performances in the last couple of seasons were far from unsatisfactory, yet he never really was successful in rationalising the hype around him. That was, until this season, where he scored 499 runs at an average of 62.37, and finished as the eighth-highest run-scorer. In a team where the top-order batters are not particularly renowned for their hitting prowess, Pooran was tasked with the seemingly improbable role of accumulating runs at a brisk pace whilst not losing his wicket, but he was successful in his ordeal, highlighted by his strike rate and average – 178.21 and 62.38 respectively.

In their second triumph in 2014, he was a member of the KKR team, but could only feature in two matches.

He was, however, needed to deliver with the ball, and deliver he did, by picking up 19 wickets at an average of 15.53. He was also KKR’s leading wicket-taker in the final. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Pacer 1 – Pat Cummins (Captain) Though Pat Cummins is among the top 10 on the list of leading wicket-takers, with 18 scalps at an average of 31.44, his numbers with the ball is not the solitary reason why he has made the cut. Instead, it was his leadership qualities which led to the rather unforeseen Sunrisers Hyderabad resurgence. Having finished in tenth place last season, Hyderabad were second to only Kolkata this year, both in the final and the league stage. Cummins was flawless with his bowling changes, whilst the inculcation of his fearless approach saw the batters breaking records of all sorts.

Fair point, but a few factors need to be considered. Firstly, specialist death bowlers are always likely to pick more wickets than all-phase bowlers, with risk-taking shots increasing exponentially in the latter overs. Moreover, Patel scalped 24 wickets at an economy rate of 9.73 runs per over, whilst Bumrah scalped 20 wickets at an economy rate of 6.48 runs per over, plotting the batters’ downfall when their predominant approach was defensive. ðððð ð¥ ð¢ð¡ ð§ðð¥ððð§ ð ̄ Just Bumrah doing Bumrah things ð¤·ââï ̧ Watch the match LIVE on @starsportsindia and @JioCinema ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #MIvDC pic.twitter.com/rO1Hnqd3Od — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 7, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Spinner 1 – Yuzvendra Chahal Yuzvendra Chahal became the only player to scalp 200 wickets in this competition, and rightfully so, has reclaimed his place in the Indian T20 team. The second-highest wicket-taker among spinners, Chahal had 18 scalps to his name. Among the more impressive facets of Chahal’s game was his prowess to break partnerships, and having a trick or two up his sleeve in every game. In the 16 matches he featured for Rajasthan Royals this season, Chahal could not open his wickets tally only thrice.

It seemed that the presumed mystery spinner had no mystery to his game, until he found the incantation to unlock his expertise. Chakaravarthy was the second-highest wicket-taker with 21 scalps, and the highest among spinners.

The Christian factory owner, Nazir Masih, is accused of burning the pages of the Quran in his residential area in Mujahid colony and was attacked by a mob, numbering over 400 and armed with batons, bricks, and stones. “Our brother, a businessman, was victimized. We are peaceful people being pushed to their limits,” Iqbal told UCA News on May 26. The case was registered on behalf of the state under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). However, the police also registered a blasphemy case against the Christian man, a resident of Mujahid Colony, who was critically injured by the mob but survived the lynching attempt. He was booked on the report of an activist of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan, identified as Muhammad Jahangir. A local resident, speaking to Dawn, reported that burnt pages of the Holy Quran were discovered on the cover of a water pump near the residence of a Christian man. However, no one witnessed him setting the pages on fire. The man’s family is described as humble and not associated with such activities, as per Dawn. A mob of religious individuals attempted to lynch the Christian man on Saturday. According to a case filed by Station House Officer (SHO) Shahid Iqbal, locals, armed with sticks, stones, and weapons, gathered in front of the man’s house and tried to break in. Amid police efforts, the Sargodha Peace Committee, and other residents tried to resolve the situation through dialogue, the mob set fire to a shoe unit owned by the man’s son and attempted to enter his house from adjoining rooftops. The crowd also destroyed electricity meters and outdoor AC units outside the man’s home and set them on fire. The situation was brought under control after a heavy contingent of police reached the spot. Station house officer Iqbal and other police officers on the scene saved the man from the burning house. However, as they brought him out, the mob surrounded them, threw stones, and beat them with sticks, severely injuring the man. According to the FIR, some women are also part of the violence. The case was registered under several sections of the ATA and PPC, including an attempt to murder, obstructing public officials in discharging their duty, assaulting a public official and mischief by fire or explosive material with intent to destroy a house or cause death or hurt. Following the incident, Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Usman Anwar and Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal visited Sargodha and inspected the crime scene. In response to the incident, Provincial Minister for Minority Affairs Ramesh Singh Arora took notice of the alleged blasphemy and contacted the Punjab home secretary. Under the supervision of Sargodha District Police Officer Asad Ijaz Malhi, the security of churches in the entire district was tightened and more than 1,000 security personnel were deployed at the churches on Sunday. Meanwhile, Sargodha District Police Officer Asad Ejaz Malhi told Dawn that the incident happened over an incident of alleged desecration. The police cordoned off two houses in the colony and “safely recovered all the residents,” he said. Unverified footage on social media showed a mob surrounding an injured man and separate videos showing men, some of whom appeared to be teenagers, wrecking furniture outside a house, according to Dawn. Being asked about the videos, DPO Malhi said that these were “fake videos” and insisted that no one was hurt in Sargodha district. “Police is maintaining law and order,” he added. More than 200 Christian families from Sargodha, half of them Catholics, have fled as the vital Punjab province witnessed another mob attack over blasphemy in August last year. This is one of the many episodes that highlight the precarious situation faced by religious minorities in Pakistan, who continue to face the threats of persecution and attacks.",

        "content": "A man allegedly stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death in a PG here over a rape case she had filed against him, police said on Monday. Police arrested the man after he informed them about the incident on Saturday night. The 32-year-old deceased woman had come to meet the accused in his PG in Gurugram from Maharashtra, police said. According to police, Suraj Verma (28) claimed that the woman had filed a rape case against him in 2023, and he got bail in the case after a \"compromise\" with her. Verma claimed that she was now trying to blackmail him, they said, adding that his claims were being probed. \"Both the accused and deceased were in a love affair and the woman had filed a rape case against the accused in Maharashtra last year,\" said Inspector Arjun Dev, SHO of Sadar Police Station. \"The accused claimed that the woman was blackmailing him, but it is a matter of investigation. The accused was produced in a city court today and sent into judicial custody,\" he said. Verma and the deceased woman are both residents of Akola, Maharashtra. The accused was working in a private company and lived in a PG near Tikli village here, police said. According to police, they got a call from Verma around 8 pm Saturday that he had killed a woman. A police team reached the spot and found the woman lying in the pool of blood and arrested Verma, who was in a washroom in the PG. Police said the body was taken into custody and kept in the mortuary. After identifying the body, her family were informed, they said.",

But if you go down the steps and into this underground bar, you'll find NQ64. NQ64 is a retro arcade bar that , featuring 80s and 90s video game classics such as Pac-Man, Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario Kart. The bar also has branches in Manchester, London and Glasgow, to name a few. I am a huge fan of video games, having previously tried to While my Wii skills didn't really translate into real life, I felt right at home in NQ64. When visitors go inside, they can pay for game tokens to be used in consoles, such as classic Dance Dance Revolution or racing games. It was a nice touch that some of the consoles, such as the Nintendo 64, are free to play on, so visitors can still experience the video games without getting tokens. Another great aspect of the bar are , as they are all named after classic video game characters. My personal favourite, which you can see in the video above, was the Kirby, named after Nintendo's cute protagonist of the Kirby games. It was made up of beefeater pink gin, poppy liqueur, grapefruit, lime and vanilla, but it had a special visual twist that I couldn't get enough of.

        "content": "Drug shortage in the US generic market will help Indian pharma companies see improved volume growth as well as higher returns in FY25. Indian companies also have an opportunity to increase their market share. The US is facing an active shortage of 233 drugs across 22 therapeutic categories, led mainly by discontinuation of drug production, rising demand and delays in shipments. Generic pharma manufacturing is a competitive industry with low margins. Price erosion on account of purchase concentration, increasing regulatory costs and limited commercial viability in some cases has led to many US-based generic pharma manufacturers to halt the production of financially unsustainable products. Large Indian generic players have exited non-profitable molecules, contributing to increasing shortages. Further, there has been a consistent decline in the filing of original abbreviated new drug application (ANDAs) on account of increased filing complexities, leading to higher research and development spend per molecule. The median timeline for approval had increased to 26 months which is a six-quarter high, from 21 months. With the reduced ANDA filing intensity, the pricing scenario will improve amid decreasing competition. Due to drug shortages, now there is an improvement in USFDA approvals and tentative approvals of the original ANDAs filed by pharma companies. India Ratings finds that US-focused pharma companies will sustain their revenue improvement trend in FY25 on account of heightened drug shortages. This will not only provide potential for volume growth, but also limit price erosion to single digits over the next 12-18 months, leading to improved returns. Expanding the supply chains and increasing participation from manufacturers across therapeutic categories are ideal long-term solutions to address drug shortage. The agency believes Indian pharma companies with a reasonable track record, recent cost rationalisation and enhanced research and development capabilities can capture a higher market share in many of these therapeutic categories. Also, given the limited ANDA filings and delays in approvals provided by the USFDA, the drug shortage in the US provides an opportunity for Indian players with necessary approvals to gain market share in a competitive-but-attractive market.",

        "content": "( ) mengatakan Indonesia patut bersyukur telah mampu menghadapi berbagai krisis yang ada di dunia saat banyak negara lain menjadi 'pasien' dari dana moneter internasional ( ) alias bergantung pada lembaga tersebut. Lebih dari 96 negara menjadi pasien IMF. \"Kalau kita melihat di jajaran negara besar G20, selalu kita masuk tiga besar atau lima besar,\" kata Jokowi pada Inaugurasi Menuju Ansor Masa Depan di kawasan GBK, Jakarta, Senin (27/5). Menurut dia, ada tiga hal yang ditakuti oleh negara-negara di dunia. Pertama berkaitan dengan nilai tukar atau kurs terhadap dolar AS. Sebab hal ini akan berpengaruh pada naik tidaknya harga barang-barang, terutama barang impor. Kedua terkait harga minyak. Perang geopolitik yang terjadi di Palestina dan mengikutsertakan Iran juga mengkhawatirkan dunia. Karenanya harga minyak sempat naik. Jokowi meminta agar kenaikan harga minyak dunia tidak dianggap remeh. Alasannya, kenaikan harga minyak bisa berpengaruh ke Indonesia, yaitu harga-harga barang akan ikut terkerek lebih mahal. Sama dengan perang di Ukraina-Rusia yang berpengaruh pada kenaikan harga gandum karena kedua negara perangnya sama-sama menyimpan stok gandum dan menahan ekspor mereka. Akibatnya, harga gandum sempat naik hampir 50% dan harga roti serta mi ikut naik. \"Kelihatannya tidak ada hubungannya. Padahal ada. Geopolitik kalau tidak dicermati bisa membuat harga-harga naik,\" kata Jokowi. Ketiga, yang ditakuti semua negara yaitu bunga pinjaman. Semua negara, kata Jokowi, memiliki pinjaman. \"Ada yang sampai 220% lalu ada yang 130%. Dan kita (Indonesia) pada tataran dibandingkan negara-negara lain, berada di 39%, jauh dari UU yang diperbolehkan dan jauh dari negara-negara lain yang saya sebutkan. Ini patut kita syukuri bersama,\" kata Jokowi. Karena itu, paling penting ialah menjaga agar tidak ada turbulensi politik. Kestabilan politik menjadi kunci pembangunan di negara manapun. \"Kalau ini tidak bisa kita pertahankan, yang terjadi kerugian ekonomi,\" kata Jokowi. Oleh sebab itu, pembangunan merata, hilirisasi industri, program-program kerakyatan, transformasi menuju ekonomi hijau, dan pengembalian aset seperti Freeport dan Blok Rokan juga perlu berkelanjutan.

Above-normal heat wave days are likely over most parts of northwest India and adjoining areas of central India during the next month, the IMD forecast states. Above-normal monthly minimum temperatures are also likely across most parts of the country in June, except for the extreme northern parts of northwest India and a few pockets of east and northeast India, where normal to below-normal minimum temperatures are most likely, the IMD said. The IMD has also warned that during heat waves, vulnerable populations, like the elderly and those with health conditions, face risks of heat-related illnesses. Prolonged extreme heat strains infrastructure and leads to dehydration. Authorities must act proactively by opening cooling centres, issuing advisories, and reducing urban heat islands. These steps are crucial for protecting public health during heat waves. One has to stay hydrated, remain in an optimally cool environment, and avoid strenuous activities during peak heat hours to stay safe during heat waves.",

        "content": "Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captured their third Indian Premier League (IPL) title by defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in a low-scoring and one-sided final, concluding a season defined by three words, nostalgia, domination and records. The return of former skipper Gautam Gambhir, the winner of 2012 and 2014 titles with the franchise as a captain, made his return to Eden Gardens as the team’s mentor, in a move that brought back all the nostalgia and golden memories associated with KKR’s golden days. His move to promote bowling all-rounder Sunil Narine to the top of the order paid rich dividends. Narine slogged and battered bowlers into submission with his massive sixes, reminiscent of the good old days when he was sent up the order as a pinch-hitter to up the run-rate. Batter Manish Pandey, the star of KKR’s 2014 final with a knock of 94 while chasing 200 runs against Punjab Kings, took to the field during the group stage match against Mumbai Indians. Another KKR star Andre Russell, delivered yet another all-time great campaign, following some years of inconsistency. Scoring 222 runs in nine innings at an average of 31 and a strike rate of 185 and taking 19 wickets, including a three-fer in the final, Russell provided the team with wickets and sixes, whenever needed. His Caribbean partner in domination, Narine, dominated the tournament at the top, scoring 488 runs in 17 games including a century and three fifties and took two wickets. The trio of Gambhir, Narine and Russell having an absolute blast on the field form-wise and a rare sighting of Manish on the pitch sent millions of fans into nostalgia. These elements representing KKR’s glorious past and nostalgia associated with it, blended well with the newer players of the team, many of them youngsters, consisting of Phil Salt, Rinku Singh, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Venkatesh Iyer, Shreyas Iyer, Ramandeep Singh, Varun Chakravarthy and the big buy, Mitchell Starc, worth Rs 24.75 crores, to give the audience a season to remember. Numerous records were broken by KKR throughout the season, presenting the team as a perfect mix of youth and experience, nostalgia and excitement for the future. KKR ended the group stage with a record of nine wins, three losses and two no results, topping the charts for the first time with 20 points. Its net run rate of +1.43 is also the highest by any team in the league’s history in a single season. The batting unit delivered fours, sixes and consistency like never before, registering the best run rate in an IPL season, with 10.7 runs scored per over. This success story was largely written by the fiery opening pair of Phil Salt (435 runs in 12 matches, with four half-centuries) and Narine. After two to three years of changing and chopping various combinations, the Knights managed to get a stable and firing opening duo. A total of six 200-plus totals were posted, tied with SRH for the joint-most in a single season by a team. Though much of the work was done by Salt and Narine while batting, skipper Shreyas Iyer (351 runs) provided the team the leadership and stability it needed and Venkatesh Iyer (370 runs) produced came in clutch during knockout matches. The finishing touches were consistently put by Rinku, Russell and Ramandeep and made sure that the team got extra 20-40 runs almost every time. KKR smashed 238 fours in the season, the most by a team and 135 sixes, the fourth-most this season with SRH leading the charts with 178 sixes. The youth and aggression of the likes of Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora (19 and 11 wickets each), the big match experience of Starc towards the back end of the competition (17 wickets), bamboozling spin of Varun and Narine (21 and 17 wickets) came together to form one of the most all-round bowling attacks in league’s history as they all chipped in useful contributions in every match, standing up whenever any of their partners was being smashed into the skies. The result was a bowling strike rate of 14.3, the best by a team in an IPL season. Leading into the final, KKR bowlers had taken 47 wickets in their previous five completed games, the most by any team in the league’s history across a five-match stretch. During this period, their bowlers had an average of 16 combined and an economy rate of just 7.95. KKR also bundled out SRH for just 113 runs, the lowest-ever total in an IPL final, producing possibly the most one-sided final in the tournament’s history. All of these factors combined gave KKR a total of 13 wins and just three losses, the least defeats in an IPL season. When future stars of the sport are given their lessons in the sport, these statistics and this IPL season by KKR could be used to bring a shift in the way the game is played. Though the question as to who was more dominant, SRH or KKR would be subjective, now that KKR has a trophy in their cabinet, they have no doubt delivered a season when nostalgia, role clarity, positive intent and big match mentality came together to create a T20 superteam.

        "content": "India’s rain-fed agri areas likely to receive above-normal monsoon rain this year PTI Updated: May 27th, 2024, 19:04 IST in National , Prime News 0 Pic- PTI Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin New Delhi: India’s core monsoon zone covering most of the rain-fed agriculture areas in the country are predicted to receive above-normal rainfall this season, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Thursday. Below-normal monsoon rainfall is expected in northeast India, normal in northwest, and above-normal in central and south peninsular regions of the country, Director General of IMD Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said at a virtual press conference. Also Read Kejriwal’s close aide Bibhav Kumar to move HC against rejection of bail: AAP 47 mins ago Cyclone Remal: 24 blocks affected, nearly 15,000 houses damaged in Bengal 4 hours ago Last month, the IMD said the country could see above-normal rainfall in the four-month monsoon season (June to September) with cumulative rainfall estimated at 106 per cent of the long-period average of 87 cm. “India’s monsoon core zone comprising most of the rain-fed agriculture areas are likely to receive above-normal rainfall (more than 106 per cent of the long period average),” Mohapatra said. Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal form the country’s core monsoon zone where agriculture is primarily rain-fed. The IMD director general said the country is likely to experience normal rainfall (92-108 per cent of the long period average of 166.9 mm) in June. “Barring a few parts of southern peninsular India, normal to above-normal maximum temperatures are expected in the country in June,” the senior meteorologist said, adding that conditions are favourable for monsoon onset over Kerala in the next five days. With the crippling heat testing power grids and triggering drought-like conditions in parts of the country, a prediction of above-normal monsoonal rainfall comes as a huge relief for the nation. However, normal cumulative rainfall does not guarantee uniform temporal and spatial distribution of rain across the country, with climate change further increasing the variability of the rain-bearing system. Climate scientists say the number of rainy days is declining while heavy rain events (more rain over a short period) are increasing, leading to frequent droughts and floods. The monsoon is critical for India’s agricultural landscape, with 52 per cent of the net cultivated area relying on it. It is also crucial for replenishing reservoirs critical for drinking water, apart from power generation across the country. According to the Central Water Commission, water storage in 150 major reservoirs in India dropped to just 24 per cent of their live storage last week, exacerbating water shortages in many states and significantly affecting hydropower generation. June and July are considered the most important monsoon months for agriculture because most of the sowing for the Kharif crop takes place during this period. El Nino conditions are prevailing at present, and La Nina may set in by August-September, scientists say. While El Nino — periodic warming of surface waters in the central Pacific Ocean — is associated with weaker monsoon winds and drier conditions in India, La Nina — the antithesis of El Nino — leads to plentiful rainfall during the monsoon. Data from the 1951-2023 period shows India experienced above-normal rainfall in the monsoon season on all nine occasions when La Nina followed an El Nino event. The country gauged above-normal or normal monsoon in 20 out of the 22 La Nina years. The IMD is also anticipating the development of a positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) or cooler-than-normal Indian Ocean in the east compared to the west, which helps bring rain to several states in southern India. The IOD is currently ‘neutral’ and is expected to turn positive by August. Another factor is below-normal snow cover in the northern hemisphere and Eurasia. Historically, there has been an “inverse relationship” between the levels of snow here and the monsoon.

        "content": "Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi revealed that he reached out to motivate Shadab Khan after the experienced all-rounder recorded his worst bowling figures in T20I format. During the second T20I between England and Pakistan at Edgbaston, Shadab went wicketless and conceded 55 runs in his four-over spell at an economy of 13.50. The 25-year-old recorded his worst bowling figure as Pakistan bundled out on 160 while chasing 184 on Saturday. Afridi had a conversation with Shadab about his performance and tried to motivate him and pinpoint the areas where he was struggling with. “I need Shadab to deliver with the ball. Whenever he has performed with the ball, Pakistan have won. I have watched all of his matches in the past. We had a detailed chat yesterday, I asked him who is guiding him or if there is something he is not doing, how are you making such mistakes is there no one to tell you?” Afridi told a local Pakistan news channel as quoted from Geo News. “I called yesterday because I know he is going through a difficult time so I always try to help and motivate players who are having a hard time. Similarly, I talked with Shadab about what he is doing wrong and I hope that if he does [what he discussed] in training sessions, you will see the difference,” Afridi added. The former Pakistan skipper was also asked whether Shadab was suffering from a mental block. Afridi pinpointed the unavailability of a leg-spinner in the coaching team who could guide Shadab as he continues to face “tremendous pressure”. “Is there any leg-spin coach with the team? Saeed Ajmal was there but he was an off-spinner. Ajmal should be asked if he guided Shadab and why is he not doing what he was told,” Afridi said. “I know there must be tremendous pressure on Shadab but big players know how to pull themselves out of such situations. I shared with him one to two problems I found with his bowling and I’m hoping that he will work on those things,” the former skipper concluded. Pakistan will play the third T20I against England on Tuesday at the Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. The Men in Green are trailing 1-0 in the series, as the first game got washed away due to rain. (ANI)",

        "content": "EDMONTON -- The Western Conference Finals shifts venues for the first time, as the Edmonton Oilers are hoping some home cooking will give them an edge against the Dallas Stars on Monday night. Dallas Stars vs. Edmonton Oilers (Series tied, 1-1) Just like they did in the second round, the Stars fought back after relinquishing home-ice advantage to start a series. It was not easy, though, as the Oilers came out flying in the first 20 minutes of Game 2 on Saturday night, outshooting Dallas 16-4. Yet, the game was tied at one after the first period, thanks to some important saves from Jake Oettinger. The home side settled into the game as it went along and began taking the play to Edmonton. The Stars’ pressure was rewarded with a goal from Mason Marchment early in the third, and they would hang to tie the series with a 3-1 win. Oettinger ended up making 28 saves in the victory, proving once again he is more than capable of being a difference-maker in these playoffs. The Oilers have to find a way to not take their foot off the gas. If they continued to create scoring chances at the rate they did in the first period throughout the rest of the game, they might be returning to Edmonton with a 2-0 series lead. The Oilers are 4-2 on home ice in these playoffs, while the Stars are 5-1 on the road. Follow the Stanley Cup Playoffs here",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,” said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine.",

        "content": "Tajikistan, with substantial support from South Korea, started its first solar panel production facility in the Danghara Free Economic Zone on Saturday, according to the Tajik Embassy in Seoul. The project spearheaded by the Korean company Global Solar Wafer, is set to unfold in four stages investing $2 billion and boosting local employment in Tajikistan, the embassy said. The facility is also expected to provide over 8,000 jobs, it added. In a move to woo foreign investment in the country, the Tajik government has allocated 22 hectares in the Danghara Free Economic Zone for the project. Construction of the first phase is slated to begin in July 2024, with completion targeted for March 2025 with the production of solar panel equipment with a capacity of 5,000 megawatts. The establishment of this plant is seen as pivotal to Tajikistan's \"green economy\" strategy, as it is expected to bolster the country’s renewable energy infrastructure, striving to achieve up to 1,000 megawatts of green energy production by 2030. During the facility’s presentation, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon praised the deepening economic ties between Tajikistan and South Korea, citing this venture as a stellar example of bilateral cooperation. Tajikistan-Korea bilateral trade turnover reached $116.1 million in 2023. Currently, over 13 Korean service and production companies are operating in Tajikistan, according to the embassy.",

        "description": "They are calling for a ban on any Irish LNG terminals in line with promises over fracked gas",
        "content": "Climate activists from both sides of the Atlantic gathered in Dublin on Thursday to call for a permanent ban on any Irish LNG terminals. It follows proposals for a floating liquefied natural gas facility offshore in the name of ‘energy security’ should gas lines suffer attack or be shut down. Kerry man Eoghan Harris described the emergency back up plan as a “stab in the back” after Shannon LNG’s application for an onshore facility was rejected. While Julia Walsh from New York based Frack Action warned such a facility could pose major security risks if it ever caught fire or exploded. READ MORE: Mark Ruffalo accuses Irish government of 'breaking its promise to stop LNG' READ MORE: Ireland leading calls for EU to adopt long awaited Nature Restoration Law She told those gathered outside the Department for Environment office as Garda looked on: “LNG terminals pose an even greater national security risk given that there are many more access points for destruction. “LNG terminals are basically sitting ducks in the water and because they are flammable they have a detonation range of almost 2km, where LNG burns so hot it could literally burn the flesh off your body. “That’s not energy security.” Ms Walsh also questioned how the Irish government could keep to its ban on fracked gas, when this can be contained within LNG. She added: “On the other side of the pond our federal government has implemented a temporary ban on all LNG export permits while it reviews the national security risk as well as climate and economic impacts. “Why is Ireland ignoring all these risks and blindly moving forward?” Dublin teacher, Geraldine Coleman, told us she was protesting LNG in Ireland because of the rising climate anxiety her students are suffering. She said: “I have been teaching for 38 years or so and I have come across a lot of students who really suffer, genuinely, from climate anxiety. “This is going right back into the 90s. I remember a young girl who couldn’t sleep at night. “[There’s] genuine fear, genuine worry. It is life threatening and people are worried about the future, their children’s future, their grandchildren’s future.” Eoghan added: “Minister Ryan, we are not going anywhere - no LNG. Keep your promises.” Hollywood Star Mark Ruffalo is supporting the campaign, and recently urged Minister Ryan to scrap the LNG proposal. A letter has also been delivered to Eamon Ryan from Cornell University climate scientist, Prof Robert Howarth who previously gave evidence on LNG’s climate impact to the Oireachtas climate committee. He too has asked Minister Ryan to ban LNG imports to Ireland. DECC previously told us the proposal for offshore LNG would be temporary and the gas would only be used in case of emergency. We understand a decision on the floating facility is expected in the coming weeks. A DECC spokesperson said: \"We will remain reliant on gas for some years yet however, while we wait for our larger projects – in particular off-shore projects – to begin operating. \"Most of our gas comes via two pipelines from Britain, which would leave is in a precarious position should anything happen to them. Therefore, what is being examined is the use of a strategic, temporary , back-up gas reserve – to be used only in the event of an interruption to our normal gas supply from Britain. This is responsible planning for Ireland’s energy security. One option being explored is a strategic floating facility, which would be used only when absolutely needed. This would then be discontinued and sold, when our renewables capacity and storage is increased and it is no longer needed.\" Join the Irish Mirror’s breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

        "content": "As we embarked on our journey, camaraderie filled the air. While travelling alongside fellow prospective corps members, the sense of unity was palpable. From shared laughter to prayers for safe travels, each moment cemented the bonds of camaraderie that NYSC fosters. My journey was interesting, especially travelling with a friend also assigned to the same state. “Corpers on board” was boldly written on our vehicle, and people we passed hailed and prayed for our safe journey. Upon graduating from the university, I eagerly anticipated joining the mandatory one year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). I shared my excitement with friends, but not all of them were keen to join immediately. One friend said he needed to hustle and build his career first. However, I wanted to get it done quickly and move on to the next phase of my life. So, I registered and subsequently got mobilised for a three-week-long camping/orientation. Embarking on the journey to join the NYSC is more than just a transition to adulthood; it is a rollercoaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns. The call up letter came and its stated that I am to camp at the Paiko camp in Paikoro Local Government Area of Niger state, but that after the three weeks, I am to complete my service in Abuja. I was happy and prepared to travel, as I had never been to Niger State. I learnt that it is one of the largest states in terms of land mass. I thought about how beneficial it would be for the Federal Government to collaborate with the NYSC, and invest in agriculture to empower graduates, so as to develop their future. This would surely boost the economy at both the federal and state levels. NYSC is a mandatory scheme for all graduates except those over thirty years old, who are usually issued with an exemption letter. The night before departure, a subtle warning on the NYSC documentation reminded us not to travel at night — a precaution that resonated deeply. Despite the allure of reaching our destination quickly, we chose safety over haste, breaking our journey when dusk fell. This lesson is applicable beyond NYSC, reminding us that even in seemingly safe spaces, vigilance is key. As we embarked on our journey, camaraderie filled the air. While travelling alongside fellow prospective corps members, the sense of unity was palpable. From shared laughter to prayers for safe travels, each moment cemented the bonds of camaraderie that NYSC fosters. My journey was interesting, especially travelling with a friend also assigned to the same state. “Corpers on board” was boldly written on our vehicle, and people we passed hailed and prayed for our safe journey. We chatted and played music, making the journey memorable. Yet, amidst the laughter and anticipation, a moment of stark reality halted us in our tracks. In the midst of lush landscapes, armed men appeared — a stark reminder of the world’s unpredictability. It was a wake-up call, underscoring the importance of vigilance, even in seemingly serene surroundings. We stopped at a canteen to eat a sumptuous meal, enjoying the privileges of being a corper. Continuing our journey, we enjoyed the natural beauty of Nigeria’s landscapes.

Security checkpoints manned by dedicated officers reassured us of their commitment to our safety. Their professionalism and integrity stood as beacons of hope on an otherwise uncertain journey. The most unexpected twist came when a seemingly menacing encounter turned into a moment of levity. Startled awake by a tap on the shoulder, I found myself face-to-face with an armed security officer, his stern demeanour giving way to a shared joke. In that moment, fear melted into laughter, reminding me that amidst life’s uncertainties, moments of joy abound. As we finally arrived at our destination, the journey left an indelible mark. From cautionary tales to unexpected camaraderie, each moment was a testament to the importance of preparation and vigilance. As I shared my tale with my hustling friend, who had chosen a different path, I couldn’t help but wonder what adventures awaited him. For in the journey of NYSC, every twist and turn is a chapter waiting to be written, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the bonds that unite us all. This is the essence of NYSC, preaching national unity and peace. Apart from the interesting aspects of NYSC, there are numerous advantages that I believe will convince you to join the programme. If you want to know the funny joke the officer cracked with me, I guess you should also prepare to go for your NYSC, so you can experience how interesting and memorable the journey was. As long as we take the necessary security precautions and avoid rough driving, NYSC ensures our safety because we are all dear to the government.

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 27 — The government assured that the Specialisation Degree Training Programme or “Parallel Pathway” issue will be resolved promptly, and that a proposed solution framework has been submitted to the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) for evaluation. Higher Education Minister Datuk Seri Zambry Abdul Kadir stated that discussions with the Ministry of Health have been held recently to find a solution regarding legal aspects, in addition to issues related to the recognition of medical programmes, offered in universities. “The government is currently examining comprehensive solutions that also involve legal aspects such as a need for any amendments to the Medical Act 1971, in addition to matters related to the recognition of medical programmes offered at universities. “We have looked into it more deeply and identified that it needs to be resolved regarding matters within legal provisions,” he said after attending the investED training programme graduation ceremony organised by the Securities Commission here today. The Parallel Pathway issue gained attention when the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA) requested Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) to allow entry of non-Bumiputera medical officers who wished to undergo specialised training in cardiothoracic fields, just like how the institution accepts international students. This comes after the Malaysian Medical Council (MMC) rejected the applications of four cardiothoracic surgeons to be listed in the National Specialist Register due to their Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in Cardiothoracic Surgery (FRCS Ed) qualification not being recognised. Commenting further, Zambry said the issue should not only focus on the matter of admitting these four doctors to UiTM but also on why the MMC does not recognise their academic qualifications. “It is unfair if we accuse UiTM of being too rigid and not providing space, showing no compassion to urgent cases. This involves the MMC. Even though they (doctors) may be allowed to temporarily pass out if UiTM provides space, ultimately will the MMC accept them or not? This is the real question,” he said. He also urged the public to have confidence in the ongoing solution efforts and emphasised that the issue should not be exploited for political gains by any party trying to exaggerate the matter. — Bernama",

        "content": "Lagos-based amputee, Idris Aliu, 31, shares with ABDULLATEEF FOWEWE how the amputation of his hand from a tender age hindered his pursuit of becoming a professional footballer Could you recount the events that led to the amputation of your hand? I’m Idris Aliu, and I’m 31 years old. I am from Kogi State but was born and raised in Ikorodu, Lagos State. The journey toward amputation began in 2005. One day, while I was holding onto a tree branch, it unexpectedly broke, causing me to fall and fracture my left wrist. I was promptly taken to a herbal healer for treatment, and initially, the recovery seemed to be progressing well. However, one night, my condition took a turn for the worse. My hand began to deteriorate rapidly, with the decay spreading from my wrist toward my elbow and almost reaching my shoulder. While I’m not suggesting it was a supernatural occurrence, there’s a certain unpredictability to life. Faced with this dire situation, the only option left was to undergo amputation to save my life. And thus, my journey as an amputee began, marking a new chapter in my life. At which hospital did you undergo the procedure to have your hand amputated? My hand was amputated at Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in Ogun State. Initially, they were not the ones treating me when the incident occurred. I was taken to OSUTH to explore any possible remedies, but the only viable option at that point was amputation. Can you recall what transpired when you arrived at OSUTH? I distinctly remember the doctors and nurses expressing anger towards my parents for what they perceived as recklessness in delaying my treatment until my condition had significantly worsened. They found it hard to believe that my injury was less than a month old. It was only after the surgery that they discovered something unusual that was causing the decay in my hand. Surprisingly, this was not mentioned in my medical report. Initially, they attributed the decay to improper care, but a specific doctor who later took charge of my case explained certain aspects to my father. What did the doctor say to your father? My father didn’t delve into many details, possibly because I was young at the time. However, I recall him saying, “Aliu, everything you mentioned about your hand was accurate. The doctor confirmed it.” Interestingly, I used to complain about hearing strange sounds, as if something was burning inside my hand. Strangely, I was the only one who could hear these sounds. Why did you think it was a spiritual issue? One of the doctors explained to us after the surgery that there was a substance, akin to poison, rapidly consuming my hand. It was eating away at my hand so quickly that I was fortunate to have survived as long as I did before the surgery. What was your initial reaction upon learning about the amputation? Initially, I wasn’t informed directly about the amputation. Instead, I was simply told I had an appointment with the doctor in the theatre room. Being young, only 13 years old at the time and in Junior Secondary School, I didn’t fully grasp the gravity of the situation. However, upon regaining consciousness after the surgery, I became aware that my hand had been amputated. Were you not informed about the amputation beforehand? No, I wasn’t informed directly, but I sensed that my appointment with the doctor was different from the usual. I was perceptive enough to realise something was amiss, but I didn’t want to pry too much, especially since I could sense my mother’s unease with my meeting with the doctors that day. Despite feeling devastated upon waking up and realising my hand was gone, I understood deep down that my parents wouldn’t have consented to amputate my hand if there had been any other viable option. How did you manage to cope after the amputation? Coping with the reality of living with a hand amputation was incredibly challenging. I found myself in tears almost every day, struggling to come to terms with the fact that my life had been altered forever. However, the unwavering support of my parents, particularly my late mother, as well as my siblings, and the compassionate care from the doctors and nurses, especially my physician, played a significant role in helping me navigate the difficult period. Their love and encouragement made me realise that despite my disability, I still possessed immense potential. What has been the most difficult aspect of adjusting to life with a missing hand? One of the most challenging aspects has been the realisation that my dream of becoming a professional footballer had to be abandoned. The thought of not being able to pursue my passion at a professional level still weighs heavily on me. Although I continue to play football with friends and participate in local tournaments, the reminder that I can’t pursue it professionally is a constant source of heartache. Also, It was truly disheartening to realise that I couldn’t pursue my passion for learning Aluminium fabrication, especially since I had planned to start after completing Junior Secondary School. I had everything mapped out in my mind, but it seems that it wasn’t meant to be. Despite this setback, I’ve learned to adapt and focus on other skills. Although the journey might be challenging initially, I am determined to excel in whatever I set my mind to. On a positive note, I’ve discovered a talent for playing video games, and at one point, I was considered one of the best in soccer video games in my area in Ikorodu. How did your classmates react when you returned to school with one hand? My classmates were already aware of my situation, as my father had informed my class teacher and the school authorities. However, they were genuinely happy to see me return to school, as some had feared I might not come back after missing a whole term. Their warm reception and support meant a lot to me and helped ease my transition back to school life. Did you continue your education past high school? No, I was unable to due to financial limitations. Have you ever experienced ridicule or mockery due to having one hand? Yes, I faced mockery several times, but I was able to overcome it with my talents in football and video games. Despite the taunts, I found solace in my abilities and the support I received from those around me. Being constantly surrounded by people in public places, I often received praise and encouragement, which helped offset the negative comments. While some kids may have been envious of the attention I received, I learned not to let the mockery affect me. It was just part of the normal banter that occurs among children, and over time, I became accustomed to it and even found humour in it. What activities or ventures are you currently involved in? I used to run a sports betting business, managing my own shop. However, the business eventually faced challenges, primarily due to insufficient capital and a lack of funds to maintain and upgrade it to the required standard. As a result, I am currently not engaged in any specific venture. Were you ever subjected to bullying or discrimination due to your missing hand while working there? I didn’t experience any bullying; in fact, I was quite popular among the people, possibly because my shop was located in my neighbourhood where I was well-known. I believe my approachability and humility contributed to being well-liked, even beyond my immediate community. Has the amputation of your hand ever hindered your ability to secure employment? Yes, it has. One particularly painful instance was during a football screening. Despite being one of the top performers, I was dropped and replaced by someone else simply because I had only one arm. The white man acknowledged my skill and said that I was good enough to proceed to the next screening stage, but my physical condition led to my replacement. As a form of consolation, my coach was given some money to give to me. Have you attempted to join the physically challenged football league? Yes, I have. Unfortunately, the system isn’t very supportive in Nigeria. I used to make frequent trips to Surulere, seeking the right contacts to help me get involved. However, I learned that there is no permanent soccer team or organisation for the physically challenged. They only bring people together and train for a particular tournament, after which the team disbands. It’s disheartening that our country does not provide adequate support or encouragement for the physically challenged. When I see how things are organised abroad, it leaves me feeling like I would do anything to find a way out of this country to pursue my dream. If you were to offer advice to the government, what would it be? I would advise the government to invest more in sports, especially para-sports, and to establish a system where the disabled or physically challenged receive monthly support from the government. These kinds of support systems are common in other countries, and Nigeria should not be an exception. How do you envision Nigerians supporting you? Primarily, I need a comfortable artificial hand. While I have acquired one, it isn’t the best fit for me as it is quite heavy. I am aware that there are lighter and more suitable options available, but they come at a high cost. Additionally, I would greatly appreciate assistance in joining the Nigerian physically challenged soccer team and perhaps even the opportunity to travel abroad to showcase my skills on an international platform. Furthermore, I would be grateful for any help or financial support to start a new business to provide for my family. I am married with a two-year-old daughter, and life has been challenging since my betting shop business failed. The current economic situation is tough, especially for those without stable employment. Can you share the story of how you met your wife? She was a student at Lagos State Polytechnic, now LASUSTECH when our paths crossed. I met her one fateful afternoon near the school premises, we exchanged numbers, and the rest, as they say, is history. How did you approach her despite your condition? Despite having only one hand, I didn’t see it as a barrier. I believe my condition doesn’t define me or diminish my worth since I didn’t murder anyone. Confidence is key, and I’ve always been confident in myself. Additionally, I make an effort to take care of myself and present myself well, believing that looking good is important. What was your wife’s reaction when you first approached her? When I approached her, it wasn’t completely out of the blue. We were familiar with each other as we lived in the same area. This familiarity made the initial approach smoother and more comfortable for both of us. What about her parents’ reaction? Initially, winning over her parents, especially her mother, was challenging. Understandably, no parent wants their child to face unnecessary challenges by marrying a physically challenged individual. However, I had already established a strong relationship with her elder siblings, which played a significant role in convincing her mother to accept our relationship. Eventually, her mother agreed, understanding that it was her daughter’s choice and that I was a suitable partner for her. Given what you’ve been through, do you still have faith in herbal healers? Absolutely. I still have faith in them. My experience has shown me that herbal healers can be effective. I have witnessed many cases where herbal remedies have been successful, both before and after my own incident. However, I would advise caution and careful consideration when seeking herbal treatments. What advice would you give to individuals facing similar challenges like yours? My advice to those facing similar challenges is to remain active. Dressing well and socialising can help maintain a positive outlook. It’s natural to feel down or useless at times, especially when facing limitations in activities you once enjoyed. However, finding new interests and activities that bring joy and a sense of purpose is crucial. Remember, you are not disabled but a unique individual with a remarkable soul.",

        "content": "A new parliament convened in Iran’s capital Tehran for the first time on Monday, days after a deadly helicopter crash which killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Local media reported that lawmakers in the Islamic Consultative Assembly opened the first session of the legislative period with a recitation from the Koran. A new parliamentary speaker is set to be elected in the coming days. Incumbent Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, is running for re-election against religious hardliner Mojtaba Zonnour and former foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki. Elections in Iran are widely seen as neither free nor fair, as the country’s Guardian Council, a supervisory body of Islamic clerics and lawyers, must approve all candidates before they can run. Hardliners won this year’s parliamentary elections, which were held over two rounds in March and May amid a historically low turnout of around 40 per cent. Many Iranian citizens have become disillusioned in the face of political repression, an economic crisis and failed attempts to reform the country’s political system. A wave of protests in September 2022 following the death of a young Kurdish woman, Masha Amini, was violently suppressed by authorities. Political power in Iran is concentrated in the hands of the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran’s president Ebrahim Raisi and foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian died in a helicopter crash near the border to Azerbaijan more than a week ago. According to media reports, more than three million people attended Raisi’s funeral in the north-eastern city of Mashhad on Thursday after days of national mourning. (dpa/NAN)",

        "description": "Daria Saville has joined Australia's casualty list at Roland Garros, losing in the first-round after an untimely rain break.",
        "content": "Australia's tale of Roland Garros woe has continued with Daria Saville's exit ensuring an opening-round wipeout in the women's singles at the French Open for the first time this century. Saville fought valiantly against one of the rising stars of the women's game, 12th seed Jasmine Paolini, but her second-set fightback fell agonisingly short on Monday, interrupted by an hour's rain delay that quite halted her momentum. The 30-year-old Saville, who'd fought back from 5-1 down in the second to the verge of 5-4 when the rains came, returned after the break only to lose all four points on the Italian's final service game as she succumbed 6-3 6-4 in an hour-and-a-half. It means that after Ajla Tomljanovic's exit on Sunday at the hands of No.30 seed Dayana Yastremska, there will be no Australian woman in the second round at Roland Garros for the first time since 1997 when Rachel McQuillan and Annabel Ellwood were the lone entrants. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Tomljanovic's defeat had been the prelude to a miserable opening day for the Australian contingent, with Jordan Thompson and Aleksandar Vukic both getting knocked out before Chris O'Connell pulled out from the tournament with a shoulder injury. But Australia's No.1 Saville wasn't complaining about her loss, bemoaning only that she served so poorly, holding her delivery just once in eight attempts while also gifting nine double faults. \"Obviously, I'm not happy with the way I served, I gave her a lot of free points,\" said Saville. \"I felt like the whole match was actually a lot closer than maybe the scoreline suggested, with a lot of deuce games and although she was hurting me with her forehand a lot, I still felt on the baseline rallies, we were head-to-head. \"But then I struggled with the serve, and it cost me, especially in the first set.\" She felt after pulling back three games in the final set that she was really in with a chance. \"But at 5-4 on that return game, I made four unforced forehand errors, trying to dictate but missing. I'm okay with that, though, because I think I took a chance, but it just didn't work out. \"Maybe I should have played more safe, but I don't think that would have got me anywhere either.\"",

        "description": "The SNP leader was campaigning in Dumfries, part of the Dumfries and Galloway constituency won by Scottish Secretary Alister Jack in 2019.",
        "content": "Mr Swinney, who took over as SNP leader from Humza Yousaf just three weeks ago, said the party was already united behind him and was “very focused on the election campaign”. However, polls have shown the party, which for years has been the dominant force in Scottish politics, is now trailing behind Labour in the run-up to the July 4 voting day. Most recently, a poll by More In Common put support for Labour on 35%, five points ahead of the SNP. Mr Swinney insisted the SNP was “focused on the election as a united party”, adding this was a “significant achievement” which had come about in the “very short space of time” since he took charge. Speaking to journalists as he campaigned in Dumfries, Mr Swinney said: “I want to make sure we take our message to every part of the country to reclaim the ground the opinion polls indicate we have got to reclaim to be successful. “The election is the best part of six weeks away and we have got a lot of ground to cover to do that.” Asked if that meant the SNP was now fighting this election as the “underdog”, the Scottish First Minister said: “That’s an interesting way to put it. “Actually, it is quite a good way to fight an election campaign, if I think back to the contest in 2017 in my own local area, Perth and North Perthshire.” Mr Swinney said in that general election it had been thought the SNP could lose that seat, but he noted: “We fought it as the underdog and we won. So, I think there is maybe something in that.” The SNP leader was campaigning in the Dumfries and Galloway seat currently held by Scottish Secretary Alister Jack. Mr Swinney said the Tory cabinet secretary, along with other Scottish Conservative MPs, had “presided over austerity, Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis being inflicted on Scotland” – adding that voters were “angry” about this. He told people living in those seats held by the Tories in Scotland: “If you want to do something about it, then you vote SNP, because we are the challenger to the Conservatives in these constituencies, and we can remove those Conservative MPs with SNP votes. “My message to voters in this part of the country and in other areas where the Conservatives represent the area is to vote SNP to remove the Tories.”",

        "content": "The Minister of Housing and Urban Development, Ahmed Dangiwa, has reiterated his commitment to eliminate barriers hindering a large scale of homeownership in the country. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony for the Renewed Hope Housing Delivery Portal held at ministry headquarters in Abuja recently, the minister disclosed that the government was ready to institute several policy initiatives to make it easier and more convenient for Nigerians to own their homes. The Renewed Hope Housing Delivery Portal is expected to grant access to 100,000 houses across Nigeria. The Renewed Hope Cities and Estates web portal, where Nigerians, including those in the Diaspora, can apply is The minister recalled that in December 2023, the ministry signed an MoU with a consortium of developers led by Continental Civil to deliver 100,000 housing units nationwide. He noted the inaugurated platform was a key part of the partnership. According to Dangiwa, the innovative platform provides an online, transparent, easy-to-use, integrated web-based application for the sale of homes under the ministry’s Renewed Hope Housing Programme. He explained that the platform also integrated features that offered flexible payment options, including one-time payments and instalment plans, catering to different financial situations. The minister said buyers could also apply for the release of up to 25 per cent of their retirement savings account balance for additional financial support He said, “When we assumed duty, we promised to work in line with His Excellency, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, GCFR, to break all the barriers to homeownership for Nigerians. “We also promised to facilitate and promote the creation of technological systems and private sector-led initiatives that will make it simpler, easier, and more convenient for Nigerians to own their homes. “Today, we are gathered here to take yet another major step towards achieving that promise with the launch of the Renewed Hope Housing Platform.” The minister added that the innovative platform was groundbreaking, providing an online, transparent, easy-to-use, integrated web-based application for the sale of homes under the Renewed Hope Cities and Estates Programme of the ministry. “The platform has many benefits for homebuyers. It has a user-friendly interface to ensure that the journey to homeownership is smooth and straightforward. It ensures a seamless and secure registration process with identity verification, enabling potential homeowners to efficiently search for properties using various filters, ensuring they find homes that meet their specific needs,” he explained. Dangiwa further charged all Nigerians to take advantage of the platform to apply for the houses, adding that “with the platform, you do not need to know anybody to own a home. It is transparent, and the criteria are open to all”. Meanwhile, the government has pegged the price of a 1–3-bedroom flat located at Karsana, Abuja to cost between N22.5m and N65.5m. It also offered different prices for custom-built houses and finished option houses. For houses in Kano and Katsina States, the houses were priced between N9.1m and N12.6m.",

        "content": "Milan is Massimo Giorgetti’s adopted city; born in sunny, industrious Romagna, he decamped at a young age to the equally industrious but alas not so sunny Northern capital. His MSGM creature, who turns 15 this year, is rooted both in the optimism of his birthplace and in the energetic, hard-working nature of the Milanese. Pre-Fall added another chapter to his ongoing celebration of the vitality of young artistic communities blooming today all across the city. “I feel I belong to Milan’s dynamic reality; things happen fast here, which I very much like,” he said. Giorgetti is active in promoting creative talents through the cutting-edge art gallery Ordet, where he’s a partner; throughout his career, he has collaborated with an array of designers, curators, singers, and filmmakers. Since last season, MSGM’s lookbooks have been shot by photographer Delfino Sisto Legnani, whose book Entryways of Milan has been a widespread success. Pre-Fall’s backdrop was the elegant entrance of a Milanese brutalist building, where props including marble sculptures by Gino Cosentino, seats by Osvaldo Borsani, and steel furniture by NM3 were added to convey an artsy vibe. The mainly daywear collection was modeled by Milan-resident visual artists Giorgia Garzilli and Benni Bosetto. They sported a quintessential MSGM repertoire: streamlined and oversized color-blocked coats; leotards in white stretchy lace worn under miniskirts; scuba and neoprene pieces; and for decorative motifs, playful prints of strawberries, Dalmatian dots, and stickers of ceramic figurines. All was imbued with a saturated color palette that mirrors Giorgetti’s zest for life. MSGM seems to be a replica of the designer’s character, a sort of fashion doppelgänger: “It’s a brand that is upbeat, passionate about living in the moment, about embracing life, creativity, lightness and a sense of humor,” he said. But not even the sunny-side-up Giorgetti could avoid a remark on the state of the industry today: “It isn’t easy at all to survive as an independent designer, but we fight our fight with the attitude Milan has taught me: be resilient, hardworking, factual, keeping the heart inventive. Roll up your sleeves, and do not ever give up.”",

        "content": "Dylan Minnette, who rose to fame following his role in 13 Reasons Why, revealed the reason behind taking a break from acting. In a recent interview, he said that he left acting as he decided to focus on music with his rock band Wallows, Variety reported. The 13 Reasons Why star began his acting career as a child star at the age of 8 and touched the new heights of fame after playing Clay Jensen in the popular series. “I was fortunate to find success in [acting],” said Dylan Minnette. “I was on 13 Reasons Why and it was really popular and definitely reached a peak in what I’ve had in acting. But it also started to feel like a bit of a job. And I was in a very fortunate position, it was always fun for me, always really inspiring, but then it was just starting to feel like just a job.” According to the actor, he along with his other band members had dreamed of taking music “all the way as far as we can.” Read more: ‘I must not do any more dramas or films...’: Momina Iqbal is quitting showbiz? “The only way that’s gonna happen is if I put my 100% time and energy into it and take it very seriously and show the world that we all take this very seriously. This is a real band, we’re going to do real band things,” he said. However, the 13 Reasons Why actor said that he does thinks about returning to the screen on occasions. He planned to make a return to acting last year, however, he could not do it due to the actors strike. Minnette’s last outing was in 2022’s Scream and The Dropout and has since remained out of the spotlight.",

        "content": "Bhaiyya Ji X (Twitter) Review: Manoj Bajpayee’s Latest Movie Receives Mixed Response By latest action thriller, , has premiered to mixed reviews. Directed by Apoorv Singh Karki, the film features Bajpayee as a mass action hero in a brand new avatar. Reactions have been divided since its release on May 24, 2024. “Desi mass film”: Netizens on Manoj Bajpayee’s Bhaiyya Ji The social media buzz surrounding Bhaiyya Ji has been intense, with many netizens sharing their film reviews. One described it as a “Desi mass film with Anurag Kashyap style,” praising the acting but criticizing the film for being melodramatic and repetitive. “The cast is phenomenal which carries the strong plot. Does get too melodramatic, repetitive & feels stretched out. @BajpayeeManoj is a Legend! Just watch for the talent involved.” Another found Bajpayee’s performance refreshing, highlighting the standout performances by the cast. “Just seeing #ManojBajpayee @BajpayeeManoj in this #BhaiyyaJi, this larger-than-life avatar is so refreshing. #ZoyaHussain is the pleasant surprise, while #SuvinderVicky is terrific.” was good fun. A typical paisa-vasool entertainment in Hindi cinema after quite a long time. However, not all reviews were positive. Some viewers felt the film fell short of expectations. One user , “BAJPAYEE BECOMES BHOJPURI BALAYYA! I wanted to love this film but barring the screen presence of #ManojBajpayee: it’s routine screenplay & patchy editing are huge demerits. Why should the ‘stars’ have all the fun tho: Bajpayee as the MASS hero fits perfectly!” In stark contrast, another criticized Manoj Bajpayee’s film’s script and action sequences. “#BhaiyyaJi is a colossal disappointment. A failed attempt at Masala genre that instigates nothing but yawns inside the theatre. The film could never rise above the mark of B-grade cinema with a cringe-worthy script and wannabe action sequences.” Despite the mixed reactions, there were fans who still the film for its masala entertainment value. “Masala, Action And, Dialogue-Baazi....#BhaiyyaJi Is Single Screen SeetiMaar Film. For fans, ‘Bhaiyya Ji’ is like a tribute film, which presents the #DesiSuperstar in the South template.” Bhaiyya Ji has sparked varied reactions, but Manoj Bajpayee’s performance has stood out as a highlight for many. The film is currently in the theaters. When not obsessively writing about anything and everything related to cinema, you can catch her documenting nooks and crannies of Delhi.

        "content": "On a December morning in 1971, the air was filled with hope and optimism as the United Arab Emirates was officially formed as a nation. With the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan serving as its first president, the UAE was born from the belief that advancement is achievable through strong will, determination, and collaboration. Against the backdrop of its rapid growth, the UAE quickly gained standing among the international community as a dedicated advocate of cooperation and dialogue. Nine years after its founding, the UAE established diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea, which shared many similarities with our nation’s emerging success story. At the time, the UAE and the Republic of Korea were both relatively young countries with vast developmental aspirations. Throughout the years, the late Sheikh Zayed —known for his humility, humanitarianism and openness to the world — would emphasize the importance of partnership in realizing gains only made possible by building bridges of solidarity and friendship with others across the globe. Now, the flourishing bond between our countries continues to foster enduring successes. It is not merely the near-44 years of cooperation that unite the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea, billions of dollars in trade that link our business communities, or countless agreements that connect our governments and people. Our ties extend far deeper through a history of cooperation, and the UAE-Korea partnership is looking forward to the path that lies ahead. As beacons of ambition and progress in dynamic regions, the UAE and the Republic of Korea stand united in vision and purpose. Together, we are determined to secure our regions well into the future and offer every opportunity for all peoples to thrive in peace, stability, and prosperity. This is our shared duty, and a core belief of UAE President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan: through dialogue and diplomacy, we must work towards collective progress for generations to come and envision a better world than the one we inhabit today. Since our national founding over 52 years ago, we in the UAE have strived to face challenges with courage and pursue opportunities with curiosity. When working alongside the Republic of Korea, such an approach has reaped clear benefits for our people and formed a model of interregional cooperation to be emulated. After elevating our relations to a Special Strategic Partnership in 2018, the UAE became the first and only country in the Middle East to maintain such ties with the Republic of Korea. This step enabled our countries to combine our energy, resources, and efforts towards pioneering solutions in diverse fields, including trade, industry, sustainability, technology, health, and food security. In January 2023, during the first-ever Korean state visit to the UAE, President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and His Excellency President Yoon Suk Yeol commemorated another milestone: as the UAE announced plans to invest nearly $30 billion in the Republic of Korea in the coming years, our countries agreed to leverage opportunities in innovative sectors and explore bold action with real-life results. From the bustling ports along the UAE’s coastline to the iconic financial districts of Seoul, our bilateral trade has grown remarkably. The UAE is now one of the Republic of Korea's top Arab trading partners, accounting for nearly one-third of its total trade with the entire Arab world. This week, our two countries have once more demonstrated this commitment to shared growth and development. During the state visit of President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to the Republic of Korea, I was pleased to witness the signing of the UAE-Republic of Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which will accelerate our joint advancement in fields such as energy, healthcare, and advanced technology. Each agreement we sign and initiative we activate draws us closer to achieving more together, particularly in future-focused sectors that will improve quality of life and safeguard our planet. One exceptional example of this cooperation can be found at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, as clean energy has become a cornerstone of our country’s Comprehensive Strategic Energy Partnership. In 2009, the UAE selected a coalition led by the Korea Electric Power Corporation to build Barakah, and our countries pledged to power the UAE with clean energy and remove tens of millions of tons of carbon emissions every year from our environment. At Barakah and beyond our borders, the UAE and the Republic of Korea have demonstrated that joint innovation — when underpinned by the sharing of knowledge, best practices, and expertise — can help our nations advance toward a sustainable future that offers cleaner air and energy to all without exception. As our ties withstand the test of time, so, too, does our commitment to uplifting communities around the world and ensuring that sustainability remains at the heart of our cooperation. The UAE, under the leadership of President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, stands determined to work in lockstep with our Korean partners to address the most pressing challenges facing humanity, from equitable growth to climate change and sustainable development. Today, we commit to building upon our partnership with the aim of transforming lives and bolstering global consensus through common resolve. Let us embrace the same spirit of ambition upon which our nations were founded as we reimagine a future where our cooperation grows ever stronger and opportunity flourishes for all. Abdulla Saif Al Nuaimi is the UAE ambassador to South Korea. The views expressed in this article are his own. -- Ed.",

        "content": "The National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) has embarked on the second round of public participation on the revised National Strategy to Counter Violent Extremism (NSCVE). Last November, NCTC launched a comprehensive nationwide exercise to gather insights and feedback from a broad spectrum of stakeholders including community leaders, civil society organizations, security experts and the general public. The exercise aimed to assess the effectiveness of the current strategy that has been in place for the last seven years and to incorporate valuable perspectives. Joseph Mureithi NCTC Official said the initial phase of consultations yielded significant input, informing the development of a draft document that seeks to address emerging threats, incorporate good practices and strengthen our collective resilience against violent extremism. The second round of public participation is designed to present the draft document to the public for inputs, solicit feedback and to foster engagement. NCTC today held a public participation with security teams and stakeholders from Mombasa, Kwale, Taita-Taveta, Kilifi, Lamu and Kwale counties. “We are here to engage the public and our partners about the ongoing review process for the NSCVE. It is part of the constitutional requirement to get public views,” said Mureithi in Mombasa. “We had a strategy that has taken us through from 2016. It has come to a time to build on the lessons learnt, we need also to build on what we have achieved and improve on the ways we deal with Violent Extremism as a country,” he added. Mureithi noted that through the 2016 strategy they have been working in a collaborative and multi-agency set up and were able to reduce cases of VE in the country. The new strategy will make the country safer. The reviewed NSCVE has been established to address issues related to gender, youth, inclusion and the need for male mentorship, the strategy is now anchored in the Constitution, Law and Policy. The approach to monitoring & evaluation has been improved by providing clear outcomes that will serve as the units of measure for impact. The strategy has reorganized the pillars into working groups, transforming them from coordination mechanisms into delivery units. Each working group will mobilize local actors and have clear outputs aligned with intended outcomes. It provides further clarity on violent extremism as defined by Prevention of Terrorism Act 2012, distinguishing it from other forms of crime. The strategy also addresses the issues of resourcing and sustainability. “We have been working on building trust between the citizens and the security. We have been cooperating well. The fight against terrorism relies on the cooperation between security agencies and the public. We continue to encourage the strengthening of cooperation,” said Mureithi. The terrorism menace, he added, is not a government issue but a societal problem that needs the participation of all the people. Mombasa County Commissioner Mohamed Noor urged residents to give views to improve the draft strategy to solve CVE challenges.",

        "content": "Will There Be a My Adventures with Superman Season 3 Release Date & Is It Coming Out? By has just premiered, so naturally fans will be asking about a , its , and when it could be . Based on the DC Comics character Superman, My Adventures with Superman is an animated series that follows Clark Kent as he battles various enemies in Metropolis and space as Superman while also maintaining his life as a reporter for the Daily Planet. Here’s all the My Adventures with Superman Season 3 release date information we know so far, and all the details on when it is coming out. Is there a My Adventures with Superman Season 3 release date? Given that the second season has only premiered, is likely waiting to see how well the second season performs in terms of viewership and ratings before they decide to renew the superhero series for a third season. As such, updates about a My Adventures with Superman Season 3 would likely arrive after if not once all episodes of Season 2 have rolled out. However, in a recent interview with , Jake Wyatt, the series creator, revealed that Season 3 and Season 4 have already been outlined by him and co-creator Brendan Clougher, but that he could not disclose whether the two seasons have been greenlit. My Adventures with Superman’s voice cast includes , Alice Lee, Ishmel Sahid, Darrell Brown, Joel de la Fuente, Debra Wilson, Azuri Hardy-Jones, Chris Parnell, and Jake Green. Where is My Adventures with Superman Season 3 coming out? This is because the first and second season’s episodes premiered on both Adult Swim and HBO Max. Assuming a pattern repetition, My Adventures with Superman Season 3 could also come out on the same platforms.

        "description": "Only 22,000 lifts in city are fitted with voltage dip mitigation devices allowing them to resume operations after self-inspection, government official say.",
        "content": "Nearly 70 per cent of lifts in Hong Kong are not equipped with devices that allow them to automatically start operating after voltage dips, authorities have said, adding that installing just one in an old building costs at least HK$500,000. Chan Pak-cheung, deputy director of the Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, said on Monday that Hong Kong had 73,000 lifts but only 22,000 were fitted with voltage dip mitigation devices allowing them to resume operations after self-inspection. Lifts installed after 2009 must be equipped with such devices. “Most lifts affected by voltage issues are primarily older models operated by electronic control panels,” Chan said. “The cost of installing such devices in older lifts can potentially be over HK$500,000 for a single one.” The meeting also discussed whether a penalty mechanism should be added to the regulatory regime of CLP Power, which supplies Kowloon, the New Territories and most outlying islands, when voltage dips occurred. Last month, a lightning-induced high-voltage equipment failure at Black Point Power Station in Tuen Mun caused two consecutive voltage dips, leaving 152 people stranded in lifts and triggering 16 fire alarms. A week earlier, a hill fire in Yuen Long affected overhead cables resulting in 52 lift entrapments. In January, cable faults caused voltage dips and energy disruptions in Tsing Yi on two occasions. Panel chairman Edward Lau Kwok-fan and legislator Benson Luk Hon-man expressed concerns over whether authorities would help to speed up installations and the power giant would help financially to prevent lift entrapments during voltage dips. CLP Power managing director Joseph Law Ka-chun said the firm had been providing free consultations to more than 100 housing estates and customers about mitigation devices, with more than half having adopted its suggestions in the past three years. “We are currently actively engaged with the lift and property management industries, and relevant government departments to develop a feasible solution. If this solution can be implemented for older lifts, it will address the root cause effectively.” An existing penalty mechanism only covers full scale power outages, with electricity providers paying fines based on the duration and the number of people affected. Legislator Lo Wai-kwok acknowledged voltage dips were unavoidable due to factors such as adverse weather and opposed imposing penalties in such incidents, while Michael Tien Puk-sun said voltage dip incidents caused by human error should be fined. Undersecretary for Environment and Ecology Diane Wong Shuk-han said officials had already met CLP Power and proposed incorporating a punitive framework for major voltage dip incidents into the scheme of control regulatory agreement, which the firm was still considering.",

        "description": "More than six months after a study of abuse in the Catholic Church, officials on Monday announced the status of planned measures. There is nothing concrete yet – “there are still many unanswered questions,” they said. For those affected, progress is too slow. \"We are not making as much progress as would be desirable or necessary,\" Joseph Bonnemain, Bishop of Chur and head of the Bishops' Conference, admitted to the media in Zurich on Monday. “However, intensive work has been done over the past six months.” Stefan Loppacher, the prevention officer for the diocese of Chur, added that it would take time to introduce measures nationwide. He cited federalism and differences in language and culture, as well as different church structures. In order to guarantee independent counselling for victims, church organisations are now in talks with the state-recognised victim counselling centres. For example, it needs to be clarified how their additional work will be compensated, Loppacher continued.",
        "content": "“We are not making as much progress as would be desirable or necessary,” Joseph Bonnemain, Bishop of Chur and head of the Bishops’ Conference, admitted to the media in Zurich on Monday. “However, intensive work has been done over the past six months.” Stefan Loppacher, the prevention officer for the diocese of Chur, added that it would take time to introduce measures nationwide. He cited federalism and differences in language and culture, as well as different church structures. In order to guarantee independent counselling for victims, church organisations are now in talks with the state-recognised victim counselling centres. For example, it needs to be clarified how their additional work will be compensated, Loppacher continued. The first decisions on the contact centre are to be made in June. Vreni Peterer criticised the fact that nothing further has been done so far. The president of the interest group for people affected by abuse in the church (Miku) said during an interview that, for example, the group had still not received any support months after the study. “Many of those affected are contacting the association to talk about their experiences for the first time,” said Peterer. “We have to bridge the gap until we finally have help centres.” In addition, there are still people affected who do not receive a response to their report. “They don’t even get a confirmation that their email has been received.” Bonnemain acknowledged that individual measures in a diocese could probably be implemented more quickly. But he was convinced that what was needed now were broad-based measures that would apply uniformly across the country. Victim counselling, reporting offices, and case processing should be offered separately and done more professionally. The church’s internal reporting and intervention structures are inadequate in various respects. As announced, the Catholic Church also wants to introduce the requirement for priests, deacons, and members of religious orders to undergo psychological assessments as part of their training. In addition, the entire personnel department is to be professionally reorganised. Furthermore, all church leaders leading dioceses, regional churches, and religious congregations have made a written commitment not to destroy any more files in connection with cases of abuse in future, contrary to the requirements of church law. The Church must confront its misconduct seriously, stated Abbot Peter von Sury of the association of religious communities in Switzerland, KOVOS. This was in order to do justice to those affected and prevent future abuse. The report from last September was shocking, added Roland Loos, President of the association of Roman-Catholic cantonal church organisations of central Switzerland, RKZ. However, he now feels optimistic. While it is understandable that those affected want to see more rapid progress, far-reaching changes are possible. However, these will take time. Last September, the University of Zurich published a study on the extent of sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church since the middle of the 20th century. The study showed that priests and members of religious orders in Switzerland had committed over 1,000 cases of sexual abuse since 1950, although the number of unreported cases is likely to be high. At the presentation of the report, the Church announced it would take measures against sexual abuse and its cover-up. Adapted from German by DeepL/dkk/ac",

        "content": "Karnataka Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre said the state government will foot the Rs 80 lakh bill of PM Modi's stay at the Radisson Blu Plaza during his Mysuru visit in April last year. Published: May 27, 2024 7:00 PM IST By Recently, a row erupted after news broke that the hotel where PM Modi had stayed had threatened legal action to recover its dues, over a year after the bill, which runs up to Rs 80 lakh, remained unpaid. In a statement on Monday, Karnataka Forest Minister Eshwar Khandre said the state government will foot the bill of Modi’s stay and said efforts are being made to resolve the matter in an amicable manner. “The state government’s forest department had written to them (authority). They informed that the hotel bill (Rs 80 lakh) should be reimbursed by the state government and we have decided to reimburse. So, there is no issue,” he added. As per the statement, Khandre said it a state government tradition to host dignitaries like the Prime Minister and the President when they come. But due to Assembly elections in Karnataka in April last year, the state government was not involved in planning of the programme (Project Tiger) since Model Code of Conduct (MCC) was in force. Talking to reporters, the Karnataka Minister said that PM Modi had visited Myrusu-Bandipur on the eve of commemoration of 50 years of Project Tiger, but the state government was not involved in the planning of the event as MCC was in force. Hence, it was purely a Central government programme. “Initially, they had planned to spend around Rs 3 crore but the expenditure incurred was around 6.33 crore. So, balance 3.3 crore has to come from the National Tiger Conservation Authority,” he said. For breaking news and live news updates, like us on or follow us on and . Read more on Latest on .

Omana was in the washroom outside her house in the early morning hours, when the culprit ambushed her with the chill powder. The man was wearing a mask to veil his face and Omana screamed in fear. The other members couldn't come out of the house as the culprit had already tampered with the lock of the main door. At this time, he snatched away the gold necklace from the woman’s neck and fled away.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Beer Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. History Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. Food For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Art Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Outdoor recreation Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Sports and festivals Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Beer Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. History Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. Food For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Art Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Outdoor recreation Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Sports and festivals Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore.

Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture.

        "description": "The Republican National Convention in July is but one of the attractions drawing visitors to Wisconsin's largest city, where there's more than beer and cheese.",
        "content": "You might say Wisconsin’s largest city is having a moment. But that’s probably not accurate as it’s surely more than just a moment. Milwaukee, with a population of about 560,000, is a big enough city to have world-class attractions but small enough to make it easy to get around. It’s currently in the spotlight for a host of reasons. The big news is the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Milwaukee July 15-18, bringing an estimated 50,000 visitors, including international journalists for the four-day event. Shortly before the RNC, the city’s annual three-weekend music extravaganza, Summerfest, is likely to draw more than 600,000 to the Lake Michigan shore. And the week after the convention, 80,000 people are expected for Harley-Davidson’s annual Homecoming festival, July 25-28, with big-name entertainers. And then there’s the television show. Bravo’s reality series “Top Chef” was filmed in Milwaukee and other Wisconsin spots last year and began airing its 14 weekly episodes on March 20. Viewers get a big dose of Wisconsin landscapes, history and culture along with the food porn. Yes, this city on the shores of Lake Michigan is getting a lot of attention. Here are some of the reasons why, and ideas that might draw you to visit before, during or after these big events. Long known as Brew City (that German influence), 27 breweries operate in Milwaukee. That compares with more than 40 breweries tapping kegs back in the 1860s. Of those 40, four are still around: Blatz, Pabst, Miller and Schlitz, once the largest beer producer in the U.S. and known as “the beer that made Milwaukee famous.” Hanging out at Lakefront Brewery, especially after a stroll along the Milwaukee RiverWalk, is a great way to spend some time. Sample the gold-medal winning RiverWest Stein, an amber lager, alongside some tasty fried cheese curds. Head to 3rd Street Market Hall to check out City Fountain, a self-serve indoor beer garden where you can sample as much or as little as you like of some of Wisconsin’s best beer. You’re charged by the ounce. There are all kinds of beer tours available in Milwaukee and its surrounding areas. Find the one that’s right for you at visitmilwaukee.org . And if visiting breweries and taverns isn’t enough to get your beer fix, consider this: the Brewhouse Inn and Suites is a 90-room boutique hotel constructed on the site of the historic Pabst brewery. The rooms are arranged around a central courtyard housing huge copper brewing kettles. Milwaukee’s history is alive and on full display in so many ways. When European immigrants began arriving in the United States in large numbers after 1850, Milwaukee was the destination for Germans. Today, the city’s brewing industry, its tradition of ethnic festivals and a few Gilded Age mansions are part of that German tradition that visitors can explore. It was in the 1890s that teenager William Harley met Arthur Davidson in a Milwaukee neighborhood. Shortly after the turn of the century, they produced the first Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Today, that history is examined at one of the city’s biggest tourist destinations, the Harley-Davidson Museum . It’s a 20-acre complex with retail stores, restaurants and two floors of memorabilia. A more traditional history tour is at the Pabst Mansion , where programs help tell the history of brewing, art and architecture of the time with the impressive Gilded Age mansion from which Frederick Pabst ran the brewery. For so long, Milwaukee has been famous for brats, cheese and frozen custard. That’s still true, and make sure to sample some of those stomach pleasers. (Leon’s is my favorite for custard.) But there’s much more to the Milwaukee food scene, which is getting lots of attention thanks in part to “Top Chef.” Do your own research to find what tempts you most, but here are a few restaurants I recommend for can’t-miss dining experiences. DanDan, described as American-Chinese cuisine, is helmed by “Top Chef” contestant Dan Jacobs. His Happy Chicken is a dish to remember, spicy, crispy and flavorful. I would go back just for that. At Birch, the farm-to-table menu from chef Kyle Knall drew the attention of the New York Times, ranking it one of the Top 50 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023. The ember-roasted walleye, wood-roasted pork chop and ricotta-filled pasta are standouts. The Diplomat, a cozy neighborhood spot where chef Dane Baldwin claimed a James Beard Award in 2022, offers approachable, shareable plates. Outstanding ingredients and interesting combinations elevate simple dishes. The Knife & Fork Chicken and the Diplomac prime beef burger are popular choices. Milwaukee is not shy in the outdoor mural category, but what might make it different from other cities is that many pieces focus on beer and sports. For architecture fans, a visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Burnham Block is a must. It’s the renowned architect’s collection of affordable housing units and is open to the public on most Saturdays. Tours often sell out, so plan in advance . But the indisputable star in this category is the Milwaukee Art Museum , known as much for its collections and exhibits as for its architecture. Designed by famed Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the main building perches next to Lake Michigan like a bird, or a boat, or a sail, and has become a city landmark. Four floors with more than 40 galleries display a broad collection with pieces ranging from ancient decorative arts to Renaissance paintings and documentary photography. There’s also a large collection of works from German artists. Though Milwaukee has the amenities of a big city, outdoor recreation is also plentiful. During summer, Bradford Beach is a popular destination. It’s a wide, sandy expanse along Lake Michigan where volleyball leagues share the sand with sunbathers. It’s just a short drive from downtown. There’s 135 miles of paved trails looping around Milwaukee County. Check out the 2-mile Seven Bridges Trail in nearby South Milwaukee. It crosses bridges and stairways built by the Works Progress Administration almost 100 years ago through ravines along Lannon stone paths. Veterans Park, also along the lakefront, is a destination for kite flyers, kayakers and standup paddle boarders. There’s a kite store on site and a company that rents kayaks and standup paddle boards. Those water activities are also available on the city’s rivers. Milwaukee is a huge sports town and in summer a trip to American Family Field to watch the Brewers play baseball is a must. New this year at the field is an annex of the 3rd Street Market Hall. So along with your brats and beer, you can nosh on empanadas and crab Rangoon while watching the game and the sausage mascot races at the bottom of the sixth inning. Milwaukee is known as the city of festivals with nearly 100 on the calendar for events in and around the city. Many celebrate the cultures of the immigrants who shaped the city. Others celebrate food and art. There’s even the Weird Fest, which seems to be mostly about beer, so that’s not really too weird for Milwaukee. Terri Colby is a freelancer.",

        "description": "The resolution he explained, had paved the way for the return of Emirates Airlines to Nigerian skies.The post Nigeria, Saudi Arabia To Resume Cargo Flights- Keyamo appeared first on Channels Television.",
        "content": "The Minister of Aviation, Festus Keyamo, has hinted at plans for the resumption of cargo flights between Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. Keyamo while reeling out the achievements of the aviation sector at the 3rd ministerial updates on Monday in Abuja, said the feat would be achieved through collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). According to Keyamo, the decision was finalised during a recent visit to Saudi Arabia, where he met with his counterpart. “I have good news for you from Saudi Arabia. I met my counterpart in Saudi Arabia and we have agreed to resume cargo flights,” Keyamo stated. He highlighted that these flights had been suspended for an extended period but with the new agreement, cargo services would be restored to boost trade and logistical connections between the two nations. Keyamo also addressed another critical issue on Monday concerning the clearance of foreign airlines’ funds trapped in Nigeria. Keyamo added that the Federal Government has also ensured the clearance of a longstanding backlog of trapped funds for foreign airlines hence the return of Emirates Airlines to Nigerian skies. This, he noted, has positively impacted the financial stability of the aviation industry. Emirates announced on May 16, 2024, its plans to recommence flights to Nigerian airports starting from October 1, 2024, after a long break from Nigeria. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had in January said the Federal Government had “concluded the payment of all verified claims’’ by foreign airlines with the payment of an additional $64.44m to concerned airlines. The development had brought the total verified amount paid to the air transport sector to $136.73m, adding that “all the verified airline claims had now been cleared.”",

        "content": "Dinner couldn’t be simpler than this do-it-yourself array of food. It’s a fun, interactive way to enjoy a fresh and simple meal: Arrange all the components on a platter and let everyone assemble their own dish. A zesty marinade and creamy tzatziki do the heavy lifting in this recipe, infusing the chicken with juicy flavor, lemony citrus and a kick of spice. Cutting the chicken in chunks and threading them on skewers provides more surface area for the meat to soak in the marinade and creates lots of little edges to crisp while grilling. Tzatziki, a garlicky Greek yogurt-and-cucumber sauce, provides a slick of creaminess to the chicken and pita. While you can stuff the ingredients into pita pockets, you can also eat them deconstructed. Simply assemble everything on a bed of crisp greens and call it a salad for dinner. If you have a grill, use it to cook the chicken and warm the pita. It’s nearly summer, so now is the time to move the living outdoors. Serves 4 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut in 2-inch pieces Butter lettuce leaves 2 vine-ripened tomatoes, sliced 1 small red onion, halved and thinly sliced Fresh mint leaves Pita bread, grilled or warmed Marinade: 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 3 garlic cloves, minced or pushed through a press Juice of one lemon 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Tzatziki: 11⁄4 cups whole-milk Greek yogurt 1/2 English cucumber, seeded, finely diced 2 garlic cloves, minced or pushed through a press 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, finely chopped 2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill fronds 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper Combine the marinade ingredients in a large bowl. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 6 hours. Combine the tzatziki ingredients in a bowl and refrigerate until use. If using bamboo skewers, pre-soak them in warm water for 30 minutes. Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and thread on metal or bamboo skewers. Discard any remaining marinade. Prepare the grill for direct cooking over medium heat. Lightly oil the grill grates. Grill the skewers over direct heat until the chicken is cooked through the center and well-marked, turning once or twice, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the grill and let rest for 2 to 3 minutes. If using an oven, heat to 425 degrees. Arrange the skewers on a rack placed over a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until golden brown in spots and cooked through the centers, turning once, about 25 minutes. Slide the chicken off the skewers onto a serving platter. Serve the chicken with lettuce, tomatoes, onion, mint leaves, pita bread and the tzatziki sauce.

        "content": "An Irish priest has said Bambie Thug was “an excellent choice” for the Eurovision Song Contest, and “a better ambassador for modern Ireland could hardly have been found”. This does not appear to have been intended as a compliment, however, as Fr Brendan Kilcoyne added that neither the non-binary performer nor modern Ireland had “a bull’s clue” where they’re going. He said Bambie Thug was a “perfect” representative for the competition because the singer “sums up modern Ireland in its tragedy”. “Modern Ireland hasn’t a bull’s clue where it’s going; Miss Thug hasn’t a bull’s clue where she’s going,” said Fr Kilcoyne, who is a parish priest in Balla, Co Mayo . READ MORE: Eurovision finalist Bambie Thug planning 'world domination' after being compared to Lady Gaga READ MORE: Andrew Tate brands Bambie Thug 'stupid' and 'a loser' in shocking social media tirade “Modern Ireland has lost its faith and found superstition; La Thug has lost her faith and found superstition. Modern Ireland is technically very accomplished... Miss Thug is technically accomplished and very good at what she does. “So you have a very high level of technical accomplishment and absolutely no clue, no sense of long-term coordinates, no map for the future except for some sort of vague, half-digested notion of witchcraft,” he added. \"I mean, come on, Bambie. Real witches would bully you.” The priest made the comments on a video posted on YouTube as part of his own podcast series called The Brendan Option . Addressing the fact that he was ‘misgendering’ the non-binary artist throughout the video, Fr Kilcoyne said: “Am I misgendering? Isn’t that bold? You’re not allowed to do that anymore. I suppose I’ll be banned.” He said Bambie Thug “seems actually a lovely person in other ways”, adding: “It’s a pity.” “Strictly speaking, I should be referring to Miss Thug as ‘them’ and ‘they’... Our name is legion, for we are many,” he said, quoting the response of a man possessed by spirits in the Bible when asked his name by Jesus Christ. “Listen to me, there has to be a better way than this. But, given that this is where we are, I don’t see any reason to complain about Bambie Thug or that act. I think it was a perfect representation for modern Ireland. “Maybe even an act like Bambie Thug, maybe even that indicates some residual unwillingness to let go of the spiritual quest... there is good here. It’s quite convincingly disguised, but there is good here,” he added. “The true face of modern Ireland was shown to the world. I think that’s the best thing to come out of this.

        "content": "Early introduction of peanuts in infants leads to a 71% reduction in adolescent peanut allergy risk, a groundbreaking study reveals. Introducing peanuts into infants’ diets from as early as four months has been shown to significantly reduce the likelihood of developing a peanut allergy in adolescence, a long-term study from King’s College London reveals. The study confirms that early and regular peanut consumption lowers the risk of allergy by 71% compared to avoidance. Feeding children peanuts regularly from infancy to age five reduced the rate of peanut allergy in adolescence by 71%, even after many years when the children ate or avoided peanuts as desired. The new findings provide conclusive evidence that introducing peanuts into babies’ diets early will achieve long-term prevention of peanut allergy. Importance of Early Introduction Lead investigator Professor Gideon Lack from King’s College London said: “Decades of advice to avoid peanuts has made parents fearful of introducing peanuts at an early age. The evidence is clear that the early introduction of peanuts in infancy induces long-term tolerance and protects children from allergies well into adolescence. This simple intervention will make a remarkable difference to future generations and see peanut allergies plummet.” LEAP-Trio Trial Findings Results from the LEAP-Trio trial are published today (May 27) in the NEJM Evidence by researchers from King’s College London and sponsored and co-funded by the US National Institutes of Health ’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Peanut allergy is rising in Western countries. The prevalence of peanut allergy is about 2% in young children in North America, UK, Western Europe, and Australia. For some, even small amounts of peanuts can lead to a life-threatening allergic reaction. This, as well as conflicting advice, has made parents and caregivers fearful of introducing peanuts into diets. Building on Previous Research The new research findings come from the LEAP-Trio study, building on the results of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) clinical trial. In the first trial, half of the participants were asked to regularly consume peanuts from infancy until age 5 years, while the other half were asked to avoid peanuts during that period. Researchers found that early introduction of peanuts reduced the risk of peanut allergy at age 5 by 81%. Long-Term Follow-Up Results The investigators followed up both groups from age 6 to age 12 or older. In that period, children could choose to eat peanuts in whatever amount and frequency they wanted. They found that 15.4% of participants from the early childhood peanut-avoidance group and 4.4% from the early childhood peanut-consumption group had peanut allergy at age 12 or older. These results show that regular, early peanut consumption reduce the risk of peanut allergy in adolescence by 71% compared to early peanut avoidance. Implementation of Early Peanut Introduction Professor George Du Toit, Co-Lead Investigator from King’s College London said: “This is a safe and highly effective intervention which can be implemented as early as 4 months of age. The infant needs to be developmentally ready to start weaning and peanuts should be introduced as a soft pureed paste or as peanut puffs.” Study Methodology and Implications The researchers also found that although participants in the LEAP peanut-consumption group ate more peanuts throughout childhood than the other participants overall, the frequency and amount of peanuts consumed varied widely in both groups and included periods of not eating peanuts. This shows that the protective effect of early peanut consumption lasts without the need to consistently eat peanut products throughout childhood and early adolescence. The LEAP-Trio study team tested the adolescents for peanut allergy primarily through an oral food challenge. This involved giving participants gradually increasing amounts of peanuts in a carefully controlled setting to determine if they could safely consume at least 5 grams of peanuts, the equivalent of more than 20 peanuts. The study team also surveyed participants about their recent patterns of peanut consumption and verified the self-reports through measurements of peanuts in dust from participants’ beds, a technique previously validated by LEAP investigators. Professor Lack, who is the Head of the Children’s Allergy Service at Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, added: “Early consumption of peanuts will prevent more than 100,000 new cases of peanut allergy every year worldwide.” Reference: 27 May 2024, NEJM Evidence .",

        "content": "LIMERICK recorded a ten-point victory over Waterford on a final scoreline of 2-14 to 0-30 in round five of the Munster Senior Hurling Championship on Sunday afternnon at the TUS Gaelic Grounds. Limerick now face Clare in the Munster Senior Hurling Championship final on Sunday June 9 at 4pm in Semple Stadium, Thurles. Limerick's second half performance On 55 minutes the game was in the melting pot when Waterford substitute Patrick Fitzgerald sent over a point to have Waterford trailing by two points 2-13 to 0-21. In the final quarter final Limerick outscored their opponents 0-09 to 0-01 with Aaron Gillane, Shane O'Brien, Diarmaid Byrnes, Conor Boylan, Gearoid Hegarty, Cian Lynch and Adam English all on target for John Kiely's side in a comprehensive victory in the end. The strength of Limerick's bench Seamus Flanagan was forced off on 20 minutes with a hamstring injury. Limerick U20 star Shane O'Brien replaced the full forward where he made his championship debut chipping in with three points from play. Conor Boylan and Adam English have made significant impacts throughout the Munster Championship and both players were off the mark for the Shannonsiders in the final quarter. Limerick's shooting The most remarkable statistic from Limerick's victory is that the reigning All-Ireland champions managed to get 49 shots off but the one concern for John Kiely is that his side registered 19 wides. In the opening period, Limerick were using the strong breeze to their advantage but 14 of their wides came in the first half and Limerick will be looking for an improvement on their accuracy in front of goal heading into the Munster decider. Limerick and Clare renew their rivalry Limerick and Clare will face off in the Munster Senior Hurling Championship final for the third year in a row. There has been nothing between the sides in the last two years, in 2022 Limerick came out on top by three points on a final scoreline of 1-29 to 0-29 after extra time. Last year's final in the TUS Gaelic Grounds was similar where Limerick defeated the Banner county by the minimum. The clash between the counties on June 9 will be no different.",

        "content": "Sometime this week, it appears, the infamous Abuja light rail will thunder into life. Again. Perhaps for a year or two. According to Nyesom Wike, the Federal Capital Territory(FCT) Minister, the new tape-cutting will be undertaken by President Bola Tinubu in celebration of his first anniversary in office. To that extent, I am in full approval, as his government needs to show something for its presence. It is ironic that for this, the APC government owes its gratitude to Mr. Wike, a PDP mainstreamer, but these are desperate times. APC ought simply to have announced that the train services were being restored and left it at that. In July 2018, the service was loudly inaugurated by the fake anti-corruption leader from Daura, who then sat back in the same city and watched it go out of service and into decay. When the service resumes, for the few in Abuja who can take advantage of it, the ruling party will have plenty to be grateful to the opposing PDP for, including what Minister Wike described as the building of access roads to the train stops. It would be remembered that last October, the government approved N5.9 billion for the construction of those roads, which was apparently quickly undertaken, although it is unclear where they are, how the contractors obtained and completed the jobs so quickly, or what standards they met. Wike also identified design omissions he had inherited in the rail system, such as escalators and elevators, and waiting room air-conditioning, but observed that they will not hinder the resumption of services. The Minister also announced large savings in training costs, telling journalists last week: “Before we came, the former administration approved $128 million for the training of our people by CCECC for 29 months, and we said no, that’s very exorbitant. We renegotiated with CCECC, and now it has been brought down to $75 million. We have saved no less than $53 million for the government.” These issues are critical to understanding the hollowness of governance in Nigeria, not simply our infrastructure chaos. In a previous article, I drew attention to the reckless spending in the rail sector during the Buhari years, including the Abuja light rail. As part of that story, I provided evidence that in addition to the $823m spent on the abandoned Phase I, the Buhari government in May 2017 also signed a contract worth US$1.473 billion with the Board of Directors of China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC), the parent company of CCECC, for Phase II. Indeed, two months earlier, the then-FCT Minister, Mohammed Bello, had announced that the China Exim Bank would bankroll Phase II for $1.79bn. Phase II was also to be completed in 54 months: that is, in 2021, two years before Buhari was due to be separated from the presidency. Characteristically, he neither delivered nor ever mentioned it again. As one who has kept a close eye on the rail file, I believe this to be deliberate. The Buhari government had neither the intention nor the capacity to advance the sector beyond politics. That is why projects and contracts got bandied around so much, particularly by Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi, a man who advertised how much he did not like money. Maybe he did not. The alternative is that he was incompetent and complicit. Of his tenure, in 2019 I penned Infrastructure Games I and II, which partly explored his, and his government’s, inconsistencies. In the closing years of the Buhari presidency, they also spawned such headlines as: “Lack of funds halts Eastern railway project —FG,” (The Primanews, December 2022); “Lack Of Funds Stalls N16tr Railway Projects Across Nigeria,” (Daily Trust, September 2023); and “Poor Funding Model, Paucity, Stall $3.2bn Eastern Rail Project Three Years After,” (The Guardian, April 2024). But none of this was true: it was the government, not an absence of funding or of prospective funders, that had grounded infrastructure development. Governments, government officials, their families and cronies did not lack funds to live in luxury, including through the fleecing of their offices, it was when it came to service or telling the truth that there was a problem. And there was a problem with funding infrastructure, particularly rail, as loan negotiations with China had ground to a halt in the early months of Buhari’s arrival. According to the story, the Chinese government, reportedly concerned about the fast-fingers of Nigerian officials, was insisting that for Nigeria to obtain any more loans, it must concede their supervision to Chinese officials. That story was broken by The Guardian in August 2016, and it meant that for the entirety of the Buhari Years, the speeches its officials made about loan arrangements and expectations with China were patently false. It was why the government was floundering all over, and back to Beijing. Some areas of the rail file got so messy that on many occasions, beginning as early as November 2016, National Assembly committees commenced investigation of Mr. Amaechi, but none of them yielded anything. Frustrated newspaper editors agonized about both trade and politics. How did the Buhari government respond? It maintained a straight face, told more robust lies, and issued more contracts as time ran out, including, in February 2022, a $329 million in consultancy fees “for the supervision of the various railway projects in the country.” Three hundred and twenty-nine million, not for a rail project, but for “consultancy supervision.” That was the scenario in which Buhari’s Abuja light rail of 2018 collapsed in 2020 and the country was strewn with a litany of broken infrastructure promises as he departed. When Mr. Tinubu congratulates himself on the re-completion and re-inauguration of Phase I of the Abuja rail then, he must remember to unveil Phase II. It is inconceivable that a project that was supposed to have been completed three years ago is hiding in the open. What does the future hold? If it is to endure, the government must set up appropriate structures and hand the project over to experts who know what it is to run a light rail facility. The good folks at the Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) are already out of their depth using bottles to supply diesel to trains in dangerous forests and leaves to try to stop engine fires. In a riveting story last year, rail expert Rowland Ataguba, a member of the NRC, offered a penetrating analysis of ‘The Trouble With ‘Abuja Light Rail.’ If we are not to be back here within a couple of years trying to restart Phase I of this novel rail system, the government must put it in the hands of such people and step back. Already, we have become the laughing-stock of the travel world, Bloomberg last year calling the Abuja light rail a ‘ghost train’ and the ‘latest example of empty promises in Nigeria.’ The two rail-track “security contracts” the Buhari government issued in 2022 for $1.7m expire three months from now, and that government never obeyed a court order to account for its predecessors’CCTV scams between 2004 and 2013. In other words, apart from when Tinubu and Wike ride the rail, the system will be defenceless from Day One.",

        "description": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas.",
        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "description": "Emergency family shelters will cost the county $34 million this year, part of a nearly $200 million homelessness prevention and housing stability effort.",
        "content": "Imani Swinney moved to Minneapolis last year at the urging of her mother, who told her that the resources available in the city gave her a better shot at getting back on her feet. Swinney and her two young daughters were \"couch hopping,\" living with family and friends in North Carolina, when she decided to make the cross-country move to start over. At first, they lived with Swinney's mom and friends. But last summer, they ended up in an emergency shelter for homeless families funded by Hennepin County at the Holiday Inn in Bloomington. Once there, Swinney was surprised at how quickly county social workers helped her find income and food assistance. By fall, the family moved into a new apartment, and in the following months, Swinney got her driver's license back, bought a car, finished school and landed a job. \"You've got them by a landslide,\" Swinney said of the help available to families in Minnesota compared with some other states. In recent years, Hennepin County has helped hundreds of families like Swinney's escape homelessness and find stable housing. County leaders say this is one of the last places in the U.S. that promises to house all families with children — no matter the cost. David Hewitt, human services director for housing stability, said he summarizes the policy enacted in 2005 as \"no child sleeps outside.\" County leaders acknowledge that people from other parts of Minnesota, other states and outside the U.S. have come to Hennepin County because of the strong safety net. Still, county officials don't want to be the homeless shelter for other communities, so staffers work to determine which jurisdictions are financially responsible for those seeking help. That can be difficult, especially for people from other states or countries. County Commissioner Jeffrey Lunde said other communities may have \"quietly rolled up their 'All Are Welcome' flags and put them back in the garage\" but Hennepin County continues to provide shelter to everyone it can help. Keeping up with the demand has been increasingly challenging — and costly. The need for family shelter space surged after the eviction moratorium implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic ended in 2022 and filings reached record highs. A growing number of new arrivals from outside the U.S. further strained the system this winter, pushing occupancy rates of county shelters to 427% of their capacity. In February, more than half the families in the shelters were recent immigrants. To cover the growing costs, the County Board in March unanimously approved $9.6 million in additional spending, pushing the budget for family shelters to $34 million for 2024. In April, the board agreed to spend up to $9,000 a month for a \"safe space,\" which opened in December, that can serve as an overflow shelter when demand spikes. County leaders rely on a mix of local, state and federal dollars to pay their homelessness prevention efforts. They partner with cities like Minneapolis and local nonprofits like Catholic Charities or People Serving People to provide shelter and services. But funding for homeless shelters has typically fallen to local communities and charities. State support recently grew from $7 million to $22 million annually, but it still doesn't come close to meeting the demand. Hennepin County expects to spend $50 million on shelters this year; much of the money will come from local taxpayers. County officials focused a big part of federal pandemic aid on funding shelters, but that money will soon run out; officials anticipate a $13 million funding cliff in 2026. Nevertheless, commissioners have repeatedly emphasized their commitment to end chronic homelessness and improve residents' housing stability. They've successfully lobbied the state for new resources, such as more dedicated funding for shelters and rental assistance, as well as a new 0.25% sales tax for housing stability, which is expected to raise $29 million annually. \"A safe and affordable place to live is the foundation on which people build successful lives,\" County Board Chair Irene Fernando said in a statement. \"Hennepin County has a person-centered approach to providing housing, shelter and resources; our goal is to help everyone gain access to greater housing stability.\" It's not just the compassionate thing to do; it makes financial sense too, county officials said. People without shelter often end up in more costly places, like the emergency room or jail. \"All the stuff we can do to help people is much more effective if they have stable housing,\" Lunde said, noting that most people experiencing homelessness also need services for mental health, addiction and other challenges. Hennepin County's promise to shelter all families with children is just one part of Minnesota's largest homelessness prevention and housing stability program. The work has nearly $200 million in annual spending and a staff of 196 working to make homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring, while investing in more affordable housing. One of those staffers is social worker Mario A. Daniel, who works primarily with homeless young adults. On an April afternoon, Daniel checked in with clients at YouthLink in Minneapolis, which has a drop-in center with necessities like hot meals, showers and laundry as well as places to meet with counselors and other social service providers. Daniel said a big part of his job is helping clients navigate the many barriers that keep them from stable housing. A missing identification card, bad credit or a poor rental history can shut them out if they don't know how to advocate for themselves. \"Everyone needs something different,\" Daniel said, but most importantly: \"They need to realize that they deserve to have housing.\" For instance, Daniel helped Swinney sign up for income and food assistance and pay off outstanding fines so she could regain her driver's license. He also helped her and her daughters get the essentials they needed for their new apartment. \"He's always on top of stuff,\" Swinney said. \"I'm so grateful for him.\"",

The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. Damage is seen after a storm the night before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Pryor, Okla. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. A man looks at a damaged car after a tornado hit the day before, Sunday, May 26, 2024, in Valley View, Texas. Powerful storms left a wide trail of destruction Sunday across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity.

        "description": "Both Chelsea and Manchester United may be heading into a new season with a new manager as Newcastle United continue to back Eddie Howe",
        "content": "The Premier League campaign only concluded a few days ago but we're already seeing major managerial changes from some of the clubs set to do battle with Newcastle United next season. Brighton's Roberto De Zerbi opted to leave the south coast club after a disappointing campaign, before Chelsea and Mauricio Pochettino mutually agreed to part ways despite a strong end to the campaign. It also looks increasingly likely Erik ten Hag's position at Manchester United will soon be available despite an FA Cup win at the weekend. Meanwhile at Newcastle United , Eddie Howe will lead his side into next season despite a testing campaign and European disappointment. READ MORE: Eight Newcastle United stars at risk of summer exits as transfer plans take shape READ MORE: Yankuba Minteh quizzed over future as Newcastle ponder summer transfer decision Magpies co-owner Amanda Staveley raised eyebrows in 2021 when telling the world she believed Howe could become Newcastle's answer to Sir Alex Ferguson. In the cut-throat world of modern football, managers these days are lucky to last 26 weeks, never mind 26 years. Howe has an extremely long way to go to match the achievements of the Scot but behind the scenes there is major internal backing for the former Bournemouth boss. Despite a disappointing campaign on four fronts, Newcastle's ownership have resisted any urge to panic into a change in the dugout. Next season there is of course added pressure and Howe will be aware the support he currently enjoys both from the hierarchy and the fan base is not unconditional. A slow start could result in a decision being taken by Newcastle's Saudi majority owners in Riyadh. For now, it is refreshing to see 46-year-old given time to get things right. Many would not have expected such restraint from the Saudi Public Investment Fund given their vast resources and public desire to be 'number one'. Chelsea pipped Newcastle to sixth-place in the Premier League and will subsequently be playing Europa Conference League football instead of Howe's side - but that wasn't enough to salvage Poch's job. After a 12th-place finish the year before, and a barnstorming end to the season, the south American had started to win fans over. Owner Todd Boehly wasn't impressed, however, and with the two often at war in public over the direction of the club, the decision was taken to part ways. The likes of De Zerbi, Brentford's Thomas Frank and Leicester City's Enzo Maresca are all in the running to replace Pochettino. Newcastle were sandwiched in between the Blues and Manchester United in the league table, with the latter finishing eighth and therefore set to miss out on Europe until they won the FA Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Ten Hag now has two trophies in two seasons and after a plethora of injury concerns this term, has been applauded for ensuring the season ended on a high. The Glazer family and minority owners INEOS now have a decision to make. The Red Devils hierarchy are said to be considering a managerial change, with the new era at Old Trafford expected to be led by a new manager who fits the INEOS brand and philosophy. Fans, however, are backing Ten Hag to be given a third year in charge after another trophy win. Newcastle, heading into next season, must surely take solace from the fact clubs around them could be starting afresh. Chelsea under Pochettino were suddenly looking a threat once again, while it could take time for a new manager to get things going at Old Trafford with potentially only a month to strengthen the squad and prepare tactically before the start of a new Premier League campaign. Stability is the message from those in charge of Tyneside as others prove happy to chop and change. Staveley and co will be hoping their patience and support pays off with an improved showing next term.",

        "description": "Have you ever wondered how much to invest to generate a juicy passive-income stream? Here's a rundown of three superb picks.The post Passive Income: How Much to Invest to Get $5,000 Each Year appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "Have you ever wondered how much passive income you’ll need? Figuring out how much to invest today to get a decent return tomorrow is a question that baffles many investors. Fortunately, it’s not as hard as it sounds, but there are two more important points to answer first than how much to invest. Those questions are to invest and to start investing. Let’s try to answer them all. There’s no shortage of great long-term stocks on the market right now. Some of the best stocks on the market can provide a reliable passive income today while providing ample growth tomorrow. To meet that goal, there are three stocks for investors to consider: ( ), ( ), and ( ). Each of these three stocks caters to a specific area of the market. Additionally, they can provide both growth and defensive appeal to investors. Fortis is one of the largest utilities in North America. It generates a reliable and recurring revenue stream backed by decades-long regulated contracts. This fact alone makes it one of the most defensive offerings on the market. Fortis is also incredibly reliable as an income stock. The company has provided an insane 50 consecutive years of dividend increases, making it an ideal buy-and-forget candidate. CIBC is one of Canada’s . It too has a wide defensive moat thanks to its sprawling domestic segment. Bank stocks like CIBC also boast long-term stable growth and a very juicy yield, which is well-covered and growing. CIBC also has an international segment, which includes operations within the United States. This helps to the bank outside of its core domestic operations, making it a superb long-term pick. SmartCentres is the third option to consider. SmartCentres is a retail-anchored real estate investment trust (REIT), which boasts a massive footprint across the country. The REIT also boasts an impressive tenant list, which includes some of the largest names in retail and finance. Finally, unlike the other two stocks mentioned above, SmartCentres also boasts a predictable distribution. In short, all three stocks provide a unique perspective and opportunity. So, let’s now turn to when and then how much to invest. There is no time like the present when it comes to finding a time to start investing. And despite the market being on a tear this year, the three stocks I mentioned are trading down over longer terms. Fortis is a superb example. Despite being a great long-term defensive pick, the utility stock is down over 14% in the trailing two-year period. That drop is largely attributed to rising interest rates and not a reflection of the company’s performance. The same can be said for CIBC. The bank stock trades down nearly 5% over that same two-year period and for the same interest rate-fueled reason. We can see a steeper long-term dip with SmartCentres. And unlike Fortis and CIBC, that dip extends to this year. Over the prior two-year period, the stock has dipped a whopping 22%. As a result, the REIT’s distribution has swelled to 8.17%. The key takeaway for investors is that these individual stocks, which offer juicy yields and long-term growth, still trade at a discount over the longer term. This makes them superb options to buy right now and hold for a longer term. Finally, we come to how much to invest. If our goal is to reach the coveted $5,000 per year level, we can handily reach (if not surpass) this level by dropping $30,000 into each investment. Keep in mind that prospective investors don’t need $90,000 right now. Investing is a long-term game. Investors can and add what they can to their nest egg over a longer timeframe. Doing so allows your portfolio to grow on autopilot, thanks to dividend reinvestments. In my opinion, the three stocks mentioned above are great options for any long-term income-producing portfolio. Buy them, hold them, and watch them grow.",

        "description": "County officials focus on making homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring, while investing in affordable housing.",
        "content": "Hennepin County has the largest homelessness prevention and housing stability effort in Minnesota, working to shelter thousands of people each year and hopefully get them into permanent housing. The county has nearly 200 people working on homelessness and housing stability and will spend nearly $200 million in local, state and federal dollars in 2024. A new 0.25% sales tax approved by the Legislature will raise about $29 million annually for rental assistance and affordable housing. The county partners with cities and local nonprofits to provide shelter and other services to residents experiencing homelessness or housing instability. Hennepin County leaders say they are one of the last jurisdictions in the U.S. that promises to shelter all families with children so no child sleeps outside. \"We believe that homelessness is unacceptable and that government can do something about it,\" said David Hewitt, human services director for housing stability. \"This crisis is very visible. The successes are, almost by nature, invisible because it is people, in their homes, doing OK.\" The county's work has grown considerably since the coronavirus pandemic, when a combination of financial, health and social factors pushed many residents to the edge or over it. Last year, 9,000 people found shelter in the 13 year-round facilities the county funds. Other shelters come online in winter months when demand for space spikes. In 2023, county workers helped 2,171 people who were homeless transition into permanent housing. That was a 18% increase over 2022 and a 57% jump since 2021. County leaders focus on making homelessness rare, brief and nonrecurring; a popular approach with state and local governments across the U.S. Supplementing that work are ongoing investments to create and preserve affordable housing. Here's the focus of each of those efforts: Rare: With a staff of 31 and budget of $19 million, the aim of this team is to help residents keep the housing they have already. That means providing emergency rental assistance or connecting tenants facing eviction with lawyers for housing court. Staffers also help residents with unstable housing find temporary solutions so they don't have to go to a shelter. \"We are here to advocate for you,\" said Brittani Walker, a case management assistant. \"A lot of people are scared and don't know where to go.\" Brief: This team of 120 with a budget of $46 million works to get people who are living outside, in shelters or in unstable housing into a permanent place to live. Anyone who interacts with a county social worker at a shelter or an encampment can have their name and contact information entered into a database. A case worker will reach out to get them into permanent housing as quickly as possible. \"We work with people where they're at,\" said Phyllissha Butler, a supervisor for the youth homeless to housing team. She added that unhoused clients almost always face multiple challenges that contributed to why they lost their homes including mental health problems, substance abuse and financial challenges. \"We are looking to break down any barriers they have to housing,\" she said. Nonrecurring: A team of 18 with a budget of $103 million is focused on keeping people who have struggled with homelessness in permanent housing. Clients receive housing aid, which in February helped 2,300 households pay rent, and have a case worker who helps them avoid the problems that contributed to their housing instability. Nathan Nyren, a housing support program manager, said one of the biggest challenges is finding landlords who will rent to people who were homeless or have a criminal record. The housing aid is typically considered an ongoing income supplement, but sometimes the help is time limited. Nyren says providing rental assistance is cheaper than having homeless residents in shelters or ending up in the emergency room or jail. \"This program is saving taxpayers money,\" he said. \"Our goal is always to try to get people to be as independent as they can.\" Affordable housing: Hennepin County will invest about $23 million this year in affordable housing with plans to create about 1,000 new units. The staff of 27 works to maintain existing affordable housing and bring new units online through forgivable loans and other incentives for providers. There are also grants and assistance to help lower-income residents become homeowners. Hennepin County has a shortfall of more than 34,000 deeply affordable units for low-income residents. Nearly half of the county's tenants are cost-burdened by rent, according to the Minnesota Housing Partnership.",

        "content": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. Deadly series of storms The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Homes destroyed, roads blocked Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. Widespread power outages The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. More severe weather in forecast The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.",

        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state.

A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us .

        "content": "If you’ve considered fasting to lose weight, new research may leave you thinking twice, especially if you have heart disease or cancer. Researchers with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China studied more than 20,000 adults and found those who followed an 8-hour time-restricted eating schedule, or intermittent fasting, increased their risk of death from cardiovascular disease 91%. When compared with a standard schedule of eating throughout a 12- to 16-hour period, limiting food to 8 hours or less per day did not produce results that suggested participants would live longer. Researchers presented their findings at an American Heart Association scientific session in Chicago in March and noted that the increased risk of cardiovascular death was also seen in patients who have heart disease or cancer. They said it’s important for individuals to have a cautious, personalized approach to dietary recommendations. Source: American Heart Association Problem pregnancies weigh on kids A new study has linked health issues during pregnancy with poor heart health in children. Researchers at Ohio State University found that preeclampsia and gestational diabetes can affect the heart health of children. Pregnant women who have these conditions also have a higher risk of developing heart disease later in life. The study included more than 3,300 mother-child pairs who had enrolled in a study that examined the relationship between blood sugar and pregnancy outcomes. Researchers say the findings offer an opportunity to intervene early in childhood to help promote healthy habits. Source: Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and College of Medicine Sugary drinks and type-2 diabetes Boys who drink drinks high in sugar could be more likely to develop type-2 diabetes later in life. A new Harvard University study tracked nearly 500 Massachusetts children who were taking part in another long-term study with their mothers. Researchers kept dietary records on the participating children. In the new study, researchers looked at the average amount of sugary drinks and fruit juices they were consuming on average and compared those numbers to blood tests taken in adolescence. The researchers found that boys who consumed higher amounts of sugary drinks were more insulin-resistant. This means that muscle, fat and liver cells have a harder time taking up sugar from the blood. The boys’ blood sugar levels were also higher. However, girls did not experience the same risks as boys and experienced only a small increase in their blood sugar levels, researchers found. Source: Harvard Medical School Walking the walk of cognitive decline How easily a person stands and walks can be an early indicator of whether that individual may experience cognitive decline. Researchers from Florida Atlantic University examined gait to test for early cognitive decline. Gait is how a person stands and walks, and gait analysis offers insight into the neurological health of a person by looking at walking patterns, balance and coordination. Researchers recruited 55 older adults, of which 25 exhibited mild cognitive impairment; 30 did not. Researchers asked the participants to perform two walking tests. One involved straight walking, and the other involved walking on a curved path, which requires a higher level of cognitive resources and balance control. They then used a special camera to track 25 joints of body movement and gave them gait markers for each test. Researchers found that those with mild cognitive impairment had distinctive changes in their walking patterns, including shorter average step length and reduced walking speed. They said this is likely due to an increased demand for balance and coordination. These findings could offer opportunities to detect cognitive impairment early, which is key for treatment.

The twist is that this next project takes place on just one planet, and there's a medieval fantasy edge to the whole thing. Light No Fire was first shown during Keighley's previous event, The Game Awards, back in December — but we've seen nothing of the title since. This supposed return could be a big deal, then. Dates, times, and what to expect Literally open world Are you eager to see more of Light No Fire? Gather your fellow adventurers and establish a camp in the comments section below. [source x.com ] About Robert Ramsey Robert (or Rob if you're lazy) has been a fan of PlayStation since the 90s, when Tekken 2 introduced him to the incredible world of video games. He still takes his fighting games seriously, but RPGs are his true passion. The Witcher, Dragon Quest, Mass Effect, Final Fantasy, he's played 'em all — a little too much, some might say. Comments 10 I do love how Sean being a cheeky little gobshite gives me the warm fuzzies! Cannot wait to see more of Light no Fire, hopefully they go early access soon after. I'm intrigued to see it, but it'll take something special for me to get involved day one after their last game. Can i suggest Sean, dont over promise and take half a decade to deliver this time 🙂 I will probably get this day one, surely they have learnt from past mistakes. Also this seems less ambitious than NMS was so should be easier for them to fine tune. It seems like it's just one massive planet but shared with others? If so I wonder if there's still randomly generated parts to the game or is it just one well crafted world that's the same for everyone. Still not ruling out that they got bought by Microsoft Can’t wait for Summer Games Fest, so I can find out if I buy anything in the second half of the year! Lol. Seriously, there’s basically 3 games releasing after June right now and two of them are Ubisoft. This is the main reason I haven't bought Enshrouded yet. I REALLY like what Hello Games does, their ambition, and how well they support their work. It's nearly unheard of. Can't wait to see what they're up to with this. @UltimateOtaku91 Its actually more ambitious according to Sean. The Planet is bigger then our real world Earth, has multiple biomes, has zero loading screens as in its all seamless and it has a realistic scale for things so mountains for instance are as big if not bigger then are real world mountains. There is random generation that is a more advanced version of the engine NMS uses as well. It honestly sounds incredible and the reveal trailer shown looked amazing. @Enuo Why? Hello Games have only been able to do what they want because they're Indie and right now i doubt MS wants to add any more studios. @DennisReynolds I stand corrected then, sounds pretty darn impressive and will take people years to see everything the planet has to offer. So is the entire map randomly generated? so people will get different starting biomes or resources etc. Tap here to load 10 comments Leave A Comment Hold on there, you need to login to post a comment...

        "content": "Ten Hag’s time is up Manchester United have decided that they will sack Erik ten Hag following an end of season review, according to the Daily Mail’s Sami Mokbel. Despite winning the FA Cup, United endured their worst-ever Premier League campaign, finishing eighth in the table. The Guardian were told by one source that Sir Jim Ratcliffe has decided to take a new approach for next season, and the Daily Mail claim Ten Hag’s time is up following Ratcliffe’s end of season review. A four-man shortlist has already been devised, with Kieran McKenna, Mauricio Pochettino, Thomas Tuchel and Thomas Frank all in contention to replace Ten Hag at Old Trafford. Man United have reportedly already made contact with McKenna but face competition from Chelsea and Brighton with the 38-year-old a man in demand following the work he has done at Ipswich Town. Ten Hag’s arrival was supposed to mark a drastic change in standards and it did appear at one stage that could actually happen. In his first season in charge, United won the Carabao Cup and finished third in the Premier League however this year has seen several sub-par performances. Heated relationships with players has also left dark clouds over Old Trafford and under Ratcliffe, they are hoping that the footballing side of the operations can be revitalised. Related links:",

Meanwhile Kieran opted for a white shirt with a black blazer with skinny beige trousers for the day out. Katie and Carl split at the end of 2023 after two years together. Katie Price 's exes Carl Woods (L) and Kieran Hayler (R) seem to have formed a close friendship as they attended the Silver Leas Polo in Hertfordshire over the weekend Katie and Carl split at the end of 2023 after two years together. Meanwhile she married Kieran in 2013 but later split in 2018 after welcoming two children, Jett, 10, and Bunny, nine Carl made his debut at the event with new girlfriend Megan Bells who wore a white dress The former glamour model tied the knot with Kieran in 2013 but later split in 2018 after welcoming two children, Jett, 10, and Bunny, nine. Kieran later got engaged to fiancée Michelle Pentecost, with whom he shares a son, Apollo. It's not the first time the exes have enjoyed some downtime together as they celebrated Easter Sunday together earlier this year which left Katie, who is now dating MAFS star JJ Slater, fuming. At the time, a source told The Sun that Katie was seriously irritated by the pair's friendship and claimed it was just because they were trying to 'have a dig' at her. The source said: 'When Katie saw the pics of Kieran and Carl together she texted Carl that he was a \"sad c***\". She was absolutely fuming because it can't have been for any reason aside from to have a dig at her.' Katie is also mum to Junior, 18, and Princess, 16, from her marriage to Peter Andre, and Harvey, 21, whose dad is Dwight Yorke. It comes after Katie confirmed she's finally moving out of her Mucky Mansion after she was served an eviction notice to leave the property. The mother-of-five revealed she will soon be collecting the keys for a new home and denied recent reports she was looking to move her family into a caravan. Both men looked to be enjoying each other's company as they sipped on beers ahead of a luncheon Carl looked smart in a beige Ralph Lauren polo shirt which he teamed with blue jeans and a black jumper tied around his shoulders Meanwhile Kieran opted for a white shirt with a black blazer and skinny beige trousers for the day out as he cuddled his son, Apollo Carl showed off his tattooed arms as he watched the polo Carl and Kieran were seen posing for photos at the event along with impressionist Francine Lewis After nine years, Katie says she 'can't wait' to relocate and admits, 'I've had nothing but bad memories in that house', insisting moving will be the start of a new chapter in her life. Former I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! campmate Katie was declared bankrupt for a second time in March over an unpaid tax bill of £761,994.05. Speaking about the West Sussex property, branded the 'Mucky Mansion' because of its constant state of disrepair, Katie said: 'I absolutely hate the Mucky Mansion, even how it's been called the Mucky Mansion because of all the stuff that happened there before. 'I can't wait to get out of that house I've had nothing but bad memories in that house for nine years. I hate the Mucky Mansion, I never want to see it again and I can't wait to move into my new place, I am so excited. 'New beginnings, new start, reset button, I love it. 'But don't worry, I'll be featuring my new house on my YouTube channel when I get the keys and welcoming you to my new house, I can't wait, I just want to get rid of all the bad stuff in the past and have a fresh start. 'Although I would love a big caravan, it wouldn't fit us all in so it's definitely not a caravan I'm moving into.' In March, she became bankrupt for a second time after she failed to pay her taxes, saying the reason she has debts is because she went through a 'breakdown.' Speaking on the Stripping Off podcast with Matt Haycox , Katie said she wasn't even aware of the second bankruptcy, insisting, 'I will pay it, but it just has to be when I've got it.' Katie is now dating Married At First Sight star JJ Slater and the pair say they are 'in love' Kieran and Katie share two children, Jett, 10, and Bunny, nine. She is also mum to Junior, 18, and Princess, 16, from her marriage to Peter Andre, and Harvey, 21, whose dad is Dwight Yorke Kieran moved on with fiancée Michelle Pentecost - they share son Apollo It comes after Katie confirmed she's finally moving out of her Mucky Mansion after she was served an eviction notice to leave the property She said: 'Yeah, you should always pay your tax, this and that. But obviously, I went through a breakdown so then I didn't pay tax and that's sort of where the bankruptcy thing has come from.' Katie has been given until June 26 to leave the Mucky Mansion, which became the subject of a Channel 4 documentary when she attempted to install life back into the property for the last time. During an Instagram live last week, she confirmed there will be no further renovation shows based around the house, saying, 'Is there going to be anymore Mucky Mansions shows? No.' She was served an eviction notice on April 24 and told to leave by the end of May but has been given an extension by her mortgage provider. Katie was due to give evidence at the High Court over her finances last month but failed to turn up because she was on holiday in Cyprus with boyfriend JJ. The 'Mucky Mansion' earned its nickname following years of damage to the property, including flooding, burglaries, mould and even reports of it being haunted.

        "content": "The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes miss the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. say they are not represented accurately in the official numbers. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them versus how they identify themselves. The groups say money, political power and even health could be at stake. Being lumped into the wrong column can mean a gain or loss of government funds that are distributed based on data. For some, it's about their identity and feeling seen by their own country. The Office of Management and Budget said the working group that oversaw the revisions held 94 “listening sessions” with many advocacy groups, academics and the general public, and it will continue to reach out to communities. HMONG AND THE SECRET WAR During the Vietnam War and unbeknownst to the American public, the CIA recruited Lao and Hmong people to fight the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia. Tens of thousands of Hmong soldiers died while others fled to the U.S. as a result of what became known as the “secret war.\" By the 1970s, many Hmong had resettled in Minnesota, Wisconsin and central California. Today, Hmong in the U.S. number more than 300,000. Some states recognize Hmong and Lao veterans with annual ceremonies, and in April, the Wisconsin governor signed a law mandating that Hmong American history be taught in schools. Given their history fighting in that region for the U.S., many Hmong feel strongly that they should be classified as Southeast Asian. But because China is considered the Hmong ancestral homeland, the U.S. Census Bureau categorized them as East Asian after the 2020 census. “That has been very hurtful to our elders and to our veterans who sacrificed so much to get us here to this country after everything they did to help the U.S. during the Vietnam War,” said May yer Thao, president and CEO of the St. Paul, Minnesota-based Hmong American Partnership. The East Asian label also pains them because the Hmong were oppressed in China as an ethnic minority and sought refuge in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, according to Quyên Dinh, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. Those who object to the classification also have a practical concern: the East Asian grouping could hide socioeconomic disparities between Hmong and other Asian households that need to be addressed. The per capita income of Hmong was almost $26,000, while it was more than $53,000 for Asians overall, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. “We are still one of the most impoverished communities in this nation,” Thao said. The Census Bureau says it’s working with the Hmong community to improve their classification. THE EXCLUDED BACKGROUNDS When the government revised its race and ethnicity standards in March — it's first major alteration since 1997 — its seven categories included a new one, Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA. The revisions also encouraged detailed data collection about respondents' backgrounds, such as African American, Jamaican and Haitian under the Black category. Missing from the list of backgrounds under the new MENA category: Black Arabs from such countries as Somalia and Sudan, and Armenians. The groups were left out after a 2015 field test by the Census Bureau found that most Armenians still identified as white and most Somali and Sudanese respondents identified as Black even when MENA was an option. Some advocates said the decision to omit Black Arabs from being included in the MENA category was based on outdated research. For many Armenian Americans, not having their own category amounts to an existential threat as a large part of their diaspora's culture is now concentrated in the United States. Ethnic Armenians also have communities around Europe and the Middle East, in particular Lebanon. Many are descendants of those who fled the 1915 campaign by Ottoman Turks in which some 1.5 million Armenians died in massacres, deportations and forced marches. The atrocities, which emptied many ethnic areas in eastern Turkey, are widely viewed by historians as genocide . Turkey rejects the description of genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest during World War I. Without Armenian inclusion in the MENA subcategories, many will likely categorize themselves as being from a different country. That could diminish their official numbers and reduce their power when it comes to redrawing political districts in places with large Armenian communities, said Sophia Armen, chair of the Census Taskforce of the Armenian National Committee of America-Western Region. “We will now be undercounted by potentially hundreds of thousands of people,” Armen said. “It spells out a very real destruction of Armenian identity in the next two generations.” During the last redistricting round following the 2020 census, Armenians in greater Los Angeles — which has the largest concentration of Armenians outside Armenia — were almost split up into different city districts, but the redistricting plan was modified after they sounded the alarm. There are an estimated 460,000 Armenian Americans in the U.S. , with half living in California, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. Being identified in the data correctly also is important to local health departments. It can influence anything from vaccination outreach in the proper language to tailoring health campaigns for specific communities. Armenian Americans, for instance, are more likely to suffer from hypertension than the general population, but there’s not a lot of data. MANY BRAZILIANS IDENTIFY AS HISPANIC A coding error last year in an annual Census Bureau survey offered unprecedented insight into how large numbers of Brazilians in the U.S. identify as Hispanic or Latino. An analysis by Pew Research Center showed that the coding mistake revealed at least 416,000 Brazilians, or more than two-thirds of Brazilians in the U.S., also identified as Hispanic in the 2020 American Community Survey. Usually, if someone marks Hispanic and Brazilian on the survey, they are recoded as “not Hispanic” when the numbers are crunched. Not including Brazilians, or Haitians for that matter, in the definition of Hispanic or Latino, means that large numbers of Afro-Latinos aren't counted, Michelle Bueno Vásquez, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Northwestern University, wrote the Office of Management and Budget. “The OMB as it stands fails Latinos, especially Afro-Latinos who continually suffer double discrimination and marginalization, on top of statistical invisibility, in the United States,” she said. Researching the impacts of categorizing Brazilians as Hispanic was among the recommendations a Census Bureau advisory committee made last month. “Policy is driven by data, first and foremost,” Armen said of people who feel missed in the classifications. “It just seems like we are purposely being ignored.” ___ Follow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP .

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The testimony in Donald Trump's New York hush money trial is all wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It's impossible to say how long all of that will take, but in a landmark trial that's already featured its fair share of memorable moments , this week could easily be the most important. Here's what to expect in the days ahead: WHAT HAPPENS DURING CLOSING ARGUMENTS? Starting Tuesday morning, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments expected to last for much of the day, if not all of it. The arguments don't count as evidence in the case charging Trump with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election to a porn star who alleged she had a sexual encounter with him a decade earlier. They'll instead function as hourslong recaps of the key points the lawyers want to leave jurors with before the panel disappears behind closed doors for deliberations. Look for prosecutors to remind jurors that they can trust the financial paperwork they've seen and the witnesses they've heard from. That includes porn actor Stormy Daniels , whose account of an alleged sexual encounter with Trump is at the heart of the case, and Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer Michael Cohen, who testified that Trump was directly involved in the hush money scheme and authorized payments. It's worth remembering that the defense, which called only two witnesses but not Trump, doesn't have to prove anything or convince jurors of Trump's innocence. To prevent a conviction, the defense simply needs to convince at least one juror that prosecutors haven't proved Trump's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the standard for criminal cases. Expect the defense to try to poke holes in the government's case by disputing Daniels' testimony about her hotel suite encounter with Trump and by distancing Trump from the mechanics of the reimbursements to Cohen, who was responsible for the $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. The defense may also assert one last time that Trump was most concerned about shielding his family from salacious stories, not winning the election, when it comes to the hush money that was paid. And it'll certainly attack the credibility of Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the payment and who was accused by Trump's lawyers of lying even while on the witness stand . How much of his testimony the jury believes will go a long way in determining the outcome of the case. Since the prosecution has the burden of proof, it will deliver its summation last — the reverse order from opening statements, in which the prosecution went first. ONE LAST THING BEFORE THE JURY DELIBERATES A critical moment will take place, perhaps Wednesday morning, before the jury begins its deliberations. Judge Juan M. Merchan is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case, providing a roadmap for what it can and cannot take into account as it evaluates the Republican former president's guilt or innocence. In an indication of just how important those instructions are, prosecutors and defense lawyers had a spirited debate last week outside the jury's presence as they sought to persuade Merchan about the instructions he should give. The Trump team, for instance, sought an instruction informing jurors that the types of hush money payments at issue in Trump’s case are not inherently illegal, a request a prosecutor called “totally inappropriate.” Merchan said such an instruction would go too far and is unnecessary. Trump's team also asked Merchan to consider the “extraordinarily important” nature of the case when issuing his instructions and to urge jurors to reach “very specific findings.” Prosecutors objected to that as well, and Merchan agreed that it would be wrong to deviate from the standard instructions. “When you say it’s a very important case, you’re asking me to change the law, and I’m not going to do that,” Merchan said. Prosecutors, meanwhile, requested an instruction that someone’s status as a candidate doesn’t need to be the sole motivation for making a payment that benefits the campaign. Defense lawyers asked for jurors to be told that if a payment would have been made even if the person wasn’t running, it shouldn’t be treated as a campaign contribution. ONCE THE JURY GETS THE CASE The deliberations will proceed in secret, in a room reserved specifically for jurors and in a process that's intentionally opaque. Jurors can communicate with the court through notes that ask the judge, for instance, for legal guidance or to have particular excerpts of testimony read back to them. But without knowing what jurors are saying to each other, it's hard to read too much into the meaning of any note. It's anyone's guess how long the jury will deliberate for and there's no time limit either. The jury must evaluate 34 counts of falsifying business records, so that could take some time, and a verdict might not come by the end of the week. To reach a verdict, either guilty or not guilty, all 12 jurors must agree with the decision for the judge to accept it. Things will get trickier if the jury can't reach a consensus after several days of deliberations. Though defense lawyers might seek an immediate mistrial, Merchan is likely to call the jurors in and instruct them to keep trying for a verdict and to be willing to reconsider their positions without abandoning their conscience or judgment just to go along with others. If, after that instruction, the jury still can't reach a verdict, the judge would have the option to deem the panel hopelessly deadlocked and declare a mistrial. ___ Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz, Michael R.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard (180 meter) hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Winners of the three men's races included local man Josh Shepherd as well as competitors from Germany and Australia. Abby Lampe from North Carolina won the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. “You just have to roll,” said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. “There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.” Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) over a 240-yard (220-meter) course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.
