        "content": "Pitso Mosimane's Abha FC were officially relegated on the final day of the Saudi Pro League season after losing to Al-Hazm on Monday night. Abha came into the encounter with their fate in their own hands after late win over Al Khaleej last Thursday, which took them out of the relegation zone. The former Al Ahly tactician made just one change from the win against Al Khaleej, Meshal Al Mutain came in at right-back for Fahad Jumayah. While the first half proved to be quiet affair in terms of chances for the visitors, Abha went ahead two minutes after the break courtesy of a strike from Ahmed Abdu Jaber. The visitors were unable to hold on to that lead for long as Al-Hazm restored parity in the 58th minute, with Muhammed Badamosi getting his name on the score-sheet. Al-Hazm completed the turnaround with ten minutes left on the clock when Mohammed Al-Thani fired past goalkeeper Anton Tataru?anu to seal the win, which was the fourth of the season. As a result, Mosimane's side have officially been relegated as Al Alkhdoud moved to 15th position after defeating fellow relegation rivals Al-Tai, who finish the campaign in 17th position, one place behind Abha. It remains to be seen where Mosimane's future will lie as he only signed a with the Saudi club back in January. You must be to read and post comments",

        "description": "Blake Snell is starting today's game as he awaits the birth of his first child, and manager Melvin keeps options open for Tuesday pitching plan.",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO – Blake Snell will start Monday on the pitcher’s mound, and he may end the day as a father. The 31-year-old left-hander was reinstated from the paternity list on Sunday and will make his scheduled start as his girlfriend, Haeley Mar, is still awaiting the birth of the couple’s first child. Her due date was last Monday, and Snell flew back from Pittsburgh to the Bay Area after his Wednesday start against the Pirates . Snell, the reigning National League Cy Young award winner, has struggled in orange and black since signing a two-year, $62 million deal with the Giants. He failed to make it past the fifth inning in any of his first three starts in April, and then he went on the injured list with a left groin injury. After dominating the minor leagues during his rehab stint, Snell surrendered four earned runs in 3 1⁄3 innings during his May 22 return against the Pirates. Giants manager Bob Melvin saw reasons to be optimistic after the latest start. “Incremental progress across the board,” Melvin said. “He was pretty good there early on. They made him throw a lot of pitches and it got away once he came out of the game, but I thought his stuff was a lot better.” The longtime manager was cagey when asked about the plan for Tuesday, with a vague “TBD” listed as the San Francisco starter facing former Giants first-round pick Zack Wheeler on the MLB website, before Kyle Harrison is slated to start on Wednesday. Mason Black, who filled that spot in the rotation through much of the last month after making his major league debut May 6, was optioned to Triple-A on Friday to make room for reliever Drew Pomeranz. In Thursday’s win over the Pirates, Black allowed four runs (all earned) in 2 2/3 innings, the third time in his four starts that he gave up at least that many runs. “I think anything is on the table,” Melvin said. “Whether we want to piece it together, whether we go with a regular starter or we call someone from the minor league side.” Brett Wisely will make his third consecutive start at shortstop after getting seven hits in his last three games. The 25-year-old from Jacksonville is batting .438 in 16 at-bats, but perhaps most importantly, has not committed an error. “Brett’s been great, and that’s why he’s out there,” Melvin said. “We always talk about how if you get here and you perform, we’re going to find a place for you to play.” He has replaced top prospect Marco Luciano, who is hitting .391 but also committed five errors in the first five games of the Giants’ road trip before being sat for the finale against the New York Mets. Luciano isn’t totally in the doghouse, but he’s firmly behind Wisely. “Marco will get in the game here in this series, probably against lefties, but right now Brett is swinging the bat well and that’s why he’s in there.”",

        "content": "THERE was major travel chaos this evening as firefighters tackled a truck fire on a busy motorway. The HGV blaze, on the northbound side of the M1 at Junction 4 Donabate in Dublin, started before 4pm this afternoon. Emergency services rushed to the scene and the Dublin Fire Brigade has been dealing with the incident since then. The M1 motorway was closed, with traffic delays building for hours. Dublin Fire Brigade said a foam tender and water tanker were despatched to the scene. A large amount of waste spread out onto the carriageway, with a teleporter and prime mover also sent out to the scene to aid with cleanup. Dublin Fire Brigade posted on X: \"The M1 is currently closed as we deal with a HGV fire on the motorway. \"We're making good progress but traffic delays are building.\" It later added: \"Firefighting operations are continuing. \"A foam tender and water tanker are now on scene. \"A large amount of waste is on the carriageway. \"We're using a teleporter and prime mover to help clear the scene.\" Another post read: \"Our Manitou teleporter has been used to good effect to remove the burning waste so it can be extinguished and cooled.\" Dramatic pictures posted on the account showed smoke billowing over the motorway, while several vehicles and firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze and move the waste and truck. TII Traffic said the vehicle fire was causing \"heavy traffic\". It added: \"Expect delays and drive carefully.\" Meanwhile, last week the DFB issued an urgent warning ahead of heat hitting Ireland in warmer months. They alerted the public of the fire hazard associated with reflections. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, Dublin Fire Brigade warned that reflections from mirrors and glass onto flammable surfaces can cause fires. They warned: \"Just a gentle reminder to remove mirrors, glasses, and vases from window ledges or anywhere they might be exposed to direct sunlight. \"They can cause fires if the sun is reflected onto a flammable surface.\" Where you have a mirror or any other glass object, such as an ornament, that is curved, this allows the glass to act as a lens. When the sunlight hits it, it becomes concentrated and, if the rays are bounced onto something flammable - like curtains or soft furnishings - then a fire can start.",

        "description": "The lawsuit alleges that James is using the \"State's power to regulate business fraud to stop nonprofit pregnancy centers.\"",
        "content": "was hit with another lawsuit this week by an anti-abortion group relating to abortion pill reversal protocol. Last week, the National Institute for Family and Life Advocates, Gianna's House, Inc., and Choose Life of Jamestown, Inc., filed a lawsuit against James, alleging that she is using \"the State's power to regulate business fraud to stop nonprofit pregnancy centers and a network of affiliated centers from providing the information\" regarding Abortion Pill Reversal. An APR procedure involves a woman who has changed their mind about aborting a pregnancy after taking mifepristone, a drug that is used to end a pregnancy. APR involves taking progesterone to offset the effects of mifepristone. The lawsuit states that a woman identified as Maranda recently welcomed her daughter into the world after an APR. According to the lawsuit, Maranda was taking mifepristone but later changed her mind about her pregnancy and received information from \"New Hope Family Services' website about a method of using FDA-approved progesterone supplements, which physicians may lawfully prescribe under New York law, in an effort to save a developing child by counteracting the hormone-blocking effects of mifepristone.\" \"The Attorney General alleges that New Hope and the other pro-life pregnancy centers are spreading 'false and misleading' information about progesterone treatment. She seeks an injunction and other penalties to censor their attempts to provide this information,\" the lawsuit says. \"This action seeks to enjoin the Attorney General from targeting, chilling, and punishing Plaintiffs' speech about progesterone treatment, and to declare that her actions violate Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights to speak freely, to practice their religion, and to due process under the law.\" reached out to James's office and the National Institute for Family and Life Advocates via email for comment. Earlier this month, James was by a coalition of anti-abortion groups that said she sought to block Christian pregnancy centers from promoting so-called abortion pill reversal protocol. The Abortion Pill Rescue Network says that studies of APR have shown it has a 64-68 percent success rate of allowing the pregnancy to continue, but the course of action has not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( ). Jor-El Godsey, President of Heartbeat International, one of several anti-abortion groups named as plaintiffs in the suit, said in a statement that \"New York State laws protect abortionists and abortion on demand up until birth. Now they are targeting those who assist a woman in exercising her right to continue her own pregnancy.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "description": "\"This situation needs to be treated like the emergency it is.\"",
        "content": "The MLA representing the Cumberland House community says Saskatchewan’s premier should experience for himself a ride on Highway 123. After rains and spring conditions washed out the highway and made it largely impassable, Cumberland House officials last week declared a state of emergency for the village as well as the nearby Cree Nation. The highway serves as the lone road into the northern Saskatchewan community. Cumberland MLA Doyle Vermette on Monday criticized the provincial government for its lack of any tangible service towards fixing the problem. Vermette challenged Premier Scott Moe to drive Highway 123 himself, to experience just once what area residents are having to deal with in their day-to-day lives. “I have an invitation for the premier: Let’s meet where the pavement ends and I’ll let you drive and see it for yourself,” Vermette said. “I don’t think this government realizes how bad our road is.” Janelle Thomas, who started a petition on Change.org calling for improved highway infrastructure, said those using the road face “nearly impossible travel conditions.” “Transport vehicles carrying gasoline, food, and other necessities are getting stuck because of freight weight,” Thomas wrote. “Ambulances cannot make it through the muddy roads, putting our sick and elderly residents at risk of further illness or even death.” Moe last week said the Cumberland House community will be a “priority for conversations” with the provincial highways department. “We’ll work with the community on any immediate challenges that they have and also work with the community on what the investment looks like for that road in the future, and I would say it needs to be more, not less,” Moe said. Cumberland House is located approximately 450 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon. The village and the First Nation each have a population of between 700 and 800 people. Opposition NDP Leader Carla Beck on Monday said people in Saskatchewan shouldn’t have to struggle to have access to medicine, food and fuel. “Cumberland House is in a state of emergency and the local leaders I’ve heard from rightly feel the government is not doing everything in its power to help,” Beck said. Cumberland House Mayor Ferlin McKay last week said the “deplorable and deteriorating conditions” of the highway “puts the health and well-being of our community members in jeopardy.” Cumberland Cree Nation Chief Rene Chaboyer said government action is urgently needed to address “the dire situation” on Highway 123. “We need a safe and reliable access for emergency services, food supplies, and vital resources,” Chaboyer added. Beck said a short-term fix should include the government deploying road builders and other resources — including airlifts, if needed — to ensure safe and reliable traffic, goods and supplies for the community. Beyond that, a long-term fix is necessary, she added. According to the NDP on Monday, highways critic Trent Wotherspoon and Vermette wrote a letter to Highways Minister Lori Carr on May 6, urging the government to take appropriate action and Carr responded on May 23 that government officials were “optimistic” that “conditions will improve significantly.” The next day, a state of emergency was declared. Said Wotherspoon on Monday: “This situation needs to be treated like the emergency it is.”",

My name is Abby, and if there's one thing you should know about me, it's this: I LOVE BAGELS. They could be the greatest food of all time. What else is equally acceptable to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert, or as a snack? Nothing. Abby Zinman No, like, I don't think you get it... I was RAISED on bagels. My parents framed a painting of a bagel in their house. And although I've learned the hard way that not all cities have decent bagels (ahem, Calgary), bagels in Toronto (where I'm from) just don't compare to the \"Big Two\": Montreal and New York. Abby Zinman Yes, that's technically a Montreal bagel, and NO IT WON'T AFFECT MY SCORING. I've spent my whole life listening to friends and family from these two cities argue about whose bagels are better — but I've never actually sat down and compared them before. THE PEOPLE DESERVE AN ANSWER: Which are better, Montreal or New York bagels, once and for all?! Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Fox / Via giphy.com Just wait until Homer finds out about the pizza-bagel. Welllllll, I went to both Montreal and New York recently, with the sole mission of tasting bagels. And I'm excited to announce that we have a winner. Abby Zinman But first, the breakdown. In Montreal, I tried Fairmount , St. Viateur , and Dizz’s . In New York, I had Best Bagel & Coffee , Tompkins Square Bagels , and Brooklyn Bagel . It was extremely difficult to choose, but I vetted all of these spots on Google Reviews and TikTok — believe me, they're the best of the best. Abby Zinman The style and taste of each city's bagels is 1000% different. Montreal bagels are a hint sweeter, and the hole in the middle is bigger. They're also smaller and crunchier. Montreal is arguably more famous for their classic bagel and cream cheese — along with smoked meat sandwiches, of course. Abby Zinman Don't worry, I did try the smoked meat too, and it was LEGEN... wait for it... DARY. Meanwhile, New York bagels are bigger and doughier. They're more maximalist, crafting these huge sandwiches, and they have about a gajillion cream cheese flavours. Abby Zinman I don't know how I feel about birthday cake cream cheese, but I cannot lie, the cucumber dill cream cheese was incredible. Like, I couldn't finish my New York bagel sandwich in one sitting, and meanwhile, I gobbled my Montreal bagels down in just a few bites. Abby Zinman That cheese pull?? Are you KIDDING??? Sooooo, with all of that considered, I have my winner — which sort of depends on bagel flavour and occasion. I judged each city by category: best cinnamon raisin bagel, best everything bagel, best bagel on its own, and finally, best sandwich. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF ABC Network / Via giphy.com The two best kinds of bagels in general are without a doubt everything and cinnamon raisin, so let's discuss those first. The first category: CINNAMON RAISIN BAGELS. I judged these based on level of sweetness, raisin generosity, and overall cinnamon flavour. Because there's nothing worse than a cinnamon raisin bagel that doesn't taste like cinnamon. BLASPHEMY. And the winner is... Abby Zinman Yes, I'm making this very unnecessarily dramatic, and no, I'm not sorry about it. ...Montreal! The sweetness of the bagel complemented the flavour much better, and they were much more generous with the raisins. I had SO MANY of these bagels on their own as a snack throughout the day — they were SO. GOOD. Abby Zinman Those seeds on the bagel are only there because I'm not smart and decided not to separate the bags of bagels. Anyway. And now, for EVERYTHING BAGELS. I'm judging on the true quality of an everything bagel: how much flavour can you truly pack in a bagel? And, you know, how much do I want to keep eating it despite the garlic breath? My pick is... Abby Zinman Yes, that's a challah in the back of the Montreal photo. IYKYK. ...New York! I found that the doughiness of the bagel and more extravagant flavours worked better for their everything bagel, rather than Montreal's. Although both were pretty great, I'd definitely rather get an everything bagel in New York than Montreal. Abby Zinman Next: best bagel on its own! Like, no butter, no cream cheese, NOTHING. Essentially, which is the best to take a bite out of as you're leaving the bagel shop, because you can't quite make it home before you start eating? My winner is... Littleny / Getty Images, Abby Zinman Yes, I had to use a stock photo for New York because... well... I ate it too quickly. ...Montreal has New York beat here! The more dense texture and slightly sweeter flavour just works better when it's plain. They feel more... I don't know... authentic. Like, you know when Harry Styles said \"this movie feels like a movie \" about Don't Worry Darling ? Well, Montreal bagels feel like a bagel . So there's that. Abby Zinman And finally: I happen to be a \"go-big-or-go-home\" girlie, so that means that arguably the most important category is SANDWICHES. AKA, which bagel goes best with something on it? Because, TBH, that's how I want to be eating my bagels most of the time. Drumroll please....... Abby Zinman ...New York bagels just appeal more to me. DON'T HATE ME, CANADA! There's just nothing on the planet I'd rather eat for lunch than this New York bagel sandwich (yes, even smoked meat). Montreal bagels just don't work as well for sandwiches, not just because of their size, but also their texture. So my overall winner is New York, since this was the greatest bagel I've ever had in my life. Abby Zinman LOOK AT HER AND TELL ME I'M WRONG. She's beauty and she's grace. Check out that soft-yet-a-bit-crunchy bread, and how it envelops the whole sandwich. I'm in love. Abby Zinman But before Canadians start yelling at me in the comments (and before my Montreal family shuns me forever): this doesn't mean I don't LOOOOVE Montreal bagels, too... it just means I'd rather have a New York bagel sandwich than literally any other kind of bagel ever. PERIOD. Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Bravo TV / Via giphy.com And there we have it: your official review from the biggest bagel fan you'll ever find. I gotta go have a bagel for lunch, but in the meantime, tell me what your pick for best bagel ever is in the comments, yeah? 🥯 Tap to play GIF Tap to play GIF Netflix / Via giphy.com Also, make sure you follow BuzzFeed Canada on Instagram and TikTok — even if you're not fans of Montreal bagels — because us foodies gotta stay together.

        "content": "The potential seeding pots for the upcoming Champions League draw have been revealed, and it appears Arsenal could be in for a tough ride following the conclusion of most of Europe’s top leagues, reports express.co.uk. Arsenal are preparing for their second consecutive Champions League campaign after narrowly missing out on the Premier League title to reigning champions Manchester City. Next season will see significant changes to UEFA’s flagship event, with the number of competing teams increasing from 32 to 36. The traditional group stage is being replaced by a league stage, where each team will face two clubs from the four seeding pots. Seeding pots will now be determined by coefficients, moving away from the previous system which was based on the holders, Europa League winners and domestic champions. Germany has secured a fifth Champions League spot due to their superior coefficient rating, while Atalanta’s recent success has earned Italy an impressive six spots. Due to their six-year absence from the Champions League prior to this season, Arsenal are expected to compete in the second seeding block alongside Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen, Atletico Madrid and Atalanta. This situation could lead to a challenging Champions League campaign for Arsenal, as the first pot seeds have been confirmed to include Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain, Liverpool, Inter, Borussia Dortmund, RB Leipzig and Barcelona. The Gunners are below Liverpool despite finishing higher than them in the Premier League in both of the last two seasons.That is because of the Reds’ superior UEFA coefficient courtesy of their performances in Europe in recent years. Pot two has been confirmed to include Bayer Leverkusen, Atletico Madrid, Atalanta, Juventus, Benfica, Arsenal, Club Brugge and AC Milan, with Shakhtar Donetsk expected to join them through qualifying. Seven more spots are up for grabs in the qualification stage. If things go as planned, Aston Villa will find themselves in pot four alongside Monaco, Stuttgart and Bologna, while pot three could see Celtic, Feyenoord, Sporting CP and PSV. The group-stage phase will now feature eight games instead of six. The top eight teams will advance to the last 16, while those ranked ninth to 24th will compete in a play-off to join them. Teams placed 25th to 36th, along with the losing eight sides, will be eliminated from the competition. Clubs from the same country cannot face each other, which means Arsenal, City, Liverpool and Aston Villa will not be pitted against each other. In a worst-case scenario, Arsenal may have to contend with Bayern Munich and Barcelona from Pot 1 and Bayer Leverkusen and Juventus from Pot 2. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "content": "Young Sheldon has come to an end after seven seasons and now a new type of Big Bang Theory has emerged with a hot take about the spin-off. A to Reddit and shared that, despite their love for the original series, they just couldn’t get into . “Big Bang Theory is top 5 in my world. I cannot even count how many times I watch it,” the user wrote. “It’s my go-to most of the time. But...I cannot stand Young Sheldon. Am I alone?” It became very obvious that the preference wasn’t uncommon as another person commented, “Agreed, Big Bang Theory is one of three shows I continually watch reruns of, but didn’t watch more than a few episodes of YS.” Some fans confirmed that, while they did watch Young Sheldon, it’s not made to be rewatched as one fan explained, “I actually agree with this opinion!?? They’re super different shows! BBT is a multicam sitcom and YS is a single cam. It makes a huge difference in the comedy performing for an audience vs recording a scene over and over exactly the same so the producers can get the right angle. A third fan agreed with the rewatching point writing, “I watch both but I only rewatch TBBT somehow. And YS is definitely a different story than TBBT so your feeling is understandable.” One Reddit user pointed out one big way Young Sheldon differed from The Big Bang Theory with the comment, “I love TBBT and I liked Young Sheldon too, but they’re quite different. Young Sheldon feels a lot more serious(?) in a way and it just doesn’t feel like a sitcom to me (eg no background laughter).” Despite not winning over the favor of all Big Bang Theory fans, was successful in its own right with its series finale .

        "description": "A group called Brown Alumni for Palestine interrupted the university president's commencement speech Sunday.",
        "content": "Protesters briefly disrupted an outdoor commencement address given by Brown University's president on Sunday. Shortly after Christina Paxson began, her speech was interrupted for several minutes by shouting as she told the graduates, \"I would really like to give you your degrees.\" She eventually resumed with some people continuing to shout. A group called Brown Alumni for Palestine said in a news release Sunday that it led the disruption at the ceremony, where Paxson and the Brown Corporation were conferring diplomas to the graduating class. Brown Alumni for Palestine said the group represents over 2,000 alumni who have pledged to withhold donations to the university until the corporation divests from companies contributing to or profiting from the conflict in Gaza . Another group, the Rhode Island Coalition for Israel, said it also organized a protest outside the ceremony. It said it had a plane fly a banner supporting Israel and the U.S.-Israel alliance. Education Anti-war demonstrations ceased earlier this month at a small number of universities, including Brown, after school leaders struck deals with pro-Palestinian protesters, fending off possible disruptions of final exams and graduation ceremonies. The agreements at schools including Brown, Northwestern and Rutgers stand out amid the chaotic scenes and campus arrests nationwide since April 17. Tent encampments and building takeovers have disrupted classes at some schools, including Columbia in New York City and the University of California, Los Angeles. Deals included commitments by universities to review their investments in Israel or hear calls to stop doing business with the longtime U.S. ally. Many protester demands have zeroed in on links to the Israeli military as the war grinds on in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protesters agreed to dismantle an encampment at Brown. School officials said students could present arguments for divesting Brown's endowment from companies linked to the war in Gaza. In addition, Paxson said she will ask an advisory committee to make a recommendation on divestment by Sept. 30, which will be put before the school's governing corporation for a vote in October.",

According to on Monday, it could still take another few days before an official agreement is reached between the two parties, as directors and lawyers from Napoli work out the complexities of the last remaining details. Napoli and Conte have already reached a general agreement on figures relating to salary. It is widely expected that the 54-year-old in Serie A. It is also understood that the coach will sign a three-year deal at the Stadio Maradona. The big issue that still needs to be resolved relates to image rights, according to Monday’s reports. Conte would like to have full control of those. The club and coach are also reportedly still discussing potential penalty fees, in the event that either party decides to terminate the agreement ahead of schedule, or if certain sporting objectives are not met, for example.

        "description": "Jackson responded to questions about the significance of Baltimore's opening matchup.",
        "content": "Most fans are excited about the first game of the season. Superstar QB and the two-time defending champion are hosting the in one of the on the slate. This is an early iteration of a 2023 AFC Championship Game rematch, with MVP looking to get his team a win this time around. Getting a game like this in front of a national audience would have most players ready for revenge. Jackson isn't like most players. In his head, Week 1 is just another stepping stone and : I really don't care who we play; it really didn't matter. At the end of the day, our goal is to make it to the Super Bowl. That sounds like a man who is locked in after in the postseason again. The rest of the league should be nervous if this is Jackson's attitude until February. He's already unstoppable as is. Will Baltimore's Offense Crack the Kansas City Defense This Time? A major reason why the Ravens didn't play in the Super Bowl last season was because the offense sputtered to a 10-point performance during the penultimate stop. They were 3-11 on 3rd down, turned the ball over thrice, and finished with only 22:30 minutes of possession. Jackson completed only 54.1% of his passes and was sacked four times. Aided by baffling play-calling from the Baltimore sideline, the Chiefs completely smothered the Ravens for most of that game. A lot of Ravens on that side of the ball should want redemption, both in Week 1 and a potential playoff rematch. In home games started by Lamar Jackson, the Baltimore Ravens averaged 34.6 points during the 2023 regular season. Their 10 points in the AFC Championship Game was an ill-timed season-low for such games. Week 1 will be a test for Baltimore's offense, especially with key addition in line to make his debut. The hope is that he will make an already elite rushing attack into a historically dominant unit. Derrick Henry's Career Statistics 2016 110 490 5 2017 176 744 5 2018 215 1,059 12 2019 303 1,540 16 2020 378 2,027 17 2021 219 937 10 2022 349 1,538 13 2023 280 1,167 12 From there, another Super Bowl is the target. Jackson is making that crystal clear: Just us beating them in the regular season doesn't really do anything; it just helps us keep stacking up wins to hopefully make it to the playoffs if anything to try to get in that same position again and hopefully be successful. 2024's season opener against the Chiefs is just another regular season game. Both of those teams will care more about what happens in January. Regardless, even if Jackson won't hype it up, September 5, 2024, will show just how much the Ravens have grown since the AFC Championship Game. A win won't signify a future parade. Revenge won't equate to a retroactive ring. However, Week 1 could spark a special season in Baltimore, with a happier ending this time. Source:",

KUWAIT CITY, May 27: As the Ministry of Electricity, Water, and Renewable Energy endeavors to secure energy from the Gulf Interconnection Authority for the coming summer, several pressing challenges persist, reports Al-Rai daily. Informed sources have highlighted three main issues currently troubling the ministry: ■ Expiration of Distributed Labor Contracts: The expiration of these contracts poses a significant concern. ■ Maintenance Tender Approvals: There has been an inability to obtain necessary approvals for station and project maintenance tenders due to the absence of the Central Tenders Agency. ■ Shortage of Basic Materials: Delays in awarding supply tenders have resulted in a lack of essential materials in some ministry sectors. These problems are particularly alarming as the summer season begins, potentially impacting the performance of various ministry sectors. Regulatory and financial authority approvals hinge on the Central Tenders Agency, exacerbating the situation. This news has been read 103 times!",

        "content": "To suspend or expel them will be the end of the FijiFirst Party’s political life, and the writing is already on the wall when it is in the opposition now. FFP leader, Voreqe Bainimarama, is already suspended from Parliament and is in jail for the time being, with Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum also out of Parliament and awaiting his fate in his court case. I challenge the FFP president Ratu Joji Satakala and general-secretary Faiyaz Koya to expel the 16 Parliamentarians (MPs) who voted for the salary increase. That’s the FFP MP’s political right to exercise in Parliament for what they believe is right, and they cannot be gagged as they all deserve a pay rise. If that’s the verdict from their party constitution, then our coalition Government Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka should also either suspend or expel all five NFP parliamentarians and call for an all-out fresh national election. FijiFirst is heading for self-destruction realistically, and I would encourage the suspended MPs to form a new political party to contest the 2026 elections, as there is also too much interference from Saiyed-Khaiyum.

        "content": "The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch for all 21 New Jersey counties on Monday afternoon with the potential for heavy rain, wind gusts up to 65 mph, hail and even the chance for tornadoes through the evening. The watch runs through 9 p.m. on what has already been a stormy Memorial Day with multiple rounds of thunderstorms that fired up early Monday. The nasty weather caused an early mass exodus from packed Jersey Shore towns and jammed the Garden State Parkway for dozens of miles . Thousands of homes and businesses were already without power from the earlier storms and the gusty winds on the way could bring down more trees and power lines. The latest forecast for this evening’s storm is showing a reduced risk for tornadoes, but doesn’t eliminate that threat, Sarah Johnson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, told NJ Advance Media. “Damaging winds and large hail risk are more of a concern,” she said. Hail could be the size of a quarter. The morning round of storms forced several towns to cancel Memorial Day parades. ”It’s unfortunate timing, a lot of people had plans for outdoors activities and Memorial Day ceremonies had to be canceled,” Johnson said. “Unfortunately the weather didn’t cooperate.” While some parts of the state will see a lull before the evening thunderstorms, Johnson urged peopole to monitor weather forecasts closely and be prepared to get indoors. ”Our bigger concern is with another round comes after 4 p.m., and continues through the late evening hours,” she said. “There will be a lightening and a heavy rain threat, it won’t be safe to be outside.” The storm is expected it to be off shore by midnight, she said.

        "content": "WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation's fallen toward a more perfect union, \"for which they lived, and for which they died.\" Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country's service members is not in vain. ''Freedom has never been guaranteed,'' Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. ''Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.'' He added: ''On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.'' Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. ''Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,\" Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. ''For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.'' Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.",

        "content": "A PRIEST told how Eddie Hutch Jr’s death had caused “great shock in the community and for his family” at his funeral today. Fr Michael Casey said his relatives had been plunged into grief in recent times — as he read an online tribute from an anonymous member of the public. The message read: “I don’t know you Edward, only your surname. What I do know is that it has been a name laid with sadness and grief. May God comfort an already broken family.” And Fr Casey told his funeral: “That’s our prayer this morning as well. We’re aware you, his extended family, have been in this place of grief many, many times.” Mourners also heard how Eddie died before he found out he was going to be a grandfather — with his two dangerous brothers, Alan and Ross, watching today’s service online from a private room in Dublin’s Wheatfield Prison. Kinahan cartel target Patsy Hutch, dressed in a black suit and wearing glasses, carried the coffin of his nephew, who was remembered as a “quiet man, who didn’t like the limelight”. But there was no sign of his more infamous uncle, Gerry ‘The Monk’ Hutch , at the Lady of Lourdes of Church on Dublin’s Sean McDermott Street. The Monk has divided his time between Dublin and Lanzarote , in Spain, since he was acquitted of the 2016 Regency Hotel murder of Kinahan thug David Byrne in April 2023. Eddie’s dad, Eddie Sr, who was shot dead at his Dublin home days after Byrne’s murder in a revenge hit, and his mother Jenny, who died of a heart attack in February of last year, were both remembered at the funeral. His brother Christopher ‘Bouncer’ Hutch, who died of a drug overdose in 2003, was also remembered today. Another brother, Gavin Hutch, carried his remains, along with Patsy, from same church which held the funerals of both his parents. Patsy’s two sons, Derek ‘Del Boy’ and Patrick Hutch, were also in attendance. Their older brother, Gary was shot dead in Marbella, Spain, in September 2015 — kicking off the bloody Kinahan-Hutch feud which resulted in 18 murders. Eddie’s daughter Megan was among the chief mourners and the mass was told he died before she could tell him he was going to be a grandfather. The 47-year-old’s body was found at his home on Dublin’s Poplar Row on May 19. No foul play is suspected. Fr Casey told mourners: “I know many of you were concerned about Eddie. He had isolated himself and withdrew a little bit for some time.” Daughter Megan and brother Gavin brought gifts to the altar, including a portrait of him and a can of Guinness. And Eddie’s cousin Vanessa read a few words on behalf of the family, saying: “Unfortunately Edward passed before Megan got to tell him he was going to be a grandfather. “He used to have an Aller. For those who do not know it was an Alsatian dog who he absolutely adored. One of his siblings thought it was funny to play a prank on him and took the dog off for a couple of hours. “Well, the biggest search party in the history of Dublin was called. “He also took a trip down to Mosney with a couple of his mates which he had free accommodation, as you would know. He went to Dan Lowry’s, where they had fun and games. And he slipped away earlier than the rest of the crew and went back to the chalet and cooked up a storm of a big pot of stew. “When all the crew came back, which was about 3am in the morning, it was devoured. When Edward was asked where he learnt his cooking skills, he said: ‘Only in the best place — the Joy.’” After the funeral mass, Eddie’s remains were buried in Glasnevin cemetery. His heartbroken younger brothers Alan, 43, and Ross Hutch, 32, watched the funerals online at Wheatfield after their applications for temporary release from jail were rejected. A source said: “Taken into account is the safety of prison officers who would have had to escort them from the prison and stayed with them at all times. “The safety of the public is also taken into account. The two men are very volatile and a decision was made to reject their applications.”",

        "content": "Heeramandi actor Sharmin Segal once again landed in controversy after a video surfaced showing her taking a dig at costar Aditi Rao Hydari. Social media users slammed Segal’s take on Hydari during an interview while promoting the Netflix series Heeramandi, an Indian media outlet reported. Sharmin Segal referred to Aditi Rao Hydari as a “good school girl,” due to the latter’s punctuality and adherence to rules. “Aditi is a good school girl, please understand that. Teacher will say you have to submit your homework at this time and Aditi will do exactly that and not one more word than the word count limit. That is Aditi for you. So, according to her everyone is late and she is on time,” she said. It is pertinent to mention that Segal, who is Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s niece, essayed Alamzeb in the Netflix series, and was constantly criticized for her bland and expressionless performance and was even dubbed as the weakest link among the seasoned cast.

Hydari later called out the trolls targeting Segal for her performance in her uncle Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s web series. Addressing the backlash Segal has been receiving following her acting in the web series, Hydari called it mean and horrible. “It’s horrible to pick on anybody. I know some people like something and some people don’t. There is a way to say it. It can get very mean. It has gotten very mean and I think it’s not fair and it shouldn’t happen like that,” she said.",

        "description": "The former president promised a crackdown on-campus protests, which have swept across the country over the past few months, as he spoke at a roundtable event in New York earlier this month",
        "content": "Donald Trump told campaign donors that, should he return to the White House in November, he would deport pro-Palestinian student demonstrators in order to get them to “behave”. The former president promised a crackdown on campus protests – that have swept across the country over the past few months – as he spoke at a roundtable event in New York earlier this month. “One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” Mr Trump said, according to event attendees, who spoke to The Washington Post anonymously. According to the sources, the former president joked that the group of donors at the event encompassed “98 per cent of my Jewish friends”. Protests have swept US college campuses since the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel , which killed about 1,200 people. The ensuing Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. At the roundtable event on 14 May, one of the donors present complained that many of the students and professors protesting on campuses could one day hold positions of power in the US. Mr Trump said that the demonstrations were a “radical revolution” that he promised to defeat, per The Post. Referencing efforts by the New York Police Department (NYPD) to clear protests at Columbia University last month, he praised the force and said that nationwide protests needed to be “stopped now”. “Well, if you get me elected, and you should really be doing this, if you get me reelected, we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years,” he said, according to the donors who spoke to The Post . The former president has made sweeping statements about the war in the Middle East, saying that it is time to “get back to peace and stop killing people”. According to The Post, Republican donors have recently lobbied him to take a stronger stance backing Israel and its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu . The Post reported, per its sources, that Mr Trump told donors behind closed doors that he supports Israel’s right to continue its “war on terror”. He has repeatedly claimed that the attack by Hamas on 7 October would have never happened if he were president at the time. The Independent has contacted the Trump campaign for comment about reports. It comes as the Biden administration faces strong calls to condemn Mr Netanyahu, after Israeli forces conducted an airstrike on tents in Rafah, meant for displaced Palestinians. The attack on Sunday killed at least 45 people and injured dozens more, according to Gaza health authorities. Mr Netanyahu subsequently called the strike “a tragic mistake” and said that it would be investigated. On Monday, Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American member of Congress, wrote on X: “Genocidal maniac Netanyahu told us he wants to ethically cleanse Palestinians. When are you going to believe him @POTUS?”",

        "description": "Officials are asking people to avoid the dead whale, which came ashore in Nehalem Bay State Park.",
        "content": "Officials are urging people to avoid a stretch of the north Oregon coast after a dead humpback whale washed ashore Monday morning. The whale came ashore on the sands of Nehalem Bay State Park, just south of Manzanita, prompting warnings from the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. All three agencies issued warnings Monday on posts to social media as well as signs on the beach. The area where the whale washed ashore is also a protected area for endangered snowy plovers, making it especially vulnerable to intrusions. “We’re asking people to please stay away from the carcass so it remains undisturbed,” Michael Milstein, a spokesperson for NOAA Fisheries, said Monday. “We intend to do an initial exam today to see what we can learn about possible cause of death.” The dead whale arrives as authorities are still busy investigating the source of that has been washing up on Oregon beaches and endangering wildlife. On Monday, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife said the substance to be petroleum based, but offered no other details, as responders continue to survey beaches in Oregon and Washington. Department spokesperson Beth Quillian said investigators are aware of the dead whale, but have not determined whether there is any connection to the tar-like substance. “We’re not going to know a cause of death at least for a week,” Quillian said. Dead whales are certainly not uncommon on the Oregon coast. Aside from the recent spate of dead gray whales, the ocean beaches have long been a repository for expired marine animals, including sharks, sea lions and all manner of strange fish. It’s also not unusual to see humpback whales off the Oregon coast this time of year, Milstein said, as the whales are currently migrating north from their breeding grounds in central America, with some passing along the Pacific coast. Dead whales are often , as the carcasses provide food for eagles and other scavengers. The agencies said they will determine what to do with the whale after their analysis. The dead humpback at Nehalem Bay is located in a more remote part of the state park, officials said, a decent walk from the nearest access road. -- covers travel and the outdoors and co-hosts the .

        "content": "BALTIMORE — Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBIs, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday. Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston's Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs — six earned — over four innings as Boston lost its third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles' six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore's Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore's lineup, but made the most of his 33rd career start. After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out, and drove Criswell's 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn't retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore's lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox's Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks in his first turn in the rotation and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. TRAINER'S ROOM Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O'Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was ''most likely'' to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said. UP NEXT Red Sox right-hander Brayan Bello will try to earn consecutive quality starts for the first time this season on Tuesday after allowing three runs in six innings of Boston's 8-5 win at Tampa Bay last Wednesday. The Orioles counter with right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, who tries for his first back-to-back wins since early April. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

        "content": "A teacher has gone viral on TikTok after one of his students posted a video of him playing the guitar to 50 Cent’s iconic hit ‘Candy Shop,’ leaving viewers impressed. While some teachers act more professionally during the day than others, it’s safe to say that most of them have a “fun side.” Many of them have secret talents, while into their class. TikToker Ava3767’s History teacher decided to show his fun side right before summer break, bringing his headless guitar to class to show off his talents by playing 50 Cent’s iconic song ‘Candy Shop’. “My history teacher went crazy,” read the text on the video. Users flooded the comments shocked at how good the teacher is at playing the guitar. “He’s the one making history,” one said. Another commented: “I swear every teacher has one insane talent outside of their profession.” “I love when teachers show their lore,” a third replied. After being floored by the first video going viral and gaining 3.5M views, Ava posted a second clip of her teacher playing the popular song. With 1.5M views and hundreds of comments just a day after uploading the second clip, viewers continued to be impressed with the teacher. “He looks like Yung Gravy and Matthew Lillard had a love child,” one user replied. Another commented: “I didn’t realize this song needed electric guitar. I’ll never hear it the same way again.” Teachers going viral on TikTok is far from a new phenomenon, thanks to the millions of different things that can happen inside a classroom.

        "content": "Avon Police visited the Lorain County Commission meeting earlier this month to request access to criminal felony records they cannot access because they’re in the county’s New World Systems database. “I’m respectfully requesting from the commissioners that Avon Police Department be given immediate access to law enforcement records from the New World system,” Avon Police Officer James Drozdowski told the commission. Currently, the department has 27 cases that have been ordered to be either sealed or expunged by area judges from the common pleas, municipal and domestic relations divisions, Drozdowski said. “I am unable to follow through to give them relief because we can’t get in the system,” he said. Drozdowski spent two days at the Lorain County Prosecutor’s office in an effort to straighten out the situation, however it remains unresolved. “We know the evidence is there,” Drozdowski said. “It’s frustrating to the detectives. It’s frustrating to us. And it’s unfair to the victims.” There are several open investigations, some of which were scheduled for hearings this month, that include major offenses such as narcotics and violent crimes where some information is missing because of the department’s inability to access the information. “The prosecutors are going into court basically with one hand tied behind their backs,” Drozdowski told the commission. “They don’t know if they have the full files.” Commission President Jeff Riddell addressed the matter at a meeting May 20 with a written statement. “Based on the City of Avon’s actions, by failing to extend the 2014 agreement as it relates to its Police Department with the New World System beyond the initial 10-year term ending in 2023, the Avon Police Department no longer has direct access to the System or the archived data under the terms of that agreement,” read Riddell’s statement. “In an effort to be good partners in serving the residents of Lorain County and the residents of the City of Avon, the County Prosecutors Office and the Board of County Commissioners have made and continue to make available to Avon access to its archived data. Additionally, Avon, at its discretion, currently has the ability to contract directly with Tyler Technologies, for a fee, for access its their archived data.” “The argument that Mr. Drozdowski made, on behalf of the City of Avon, that upwards of 27 cases are in various phase of prosecutorial jeopardy or other legal action is at the feet of the County falls flat on its merits,” the statement also said. “It is the City of Avon, at the direction of its Police Chief, that voluntarily opted not to continue with the New World System. In the City’s haste to leave the New World System to use a different platform – Sundance, Avon failed to plan and migrate the data from one System to another. The City of Avon could have avoided this situation by either not leaving New World or by adequately planning the transition from one system to another.”",

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump’s trial in New York is nearing an end. On May 28, the prosecution and defense will sum up their cases, allowing jurors to deliberate on their verdict. The Manhattan District Attorney has charged President Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records to the first degree, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Throughout the trial, prosecutors have shown emails, texts, phone call logs, contracts, and other documentation in efforts to establish that there was a scheme in place to influence the 2016 presidential election, and an effort to conceal it in the creation of 11 payments to ex-lawyer Michael Cohen. They have argued that the records speak for themselves and are evidence of intent to defraud. However, the records are of mixed relevance. Some were directly related to the $420,000 payment to Mr. Cohen, while others included text conversations unrelated to the events of the case, or even book excerpts from old Trump books on business advice. During jury selection, prosecutors had used the example of a man hiring a hitman which seemed to annoy the defense, arguing that the man would be guilty even though he had not pulled the trigger. They may remind jurors that the prosecutors needed to show that President Trump caused false records to be created, but not that he created them himself. The rest of the 22 witnesses were called by prosecutors, largely to enter records into evidence, except for a few who gave lengthy, narrative testimonies, during which defense attorneys seized upon inconsistencies. Stephanie Clifford, better known as adult performer Stormy Daniels, and Mr. Cohen are considered to be at the center of the case because the 34 business records comprising the charges are only falsified if it is found that they were created to cover up a scheme necessitating this payment. However, both witnesses were at times argumentative and evasive on the stand, gave inconsistent details, and acknowledged their animosity toward President Trump and financial interest in criticizing him publicly. Defense attorneys are likely to cast them both as opportunists. President Trump has denied an alleged sexual encounter with Ms. Clifford, and the defense pointed out during cross-examination of Ms. Clifford that she told different accounts of the alleged encounter at different times, and suggested her inconsistent claims about why she came out with her story showed motivation to extort. The defense attorneys have argued that Mr. Cohen is a liar, pointing to his track record of lying under oath and possibly to his new admission of stealing at least $30,000 from the Trump Organization by requesting more than he was owed for a payment he made to Red Finch for polling services. Two other witnesses gave longer testimonies, but much of it had been to provide context for an alleged scheme. David Pecker, former head of American Media Inc., testified for a week about stories he bought to suppress because he believed they would harm the Trump campaign. However, neither of those stories was related to the charges. Keith Davidson, attorney for Ms. Clifford, testified at length, offering color and context to the agreement Mr. Cohen entered into with Ms. Clifford. Mr. Davidson made it clear on the witness stand that the non-disclosure agreement they signed was a completely legal contract, something defense attorneys are likely to remind jurors. Defense attorneys will also be restricted from explaining the law to jurors, but they are likely to remind the jury that the non-disclosure agreement, popularly termed “hush money” by prosecutors, is completely legal, as is influencing an election through lawful means.",

The recently wowed spectators at the Cannes premiere of showing up to the Croisette in a sheer blue corset gown with sparkling details. She topped off her custom design by Cong Tri with perfectly matched Gianvito Rossi heels and Gabriel & Co. fine jewels, finishing everything off with an icy manicure in the shade Glacier. “My first Cannes,” she about the look. “To the [L'Oréal Paris] team, THANK YOU! I am typing this with the biggest smile on my face. And thank you [Cong Tri] for this custom gown, I felt sexy, and felt like a princess. Didn’t know both at the same time were achievable.” While the ice princess vibes were definitely strong, King's cascading blonde waves gave the arctic look a bit of a mermaid twist—but it wasn't to last. Joey King on May 24, 2024. Other than referencing her icy debut with crystal-dripping opera gloves, Joey King completely transformed for Cannes Film Festival's closing ceremony on May 25, showing up on the red carpet in a yellow keyhole column dress and brand-new, ultra-short mushroom bob. “Custom @miumiu & a chop for Cannes day 2 with @lorealparis,” King , lest you questioned if she was somehow hiding her length for the aesthetic. Hey, celebs ! Joey King on May 25, 2024. Nope, Joey King's bob appears to be the real deal, despite what one follower . For her latest red carpet moment, she sported a middle-part, with the ends curved towards her jaw and one side of her bob tucked behind her ear. Let's take a closer look: Joey King on May 25, 2024. Clearly, Joey King was looking to make an impact at the French film festival—and this bold transformation certainly did the trick.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON ( ) — Republicans moved their long-awaited new farm bill through the U.S. House Agriculture Committee this week, despite opposition from most Democrats that could stall further advancement of the bill. The massive $1.5 trillion legislation would set policy and funding levels for key food, agriculture and conservation programs for the next five years. After a marathon markup Thursday, the GOP-authored bill cleared the committee after midnight Friday, 33-21, with four Democratic votes. The committee’s bill would increase farm “safety net” payments for some commodity crops, expand eligibility for disaster assistance and increase funding for specialty crops, organic farmers and dairy farmers. It is expected to cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years. A title-by-title summary of the can be found . Democrats Don Davis of North Carolina, Sanford Bishop of Georgia, Yadira Caraveo of Colorado and Eric Sorenson of Illinois joined all committee Republicans to vote to advance the bill. After hours of heated debate and criticism from Democrats, support from the four lawmakers across the aisle seemed to surprise House Agriculture Chair Glenn “GT” Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican who was the bill’s primary sponsor. His microphone picked up his aside as the vote concluded: “That was bipartisan. I did not see that one coming.” But the tepid Democratic support is likely not enough to see this version of the bill through to final passage in the House. A handful of Republicans typically oppose farm bills over fiscal concerns. And even Democrats who voted for the bill in the House committee said it needs major changes before it could make it into law. The measure does not have support of Democrats in the Senate or the White House. “Everyone knows that this bill would never become law. The Senate won’t accept it, and the administration won’t accept it,” Rep. David Scott of Georgia, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said at the markup. “And while this bill is a giant misstep, it nevertheless begins our journey toward passing a farm bill.” As the House committee debated the bill, Michigan Democrat Debbie Stabenow, the chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in an interview Thursday that the House proposal has no chance in the Senate. “It tears up the farm and food coalition and does not have the votes to pass on the House floor. And certainly not in the Senate,” Stabenow told States Newsroom. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack that the farm bill draft would damage the coalition that traditionally has united behind farm bills and “raises the real possibility of being unable to get a farm bill through the process.” The committee vote – which came eight months after the previous farm bill expired – was the first step in what is expected to continue to be a protracted dispute over food and farm policy. Many farm commodity groups have come out in support of the bill, but it faces opposition from hunger advocacy groups as well as fiscal conservatives. Heritage Foundation, National Taxpayers Union and Taxpayers for Common Sense, along with Environmental Working Group, united this week to oppose the legislation, which they characterized as a government giveaway to favored special interests. The groups, which span the ideological spectrum, contend the proposed legislation would spend tens of billions of dollars in subsidies that would overwhelmingly go to a relatively small number of farmers who grow certain commodity crops. Historically, farm bills have brought together lawmakers across party lines, uniting on regional interests. The massive bill stitches together support for agriculture producers, energy and conservation programs on farmland and food and nutrition programs for families in need. But committee members are deeply divided over limits on nutrition and climate programs that are the funding mechanisms for the Republican bill. “This, on the policy side, is a very good bill,” Rep. Angie Craig, a Minnesota Democrat, said. “But on the payment side, how do you get to your math?” The for Democrats is a funding calculation that would place limits on the formula that calculates benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, the food aid program formerly referred to as food stamps. “One of the reasons it is so hard to negotiate the little items on this bill is because the big items and the funding mechanism are so fundamentally flawed,” Maine Democrat Chellie Pingree said. The bill would limit future updates to the Thrifty Food Plan, the formula that calculates benefits for SNAP. This would result in a nearly $30 billion reduction in spending over ten years, based on the estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, lawmakers say. “If we want a farm bill that is able to pass into law with the bipartisan levels that it requires to pass beyond this committee, it is necessary that we go back to the negotiating table and remove this provision,” Caraveo said. Caraveo, who faces a tough re-election in a toss-up district, ultimately voted in favor of the bill. Connecticut Democrat Jahana Hayes offered an amendment that would have struck the changes to the program. But after more than two hours of impassioned debate on the issue Thursday night, the amendment failed on a party-line vote, 25-29. The farm bill has to remain budget neutral, so lawmakers must fit their proposals into a baseline projection of how much the government would spend over the next 10 years if the current farm bill was extended. The House Republican bill would offset increases in payments for farmers by placing limits on SNAP and a discretionary account at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The committee-passed bill would put limits on USDA’s discretionary Commodity Credit Corporation account and would remove climate-smart policy requirements for about $13 billion in conservation projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. “Farmers agree that this is good money that has come to all of our states, and is critically important,” Pingree said. “So taking away this authority from one agriculture secretary maybe because you don’t like one program is completely misguided. It’s not thinking into the future.” On the Senate side, Stabenow released an outline of her own for the farm bill in early May but said she is waiting for language from Republicans before they can move forward. Among other things, Stabenow’s bill would boost eligibility for nutrition programs for low-income people like SNAP. Stabenow made public a summary of the bill, but not legislative text. Arkansas Republican John Boozman, the Senate Agriculture Committee’s top Republican, said Thursday he supports the direction on the farm bill from the House Agriculture Committee but was not optimistic about swift movement in his chamber. “We’ve got a lot of headwinds,” Boozman said in an interview with States Newsroom on Thursday. Boozman said he plans to release language in the coming weeks but indicated lawmakers might be headed toward another extension if they cannot make progress swiftly. “When I visit with the farm groups, I think their attitude is that rather than just doing something, if it’s not meaningful, we’re better off waiting,” Boozman told States Newsroom. “This is a five-year commitment. And, again, if we’re not going to do meaningful changes, to improve the safety of the farmers, it’s probably not worth doing.” The farm bill is generally considered “must-pass” legislation. Lawmakers must rewrite the sweeping legislation every five years to set mandatory funding levels and policy. The current farm bill expired at the end of September 2023 but most programs have continued through extensions. The current extension lasts until the end of September, but it is not clear if lawmakers will make that deadline – especially as attention turns to election campaigns over the summer and fall. The farm bill votes could be fuel in upcoming elections. As the House committee debated the measure Thursday, the GOP candidate in the Michigan U.S. Senate race to replace Stabenow criticized Democratic candidate and committee member Elissa Slotkin for her stance on the bill. Republican Mike Rogers took to X (formerly Twitter) to say Slotkin had not focused enough on the bill. While the House committee engaged in 13 hours of debate on the farm bill markup, Democrats and Republicans acknowledged that there would need to be more negotiations on the bill before it could become law. Rep. Frank Lucas, an Oklahoma Republican and longtime committee member who chaired the panel from 2011 to 2015, characterized the committee vote as “the first step of a long journey.” “Now, ultimately, ultimately, we must work with each other to advance a comprehensive committee product,” Lucas said. “As we begin this process, I want to remind all my colleagues, the real struggle is not here in the Ag Committee, but on the floor of the United States House and in the conference committee. We will sort out our differences with the United States Senate.” SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

Cabrera told Sun.Star Pampanga that she opened the new facility this year to provide a venue for locals to sell their food products. The food park, which opened early this May to little fanfare, has been attracting locals and even people from neighboring towns, especially during the late afternoon. The food park, which carries the slogan “Manyaman Keni”, features vendors selling local delicacies, cooked meals, grilled food, and ready-to-eat food. A couple of concrete tables provide customers a place to eat and view the town’s vast pond area. The area is a favorite stopover of local bikers and joggers. “We wanted to have a place for food vendors to sell their products where there are people who can readily patronize them,\" Cabrera said.",

        "content": "Europe’s rivers, lakes and groundwater are riddled with “alarming” levels of a persistent man-made ‘forever chemical’ linked to synthetic pesticides, a coalition of non-governmental organisations said on Monday. The European Pesticide Action Network (PAN Europe) and its members analysed more than two dozen surface and groundwater samples from 10 European Union countries and found PFAS long-life substances in all. ALSO READ: Heads must roll over dirty water They said the abundance of one chemical in particular, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), represented “the largest known area-wide contamination by a man-made chemical” that well exceeded limits proposed by the 27-nation EU. “The extent of the contamination is alarming and calls for decisive action,” PAN Europe said in a new report detailing its findings. Widely used in everyday items like cosmetics, non-stick pans and fire extinguishers, PFAS are highly durable products that can take centuries to break down. They have been detected in water, air, fish and soil in the remotest corners of the globe, and concern over their possible impact on human health has been growing. Degrading PFAS used in pesticides are a major source of TFA. They are also released into the atmosphere from certain cooling systems and eventually enter the water cycle through rain. TFA is the “perfect” groundwater contaminant because it is highly soluble in water, extremely mobile and evades soil and other natural filters that remove pollutants, the report said. “They can enter the groundwater almost unhindered and remain there for centuries,” it said. ALSO READ: Mpumalanga municipality fined R200m for polluting rivers The samples, tested by the Water Technology Centre in Karlsruhe, Germany, found TFA in all water samples, with concentrations ranging from 370 nanograms per litre to 3,300 ng/L. Some 79 percent of samples had TFA levels above the proposed EU Drinking Water Directive limit of 500 ng/l for total PFAS, the report said. A decision to class TFA as ‘non-relevant’ under EU pesticide regulations was “regrettable” considering its “toxicological profile still leaves many questions unanswered”, it added. It said a recent study on rabbits and TFA exposure found birth defects in offspring, raising serious concerns about this chemical. PAN Europe called for urgent interventions to address this “political failure”, starting with a “rapid ban” on PFAS pesticides and a rethink on the threat posed by individual chemicals like TFA. © Agence France-Presse",

        "content": "THE British Library is being plagued by randy book lovers romping in loos. Bosses have been forced to call in cops to try to put a stop to the novel use of the venue. One bookworm complained to the library, describing the between-the-sheets bonkbusting as “totally unacceptable”. He said security chiefs had confirmed that bosses were aware of randy students and local workers foolscapping around in the toilets after arranging book-ups online. A post on a “cruisers” website — which The Sun is not naming — advertises the library as being a meeting spot for casual sex with a “vast amount of toilets” on site. But it warns hardback fans that there are regular police and security patrols of the building and there had been cases reported of bonk lovers caught during a private reading being escorted from the site. Last night the distinguished library at London’s King’s Cross denounced the unliterary conduct. A spokesperson said: “The British Library is a public institution and our site at St Pancras is visited by more than one million people every year. “All of the Library’s public areas and facilities, including the toilets, are regularly patrolled by on-site security staff to ensure that they are being used appropriately. “Inappropriate behaviour is not tolerated and the Library works closely with the police to ensure the safety and security of the Library’s buildings and users.”",

        "content": "Graduation indeed is one of the momentous points in a person’s life as it marks the sense of accomplishment and success that result from hard work and perseverance. It serves as a milestone that opens the door to many opportunities for a person to reach his life-long dreams and aspirations. Truly, it is also an occasion that may symbolize the beginning of an independent and rewarding life. During my pre-employment talks, I always try to motivate future graduates regarding the “reality” waiting for them the moment they step out of the university. I ask them to look at the person seated beside them, who may be their closest friend in college. But after graduation, this person whom they consider as their best friend will become his or her direct competitor as they both carry the same degree from the same university. So, to impel them into a reality check, I ask them this very thought-provoking question: “What do you have that other graduates like you don’t have?” And just as I anticipated their reactions, I could see a sense of sudden realization on their faces. After more than eight years of teaching at a state university, I feel happiness and pride whenever my students graduate. It’s as if I am their parent who saw them grow and mature as the years passed. I have asked myself a couple of times, am I that old to see these students graduate? And suddenly, I realized it had been four or five years ago when I first handled their English classes when they were still freshmen. However, it is unfortunate nowadays that these graduates do not end up where they are supposed to be. I have several former students whom I have seen working in supermarkets as cashiers and baggers, and I can’t explain how I feel whenever I see them. As graduates of a four-year course, they do not deserve to work in blue-collar jobs. At least, they should be office assistants in government agencies and private companies, call center agents, or even professionals in multinational companies here and abroad. Hence, the problem is not actually unemployment but rather it is underemployment that besets our country nowadays. Add to that the impact of the ASEAN integration on labor demands and market wherein based on a study, the projected growth in the country will be focused on low-skill employment. Secondly, there will also be fewer new jobs for women, possibly in sectors that are vulnerable and informal leading to greater inequalities. Another possible consequence of the ASEAN integration will also affect professionals as other Asian workers will be welcomed to work in our country. And with the increasing popularity and utilization of artificial intelligence in the academe and even in the workplace, the question is also on whether our acquired skills and knowledge in schools and universities are still relevant and will be needed in the future. Are we seeing the looming end to human talent?",

Set a deposit limit. Rozee in doubt for mega Blues clash | 00:40 PORT ADELAIDE v CARLTON Thursday May 30, 7:30pm at Adelaide Oval Power’s Round 11 side B: K.Farrell, E.Ratugolea, B.Zerk-Thatcher HB: M.Bergman, A.Aliir, D.Houston C: T.Boak, O.Wines, W.Drew HF: D.Byrne-Jones, T.Marshall, M.Georgiades F: Z.Butters, J.Finlayson, W.Rioli FOLL: J.Sweet, J.Horne-Francis, C.Rozee - C I/C: J.Mead, J.McEntee, La.Jones, R.Burton, J.Burgoyne EMG: D.Visentini, T.Anastasopoulos, F.Evans Team Tips: The big question mark is over Connor Rozee (ankle), who’ll be a test for the Thursday night blockbuster against the Blues. The Power will need to find a replacement for Willie Rioli who suffered a calf injury early against North Melbourne. Francis Evans would be among the leading contenders to replace him after amassing 21 disposals and a goal in the SANFL, while untried forward Tom Anastasopoulos could also be given a go. Ruck Ivan Soldo played his first game back after knee surgery in the SANFL but expect him to play at least another week there to build some match fitness. Quinton Narkle and Trent McKenzie also returned from injury via the SANFL last week. Blues’ Round 11 side B: A.Saad, J.Weitering, L.Cowan HB: B.Kemp, M.McGovern, N.Newman C: O.Hollands, P.Cripps - C, B.Acres HF: Z.Williams, H.McKay, E.Hollands F: O.Fantasia, C.Curnow, M.Owies FOLL: T.De Koning, S.Walsh, M.Kennedy I/C: J.Boyd, G.Hewett, A.Cincotta, L.Fogarty, J.Carroll EMG: C.Durdin, Le.Young, J.Binns Team Tips: Livewire small forward Jesse Motlop played his first game of 2024 in the VFL on the weekend but struggled to make an impact with just five disposals and a goal. Jaxon Binns continues to push his case for a senior recall with 25 touches, which could put pressure on a player like Alex Cincotta (seven disposals). Jack Carroll and Orazio Fantasia also struggled to impact the contest against the Suns. AFL umps express sympathy for tacklers | 00:56 COLLINGWOOD v WESTERN BULLDOGS Friday May 31, 7:40pm at Marvel Stadium Pies’ Round 11 side B: C.Dean, D.Moore - C, B.Frampton HB: I.Quaynor, J.Noble, S.Pendlebury C: S.Sidebottom, B.McCreery, J.Daicos HF: B.Hill, N.Daicos, B.Mihocek F: E.Allan, P.Lipinski, H.Harrison FOLL: D.Cameron, J.Crisp, L.Schultz I/C: B.Maynard, J.Richards, L.Sullivan, W.Parker, M.Cox EMG: N.Kreuger, F.Macrae, A.Johnson Team Tips: The premiers are nowhere near peak condition right now, though they’re still not losing, which is pretty impressive. Collingwood will need to find replacements for Mason Cox (leg/concussion), Joe Richards (foot) and Brody Mihocek for their clash against the Bulldogs, plus Jordan De Goey is set to miss another month with an ab tendon tear. That puts the likes of Reef McInnes, Nathan Kreuger and Ash Johnson in the frame for senior selection. Collingwood’s VFL side didn’t have a match last week, but the Pies will be hoping to potentially get Jeremy Howe and Jack Bytel back from injury. Jamie Elliott (vascular) and Tom Mitchell (foot) are confusingly both 2-5 weeks away, while Will Hoskin-Elliott (hamstring) should be back in a fortnight. Depending on how they’re looking on the injury front, debutants Wil Parker and Ed Allan, along with defender Charlie Dean , could end up being unlucky at selection. Bulldogs’ Round 11 side B: L.Bramble, L.Jones, R.Sanders HB: T.Duryea, A.Keath, B.Dale C: B.Williams, A.Treloar, J.Harmes HF: L.Vandermeer, A.Naughton, J.Macrae F: S.Darcy, J.Ugle-Hagan, R.West FOLL: T.English, M.Bontempelli - C, E.Richards I/C: C.Daniel, J.Freijah, H.Gallagher, R.Garcia, A.Scott EMG: L.Cleary, R.Lobb, J. O’Donnell Team Tips: Luke Beveridge will be forced into at least three changes this week with Aaron Naughton (knee), Ed Richards (concussion) and Anthony Scott (concussion) all already ruled out. Expect Rory Lobb to be a straight replacement for Naughton, while Luke Cleary and James O’Donnell (illness) are both likely to be in the mix at selection as well. Oskar Baker (22 disposals) and Lachie McNeil (two goals) were strong at VFL level too. Coaches open up on ball holding drama | 03:25 HAWTHORN v ADELAIDE CROWS Saturday June 1, 1:45pm at the MCG Hawks’ Round 11 side B: J.Impey - C, S.Frost, C.Jiath HB: K.Amon, J.Sicily, M.D’Ambrosio C: C.Nash, J.Worpel, J.Weddle HF: W.Day, C.Mackenzie, L.Breust F: J.Ginnivan, B.Hardwick, M.Chol FOLL: L.Meek, J.Newcombe, D.Moore I/C: C.Macdonald, S.Mitchell, C.Dear, J.Gunston, J.Scrimshaw EMG: F. Maginness, E. Phillips, J. Ward Team Tips: The Hawks have been one of the most in-form sides in the competition over the last six weeks so expect Sam Mitchell to continue to back a winning formula. Chad Wingard has now played four matches at VFL level as he strives to make his senior return after an achilles injury in 2023. Nick Watson was managed last week and will be in the frame to return, which could see Luke Breust’ s or Seamus Mitchell’ s place in the 23 come under a bit of heat. Crows’ Round 11 side B: B.Smith, J.Butts, C.Jones HB: J.Borlase, M.Keane, M.Michalanney C: M.Hinge, J.Soligo, J.Dawson - C HF: L.Sholl, T.Walker, J.Rachele F: C.Burgess, D.Fogarty, L.Murphy FOLL: R.O’Brien, R.Laird, H.Schoenberg I/C: M.Crouch, B.Cook, S.Berry, L.Nankervis, B.Keays EMG: W. Hamill, N. McHenry, K. Strachan Team Tips: Hard to see Matthew Nicks making many changes at selection after a monster 99-point defeat over the Eagles. The untried Zac Taylor was solid in the SANFL with 23 disposals and nine clearances but it’s hard to see how he forces his way in. Nick Murray is nearing a return from a knee injury in other positive news, which would eventually put some pressure on a player like James Borlase . Crows run riot in thrashing of Eagles | 02:07 WEST COAST EAGLES v ST KILDA Saturday June 1, 4:35pm at Optus Stadium Eagles’ Round 11 side B: J.Rotham, T.Barrass, B.Hough HB: T.Cole, J.McGovern, L.Duggan - C C: J.Hunt, T.Kelly, R.Ginbey HF: D.Sheed, J.Waterman, J.Cripps F: L.Ryan, J.Darling, R.Maric FOLL: B.Williams, E.Yeo, H.Reid I/C: C.Chesser, A.Witherden, J.Jones, J.Williams, T.Dewar EMG: A. Gaff, C. Hall, H. Edwards Team Tips: You’d imagine Adam Simpson makes some changes after a brutal defeat to the Crows last week. Veteran Andrew Gaff (34 disposals) continues to bang down the door, while Zane Trew (36 disposals), Jai Culley (23 disposals) and Harry Edwards (24 disposals) were strong performers in the WAFL. Almost half of West Coast’s side had ten disposals or less against Adelaide. Off-season recruits Matt Flynn and Tyler Brockman are two others who will look to put their hands up for selection in the coming weeks. Saints’ Round 11 side B: J.Battle, D.Howard, C.Wilkie HB: J.Webster, L.Stocker, N.Wanganeen-Milera C: S.Ross, J.Sinclair, M.Wood HF: D.Wilson, B.Hill, L.Henry F: M.Owens, M.King, A.Caminiti FOLL: R.Marshall, J.Steele - C, M.Windhager I/C: J.Higgins, L.Collard, P.Dow, R.Bonner, C.Sharman EMG: Z. Jones, R. Byrnes, B. Paton Team Tips: While St Kilda might be struggling in the AFL, their VFL affiliate, Sandringham, pulled off a great win against Casey in the VFL. Spearhead Tim Membrey booted six goals while former Sandringham Dragons product Olli Hotton kicked five majors as he seeks an AFL debut. Brad Crouch (30 disposals), Zak Jones (25 disposals) and Hunter Clark (30 disposals) all found plenty of the footy in the VFL. Mattaes Phillipou responded to his second axing of 2024 with 20 disposals, while small forward Dan Butler kicked 1.3 from 16 touches. Cooper Sharman, Lance Collard, Liam Stocker and Anthony Caminiti are among the names who might be in the firing line for Ross Lyon at selection this week. 'Throw an extra $1 million at them' | 00:51 GEELONG v RICHMOND Saturday June 1, 7:30pm at GMHBA Stadium Cats’ Round 11 side B: Z.Guthrie, J.Henry, J.Kolodjashnij HB: T.Stewart - C, M.Holmes, O.Mullin C: O.Dempsey, T.Bruhn, Z.Tuohy HF: T.Stengle, B.Close, G.Miers F: S.Neale, T.Hawkins, O.Henry FOLL: T.Conway, M.Blicavs, M.Duncan I/C: S.De Koning, J.Bowes, T.Atkins, J.Cameron, J.Clark EMG: C.O’Sullivan, S.Mannagh, M.O’Connor Team Tips: Superstar Patrick Dangerfield could be in line for his first match since round eight as he pushes to return from a hamstring injury. Brandan Parfitt had 24 touches after being dropped last week, while young midfielder Mitch Hardie had 36 disposals as he searches for an AFL debut. The Cats will need to find replacements for suspended duo Mark Blicavs and Jhye Clark , who were both handed one-match bans by the MRO. The Cats could recall Rhys Stanley to bolster their ruck division, after young pair Toby Conway and Shannon Neale struggled against the Giants. Shaun Mannagh and James Willis both booted three goals in the VFL as well, while prized draftee Connor O’Sullivan had 16 touches and a goal. Expect Irishman Mark O’Connor, who was an emergency last week, to push for selection as well given his versatility. Tigers’ Round 11 side B: B.Miller, N.Broad, J.Short HB: N.Vlastuin, T.Brown, D.Rioli C: H.Ralphsmith, L.Baker, K.McIntosh HF: M.Pickett, S.Bolton, T.Sonsie F: M.Lefau, D.Martin, N.Balta FOLL: T.Nankervis - C, D.Prestia, T.Dow I/C: S.Campbell, S.Green, K.McAuliffe, S.Ryan, N.Cumberland EMG: K.Smith, S.Banks, T.Young Team Tips: Richmond’s injury crisis continues, with both Shai Bolton (concussion) and Tylar Young (knee) declared unavailable for the clash against Geelong. However, reinforcements could be arriving in the form of Jack Graham and Rhyan Mansell , but don’t expect to see Jacob Hopper back just yet after he suffered a setback in his recovery from a hamstring issue. Adem Yze was far more content with the Tigers output against the Bombers than their past month and given the lack of options at selection, he’ll probably make as few changes as necessary at selection. Jacob Koschitzke (19 disposals, ten marks in VFL) might be preferred in place of Samson Ryan . 'He just wanted to make a statement' | 01:43 MELBOURNE v FREMANTLE Sunday June 2, 1:00pm at TIO Trager Park Demons’ Round 11 side B: J.Bowey, S.May, T.Rivers HB: J.McVee, T.McDonald, A.Tomlinson C: E.Langdon, C.Oliver, C.Windsor HF: A.Neal-Bullen, H.Petty, K.Pickett F: K.Chandler, B.Fritsch, S.McAdam FOLL: M.Gawn - C, J.Viney, C.Petracca I/C: J.van Rooyen, L.Hunter, T.Sparrow, T.Woewodin, C.Salem EMG: J. Billings, B. Howes, T. Fullarton Team Tips: Young key forward Matthew Jefferson booted five goals for Casey and could come into calculations for his first AFL game this weekend, while veteran Ben Brown booted three majors which will put pressure on Harrison Petty , who was subbed out with a foot issue. Former Saint Jack Billings had 24 touches and five clearances after being axed last week, while cult hero in the making Koltyn Tholstrup had 23 disposals. Taj Woewodin and Shane McAdam both struggled to have an impact, while Caleb Windsor might be in need of a rest despite a superb debut season so far. Dockers’ Round 11 side B: H.Chapman, A.Pearce - C, J.Draper HB: J.Aish, L.Ryan, J.Clark C: J.Sharp, A.Brayshaw, H.Young HF: M.Walters, S.Switkowski, L.Jackson F: J.Treacy, J.Amiss, J.O’Meara FOLL: S.Darcy, C.Serong, N.Fyfe I/C: B.Banfield, M.Johnson, T.Emmett, B.Walker, C.Wagner EMG: N.Erasmus, P.Voss, S.Sturt Team Tips: Key forward Patrick Voss continues to dominate in the state leagues, booting five majors in the WAFL on the weekend. Neil Erasmus (33 disposals), Will Brodie (24 disposals) and Karl Worner (24 disposals) all found plenty of the footy. Corey Wagner and Tom Emmett were both quiet against Collingwood on Friday night and might find themselves omitted this week. In a big boost for Justin Longmuir’s side, Michael Frederick is likely to be available assuming he passes through the concussion protocols during the week. Dees destroy Saints in MCG blitzing | 03:05 GOLD COAST SUNS v ESSENDON Sunday June 2, 4pm at People First Stadium Suns’ Round 11 side B: S.Collins, C.Ballard, M.Andrew HB: S.Flanders, B.Uwland, J.Jeffrey C: D.Swallow, T.Miller - C, S.Clohesy HF: J.Walter, B.Long, L.Johnston F: B.King, M.Rowell, J.Lukosius FOLL: J.Witts, N.Anderson, B.Humphrey I/C: A.Sexton, N.Holman, B.Ainsworth, T.Berry, J.Rogers EMG: A.Davies, B.Fiorini, H.Oea Team Tips: A frustrating but not awful loss for the Suns last week, who’ll have confidence in their return home to favourable conditions. They’ll likely be boosted by the return of Malcolm Rosas jnr from a hamstring injury, making Lachie Weller - less than two months away from recovering from his long-term knee injury - the only notable name left on the injury list. They have plenty of options after Ned Moyle , Alex Davies , Sam Day and Brayden Fiorini were omitted out of the Geelong loss last Saturday, with Day bagging four goals in the VFL, and Fiorini’s 37 disposals only outpaced by Rory Atkins (40). The young Will Graham (17 contested possessions, seven clearances) is a more likely inclusion, if Damien Hardwick is keen. Bombers’ Round 11 side B: J.Ridley, B.McKay, J.Laverde HB: N.Martin, M.Redman, A.McGrath C: D.Heppell, S.Durham, J.Kelly HF: J.Gresham, N.Caddy, A.Perkins F: J.Stringer, P.Wright, K.Langford FOLL: T.Goldstein, J.Caldwell, Z.Merrett - C I/C: E.Tsatas, N.Cox, N.Hind, A.Davey Jnr, M.Guelfi EMG: A.Roberts, N.Bryan, J.Menzie Team Tips: A few concentrated concerns in the midfield for the in-form Bombers. Ben Hobbs missed Dreamtime at the ‘G with a calf strain and will be out until at least Round 15; he was likely to get more midfield time with Darcy Parish sidelined with his own calf complaint, and Will Setterfield (knee) estimated to be a week away. Does Dylan Shiel get another chance? He missed the VFL loss to Richmond with illness, with Jye Menzie and Nick Bryan among the best in the reserves. Scans on Nik Cox ’s hamstring issue from Saturday night were positive, with no strain and the club “expecting his symptoms to resolve quite quickly”.

        "content": "James Schiller has opened up on why he’s signed with the Knights from next season, admitting he had “a lot of sleepless nights” while mulling over the decision. Schiller has inked a three-year deal with the Knights from next season and despite it being a “very hard” decision the 22-year-old hasn’t let it show in his footy. Schiller scored a first-half hat-trick while playing centre in the Raiders’ 36-28 win over the Roosters in New South Wales Cup. He also finished the game with two linebreaks, seven tackle busts and 275 running metres, while also making seven tackles with zero misses.

Start your free trial today > Speaking to Fox League post-game, Schiller revealed the performance had come just a fortnight after he had Covid-19. He also spoke for the first time about his upcoming move to Newcastle, revealing the opportunity to forge a career at centre was the big luring factor. Schiller, who played five NRL games on the wing this season before being dropped, will likely be stuck behind Dane Gagai and Bradman Best in 2025 after the former re-signed for two more years. But his path will become clearer once 33-year-old Gagai retires — as opposed to at the Raiders where Matt Timoko and Seb Kris are 24 and 25 respectively. Luai excited to partner Hynes in halves | 01:29 “There was a lot to weigh up with that one,” Schiller conceded. “It wasn’t taken lightly, it took me a couple of months to think about. “I’ve got an opportunity up there to play centre and explore my game more at centre. “I could’ve stayed here definitely and worked away on the wing. It’s no disrespect to Matty (Timoko) and Seb (Kris) but you’ve got to be realistic in these situations and they’re two international footballers that I know I’ll be behind for a while. “I’m honoured to be behind them and even playing outside some of them but I just had to do what’s best for me. “I’ve done my time here in Canberra and I’ve got family up in Newcastle I’d like to spend a bit more time with as well. “It was a very hard one to think about — lots of sleepless night — but I’m excited for it and it’s definitely a good change.” Read on for the latest Reserve Grade Wrap. ALL EYES WERE ON... Two weeks after suffering a first-round knockout loss to Kenny Niko, NRL star-turned boxer Tevita Pangai Junior returned to the rugby league field. Pangai Junior played Round 1 for Souths Logan — feeder side to the Broncos — but then turned his attention to his professional boxing career. The 28-year-old said after the fight that he “will rebuild and go back to footy” — and he returned with a bang over the weekend. Pangai Junior started at prop in the Magpies’ loss to Pride and finished with 171 running metres, four tackle busts and three offloads, while also making 18 tackles with zero misses. Blake Taaffe had a chance to prove his worth in the halves with the 25-year-old donning the No.7 in the Bulldogs’ loss to the Dragons. His kicking game was hot and cold with one grubber rebounding off the posts for Taaffe to score, while another kick went dead. He ran for 67 metres and made 26 tackles but also missed seven.

Meanwhile, his older brother Haele brought plenty of spark off the bench. The 23-year-old hooker set up a try, got two linebreak assists, four tackle busts and was rewarded with a try of his own out of dummy-half. The Couchman twins once again go through a mountain off work up front. Toby finished with 20 runs for 210 metres — 109 post-contact — a linebreak assist, five tackle busts and 33 tackles with zero misses. And that was in 57 minutes on the field. Ryan played the full 80 minutes and finished with 22 runs for 211 metres — 106 post-contact — and 44 tackles, one miss. The Raiders have an exciting prospect in Noah Martin coming through the ranks. The 19-year-old made his NSW Cup debut in Round 5 and on the weekend had his best performance to date. Martin, who is on a development deal and moves into the Top 30 in 2026, played 80 minutes for the first time and finished with a try assist, a linebreak, five tackle busts, 122 metres and 30 tackles — one miss. The Roosters staged a second-half comeback to almost snatch the win from the Raiders but ultimately fell away in the final 10 minutes. Central to their turnaround was teenage five-eighth Jake Elliott , who scored a double, set up two more tries, got a linebreak, a linebreak assist, four tackle busts and 86 running metres. Ethan King also tried his guts out after being a late switch before kick-off to fullback — his preferred position — to replace the injured Callum Gromek. King scored a try, got a linebreak, five tackle busts and 182 running metres. He also soldiered on with tape around his nose after copping a nasty knock. Siua Wong is expected to get some opportunities in first grade during the Origin period and he proved he is more than ready for a recall. While Wong has mainly played on an edge in the NRL, he’s spent some time at prop in NSW Cup in recent weeks. The 21-year-old punched out 80 minutes in the middle and finished with a team-high of 224 running metres as well as 20 tackles, no misses. Newtown have four wins on the trot after smashing the depleted Panthers 44-6. Centre Chris Vea’ila bagged a hat-trick, a linebreak, a linebreak assist, six tackle busts and ran 153 metres, while Sam Stonestreet scored a double on the wing, got two linebreaks and ran 147 metres. Young fullback Liam Ison was electric too, finishing with a try assist, a linebreak, two linebreak assists, seven tackle busts and 178 metres. The Eels are also enjoying a run of form. After waiting until Round 6 to get their first win of the season, they’re now on a four-game winning streak. Teenage playmaker Ethan Sanders had the ball on a string in their most recent win over the Rabbitohs, setting up two tries, getting a linebreak, a linebreak assist, four tackle busts and 75 running metres. He also made 14 tackles with zero misses. Zac Cini was electric at fullback, finishing with a try, a try assist, a linebreak assist, nine tackle busts and 178 metres. Meanwhile, Luca Moretti got through a mountain of work at prop, including a try assist, a linebreak, 147 metres and 35 tackles — three misses. In a losing side Chase Chapman was impressive with the 23-year-old lock notching up 141 metres and 22 tackles with no misses. The Bears’ tryscoring machine Allan Fitzgibbon added two more to his tally to nine tries in eight appearances this season — and overall 45 tries in 49 NSW Cup games. Fullback Jake Toby was everywhere, as per usual, in the 22-16 win over the Warriors, finishing with a try, a try assist, a linebreak, a linebreak assist, 10 tackle busts and 225 running metres. It was a try-athon in Blacktown’s 50-30 win over the Magpies with 16 tries being scored between the two teams. 11 of those tries were through Blacktown and four were scored by Clayton Faulalo , while another four were scored by Jaxson Paulo . Faulalo, who shifted to fullback while Lehi Hopoate made his NRL debut, also set up three tries, got two linebreaks, four linebreak assists, eight tackle busts and 261 metres. Paulo set up a try and notched up four linebreaks as well as 210 metres. Jake Arthur , who will get some opportunities in NRL during the Origin period, bagged a try and set up two more. He also made 18 tackles with zero misses at halfback. 'I have matured since the last series' | 01:25 QUEENSLAND CUP The Cowboys’ back-up playmaker Jake Clifford had a day out for feeder side Northern Pride, scoring a double, setting up a try, getting two linebreaks and running 130 metres in their 40-22 win over Souths Logan. Will Partridge also bagged a double in the centres and ran over 150 metres, while towering second-rower Dane Aukafolau scored to take his season tally to seven tries in eight games. He also ran for 141 metres and made 28 tackles with one miss. Dolphins halfback Joshua James was instrumental in his side’s 13-4 win over Burleigh. The 23-year-old set up a try, kicked two conversions from two attempts and slotted a field goal in the 79th minute. It’s been a tough trot for the Ipswich Jets, who sit last on the ladder with just one win. The club parted ways with coach Ben Cross early last week and then they were thrashed 50-16 by Norths Devils on the weekend. Norths five-eighth Gerome Burns scored 26 of those points with three tries and seven conversions from nine attempts. Burns also finished with six tackle busts, a linebreak, 114 metres and 19 tackles — two misses. Blake Paskins also had a lot of joy on the wing with two tries, two linebreaks, six tackle busts and 133 metres, while Tuki Simpkins led from the front with 121 metres and 18 tackles, no misses. Mackay snapped a four-game losing streak with a 40-26 win over PNG Hunters with halves Riley Dean and Jaxon Purdue stealing the show. Dean scored a try and set up two more, while also getting a linebreak, two linebreak assists and 127 running metres. Purdue was unstoppable with a try, a try assist, three linebreaks, seven tackle busts and 210 metres. Josh Smith was also a handful in the centres, finishing with a try, a try assist, a linebreak, a linebreak assist, 10 tackle busts and 172 metres. Sione Hopoate was enormous for Wynnum Manly in their 38-32 win over Western Clydesdales, scoring a second-half double — with one try ending up to be the matchwinner. He also set up a try, got a linebreak, a linebreak assist, seven tackle busts and 151 running metres SPOTTED Raiders forward Jordan Martin returned from an ACL injury on Saturday and celebrated it with a try in the 77th minute. His younger brother, Noah was one of the first players to run in and get around him. Aaron Schoupp was parachuted straight into Blacktown Workers’ line-up after gaining a mid-season release from the Titans to join Manly. The powerful centre finished with 172 metres from 14 runs, five tackle busts and nine tackles with two misses.",

        "content": "At its first live event in Los Angeles, Australian company Canva put on a cringe-inducing show, according to some social media users. Login or signup to continue reading The online graphic design and multimedia platform hosted its full-day 'Canva Create' event at Hollywood Park on Thursday, May 23. The company was founded in Perth in 2013 by Melanie Perkins, Cliff Orbrecht and Cameron Adams. Bursting into a Hamilton-esque hip hop performance, a male rapper told the crowd of all that Canva had to offer. \"You can redesign your work, Canva got that glow-up, we redesign everything from the floor up,\" he sang. In the two minutes and 20 seconds show, a woman playing the part of a sceptical enterprise CIO joined the beige-clad dancers on stage. She raised some doubts about Canva's ability to meet the \"demands of a global machine\" and \"integrate all of our systems easily\". Canva's rapper sang of automated licensing and compliancy, system integration, tailored APIs, and artificial intelligence training. Eventually convinced, the 'CIO' rapped about how \"much we love Canva 'till the end\". \"You've opened my eyes to Canva Enterprise,\" she said. Canva Enterprise is a newly launched subscription software aimed at large organisations. The musical display has been ruthlessly mocked by social media users on X, formerly Twitter. American comedian Gianmarco Soresi said \"This is Lin Manuel Miranda's fault\", while another user said \"this is why Australian companies should stop hiring Americans\". \"Feels like one of those stage performances to [sic] for kids to warn them of the dangers of drugs,\" one X user said. Another user posted that while the performance was cringey, they would still use Canva. \"Omg, I'd have to step out, I couldn't sit through that,\" another commented.

        "content": "Copy link Copied Copy link Copied Subscribe to gift this article Gift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe. Already a subscriber? Login M att Heine is clearly an ideas guy. Indeed the chief executive of online wealth platforms provider Netwealth is a self-proclaimed “ideas fountain”. This has its upsides, but Heine has also learnt the trait doesn’t always work in the top job. He’s walked into many meetings spouting ideas, and sent the people around him into a frenzy. Matt Heine is chief executive of Netwealth. Louie Douvis “It’s what they would call an ‘accidental diminishing trait’ where I think I’m doing something positive, but it’s actually diminishing or disempowering the people around me,” Heine says. One tool Heine uses to enable him to let loose on the ideas front without scaring employees is to ask permission to brainstorm at the beginning of a meeting. By doing so, he makes it clear he is not expecting team members to go off and work on the ideas. “It’s actually saying, ‘can we have a discussion?’” Heine says. Listen below or stream 15 Minutes with the BOSS on Apple, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts. Here is an edited transcript of Sally Patten’s conversation with Matt Heine. Sally Patten: What time do you get up? When do you have your first cup of coffee, assuming that you are a coffee person? Matt Heine: I try and exercise three or four times a week, which will include a combination of personal training and weights at the gym and also running. Usually, I try and get up at about 6.15 or 6.30am. That’s depending on the kids. I’m not really a morning person, so I’ve had to train myself since having kids to get up a little bit earlier just to try and fit in all the things that I like to do. I try not to look at my phone until 8am which I’m failing miserably at, at the moment. I typically will get up in the morning, look at my Oura Ring stats to see how I slept. I’ll then inevitably scroll through the AFR , see what’s happened overnight and what I’m likely to face during the day. I don’t eat breakfast if I can avoid it, but I’ll definitely have two or three large cups of coffee. What are you tracking with the Oura Ring? Sleep, REM sleep? I’m pretty fastidious about my sleep hygiene, but that doesn’t mean I’m a good sleeper. I’m a shocking sleeper, and often if I think I’ve had a bad night’s sleep, it’ll tell me I’ve actually had a good night’s sleep and I just need to get on with it. So it’s good little pep talk. Other times it might just be we’re travelling a lot, plenty going on, so I just take it a little bit easier during the day and maybe instead of doing a weight session I’ll go for a walk or something else. So I find it really, really helpful, and it’s a great way to set habits and to track the positive outcomes of behaviours. For example, I try and eat as early as possible, so dinner at 5 or 5.30 with the kids would be ideal because I actually find that eating late has a huge impact on my sleep. I try not to drink during the week. Even one or two glasses of wine will have a material impact on REM. I’ll just feel pretty groggy or tired in the morning. So it’s all those sorts of things. Being able to actually see the outcomes and the benefits of either good behaviour or bad behaviour just helps set the day well. Was there a point in your career that really shaped the trajectory of what you were doing or changed you in some really critical way? Probably the [Netwealth stockmarket] listing in 2017 . I think certainly there was a huge amount of learning to get to that point and subsequent to listing, we are always learning and trying to do things better, whether that’s communicating with shareholders, stakeholders, learning how to manage the business. It’s been incredible for me. So what have you learned about having to deal with lots of different stakeholders? Stakeholder management is probably the biggest part of my job when I think about it. We interact with pretty much every part of the financial services market, whether that’s financial advisors, with the ASX, or running a superannuation trustee. We’ve got a very big technology team now. Almost half our staff are technology so that’s a very dynamic environment to be operating in. You do need to be a very good communicator and that’s probably something that I’ve had to learn on the job, and I’m constantly refining. And how do you go about balancing all the needs of the various stakeholders? I guess it’s about trying to make sure you prioritise the right things at the right time, which sounds easier than it is, and making sure that you are quite disciplined around what you’re working on at any given time. Something that I’m not particularly good at is saying no. So I have to find ways that I can either defer conversations or things that might need to be done or just say, “look, now’s not the right time to be talking about this” has become increasingly important, but it’s 12 to 15 hours in a day, and you get through what you need to. It’s actually about making sure that we’re always working on the most important thing at the right time . And it might be that I’d really love to do something or to have a conversation or to catch up with someone, but that now’s not the right time given other things that are more pressing or need to take priority. So it might be that we still want to do something, but we do it in two or three months time. What is the best career advice you’ve ever been given? I think it was Dad that gave it to me. A lot of people have really good ideas, but it’s the ability to actually execute those ideas that will be the difference between success or failure. So make sure that if you have got an idea that you give it a go, that you’re not afraid of failure, but equally if you do fail, make sure that it’s a small bet – that it’s not going to take down the company, and importantly that you actually learn from those failures or what hasn’t worked before. So that ability to fail fast has been critical, but also being able to run with an idea where you think it’s got legs. One of the things that I’m trying at home at the moment with my kids is “start with yes until it’s a no”. I think that that gives a really good outlook on life, where rather than deciding you’re not going to like something or that you’re not going to try something, give it a go. And if it’s not for you, that’s fine, but at least you know that you’ve given it a shot and that it’s not something you want to go forward with. Do you think you are stronger on the ideas front or on the execution front? I can be accused of being an ideas fountain. I think that’s great and really helpful. Other people might not agree and might be overwhelmed or find that it’s actually difficult for them to then prioritise or work on the right thing if I’m constantly coming up with new ideas. One of the ways that I’m looking to deal with that is when I walk into a meeting actually calling it out upfront and just saying, “can I have permission to brainstorm” so that it’s very clear that it’s not me actually saying, “can you go away and work on these three new ideas?” It’s actually saying, “can we have a discussion? Here’s some things that I’m thinking about or the business is thinking about that we think might be worth exploring. It doesn’t necessarily mean that that’s now a priority and you have to go away and work on it.” Do you have a favourite productivity hack to help you get more out of your day? I’ve stopped wearing a watch. I used to have an Apple watch and a Garmin for when I was running, and I found that it was beeping and flashing and tapping me so regularly it was incredibly distracting. So I now don’t wear a watch, which has been quite refreshing. [Microsoft] Outlook’s also got a really great feature that I use quite a lot called focus time, where at the start of the week you can ask it to block out time during the week where you just don’t want to be interrupted and not have meetings booked over the top. I’ll actually go through and find half-hour or hour-long blocks within the calendar each day and just put them in as focus time. So I’ve found that’s actually really effective. And then it is a conscious choice whether you actually book something over the top of it, but you know that if someone else is trying to schedule a meeting with you that it’s already blocked out. Does half an hour work for you? I would think it’s not really enough time to do anything really nitty-gritty. I think one of the downsides of virtual meetings is that the tendency is to roll from one to the next, to the next, to the next. It’s not uncommon that you’ve suddenly done eight back to back meetings with no breaks. I’ve found it actually forces you to have that time in your diary as opposed to, as I mentioned, going from one meeting to the next and then having to catch up for the whole day at 9 or 10 o’clock at night. So I think from a mental perspective, being able to have a bit more time just to reflect on either a meeting you’ve just been in, think about what the meeting might be that you’re going into, or catch up on some emails or a phone call if you need to. It’s one of the first productivity hacks I think that Microsoft actually introduced, but it’s not particularly well known. The other one is just some of the new Co-pilot tools. That’s the Microsoft version of OpenAI. They are seriously incredible as far as productivity hacks go, we can summarise an hour long meeting that I might miss, or don’t want to attend, very quickly to five dot points. The Co-pilot will automatically transcribe the meeting, work out action items, work out who needs to do what, as well as allowing you to jump between different speakers throughout the course of the meeting. So all of the tools coming from Microsoft at the moment are absolutely focused on productivity and you need to explore them. So are you attending fewer meetings as a result? Definitely. So it’s not that I necessarily do it deliberately, but it means that if I do need to miss one for a particular reason, I know that I can always go back to that meeting (where it’s been a virtual meeting obviously), and quickly catch up on what the key items were. Co-pilot it will allow you to automatically summarise group emails. One of my pet hates is group emails, whereas this will take a whole chain and just tell you very quickly what are the key points, what needs to be done, and that can save three, four minutes. And the thing that I’ve been saying to colleagues and people that are asking about Co-pilot is it’s not necessarily just three or four minutes on that task, it’s when you start to add up all those three or four minutes that it becomes quite meaningful and you could easily get back half an hour, an hour of your day just through using the different tools in different ways for different jobs. You could deliberately stop going to some meetings where your presence is not really necessary, I imagine. And then you’re saving half hour blocks, hour blocks, maybe two hour blocks. Absolutely. And if it does turn out that it was a meeting that I should have been at or needed to be at, you can then easily just watch the video. What’s your favourite podcast or streaming show and why? The obvious answer is my own podcast Between Meetings with Matt Heine , but I’m an avid podcast and audiobook listener. During the day, if I can, I’ll listen to Multipliers by Liz Wiseman. It’s about how you empower and get more out of your staff and colleagues through the power of delegation, empowering the senior leadership team and each level down. I think what they’re suggesting and what the research says is that most staff are probably operating at about 70 or 80 per cent, and there’s a whole range of reasons for that. But if you can actually empower them and give them a framework for decision-making, you can increase that or move the dial to 120 per cent. So you can imagine as businesses grow and scale, making sure that you’re actually getting the most out of all your staff and that they’re feeling rewarded and satisfied is critical. And are there some key points in doing that? Is it about giving them more autonomy or are there key themes in that? Yeah, it’s largely about the manager, so a lot of it’s quite self-reflective. And I touched on before that I can be an ideas fountain, that is what they would call an ‘accidental diminishing trait’ where I think I’m doing something positive, but it’s actually diminishing or disempowering the people that are around me or that I work with because they feel overwhelmed, and they don’t need to necessarily come up with the ideas because Matt will do it. So this is actually about saying, here’s a problem, here’s something that we’d like to solve. What do you think? Or can you go away and work on this and come back with some suggestions or recommendations? So really putting the decision-making power back into the business and the creativity back into the business. What is your favourite party story you like to share? When I was 12 I was actually held up at gunpoint, so that one is a pretty good story. Basically mum and dad were going out for dinner. They were going out to a ball I think, and I was at home with my brother. He was upstairs. And as they got to the end of the road, dad realised (this is going back obviously many years) that there wasn’t any paper in the fax machine. That’s how far back we’re going. He came back home, went into the cupboard where the fax machine was, and as he did, two people in balaclavas came out when he started screaming. I started to get up from the room next door and very quickly was told to stay on the ground and not move by one of the gentlemen in the IRA style balaclava pointing a gun at me. So there’s a lot more that happened off the back of that, but suffice to say, we’re all safe and no one got hurt. Did it take you long to recover from that being just a kid? I definitely would check the locks and keep the lights on at night for as long as I could. Do you still think about that incident? Does it impact you in some way today? No, not so much. Thankfully, today it’s more just a good party story. If you had 12 months off unencumbered, you could do anything you’d like, you could take the family or not take the family, what would you do? I think I’d be bored for 12 months. I don’t mind a holiday, one of the bad habits that I learned from my father was to always take January off, and I find that after about two and a half, three weeks I start to get a little bit itchy and need to do things. So there’s only so long I can lie on the beach, but I try and make sure that we have a good time as a family throughout the year. We go skiing and go to the beach. But if push came to shove and I had to take 12 months off, I’d love to go overseas and live somewhere in a foreign country for six months or so and learn Spanish or French. When you start to get twitchy on your summer holiday, do you start dialling into the office or checking your emails, or how do you cope with that? Usually it starts with just checking in on emails and then I will end up responding to emails and generating my own. So how long do you think you could comfortably take off without getting too bored? Maximum two to three months, I think. as long as I was doing something interesting and it was keeping myself occupied, So if you were skiing, I guess that would at least give you something to do physically every day and perhaps prevent you from looking at your phone all the time. The beauty about skiing overseas, particularly in the United States, which I was lucky enough to do over Christmas, is that it gets dark and cold at about 3.30pm, which just happens to be when Australia comes online. So I can still do a couple of hours, even if we’re skiing. Copy link Copied Copy link Copied Subscribe to gift this article Gift 5 articles to anyone you choose each month when you subscribe.

        "content": "STANDING in the doorway of her home, mum-of-four Sarah Smith thought of desperate excuses to turn away the man who stood on her step. Once a family friend who had lent her and husband Anthony cash for Christmas, he had turned into a sex-crazed loan shark who offered her an “easy” way out of debt. “Put on some sexy underwear and we can come to an arrangement,” he told her. Sarah, who point-blank refused, is among thousands of women across the country being targeted by twisted, heartless lenders pushing some victims to the brink of suicide. Frightened borrowers have shared shocking stories of exploitation, violence and blackmail. One shark even offered to send a gang of men to a woman’s home for sex “while the kids are at school”. Our exclusive statistics reveal that almost one in ten female borrowers have been asked to clear debt through sex. It is the first time such figures have been recorded by England’s Illegal Money Lending Team, a group of specialist investigators and officers. Sarah and Anthony, 39, who live in the West Midlands , borrowed around £10,000 over 15 years but were unable to make payments when Covid hit and they suffered health issues. Anthony, who was paying 70 per cent interest on the loan, said: “It was then the shark began putting pressure on me and started being intimidating, coming out with comments to my wife in front of our 14-year-old daughter. “He asked my wife to wear sexy bras and pants and stuff like that. “We heard from other people that he was trying to make out that if they gave him sexual favours, it would pay some money off.” The Sun can today reveal the terror Britain’s loan sharks hold over skint families — many struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. Almost half of those targeted are in work but have been hit hard by rising food and energy bills. Care worker Paula, 28, of Leeds, told how a shark pestered her for sex before suggesting she become a prostitute to pay off her debt. She was introduced to the lender through a friend at work and borrowed £100. Paula faced what is known as “double bubble” interest, where the amount owing doubles each week. It was tripled the week after if she failed to pay. She soon owed £3,000. She said: “The lender contacted my parents telling them I owe money. “He came to my workplace to intimidate me. I closed my Facebook account for fear of what he might post on there. I felt trapped. “He pestered me for sex and I was told to become a prostitute to pay off what I owed. “I could never do that, but at one point it did seem like it might be the only way out. “It was more the pestering for sex that felt so overwhelming.” Paula’s nightmare only came to an end when she was contacted by the Illegal Money Lending Team, which was already investigating the man. Jane, a mum of three who borrowed from someone she knew at work, was left petrified when she changed her phone number and the lender threatened to kill her. ﻿The loan shark contacted my family to get them to make me repay and said they would kill me. I went to a bridge and was going to jump off. Only the thought of my kids stopped me The 52-year-old, of South London, revealed: “They contacted family members to get them to make me repay and said they would kill me. “I went to a bridge and was going to jump off because of the threats. Only the thought of my children stopped me from doing it.” Delivery driver Sunny, 26, from Devon, found an illegal lender online after becoming so financially strapped he went without food to make sure his kids ate. He said: “On paper my income looks great, but in reality we were constantly playing catch-up paying her off.” All these victims, who told their stories to the IMLT, were too frightened to reveal their real identities to The Sun for fear of retribution. An estimated one million borrowers owe money to loan sharks, according to a report published by the Centre for Social Justice. This figure has more than tripled since 2010. New statistics from the IMLT reveal that 31 per cent of borrowers have contemplated or attempted suicide, while three in ten have been threatened or assaulted by lenders. IMLT expert Catherine Wohlers said: “Nine per cent of female borrowers we helped last year have been told they can clear their debt with sexual favours. “Some of the suggestions are quite explicit and upfront, but others are less so, such as, ‘It would be nice if you could be wearing something nice when I come round’. “One woman was told, ‘If I send some men around when the kids are at school that could sort your debt’.” Catherine says almost half of those taking loans from sharks are low earners or families in financial crisis. She added: “We’ve seen a change in the reasons why people use them. “Many are now borrowing for food and fuel, when it would historically be for one-off expenses like a new car tyre, school uniforms or for Christmas. It’s a myth that everyone who borrows is on benefits. More than 40 per cent are working, some in low-paid jobs, or maybe their circumstances have changed due to a relationship breakdown, bereavement or business collapse. “The youngest borrower we helped last year was 19 and the oldest 91. The highest amount loaned was £99,000 and the person concerned paid back £450,000 over 25 years. “Half of borrowers went without food, fuel or making priority payments in order to pay their loan.” The figures also show eight per cent found loan sharks on social media, double the amount in 2022. The revelations come after one of Britain’s most violent loan sharks was this month jailed for seven years for kidnap, GBH and illegal money lending. Richard Dawson, 35, from Barnsley , bundled his victim into the boot of his car and drove him to a cashpoint to make payments. Sheffield Crown Court heard how vicious, tattooed Dawson collected £52,000 from 88 “customers”. He once broke the jaw of a man who could not pay up. His barrister Sean Fritchley said Dawson’s actions sounded “like something from The Sopranos” but that his client was “ashamed”. Judges have also jailed a number of pensioner loan sharks — including the country’s oldest at 83. Two Filipino hospital workers preyed on immigrant colleagues, lending them £4.2million over a 16-year period. Luz Guerra Villar, 67, and Leticia Manipol, 71, were given suspended jail sentences in 2021 after admitting illegal lending and money laundering. They were last month ordered to pay back £1.2million by a court in South London. It is the largest amount confiscated in 14 years. Gangster great-granny Tabitha Richardson lent neighbours and “friends” £120,000 over 20 years. The 83-year-old from Newport, South Wales, was described as “threatening and menacing” while charging 40 per cent interest on six-month loans. She was handed a two-year suspended sentence last August after admitting her illegal business. Last month she was ordered to pay back £173,000. Tony Quigley, head of the IMLT, said: “Illegal lenders often live a life of luxury while people who have borrowed from them struggle. “It’s only right that these criminals are not only prosecuted but are at last made to pay back at least some of their ill-gotten gains.” Sarah and husband Anthony are now picking up their lives. He said: “It still angers me because I have been made to feel like a fool. “To find out afterwards there were so many other people he was making money off makes me so angry. “It’s a vile thing to have hanging over your head. It’s like being stuck in a never-ending hellhole.”",

        "content": "Cutting or suspending dividends, even when it’s necessary, is rarely well-received by investors. The existing investors of a business that cuts its dividends experience a reduction in their dividend-based income. A drop in the company valuation also accompanies it because an exodus of investors often follows dividend cuts. In extreme cases, the sell-out frenzy may reduce the company’s valuation to a fraction of its former self. However, most of this pertains to the existing investor base, and new investors may perceive a company that recently cut its dividends a bit differently. One such company is ( ), and it might be worth looking into. The dividend cut, reasons, and reaction Earlier this year, Innergex announced it would cut its dividends by half. It paid about $0.18 by the end of 2023, and starting in 2024, the company is only paying about $0.09 per share. One main reason behind the dividend cut was that they were becoming unsustainable, owing to the company’s weak finances. In some quarters, they ate up the company’s free cash flow, forcing it to rely on external financial assistance for its projects. The reaction to the dividend cut hasn’t been as aggressive as the reaction many other companies have seen. The stock has dropped less than 3% into the year so far, and the most significant drop happened in February when the stock slumped 24% in 20 days. Overall, the phase has been minimal. Is Innergex still a buy? For people who don’t already have Innergex in their portfolio, the stock may be worth considering for several reasons. Despite the dividend cut, the stock comes with a healthy enough yield of about 4%, and if the company gets back on its feet (financially), it may try to restore its dividends to their original level. This means you may experience rapid dividend growth in the next few years. Another reason is that the company might improve its debt profile by funding most of its operations and growth from the now freed-up free cash flow. The third reason is its resilience. It’s one thing for a stock to retain its market value when the market or the sector dips (external hostile forces). However, retaining its value, despite cutting its payouts is resilience on another level. Foolish takeaway One thing to remember about the stock is that it has been in perpetual decline since its peak in Jan. 2021 and is currently trading at a discount of about 71% from that peak value. The dividend cut is more likely to prolong this slump. So, if you are anticipating quick capital appreciation, this may disappoint you.",

        "content": "THE British Library is being plagued by randy book lovers romping in loos. Bosses have been forced to call in cops to try to put a stop to the novel use of the venue. One bookworm complained to the library, describing the between-the-sheets bonkbusting as “totally unacceptable”. He said security chiefs had confirmed that bosses were aware of randy students and local workers foolscapping around in the toilets after arranging book-ups online. A post on a “cruisers” website — which The Sun is not naming — advertises the library as being a meeting spot for casual sex with a “vast amount of toilets” on site. But it warns hardback fans that there are regular police and security patrols of the building and there had been cases reported of bonk lovers caught during a private reading being escorted from the site. Last night the distinguished library at London’s King’s Cross denounced the unliterary conduct. A spokesperson said: “The British Library is a public institution and our site at St Pancras is visited by more than one million people every year. “All of the Library’s public areas and facilities, including the toilets, are regularly patrolled by on-site security staff to ensure that they are being used appropriately. “Inappropriate behaviour is not tolerated and the Library works closely with the police to ensure the safety and security of the Library’s buildings and users.”",

But every would be candidate it can at this time intimate to the public is desire for public office by conducting caucuses. It cannot be considered a violation at this time because the law says that it is not yet the campaign period, ergo there is no violation. There are now big billboards of senatorial candidates like that of Imee Marcos, Francis Tolentino and Camille Villar on strategic area along the highways. ( I made a road trip last March in Laguna, Batangas and Cavite during the Holy Week and the highways are dotted with tarpaulins wishing or advising motorists to have safe travels). Well, possibly most them believe that ‘early bird catches the worm’. There are always combinations in life and in any human pursuit. Presidential candidates have someone on the back ride as they should ride in tandem. The most successful was that of Bongbong Marcos and Inday Sara Duterte. They represented Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Bongbong’s dad was from the Ilocos, a part of Luzon and the mother is from Leyte in the Visayas . Inday Sara is from Mindanao. The mayors have their vice mayors, and in Angeles City Congressman Jonjon Lazatin will have Vicky Vega Cabigting as running mate. It is a perfect match up. Both are successful in their runs in many recent elections. Lazatin hurdled with ease three congressional elections and Cabigting is always a winner in the vice mayoral race in the city. Dopesters are placing their bets that the Lazatin-Cabigting team including their ten council bets will likely to make a sweep. In a big city like Angeles where there are more than 200 thousand registered voters, the votes are mostly cast on known surnames. Seven re-electionists are in the LV ticket, namely Atty. Pogs Suller, Edu Pamintuan, Alex Indiongco, Raco Del Rosario, Niknok Banola, JC Aguas and Chris Cortez. Alfred Sangil will have the familiar family name of his cousin Jay Sangil and Mich Bonifacio will take the place of her husband Alfie. Aron Pineda has made an almost successful run last elections and his name is already known far and wide. Politics involves marketing. Just like commodities there should be name recall. Just like when someone is buying a toothpaste, Colgate will always come to mind.",

This is the story of that transformation. if(window.innerWidthADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_atf\" });';document.write(write_html);} At the beginning of the 21st century, coal was the dominant energy source for electricity generation in the United States. In 2000, coal consumption stood at 22.6 quadrillion British thermal units (BTUs), reflecting its widespread use in power plants across the country. This was primarily a reflection of coal’s relatively low cost and abundance in the U.S. Natural gas consumption was also substantial at 23.3 quadrillion BTUs, but it was primarily used for heating and industrial processes. However, it would soon be a rapidly growing fuel for electricity generation. Renewable energy, including hydroelectric, wind, solar, and biomass, contributed a modest 5.7 quadrillion BTUs. The mid-2000s saw a notable increase in natural gas consumption, driven by advances in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques that unlocked vast reserves of shale gas. By 2005, natural gas consumption stood at 22.7 quadrillion BTUs, but it was on the verge of breaking out. Coal consumption remained relatively stable, peaking slightly in the mid-2000s before beginning a gradual decline. Renewables started to gain traction, largely due to increased investments in wind and solar energy. The late 2000s and early 2010s marked a significant shift towards cleaner energy sources. This period saw a rapid decline in coal consumption, dropping to 20.8 quadrillion BTUs by 2010, as environmental regulations tightened, and the economic advantages of natural gas became more apparent. Coal Natural Gas Renewables 2000 to 2023. Data Source: EIA. ROBERT RAPIER Natural gas consumption reached 24.7 quadrillion BTUs in 2010, benefiting from its lower carbon emissions and cost-effectiveness. Renewable energy continued its upward trajectory, reaching 7.6 quadrillion BTUs in 2010, spurred by federal and state incentives, technological advancements, and decreasing costs. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} The trend towards cleaner energy sources accelerated in the mid-2010s. By 2015, coal consumption had fallen sharply to 15.7 quadrillion BTUs, while natural gas consumption continued to climb, reaching 28.3 quadrillion BTUs. Renewables saw significant growth, with consumption rising to 10.0 quadrillion BTUs, driven by substantial increases in wind and solar power capacity. The late 2010s to early 2020s solidified the dominance of natural gas and renewables in the U.S. energy mix. By 2020, coal consumption had plummeted to 10.7 quadrillion BTUs, reflecting the ongoing decommissioning of coal-fired power plants and a shift towards cleaner energy. Natural gas consumption reached 32.6 quadrillion BTUs in 2020. Natural gas played a role both as firm power (power on demand), in addition to a role in balancing intermittent renewable energy sources. Renewables saw remarkable growth, with consumption reaching 12.1 quadrillion BTUs in 2020, highlighting the significant contributions of wind, solar, and biomass energy. In 2023, coal consumption bounced back a bit, while natural gas consumption grew to a record 36.5 quadrillion BTUs. Renewable energy consumption reached a record 14.7 quadrillion BTUs in 2023, reflecting ongoing investments in renewable energy infrastructure and the increasing role of wind and solar power in the national energy grid. The period from 2000 to 2023 has seen a dramatic transformation in the U.S. energy landscape. Coal consumption declined by 13.0 quadrillion BTUs, while natural gas consumption increased by 13.4 quadrillion BTUs. Renewable consumption increased by 8.4 quadrillion BTUs over that period. ADVERTISEMENT However, it should be noted that these comparisons are not apples-to-apples. When coal or natural gas are burned for power, most of the energy (60% to 70%) is lost in the conversion to electricity as heat. However, that is not the case for renewables. Thus, it can be said that a BTU of coal or natural gas consumption is not directly comparable to a BTU of renewable energy consumption when electricity is the measure being discussed. On the other hand, renewable energy is not firm power. Natural gas can be used to completely replace a coal-fired power plant. Renewables are better suited to serve marginal demand in a decentralized fashion. As a result, renewables and natural gas have worked well together to cause the massive decline in coal consumption this century. These trends are expected to continue as technological advancements, economic factors, and policy initiatives drive further efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

        "content": "CAT owners should stop saying “Here, puss” to moggies because it is “like swearing at them”. A pet charity says words with “s” in them sound like aggressive hissing. PDSA vet nurse Gemma Renwick added: “ Cats pick up on certain sounds and tend to prefer fewer ‘s’ sounds. The ‘s’ noise is similar to a cat hissing, which is almost like swearing at them every time you want their attention. “Consider speaking their language and meowing at them. “Unlike hissing, adult cats don’t really meow at one another, but do use meows to communicate with us humans.” Gemma warned feline fans of several moggie mistakes ahead of next Tuesday’s annual #HugYourCatDay — including cuddles. She said: “Hugging, and other approaches we may consider signs of affection, can actually be detrimental. “If a cat runs away as you come towards them or they dash off as soon as you let go, it’s a good sign they don’t want to be touched or have their personal space invaded. “Always let your cat come to you and you’ll reap the rewards of consensual kitty cuddles.” Gemma added that making eye contact was “quite threatening” and advised we instead copy cats’ “slow blink”. And playing with laser pointers leaves empty-pawed cats frustrated. Gemma also warned against using citrus-smelling cleaning products on litter trays which “could actually put them off using it”.",

Amid these market movements, captures the spotlight as this year’s standout crypto presale, amassing an impressive $34 million. With its latest dashboard enhancements, BlockDAG has significantly improved user interactions, elevating standards in cryptocurrency engagement. Bolstered by pioneering innovations and an ambitious price forecast of $30 by 2030, BlockDAG continues to draw keen interest and investment from the crypto community. BNB’s price momentum is strong, having broken through the significant $595 barrier, a price point that had been resistant since March. Currently priced at $623, BNB’s ascent reflects a vibrant purchasing trend, moving beyond the constraints of a previously observed symmetrical triangle pattern, where prices fluctuated between higher lows and lower highs, indicative of market consolidation. This breakthrough has propelled BNB above both its 20-day Exponential Moving Average and 50-day Simple Moving Average, suggesting a clear upward trajectory. This shift in momentum highlights a significant market move towards further coin accumulation. In the realm of digital payments, Litecoin remains a frontrunner, consistently leading in transaction volume on the BitPay platform for five consecutive months. Its dominance is so pronounced that it surpasses the transaction volumes of the next three cryptocurrencies combined, emphasizing its widespread use in digital transactions. The recent weeks have seen substantial investments in Litecoin, including a noteworthy purchase of 900,000 LTC on May 10th. These large transactions, totaling $230 million, demonstrate increasing institutional interest in Litecoin, cementing its status as a vital player in the crypto market. BlockDAG has emerged as a standout in the cryptocurrency presale arena, amassing an impressive $34 million. This surge in interest is largely due to its recent updates, particularly the dashboard revamp which has significantly improved user interaction and transparency on the platform. Furthermore, the updated dashboard introduces new features designed to enhance user engagement and satisfaction. It includes a ‘hot news’ section, which immediately updates users with the latest developments upon logging in, ensuring they are always informed. Additionally, the wallet feature now shows updated balances promptly after any purchase of miners or coins, enhancing user trust and convenience. A newly introduced leaderboard showcases the top 30 investors, highlighting the major players and promoting a competitive investment environment. This feature not only adds a gamification element to investing but also signals potential rewards for top investors, further engaging the community. With these strategic enhancements, BlockDAG not only solidifies its position in the market but also sets the stage for sustained future growth. Market analysts are keeping a keen eye on this trend, with projections pointing to a long-term target price of $30 by 2030. To recap, With BNB breaking through major resistance levels and Litecoin maintaining its lead in digital payments, BlockDAG stands out as the top investment choice. Renowned for its record-breaking $34 million presale, BlockDAG not only improves user interactions with its redesigned dashboard but also offers significant growth prospects. Its strategic enhancements and an ambitious $30 price target by 2030 make this the optimal moment to invest in BlockDAG, positioning it as a premier investment opportunity in the crypto landscape.

        "content": "Claretian Communications Foundation, Inc. 8TH WEEK IN ORDINARY TIME Psalter: Week 4 / (Green) Responsorial Psalm: Ps 98: 1, 2-3ab, 3cd-4: The Lord has made known his salvation. 1st Reading: 1 Peter 1: 10-16 This was the salvation for which the prophets so eagerly looked when, in days past, they foretold the favor of God, with regard to you. But they could only investigate when, the Spirit of Christ present within them, pointed out the time and the circumstances, of this — the sufferings of Christ, and the glories which would follow. It was revealed to them that they were working, not for themselves, but for you. Thus, in these days, after the Holy Spirit has been sent from heaven, the gospel’s preachers have taught you these mysteries, which even the angels long to see. So, then, let your spirit be ready. Be alert, with confident trust, in the grace you will receive, when Jesus Christ appears. Like obedient children, do not return to your former life, given over to ignorance and passions. Imitate the one who called you. As he is holy, so you, too, be holy, in all your conduct, since Scripture says: Be holy for I am holy. Gospel: Mark 10: 28-31 Peter spoke up and said, “We have given up everything to follow you.” Jesus answered, “Truly, there is no one who has left house, or brothers or sisters, or father or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel, who will not receive his reward. I say to you: even in the midst of persecution, he will receive a hundred times as many houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and lands in the present time; and, in the world to come, eternal life. Do pay attention: many who now are the first will be last, and the last, first.” REFLECTION: “Evangelical Poverty.” There is such thing as evangelical poverty, which is an option made by an individual who has decided to leave everything behind for the sake of the Gospel. Such a person who opted to be poor for the sake of the Gospel becomes a living witness to God’s divine providence. Once free from the attachment to material things, the relationship with God who always provides, deepens. Today’s Gospel is the continuation of the passage we reflected on yesterday. The disciples were puzzled about the words of Jesus because Jesus told them of the difficulty of the rich to enter into the kingdom of God. People in Jesus’ time thought of the poor as accursed. Consequently, if the rich had difficulty entering eternal life, it would even be more difficult for the poor to be saved. But Jesus told them that all things are possible with God. Hence, when we surrender everything to God, he will surely provide for us. We have to seek God’s kingdom first and his righteousness and everything will be given to us (cf. Mt. 6:33). Once a person opts for evangelical poverty, putting God first ahead of anything, every situation becomes an occasion of divine providence.

        "content": "CITY OF SAN FERNANDO —The Provincial Government of Pampanga has set the monthly cash assistance to daycare teachers in Pampanga from P2,500 to P3,000. Governor Dennis Pineda led the turnover of assistance to 689 daycare teachers at the Bren Z. Guiao Convention Center recently. Lubao Mayor Esmie Pineda and Provincial Social Welfare and Development Officer Fe Manarang assisted the governor during the event. Republic Act No. 10410 or the Early Years Act (EYA) of 2013 states that daycare workers “are directly responsible for the care and education of young children from age zero to four years.” Despite this, many workers still do not enjoy the benefits of regular employees. In 2018, the PSWDO said that “from 2015 to 2017, only 56 or 8.56 percent of daycare workers in the province have permanent plantilla positions. Some 29 of them or 4.43 percent have casual positions. The remaining 569 or 87 percent are non-plantilla – either they are working on a job order status or are volunteers.” The provincial government of Pampanga has been providing a monthly subsidy to the workers since 2016 through Ordinance No696 which started at the amount of then P1,500. The children of daycare workers also received educational assistance, free medical services, and hospitalization at the district and provincial hospitals.",

        "description": "Once again, Ronald Acuna Jr will miss time for the Braves with an ACL tear. Who could help replace the reigning NL MVP?",
        "content": "When . blew out his right knee on July 10, 2021, Alex Anthopoulos felt compelled to respond quickly. The Braves' head of baseball operations wanted to send a message to the Atlanta players that the season was not lost -- that the front office and the team should continue to fight. So five days later, Anthopoulos traded for veteran outfielder and catcher , and before the end of the summer, he'd add three more outfielders -- , and . The Braves would go on to win the World Series that fall, with those midseason additions contributing significantly. Now Acuna injury, to his other knee, and again he is out for the season. The Braves' situation is not nearly as dire as it was when Acuna was hurt in '21 -- then, Atlanta was struggling to play .500 ball, and didn't have nearly as deep of a roster as it does now. But this time, the team has to move ahead not only without the reigning National League MVP, but also without its most dominant pitcher, Spencer Strider, who suffered a season-ending elbow injury at the outset of the season. The early success (and good health) of has helped to plug the hole created by Strider's injury. But the Braves' offense -- which had already been in an early funk after setting records for home runs last year -- will need heroes to emerge in the lineup. It might be third baseman , who is expected to return soon from a minor back injury suffered a couple of weeks ago. At that point, Riley had felt that he was just about to emerge from an early-season slump. \"I am close,\" said Riley, holding his index and thumb millimeters apart, as he described how he felt at the plate. Maybe it'll be Braves center fielder Michael Harris II, who knows what it means to dig out of a slump. Last year, Harris was activated off the injured list without taking at-bats in the minors because the staff felt his defense was so important -- and for six weeks, he struggled mightily at the plate. But in his last 100 games, Harris batted .335 with 63 runs, 16 home runs and 15 stolen bases. He could be a natural candidate to ascend into the leadoff spot. All-Star catcher , too, after missing most of the past two months with a rib cage injury. First baseman has already begun to work his way out of a slow start, batting .290 with five homers in his past 16 games. Through his April struggles, Olson had actually generated hard-hit rates that were in line with what he produced last year, but he did not have the results to show for it. His teammates felt he had been the victim of some bad BABIP luck. Many pointed to a game against the Red Sox on May 8: Olson scorched a line drive toward left field that Boston third baseman rose to barely spear. Braves hitting coach Kevin Seitzer could see Olson's shoulders sag with frustration at the sight of yet another intercepted line drive. But Devers couldn't hold the ball, and Olson got a hit. Before the next game, Seitzer spoke to Olson about his reaction to Devers' brief interception. When Olson's shoulders dropped, Seitzer said, it was like he could see that misfortune weighing down the All-Star first baseman. Seitzer told Olson there was no sense clinging to that frustration, because those early-season at-bats were behind him, and he couldn't change the result. \"As far as I'm concerned, the season starts for you today,\" Seitzer said. Hours later, after Olson had clubbed a home run in a series-opening win over the Mets, Seitzer greeted Olson in the handshake line and punctuated his earlier remarks: \"Have a great season.\" Maybe the Braves will get a boost from , or , the talented young outfielder who has swung well in his first season with the Braves. Maybe Duvall, signed late in spring training, will take advantage of the additional playing time he will get. Maybe will continue to carry the offense, as he has for a lot of this season. \"He might be the best hitter in baseball right now,\" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said Sunday as he described a plate appearance that Ozuna had against his team. And it's a certainty that Anthopoulos, reflexively proactive, will scan the trade market and look for opportunities to upgrade, even at a time when his farm system is thinner than that of other contenders. Anthopoulos typically holds some spending flexibility in reserve, and inevitably, other teams will look to dump pricey veterans as they fall out of the race. Sellers will develop, and outfielders will become available. , , , , , Rosario (again) and are among the players on short-term deals who could be moved this year if their respective teams fall out of contention. Braves manager Brian Snitker talked earlier this year about the team's offensive problems and mentioned a trait he sees in the collective mindset of the team. \"These guys will not panic,\" he said. \"They will never panic. Three years ago, we lost Acuna, and these guys just kept going.\" Three years ago, they won the World Series without him. Now the Braves will have to try to do that again.",

        "content": "A new cybercrime threat has emerged, and it has been dubbed “quishing.” Many are familiar with the term “phishing,” which involves scammers attempting to obtain sensitive information through fraudulent emails or websites. Quishing takes a different approach, exploiting the convenience and ubiquity of quick-response (QR) codes. In recent months, quishing has risen from making up a mere 0.8 percent of all email phishing attacks in 2021, to accounting for a staggering 11 percent so far into 2024. Trevor Cooke, Privacy Expert at EarthWeb has told Digital Journal that: “Quishing is a relatively unknown but rapidly growing problem that preys on our trust in QR codes and our reliance on mobile devices.” As QR codes have become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of our lives, from contactless payments to accessing information, cybercriminals have found a new avenue to exploit. The data on the rise of quishing was sourced from Intelligent CIO. The data on quishing incidents in June to August 2023 and the scam threat in 2024 came from Keepnet . What is Quishing? Quishing, a portmanteau of “QR code” and “phishing,” is a form of social engineering attack that involves the use of malicious QR codes. These codes, when scanned, can redirect unsuspecting victims to fraudulent websites designed to steal personal information, install malware, or initiate unauthorised transactions. While phishing scams typically rely on emails or fake websites, quishing takes advantage of the convenience and perceived trustworthiness of QR codes. Cybercriminals can create malicious QR codes and place them in public spaces, such as restaurants, airports, or even on product packaging, luring victims into scanning them. The Dangers of Quishing The prevalence of quishing is a cause for concern for several reasons: As the world becomes increasingly reliant on QR code technology, experts fear that quishing incidents may rise even further in 2024. The projected growth in QR code payment systems, with global expenditures expected to exceed $3 trillion by 2025, presents vast opportunities for fraudulent QR code schemes such as quishing.

        "content": "PAT Sajak has suffered the brunt of one angry contestant who blamed the Wheel of Fortune host for distracting him. But Pat took the accusation in stride, and snarked back at the player. On a recent Wheel of Fortune episode, Michael Bystrzycki, a master electrician from Drummonds, Tennessee , was working his way through a Crossword round, where contestants are asked to solve a series of interconnected words with the same lead-in. In this case, the four words all had \"fire\" as the first part. Michael looked to be about to solve the puzzle, when he suddenly changed course and decided to spin the wheel one more time. He landed on Bankrupt - losing everything. Luckily for him, his turn eventually came again, and after making a comeback, correctly solved Fire - \"works, wood, department, and pit.\" After celebrating his win, Pat wanted to know what was stumping him before. \"Which one were you shaky on the first time?\" he asked, opening a can of worms. \"None. I just looked at you instead of looking at the puzzle, and 'works' went out my head,\" Michael immediately shot back. \"I was like, 'ah, he said spin, so I’m spinning'. Let’s go\". A depressed Pat simply threw his arms up, looked directly at the camera, and snapped back a sarcastic, \"It’s always my fault.\" Michael had the last laugh, however, winning the game - and then the bonus round - leaving the show with a new Infinity car and an overall total of $111,160 in cash and prizes. It wasn't the first time Pat has been called out by a contestant. Late last year, a contestant named Jill failed to solve the final round puzzle, \"Voicing Our Opinion.\" That's when she decided to voice hers . \"Come on,\" she said. Premiering in 1975, the beloved game show has had a few different iconic hosts in its nearly 50 seasons. 1975 - 1981 : Chuck Woolery was the original host of Wheel of Fortune until he departed in 1981. 1981 - June 2024: Pat Sajak took over and became a beloved Wheel of Fortune host for over 40 years. September 2024: Ryan Seacrest was declared the newest host as Sajak announced his retirement . Pat seemed caught off guard and replied, \"What do you mean, come on?\" She turned to the host and flat-out asked, \"What kind of puzzle is that?\" Pat looked shocked by the pushback and held a finger up. \"It’s a puzzle you didn’t solve,\" he slammed back, causing the audience to roar in laughter. Jill missed out on an additional $40,000 per the glitzy prize card but still got her existing $27,680. Pat won't have to play the victim for much longer. The 77-year-old announced last year that he’s retiring from the game show at the end of this 41st season, which is now only days away . In June 2023, Pat revealed he would soon be leaving the show, and it was announced soon after that Ryan Seacrest would be taking over as host. Almost a year later, Pat’s final episode of Wheel of Fortune is almost here. The big finale was filmed last month and is currently set to air on June 7 . With Pat now readying to leaving, the show has prepared a series of tributes. The weeklong goodbye will be called Thanks for the Memories and will culminate with his final episode.",

        "content": "Tom Brady seemed ready to hit the summer vibes with his kids that he shares with his ex-wife Gisele Bündchen, just after jokes from his Netflix special, The Roast of Tom Brady , went viral and upset some people. The retired NFL star posted a clip on Instagram on Monday, showing off himself having some fun in the water, enjoying good times with two of his kids, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11. “You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!,” he captioned the clip, which had Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's I Had Some Help playing in the background. The 46-year-old flexed his ripped body in the video post while driving a speedboat, jet-skiing and wakeboarding. Glimpses showed his kids also joining in on the fun. The sports personality’s beach vacation comes just days after Brady’s Netflix roast that mocked fun at his personal life. The Super Bowl champ, who shares a son, Jack, 16, with ex-Bridget Moynahan, admitted he “didn’t like” how his children were “affected” by jokes targeted st his exes. “I loved when the jokes were about me,” he confessed on The Pivot podcast. “I thought they were so fun. I didn’t like the way that affected my kids.”",

        "description": "The 2024 Indianapolis 500 delivered one of the most compelling races in the sport's history...",
        "content": "After an epic rainstorm and four hours of delays, the 2024 Indianapolis 500 delivered one of the most compelling races in the sport’s history. Josef Newgarden of Team Penske may have crossed the yard of bricks in first position, but a simple finishing order never quite tells the full story when a race lasts for 200 fascinating laps that saw 49 lead changes and a record 18 different leaders. The 108th running of the Indy 500 created hundreds of fascinating storylines, but today, we’re going to recap the biggest winners — and the biggest losers. WINNER: Josef Newgarden and Team Penske It hasn’t been a good year to be a Team Penske driver. Both Josef Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin were disqualified from the season opening race at St. Petersburg, Florida for illegally utilizing Push to Pass, which provides limited bursts of boost to aid in overtaking, on restarts. Newgarden, who utilized that system illegally more than anyone else, lost his win at the race and faced down a massive amount of criticism for hosting an emotional press conference where he insisted that he did not cheat. The whole affair has soured many fans; even though Newgarden and McLaughlin were disqualified, and even though Team Penske suspended several critical team members for two races (including the Indy 500), there’s a large group of folks who feel that that wasn’t enough — especially because team owner Roger Penske also owns the IndyCar Series and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. There’s a lot of speculation that this cheating scandal is a conspiracy, and that there are simply far too many conflicts of interest. It’ll be difficult for Penske and Newgarden to completely leave this affair in the past, but it’s also difficult to argue that Newgarden and Team Penske did not deserve their victory — the 20th 500 win for Roger. Newgarden’s masterful back-to-back performance at the Greatest Spectacle in Racing, however, is a step in the right direction. LOSER: Honda Of the 11 drivers that retired from the 2024 Indianapolis 500, nine were Honda-powered. Of those nine Honda retirements, three were mechanical failures. The two Chevrolet retirements were solely due to contact. It’s a bitter pill to swallow for the Honda camp; the Japanese manufacturer struggled throughout the entire month of May. While Honda’s teams appeared to have strong race pace in practice, its qualifying effort was poor: All six drivers in the first two rows of the grid were Chevy drivers, and all four of the slowest drivers competing for the final three grid slots were Honda drivers. In the race itself, only three Honda drivers finished in the top 10. David Salters, president of Honda Racing Corporation USA, said, “It was a disappointing day. All things considered, we weren’t good enough on the day. We’ll regroup, lick our wounds, focus our efforts, and come back.” Prior to the race, Salters joined a media availability session for journalists who had been invited as guests of Honda. During that session, he admitted that the debut of hybrid engines had required some compromises in terms of Indy 500 preparation, and that Honda had actually fallen behind performance expectations when it came time to compete at the Speedway. The answers for the drop in performance are not immediately available, but it certainly doesn’t bode well for Honda, which is currently rumored to be looking for an IndyCar exit strategy. WINNER: Pato O’Ward No, this placement isn’t a mistake — despite losing an almost guaranteed win after an audacious last-lap pass from Newgarden, Arrow McLaren driver Pato O’Ward has every right to be devastated. He also has every right to be included on the winner list. At 25 years old, O’Ward has actively raced in five Indy 500s and has performed admirably in every single one. In his debut race, he finished sixth. He followed that with a fourth-place finish in 2021, then a second in 2022. His 24th-place classification in 2023 doesn’t quite tell the story of his battle for the lead and unfortunate crash within the final 10 laps. This year, he passed Newgarden on the final lap; in every other year, that would have meant victory. In 2024. It wasn’t enough. O’Ward exited the car with a heavy heart and heavier sobs, offering heartbreaking interviews to the media. And yet O’Ward has matured immensely, both in IndyCar as a whole and at the Indy 500, over the past few years. The Mexican driver had produced stunning performances and many equally stunning crashes thanks to his fiery demeanor; his 2023 victory in the 500 was almost assured until he crashed in attempting to pass Marcus Ericsson. This year, O’Ward’s drive was just as inspired, but it was far more measured. His racing line in the final stages sliced apexes and set him up for perfect passes. It wasn’t enough, but an O’Ward of a different year may very well have wrecked himself and the leader trying to win. It was a devastating result, but O’Ward should be proud. He has a long and impressive career ahead of him at the Speedway. LOSER: Kyle Larson All things considered, NASCAR star Kyle Larson had an impressive debut at the Indianapolis 500. Despite accruing a penalty for speeding in the pit lane, he completed all 200 laps and took home an 18th-place finish for his efforts. He committed to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway despite the rain and raced incredibly well. He has much to be proud of. But Larson has stumbled onto our losers list for one big reason: His attempt at completing the “Double” — or, racing in the Indy 500 followed by NASCAR’s Coca-Cola 600 — was squashed by poor weather and NASCAR politics. Larson stuck around for the 500’s four-hour rain delay and completed the event, then immediately jetted off to Charlotte Motor Speedway. He arrived at the track just as the race was flagged for weather. Because NASCAR had completed half distance, and because humidity in the area was set to make track drying problematic, and because it was already late, NASCAR called the race. Larson wasn’t able to turn a single lap. Now, he may be facing a slew of repercussions. At this time of writing, NASCAR has not provided Larson with a “waiver” that approves his missing the Coca-Cola 600. As a result, there is still a chance that Larson will be entirely disqualified from the NASCAR Championship because he failed to compete in one race — even though it wasn’t his fault. Many pundits in the NASCAR sphere are also actively arguing that Larson be denied a waiver, angry because one of their finest drivers had prioritized another race in another series over the Cup Series. Rather than celebrate his performance, they demand punishment (especially as other drivers like Ryan Blaney toy with the idea of attempting the same feat in the future). This may be Larson’s last attempt at completing the Double — and it may also spell the end of any attempts in the future. 👉 F1 v IndyCar: Top speeds, engines, formats, calendars and safety measures all compared 👉 Which drivers are paid the most? F1, IndyCar and NASCAR salaries revealed WINNER: Scott Dixon Qualifying did not look good for Scott Dixon. The six-time IndyCar champion and one-time 500 winner qualified on the outside of the seventh row for the 108th running of the event. Despite starting 21st, he finished third. As we noted before, Honda’s engines just weren’t cut out for the task of winning the 500 this year; if they had been, Dixon’s exceptional performance would have set him up as a dominant victor. He was one of a few drivers that tried an alternate pit strategy, and luck played into his favor as his competition retired. He carved through the field and was briefly one of the race’s 18 leaders, showing yet again that he is truly one of the finest open-wheel racers in the world. LOSER: Katherine Legge Katherine Legge made her Indy 500 return in 2023 after nine years away from the track, but her race ended in disappointment. She returned to IMS in 2024 seeking redemption, but her Dale Coyne Racing No. 51 machine let her down: on lap 23, Legge slowed on the track as smoke poured from the rear of her car. Her engine had failed, and she would retire from the race after just 57 of its 500 miles. While Legge wasn’t the only Honda driver to face an engine issue, her result was uniquely disappointing. The 44-year-old was the only woman in the field, and one of only nine women to ever compete at Indianapolis. She arrived for a one-off attempt at the race with ample backing from sponsor e.l.f. Cosmetics and served as a huge inspiration to female fans around the globe. It is unclear if Legge will return for another shot at the race; it would be truly disappointing for her Indianapolis efforts to end in back-to-back retirements after breaking so many records and being such a fantastic ambassador for the sport. WINNER: e.l.f. Cosmetics Even though e.l.f. Cosmetics driver Katherine Legge exited the race early, the brand was a serious winner of the Indy 500 this year. The makeup brand sponsored Legge in 2023, then came back to provide a primary partnership in 2024. Further, e.l.f. signed on as a partner of the 2024 Indy 500 and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Its investment in the sport was clear. Not only did e.l.f. put on an exceptional drone show over downtown Indianapolis on the Saturday night before the race, but it also developed a massive “lip oil change” fan activation in the infield. There, fans of all kinds could get a makeover, enter a contest to win a year’s supply of lip oil, learn about the nine women who have contested the Indy 500, and collect sample products and Legge-specific merchandise items. The merchandise itself included scarves, hats and magnets while the samples were as generic as sunscreen and lip balm, or as glamorous as mascara and plumping lipstick. Of all the activations in the fan area — which included displays from other sponsors like Good Ranchers and Verizon — the e.l.f. display was both the most elaborate and the most well attended. It was the only activation that actively provided an experience and products designed for a female audience, but it was just as welcoming for the men who perused its offerings. The sponsorship represents a shift in motorsport demographics; while women have always watched and competed in racing, few sponsors (outside of, say, lingerie companies) have actually considered their wants or needs. Now, women are so prevalent in the racing world that big-name woman-focused brands like e.l.f. can see a benefit in investing time, money, and resources into motorsport because it knows it can see a return on its investment. That’s a huge win for e.l.f., for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and for women involved in motorsport around the world. LOSER: Colton Herta Colton Herta is notorious for both his bad luck and his small mistakes — neither of which ever seem to strike at the same time. His 2024 season has been one of his most consistent yet, and during the first half of the 2024 Indy 500, he looked like an exceptional contender for the lead after putting on a promising show in practice. Unfortunately for the Californian driver, he lost control of his car on the entry to Turn 1 on lap 86. While he did appear to save it momentarily, a second bump of oversteer meant Herta careened into the wall. He had fought his way up from 13th to second before losing control. Herta’s Andretti Autosport team brought the car back to the garage, where it deemed the damage to be repairable. Herta ultimately finished 170 of the race’s 200 laps and was classified as the 23rd-place finisher — but it was a serious blow to one of the fastest Honda drivers of the race. WINNER: The Fans When a race is delayed several hours for severe weather, it can be a challenge to keep fans both safe and happy. This year, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway proved why it remains one of the finest sporting venues in the world with its handling of the rain delay. First and foremost, when it became clear earlier this month that weather may impact the 500, IMS rented the high-powered jet dryers that NASCAR uses to clear its tracks of moisture. On the day of the race, it provided fans with ample safe areas to seek shelter and a long heads-up to get there. Track cell service and WiFi remained strong, and as the lightning cleared, a group of dedicated fans organized foot races that drew huge crowds and kept the atmosphere buzzing. The track dried quickly, IMS still provided a tradition-packed pre-race show, and when the green flag finally flew, it felt just as special as any other race day. The exceptional show was simply the cherry on top of a stress-free and impressively organized event. LOSER: Meyer Shank Racing Oh, Meyer Shank Racing. The plucky team has had one of its finest years yet in IndyCar racing, boasting one pole position and securing several top-10 finishes — and it looked set to replicate that performance in the Indy 500. Félix Rosenqvist was one of the three Hondas in the Fast 12 qualifying session, but he was one of several Honda drivers to suffer engine issues on race day. Meanwhile, sportscar ace Tom Blomqvist embarrassed the team with a first-lap crash. He dropped below the white line in Turn 1 and, as he lost control, he crashed into Marcus Ericsson. Pietro Fittipaldi and Callum Ilott made contact trying to avoid the wreck, bringing out the first caution of the race — and becoming the first three retirements in the 500. That left the team’s hopes in the hands of four-time 500 winner Hélio Castroneves. The Brazilian had a beastly run in the race, passing five cars in as many laps and racing hard to make up for his 20th-place starting position. Unfortunately, he suffered a poor pit stop that saw him lose out on all that hard work. He crossed the line in 20th.

        "content": "Jonathan Fortin woke up on May 24 morning to check on his herd of Black Angus cattle, only to find his field was empty. Mr. Fortin, who co-owns Ferme ForThé in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, said he initially thought his calves and cows might have got loose, but the presence of tire tracks and a fence that appeared to have been dismantled led him to conclude that something more sinister had occurred. “All my herd—close to 75 animals—were stolen,” he said in an interview on May 27. Quebec provincial police confirmed they’re investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm in Cookshire-Eaton, Que., on May 24 and finding the cattle had “disappeared.” Mr. Ruel didn’t say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but he noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals. “You can’t move that many livestock in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla,” he said in a phone interview. Mr. Fortin figures the cattle were taken between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on May 23, while he was out working his second job. He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. “There’s a lot of emotion, because even if it’s a new business, it’s still all the work and the life savings,” he said. “To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.” Mr. Fortin says it isn’t easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it’s not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he’s heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Mr. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren’t insured against theft. If not, he says he'll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. “For sure it’s very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we’re restarting at zero,” he said.",

The photos were from their wedding back in 2001, and in one of the shots, the lovebirds posed on a balcony with arms around one another. The director of Impractical Jokers: The Movie was also seen carrying his new wife’s bouquet while in another one of these memorable pictures, The Blue Lagoon star kneeled down in a church in her gorgeous wedding gown. Shields also included more recent photos of the pair, including a candid selfie taken in front of a scenic water view in Europe. Along with these old shots, some newer ones were also included, one of them being a selfie of the two in Europe with a prepossessing water view. The actress captioned the wholesome post as follows, \"Today marks 23 years married to the love of my life. Still giddy to be stuck with you, Henchy!\" Well-known friends of the model were quick to express their happiness for the couple, one of them being Debi Mazar who chimed in by stating, “\"Love you both! Auguri (Portuguese for \"all the best\").”",

        "description": "Sinn Féin has knocked back a Green party plan for Belfast City Council to go vegan.",
        "content": "At a recent council committee meeting in City Hall the parties went up against each other over a motion by the Greens to impose a “fully plant-based procurement” on council buildings. The Strategic Policy and Resources Committee nevertheless voted for council officers to prepare a report looking at how a vegan policy would be costed and implemented. The Green motion states the council “agrees to engage with the Plant Based Councils initiative and to commit to fully plant-based procurement where food is served throughout the council estate, prioritising seasonal local produce to support local farmers, and ensure that there are plant-based food options available at all city council run events, as well as prioritising plant-based menu options in council run facilities.” Green councillor Anthony Flynn, who proposed the motion, told the committee he was asking for a “feasibility” report on the proposal. “This aligns with our obligations in the Belfast Agenda, in terms of tackling health inequalities and increasing our city’s resilience to climate change, as well as the Belfast City Council declaration of a climate emergency in 2019,” he said. “One of the recommendations in the 2021 UK National Food Strategy recommended that local authorities ensure that ratepayer money is spent on healthy and sustainable foods. “Vegan or plant-based diets are better for the environment as they produce a quarter of the emissions compared to diets including meat, less than half of the water consumed and less of an impact on water pollution and biodiversity. “Local authorities have a huge role to play in helping inform the public in making healthy and sustainable food choices. “Belfast Healthy Cities says that reviewing procurement policies for transport and food could enhance health and sustainability for people and the planet.” Sinn Féin councillor Ronan McLaughlin said he “would have some problems” in terms of procurement, as it would see the council “having to deal with plant based caterers, which would narrow the market, and increase the general overall cost”. “I am happy with having options, but this is supposed to be a just transition, it is not about forcing people to eat plant based food, they should be doing it for their own reasons, not because an authority tries to impose it onto them,” he added. “It should be about people making the right choices through an education process, not through a forced process. “And I would be worried about the cost. In terms of the current climate, the cost of living crisis, I don’t think we can agree to increase the catering budget of the council. I don’t think the public would stand for that. I don’t think it is a good look at all.” Green councillor Brian Smyth said: “What councillor Flynn is asking for is reasonable. He is asking for a report to come back – if there are issues with procurement they will be set out. “That is fair, there are lots of things that go to report and come back with options, and people say further down the line it isn’t for us.” Sinn Féin councillor Micheal Donnelly said council catering free meals and drink for councillors at full council meetings and committee was “a bit outdated.” He asked for a report on “cost implications” of feeding the 60 Belfast councillors at every meeting with a view to ending it. He said: “We are big and ugly enough to feed ourselves if we are hungry, and grab a sandwich before we go to a committee or full council.” The committee also agreed to look at costs for councillor food.",

        "content": "NFL icon Tom Brady looks fitter than ever. The ex- New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, 46, recently shared a video of himself enjoying the Memorial Day weekend. And the clip put Brady 's remarkable physique on full display. The seven-time Super Bowl champion could be seen soaking up the rays while doing watersports with his children. The NFL legend also tried some solo wakesurfing and fell off on numerous occasions, causing a big splash. \"You guys okay if we get summer started?\" Brady captioned the post . \"Hope everyone is having a great MDW!\" And fans loved the update – while pointing out that Brady looked ready to return to the field again if he wanted to. \"Tom is looking better than ever,\" one commented. \"Could still come out and toss 4500 and 30 TDs,\" another added. \"Someone looks to be in football shape,\" a third said. \"Tom could win a Super Bowl at 70. Shredded to the gills,\" one wrote. Brady is set to begin his broadcasting career this year as part of his 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox Sports. The retired quarterback will replace Greg Olsen as the network's top color analyst. He will call games alongside play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt in a team that also features sideline reporter Erin Andrews . Andrews recently said she was confident that Brady would do well in the booth. In an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon , the Fox Sports star recalled how Brady kept telling fascinating stories about his career at lunch once. \"And it's stuff we just die for. Love the inside information,\" Andrews said. \"And you are hearing stuff that you've just always wanted to know. And my knee was just bouncing.\" Andrews' colleague and podcast partner Charissa Thompson was also sure that Brady would be just fine behind the mic. \"His resume supports that he is great at everything he does,\" Thompson noted. \"So why would this be any different?\"",

        "content": "A North Vancouver man has been charged with attempted murder after an alleged knife attacked on a stranger in Deep Cove on Saturday. Shortly after 3 p.m. on May 25, police responded to reports of a man slashing cars and attacking a motorcyclist near Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road, North Vancouver RCMP said in a release on Monday. The man allegedly struck the biker’s helmet with a knife, narrowly avoiding injury but causing him to fall and sustain minor injuries as a result, the release said. The motorcyclist was led to safety by a driver at the scene. Numerous officers arrived and took the man into custody, where he went on to allegedly assault a police officer, said North Vancouver RCMP. “The quick actions of our officers led to the safe arrest of the suspect,” said Const. Mansoor Sahak of the North Vancouver RCMP. “We would like to thank the quick-thinking actions of a passing motorist who assisted the motorcyclist by guiding them to safety.” Sahak said anyone who may have been affected by the attack can contact the RCMP’s Victim Services Unit, 24 hours a day, seven days a week at 604-969-7540. “We want you to know we are here, we will listen and we will support you,” he said. Any witnesses who have not already come forward are urged to contact the police at 604-985-1311, and quote file #24-10135. District of North Vancouver Mayor Mike Little, who resides in Deep Cove, issued a statement on Sunday evening describing the event as a “really upsetting incident” for the community. “It could have been much worse without the quick action of a passing motorist and the speedy response from our local RCMP officers,” he said. “I am grateful to everyone who was involved in the response in Deep Cove on Saturday.” On Sunday, Alexander Currie of North Vancouver was charged with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assault on a police officer, and possession of a weapon. He was due to appear in court May 27. Mina Kerr-Lazenby is the North Shore News’ Indigenous and civic affairs reporter. This reporting beat is made possible by the Local Journalism Initiative .

Finn came home from \"picking up pizza,\" which he did, that he also witnessed his birth mother Sheila and now step-father, Deacon, get married. Hope was also at the wedding and convinced Finn to attend for the sake of their parents. Steffy questioned Finn on his whereabouts after he admitted that his phone was on silent when she tried to reach him. As Finn was attempting to explain how he accidentally walked into Deacon and Sheila's wedding while picking up pizza, Steffy's phone rings and she sees a picture of Deacon, Hope, Sheila and Finn from the wedding. Steffy was upset when she noticed that he was standing next to Sheila. She kept repeating the words, \"Oh my gosh.\" Finn tried to explain to her that he was telling the truth despite how the pictures looked. Viewers hopped on X, formerly known as Twitter, and feel like Finn will be getting what he deserves from Steffy. One person wrote: \"Divorce incoming #BoldandBeautiful.\" Another person wrote: \"Finn is going to be on a big timeout now. #boldandbeautiful.\" A third person wrote: \"Dump his idiot a-- he shut a note to watch. This woman little tried to kill u both and yet he still don’t get why Steffy don’t want her around.. he will find out soon enough #BoldandBeautiful.\" What Steffy does not know is that Finn was guilted by Hope and Sheila into staying. Steffy has made it clear to Finn that she did not want him to have any relationship with Sheila after she tried to kill her. Steffy \"killed\" Sheila as she was defending herself but later found out that Sheila was, indeed, alive. Steffy is also not a big fan of Hope and vice versa. Hope dated Steffy's brother, Thomas, who left town after Hope denied his proposal. Viewers have been awaiting this split between Steffy and Finn and believe that he will end up with Hope, who is now his step-sister.",

        "content": "Kevin Sabitus/Getty Images The Eagles-Cowboys rivalry is among the fiercest in the NFL. The fanbases can't stand each other, and in some cases, the animosity extends over to the players themselves. For 13 seasons, Jason Kelce battled the Cowboys twice a year as a member of the Eagles. This year, he will have to cover two Dallas games as part of ESPN's Monday Night Countdown. During the newest episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast with brother Travis, Jason was asked how he'll handle the responsibility of discussing his former team's most-hated rival. “Oh, I have no bias,” Jason explained, via Awful Announcing . “I just don’t like them. But I’m gonna give them their props. There’s a rivalry, but the reality is, even though I hate the Cowboys’ fanbase...I was at a charity golf outing, and there was a kid, and he was like, ‘Hey, I’m a Cowboys fan.’ I was like, ‘Oh, are you from Dallas?’ And he said, ‘No, I’m from Philadelphia.’ Are you a Lakers and a Yankees fan, too? Like, what are we doing? We’re just picking whatever team we want; that’s where we’re at?\" Jason added that he'll be able to \"set aside my differences as a player and the competition,\" but then Travis interrupted him to call him out for being a Pittsburgh Steelers fan growing up in Cleveland. “I had to; we didn’t have a team,” Jason explained. “We lost our team. The next closest team was the Pittsburgh Steelers, geographically, and I loved Jerome Bettis. I couldn’t keep being a Browns fan when they went to be the Ravens. There wasn’t a team to root for, Travis... the moment the Browns came back, I got a Tim Couch jersey, and I was rocking Tim Couch. I still loved Jerome Bettis, but I was no longer a Steelers fan once the Browns came back.” Kelce will work two Dallas home games on Monday Night Football , starting Week 11 against the Houston Texans. He'll be back at Jerry World in Week 14 when the Cowboys host the Cincinnati Bengals. It will be interesting to see the kind of reception he gets from Dallas fans when on assignment. Our guess is there will be some booing and good-natured taunting, but a mutual respect will outweigh any concerns over the Cowboys-Eagles rivalry.",

        "content": "Josh is joined by Sophie Walker on this week's episode of the Sky Sports Golf podcast to reflect on the tragic news of Grayson Murray's death, before previewing the US Women's Open and hearing from Eddie Pepperell in a wide-ranging interview. It was announced over the weekend that two-time PGA Tour winner Murray passed away on Saturday after withdrawing late in his second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge on Friday. Murray's family confirmed in a statement that the 30-year-old had taken his own life after previously speaking openly about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. \"Everybody thinks that professional golf is the best job in the world, just because you've got all the stuff, all the money, all the trophies, life must be good right? Sometimes it's not and it's a battle in your own mind,\" said Sophie Walker. \"Maybe listening to some of the stuff he said some of us might have thought he'd won that battle, but I don't think you ever do. It's a constant thing and it makes me so sad he was that low. \"It's horrible to think that's your only option.\" Tributes have poured in from across the world of golf as the sport remembers the influence of Murray, who has previously taken time to open himself up to messages from others who might have been struggling with their mental health. \"I often say, some of the lads I've played with, when I see them on the course on Tour they look like super men,\" said Walker. \"Their clothes are fresh out of the packet, their shoes, they walk around and look six foot five etc, but you're trying to put on a show for yourself in order to be as confident as possible. \"There's nothing quite like not playing well and going back to a hotel room alone and being left with your own thoughts. \"Pro golfers I think speak quite negatively to themselves at the best of times, and you would never say what you say to yourself to somebody else. \"When things are going well your phone blows up, when they aren't it's a really quiet place.\" You can listen to more by downloading the latest Sky Sports podcast via Spotify , Spreaker or Apple Podcasts .

Canadian Press May 27, 2024 12:56 PM Share by Email Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Print Share via Text Message Alberta's police watchdog says there will be no criminal charges for two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled NDP legislature member Shannon Phillips. Phillips speaks as Rachel Notley looks on at an announcement in Calgary, Monday, March 15, 2021. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh EDMONTON — Two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member won't face charges, even though there are reasonable grounds to believe they committed a crime, says the province's law enforcement watchdog. In a letter to the lawyer for Lethbridge New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says the provincial prosecution service has declined to take the matter to court. \"(The agency) determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two officers had committed criminal offences by accessing Ms. Phillips' data,\" reads the letter, dated May 17. \"The investigative materials concerning two officers were forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether their test for prosecution was met. (The agency) received an opinion back that (the service's) test for prosecution was not met and therefore these individuals will not be charged.\" The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has not yet filed its full report on the investigation. \"(The agency) will soon be producing a public-facing report containing our investigative conclusions,\" the letter says. In 2017, Phillips, who was then environment minister, was discussing a proposed new park with a constituent in a coffee shop and was overheard by Lethbridge officer Keon Woronuk. Woronuk, a local all-terrain-vehicle user, was concerned that what he heard might have an impact on his hobby. Woronuk subsequently posted photos of the meeting on a Facebook page under the name \"Mike Corps,\" which included identifying the stakeholders and a long caption criticizing Phillips and the NDP government. That prompted Phillips to complain to Calgary police, who found Woronuk had conducted an unauthorized database search. Calgary police then passed the investigation on to Medicine Hat police. Woronuk was later convicted of five counts of violating the Police Services Act. They included wrongly subjecting Phillips to a police database search, singling her and others out for traffic enforcement, misleading supervisors and using his position as an officer for political reasons. The other officer, Jason Carrier, also an off-road enthusiast, was convicted on two counts of the police act — being an accessory to Woronuk's offences and failing to report them. In 2020, both men received temporary demotions. Woronuk was demoted for two years and Carrier for one year. Phillips appealed the sentences, but they were upheld. She has also filed a lawsuit against the Lethbridge Police Service. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake? Have a story/tip?

        "content": "The Imo State Command of the Nigeria Police has confirmed the rank demotion of one of its officers caught extorting money from motorists along the Owerri-Onitsha express road. The officer, identified as Inspector Isong Osudueh, was captured in a viral video collecting money from drivers on the busy road and, in some cases, handing them change. The officer’s extortion video, attached to the Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU), has continued to generate criticism from social media users, with many condemning the act in its entirety. Reacting to the development on Monday, the Imo State Commissioner of Police, Aboki Danjuma, described the act as shameful and unprofessional. In a statement made available by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Henry Okoye, CP Danjuma stated that the demotion became important to maintain his officers’ highest professionalism. ALSO READ: Two feared killed in Lagos Police station attack The statement also revealed that the supervisory officer in charge of monitoring the activities of the erring officer was issued an official query for lack of supervision. The Imo State Commissioner of Police, however, enjoined the state’s residents not to relent in their efforts to continuously support the police and other security agencies with timely information. The statement partly reads, “The disciplinary actions taken against the erring officer underscore the Command’s unwavering commitment to maintaining the highest standards of professionalism, transparency, and integrity among its personnel while effectively discharging its lawful duties and entrenching public trust and confidence. “While strongly condemning the embarrassing act, the Commissioner of Police, CP Aboki Danjuma, reiterates that the Command under his watch will not condone any act of extortion or misconduct by its personnel and warns that any supervisory officer who fails to carry out his oversight duties will be severely sanctioned.”",

        "description": "There is a growing number of Brits exploring relationships involving multiple partners. One couple have told the Mirror how their open marriage works for them",
        "content": "Hacking on an industrial scale exposed the personal details of 30 million users of the Ashley Madison dating site for married people looking to cheat - resulting in heartbreak, divorce and even suicide. But neither the 2015 hack, nor the new Netflix docuseries, Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal, examining the subsequent fall-out, have dampened its customers' ardour. Now, nine years after the personal data became public, Ashley Madison - described as “only for married people” and claiming to be “the first married dating website” - has millions of customers. It also welcomes people in “open relationships’ like husband-and-wife Chu Nim and Su Perez, who completely understand the allure of extra-marital sex - although they never cheat. The super glam couple have an open marriage The pair have been married for years ( Image: Collect) Instead, the London-based parents, who met on the dancefloor of the Liquid & Envy nightclub in Romford, Essex, in 2008, juggle kids, work, sex parties and throuples...together. Chu, 37, tells the Mirror : \"One night we were out, really drunk, and a friend stayed over. We were like ‘Should we bring this person in?’ “Obviously, it was very scary at the time. The funny thing was we hadn’t even spoken to this person, they were oblivious.” According to Chu, everyone was in the bedroom when he suddenly asked their friend if he wanted to sleep with his wife. “They didn’t think it was real until we made it real,” he says. Su, 44, adds: “It was just me getting involved. There was no sexual connection between the two men, it was just me with them. “It went really well. The morning was awkward, he went out and brought us breakfast! “But it didn’t change anything about us or our friendship.” Away from their unorthodox sex life, the couple look after their 12-year-old son and Su’s 23-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. She is disabled and Su is her carer, as well as being an events manager, while Chu is a manager at a private jet business. The pair say it strengthens their relationship ( Image: Collect) Chu and Su discussed it for years before going ahead - and say communication is key ( Image: Collect) They both say that sleeping with other people strengthens their connection and keeps their sex life sizzling. Enjoying an open marriage by mutual consent, without any deception, they say they don’t need Ashley Madison. The couple, whose first sexual experience as a throuple was in 2018, generally sleep with another woman. When they involve another man, he makes love to Su, but not to Chu. “Chu always says he just likes me enjoying myself and having pleasure. He doesn’t get involved, but it works for us,” says Su. In a practice known as “unicorn hunting” - when a usually heterosexual couple seeks a third and generally bisexual female partner to join a threesome - they normally involve a woman. Despite their unconventional marriage, their courtship was fairly standard, with Su saying of their first meeting: “I don’t believe in love at first sight, but I do believe something happened. They used to be very traditional “Then we just kept bumping into each other and we moved quickly. We became friends really quickly and I think that's the basis of any relationship - we’re best friends.” The pair held a Chinese marriage service in 2011, the day before Valentine’s Day, attended by friends and family. They then officially registered their nuptials two years ago, after marrying again in Las Vegas. For several years they were quite traditional, with Su making Chu promise not to visit any strip clubs in Amsterdam on his stag do. She says: “I literally said ‘I only have one condition - do not go to the strip clubs.’ “The way I saw it was that if you’ve found the one, I should be the one forever. You shouldn’t even need to look anywhere else.” When Chu was “dragged” to a sex show - but not a strip club - on his stag night, Su threatened to call off their big day, before cooling down. But everything changed two years later when they started visiting Miami for work. Su says: “The sex culture there is very big - especially in the clubs. One of the first nights, we went with some friends to a strip club and I remember saying ‘Enjoy yourself but respect me.’” Chu adds: “Su made it really clear to me from the get-go and I really understood. It’s not about the girls, it’s about how I make her feel in that scenario. “We can be very comfortable and say ‘that girl is beautiful’ or ‘that man looks amazing’, but you need to have a foundation of understanding.” On one Miami trip, the pair shared a private lap dance and “the penny dropped”, says Su, as she watching her husband’s reaction. They first explored their fantasies in Miami ( Image: Collect) Su was fuming when Chu attended a sex show in Amsterdam “It was very sensual,” she says. “I enjoyed watching him enjoy it, and he enjoyed me enjoying it. And it progressed to us fantasising about situations.” But boundaries are key. They discuss everything before involving other people. “I think you can get very lost in the moment and think ‘let’s just do it’ but it’s not necessarily the right move,” says Su. Looking back at the night in Miami, Chu adds: “There was lots of discussion - ‘is it just a fantasy, do we want to make it real?’” And when they eventually invited a woman to join them, Su says there was a “completely different dynamic” in the bedroom. “The first time, it was just me, but the second time we were both involved.” Watching Chu make love to another woman didn’t make her jealous. She says: “For me, it’s about making me feel that I’m there. That even if he’s having sex with another woman, I’m the most important person in the room. I need to be present.” The extra-marital activity bonds them more than threatening their relationship, according to Su, who adds: “It brings you closer together. You enjoy each other in a very different way.” Meanwhile, Chu admits that enjoying intimacy with two women is “amazing.” He says: “If someone does something wrong, we sit down and we make sure it doesn’t happen again. “Obviously, boundaries can be blurred, especially in the heat of the moment, as there’s a different part of the brain making decisions.” It has helped discovering that friends they already had are, in fact, swingers. Chu says: “We thought it was just us. The pair have enjoyed sex parties before - but prefer to be a bit more selective “By absolute happenstance, some of our closest friends that we’ve known for 20 years are swingers.” And while they haven’t ruled sex parties out, they have been enjoying more intimate encounters like those described. Chu says: “There’s different types of open relationships. We don’t play separately, it’s all about being together. “So, we’ve been moving back to our own kind of thing, using certain websites, and even escorts. Just to make life easy.” Understanding each other’s needs is of paramount importance before an open relationship can work, according to Su. And when Chu, who is gregarious, organised some “hook-ups” and she felt left out, she told him. She says: “I realised it wasn’t making me comfortable, that I needed it to be on my terms. I needed to give the all-clear. “You’re still a couple and a family. It’s all about enhancing parts of your life.” These days, when they’re in the mood for a third person, they might call on a friend to join them. But they’ve managed to form lasting friendships with some people they have enjoyed casual sex with. Despite their openness, they do exercise caution when talking to other people about their open marriage. Chu says: “If people ask, I’ll never lie, but I’m not mentioning it in the office.” Similarly, they don’t advertise their unconventional sex life to their children - although they say they will answer age-appropriate questions if asked. The pair say there's a lot of incorrect assumptions about open relationships out there And Su is keen to dispel the image of people looking for three-way sex being kinky, “old and wrinkly.” She says: “It’s a massive misconception that everyone in this world is old and wrinkly and an exhibitionist. “There are a lot of young trendy people. Unfortunately, not a lot of people understand it. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t work for us. “A lot of people think that if you do this with somebody else it's because you're not happy in your marriage. “I completely disagree. I think the happier you are in a marriage, the easier it is to do this, as you trust each other.” Classified site, Vivastreet , connects people with casual encounters and more Shoppers say £19 wrinkle-filling cream gives ‘amazing’ results on fine lines in four days",

        "content": "In recent weeks, GIFs sent by iPhone users to Android devices running Google Messages have turned into distorted still images with missing dots/pixels throughout. This issue — with reports continuing to come in — has been encountered on Pixel, Samsung, and other Android phones. All the GIFs have been sent over SMS/MMS by iPhone owners. While more than a few Android users have reported this issue, not every iPhone-Android conversation is impacted. GIFs we sent in testing today appear normally in Google Messages. Meanwhile, one case described how they had this problem but other Android users in the same group chat received GIFs from iPhone owners without issue. Credit: u/Diiiiirty, u/ForwardMotion6565 Given the wide range of devices and carriers, it’s unlikely to be an Android OS issue. It could be a problem with the Google Messages app, but we have yet to find Android-to-Android instances. As such, iOS is the most likely culprit. A compression or rendering bug might be at fault. Reports about this distorted iPhone GIF issue increased in mid-May , though some Android users say it has been happening for a few weeks before that. One thing worth noting is how Apple released iOS 17.5 on May 13 , with beta testing starting on April 2 . This issue comes ahead of Apple’s work to adopt RCS on the iPhone. We’re expecting it to launch later this year . The first beta of iOS 18 should arrive next month at WWDC 2024, but it’s unclear if RCS will be enabled on those first previews.

        "description": "The experienced Red Storm finished atop Class A South, thanks to shutdown pitching and an improved offense.",
        "content": "SCARBOROUGH — A year ago, the Scarborough High baseball team’s season ended abruptly. A Class A South quarterfinal loss to No. 6 Marshwood left the higher-seeded Red Storm disappointed. Despite being beaten by top-tier pitcher Noah Fitzgerald, the good feeling from an 11-5 regular season and a third-place place finish in A South evaporated after they failed to advance in the postseason. This year feels different. Scarborough finished the regular season 15-1, winning its eighth straight game on Saturday, a 12-0 decision over Portland at Hadlock Field. The Red Storm will likely enter the Class A South playoffs as the No. 1 seed. Scarborough is also poised to have an 11-day break between its regular-season finale and the regional quarterfinals on June 6. “Last year, we were all young. That’s part of the reason we fell short last year,” said Tyler Archambault, a slick-fielding senior shortstop. “This year, we’re all older. We’ve been playing together since we were 10 years old. We’ve all grown together. It took last year to all grow together at the varsity level. This year, we’re all more mature. Bigger, stronger and mentally more mature, as well.” A post shared by Varsity Maine (@varsity.maine) Scarborough lost only one player from its 2023 team, Coach Wes Ridlon said, adding that team expectations didn’t change – “Finish in the top four.” One effect of last year’s early playoff exit was that Scarborough, despite all its returning players and a deep pitching staff, wasn’t tabbed as the favorite entering this season. That distinction went to Falmouth (13-3), which is second in the standings. “I think people definitely thought that we would be in the mix, in the middle of the pack. I don’t think anyone thought we would be where we are,” said junior Erik Swenson, the staff ace. “But I credit it to my coaches. We have a great team, we have a strong team.” The Red Storm have won close games. They have come from behind. They have handled many teams with ease. The one setback came to Deering (5-10), and they nearly recovered from a 7-0 first-inning deficit in that one, losing 8-7. Scarborough’s success starts with its pitching. Swenson, who has verbally committed to pitch for the University of Maine, is 5-0 with one save. He recently beat his future Black Bear teammate, Falmouth senior Brennan Rumpf, in a 2-1 pitchers’ duel . Swenson has struck out 58 over 31 2/3 innings, and compiled a 0.66 ERA. Scarborough’s Matthew Fallona gets a hit in the fourth inning to drive in the winning run in a May 16 game against Falmouth. Derek Davis/Staff Photographer Zak Sanders has stepped in as the No. 2 starter after an injury to senior Harrison Griffiths. Sanders is 3-0 with three saves and a 0.78 ERA. He has 34 strikeouts and six walks over 27 innings. Sophomore Ryan Shugars (4-0, 0.56 ERA), senior right-hander Mason Porter and sophomore righty Nate Masters have contributed to the team’s 0.86 ERA. Opponents are hitting just .167 against the Red Storm. “Our staff is very effective because we throw strikes and we mix up speeds with efficiency,” Sanders said. “First-pitch strikes and getting people to make outs, not necessarily strikeouts.” Scarborough’s improved offense emphasizes batters reaching base. In a 12-1 mercy-rule shortened victory over Windham on May 21, the Red Storm had seven hits over four innings (as the home team, they did not need to bat in the fifth). But they had 19 baserunners, thanks to walks, hit-batsmen and defensive errors. Ridlon said he and his staff stress the value of hitting hard ground balls. On grounders, the defense has to field the ball, throw the ball and catch the throw, as opposed to a fly ball, “when all they have to do is catch it for an out.” Matthew Fallona is hitting .432 and leads the team in hits (19) and RBI (16). Mason Porter (.326, 14 RBI, team-best five extra-base hits), Archambault (.321), Sanders (.348, team-high 23 runs), and left-fielder Patrick McCue (.297, 14 RBI) have also contributed to a team that is hitting .288 overall. Even better, the Red Storm’s on-base percentage is .410. McCue (.518), Porter (.492), Fallona (.491) and Sanders (.455) lead the club in OBP. Once on base, Scarborough goes into attack mode. “That’s definitely our image. We like to put pressure on people as early as possible on the base paths,” Porter said. “Especially if there’s a pitcher we see is struggling a little bit, as much pressure as we can put on the base paths as possible is what we like to do.” Sometimes Scarborough runs into outs. In the first inning of the Windham game, Sanders scored on a wild pitch. Ridlon then waved home Fallona from second base on the same play. Fallona, however, was out by a couple feet to end the inning. “We love the hyper-aggressive base running,” Archambault said. “We love to put stress on teams and we love to take the extra bags we can, even if that means we get thrown out sometimes. “We figure at this level, we can get more runs that way than outs, and it’s worked pretty well for us the last two years.” Success.

        "content": "Cannes security guard, previously embroiled in a dispute with Kelly Rowland, is now accused of disrespecting Korean actress Yoona. The K-pop star-turned-actress was reportedly halted from posing for red carpet photos on the iconic Cannes stairs by the same security guard. This incident follows closely on the heels of the confrontation with Rowland, where the Destiny's Child alum hinted at racial bias. While the guard's colleagues defended her actions as simply 'doing her job,' fans uncovered another video showcasing Yoona receiving similar treatment. Despite her composed demeanor, her facial expressions betrayed her evident discomfort and annoyance as she was escorted away from the stairs by the female staffer. In the latest developments at the Cannes Filmd Festival, the controversy surrounding the behavior of a particular security guard has escalated, drawing attention to alleged instances of disrespect towards celebrities and attendees. Among the incidents that have sparked widespread criticism, a Ukrainian model found herself in a heated altercation with the same guard, resulting in an expulsion from the red carpet. The model, visibly determined to reclaim her place on the iconic Cannes stairs, engaged in a physical confrontation with the worker. Furthermore, Massiel Taveras, a Dominican actress, became embroiled in a similar clash with the female guard in question, echoing the confrontational atmosphere.",

        "content": "ESPN's Stephen A. Smith has fired back after being called out by an NBA Hall of Famer. Two-time NBA champion Isiah Thomas called out Smith on social media after he criticized Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown on First Take . The Celtics are currently knee-deep in the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers , with Brown and Co. leading the series 3-0. Following their 133-128 Game 1 win, Smith took to First Take to share a brutal note he'd been sent by \"an NBA source\" regarding Brown - who was recently controversially snubbed from the All-Star lineups. \"It's not so much that he's underrated; it's that he's just not liked because of his 'I-am-better-than-you attitude,'\" Smith said. \"He knows it. It's the same reason he is not as marketable as he should be.\" Thomas, however, was far from impressed with this take, taking to X, formerly known as Twitter , to defend the 27-year-old. \"I have been a friend, mentor and advisor to @FCHWPO since he was a student at UC Berkeley he is 100 percent marketable and before you slander his name @stephenasmith tell your source to put their name on it or don't speak on it,\" Thomas said . \"Let it be known.\" But Smith also wasn't going to take this criticism lying down, also taking to X to reply to Thomas. \"I have no idea what you're talking about @IsiahThomas,\" he said . \"I have been a fan of Jaylen Brown for years. Still am. What’s unfortunate is that you — who's known for me decades — would choose to go on X to expressed whatever dissent you feel instead of calling me directly. \"But I get it. It's a pattern several folks have used vs me recently, suddenly forgetting communication we've always had. \"So be it. I root for JB always—a great dude and player. But the @celtics have to close the deal.\" As for Brown, he too took to X to respond to Smith , calling on him to \"State your source.\" Smith, though, could not be convinced. He replied saying simply, \"That's not happening. It's journalism. Not revealing sources. Smith then went on to note that later in the aforementioned First Take segment , he and Kendrick Perkins both disagreed with the source. \"The point we were actually discussing is how under appreciated you are and why that may be, which is why I read the quote,\" he added. \"I even brought up how socially conscious you are, and how that may not be liked, knowing you're a good brother. STEPHEN A. Smith is now the face of ESPN and an executive producer on First Take having initially started working for the company back in 2003. Smith has held various roles with the network, including hosting radio shows, SportsCenter contributions, and appearing on NBA Countdown. He was a columnist for the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1994 to 2010. His began as an NBA writer before becoming a general sports columnist. Before that, Smith worked as a reporter with Winston-Salem Journal, the Greensboro News, and the New York Daily News. \"Also, that you're a $300M man and you deserve it. But that doesn't mean naysayers don't get heard. That comes with the territory.\" Regardless of who said what, Brown has been impressive as usual during the Conference Finals. In three games he has averaged 30 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 3.3 assists. The Celtics will now have the opportunity to complete the sweep on Monday at 8pm ET. And as for the beef between Smith and Thomas, the latter has attempted to settle the situation in a later tweet. \"All love between you and I @stephenasmith let's talk when time permits,\" he wrote on Sunday. \"Tell your source to stand on their words and not use you to throw their stones.\"",

The Calgary golf professional is gearing up for playing in Canada's lone PGA Tour Champions event of the season while battling inoperable Stage 4 lung cancer. \"You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn't mean life's over,\" said Blake, whose received the shocking diagnosis in September. \"You've still got a lot to give, so get out there and give something.\" Blake was given a sponsor exemption on Monday, his 56th birthday, to play in his hometown at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf and Country Club from Aug. 16 to 18. \"The more I have something like this tournament coming up to look forward to, the more alive I feel,\" Blake said. \"I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who’s going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I’ll be around for the next one and so on and so on. \"As devastating as something can sound, I think if you believe that you can conquer something, you will, especially if you have good support staff and family (and) friends.” Blake, who also competed at the PGA Tour Champions event in 2018 when the tournament was known as the Shaw Charity Classic, decided to apply for another exemption while in the midst of undergoing eight months of chemotherapy treatments. He is looking forward to playing the sport he loves, possibly alongside fellow Canadians Mike Weir and Stephen Ames. \"It’s incredible,” Blake said. \"The opportunity, it leaves you speechless obviously to compete again with these guys to be on the same stage. The situation being what it is, they were very open to receive my letter and have me in there.\" A non-smoker with an active lifestyle, Blake developed a nagging cough in August. “I made a deal with my wife that if it did get worse that I would go to the hospital,” said Blake. “Long story short, about 16 hours later and my wife had shown up by that time, sitting in emergency going through a bunch of tests and stuff and they came back with the diagnosis.” Blake faced his prognosis from his oncologist with his family by his side. \"We knew it wasn’t going to be good,” Blake said. \"He said 12 to 24 months, but I kind of really grabbed onto that and said, 'I just want this to be the starting point. Like, I’ll see you in 24 months and then we’ll discuss another prognosis if you’ve got another one for me.' \"Being able to look forward to something like this does so much for me mentally, physically, everything, just to get me psyched up to come out here and compete again.\" The devastating news was a shock to the system for Blake, his wife Kelly and their kids Connor, 25, and Brooklyn, 22, who are both accomplished athletes. \"When we told the kids, they were so emotional as well,\" said Kelly. \"We didn’t know if Steve would be well enough to golf, let alone out here (at Canyon Meadows).\" Connor is a defenceman playing hockey for the ECHL’s Adirondack Thunder, while Brooklyn is a midfielder with Calgary Foothills WFC. \"I’m always looking for something to take my mind off the illness,” said Blake, who works as a financial adviser. “I’m still trying to be very active in work. I’m still trying to be very active in golf and in my kids’ sports and things like that.\" After just missing out on qualifying to compete at the U.S. Senior Open Championship last year, Blake will attempt to earn a spot to play at this year’s tournament to be held at Newport Country Club in Newport, R.I., from June 27 to 30. \"Having something like the U.S. Senior Open qualifier to look forward to again, just the idea of being able to go down and compete, is something that’s really special to me and my wife,\" said Blake, who will tee it up for a qualifying round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Calif., on Tuesday. “I’m fortunate I’ve played (Goose Creek) a couple times. I was close the last time I was down there. Hopefully, I just make a few more putts and we’ll see if we can get in the U.S. Senior Open again.\" Blake played at the major in 2018 at the Broadmoor Golf Club in Colorado Springs, Col. Although he missed the cut with rounds of 79 and 74, it gave him confidence that he could hold his own against the likes of World Golf Hall of Fame members Vijay Singh and Bernhard Langer. \"It’s just such a great opportunity to come out and compete with them,\" said Blake, who carded rounds of 70, 77 and 71 six years ago at Canyon Meadows to finish well back of winner Scott McCarron. \"It’ll be a little different than the last time. It’ll be similar as far as having family and friends and the crowd around, which I so enjoy having. “I know in 2018, it was let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here too much. It will be different, just playing for something maybe just a little bit bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "If you are a deeply unpopular incumbent president facing a stern uphill challenge in a bid for re-election (not unlike President Joe Biden) you would like to hit a couple public relations home runs en route to the general election. In lieu of home runs, which can certainly be tough to come by in this hyper-partisan political climate, the next best thing actually isn’t hitting singles or doubles — it’s just avoiding glaring errors. Thanks to a viral Memorial Day clip, the already- Joe Biden now finds himself trying to stave off such an error. As noted, Biden spoke Monday at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, as most presidents are wont to do on Memorial Day. And believe it or not, there was little issue with what Biden actually said during his speech. “Freedom has never been guaranteed — every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few and the rights of many,” Biden told those in attendance. “It matters. Our democracy is more than just a system of government. It’s the very soul of America.” Cool. Anyways, the real issue for Biden came up when a viral clip began circulating that showed the president ... less than energized. Is Biden sleeping at the Memorial Day Address?? — The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) “Is Biden sleeping at the Memorial Day Address?” The Post Millennial asked while sharing a clip of “ Joe.” To answer that outlet’s question: No, it doesn’t appear like Biden was asleep at the wheel (well, ) during this Memorial Day service. It really does look like Biden was closing his eyes in “prayer,” or at least solemn remembrance, for the men and women who’ve given their lives in service to this great country. But the issue isn’t so much the truth of the matter (it’s impossible to tell if he was actually dozing off or not, given Biden appears to generally move at a ), so much as it’s the optics of the matter. It’s that Joe Biden was falling asleep during this moment of remembrance because that’s what 81-year-old men do after anything remotely physically or mentally taxing. They nap. And that’s a generally big problem for Biden. The man could fix the economy and cure cancer tonight, but the fact won’t change that there will always be people dubious of the man’s ability to perform due to the biological realities of aging. And yes, Biden’s chief political rival, former President Donald Trump, isn’t exactly a spring chicken either, but you can’t deny the sheer between the two men. Because of those biological realities, Biden has to outperform expectations to overcome questions about his age. He’s obviously not accomplishing that, if is to be believed. And that’s the real problem with the viral clip of Biden “napping.” Perception shapes reality, and the perception of Biden being a doddering, sleepy old fool very much feels like reality. The president would do well to avoid these types of snafus — even innocent ones like this — if he wants any shot of a second term. (Hah.) We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

        "description": "Attorneys get one last chance to make their case to 12 jurors in Manhattan before deliberations begin this week",
        "content": "A verdict in Donald Trump ’s hush money trial could arrive as soon as Wednesday. Closing arguments in the former president’s criminal trial in Manhattan begin on Tuesday, and Manhattan prosecutors and Mr Trump’s defense team are expected to spend the day delivering their final statements to the jury before deliberations begin. Then, after 16 days of testimony from 22 witnesses spread out over five weeks, a group of 12 jurors in Manhattan will determine whether Mr Trump is guilty of falsifying business records as part of a conspiracy to corruptly influence the 2016 presidential election . Jurors will review dozens of documents, including emails, text messages, encrypted chats and the allegedly false documents at the center of the case. Those include company ledger entries, invoices and checks that form the paper trail of Mr Trump’s reimbursement payments to his former attorney Michael Cohen , who paid $130,000 to adult film star Stormy Daniels weeks before Election Day so she wouldn’t go public with a story about having sex with Mr Trump. On Sunday , near the end of his six-day break between trial dates, the former president once again lashed out at the judge and the chief prosecutor leading the case against him. Lawyers for the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office won’t be presenting new evidence when they wrap up their case on Tuesday, but it’s their one last shot to drive home their narrative and remind jurors what the case is all about. In his opening statement last month, assistant district attorney Matthew Colangelo argued that Mr Trump “orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election” and then “covered up that criminal conspiracy by lying in his business records, over and over and over again.” Mr Trump is accused of falsifying business records by labeling a series of payments in 2017 to his then-attorney Michael Cohen as a “retainer” and “legal expense”. But prosecutors argue that Mr Trump – who was the president at the time – was actually reimbursing his “fixer” for a hush money payment to Ms Daniels. Prosecutors must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr Trump not only falsified business records, but did so with the intent to commit or cover up another crime. Prosecutors will likely walk jurors through that scheme one last time, and explain how that central fraud violated state and federal campaign finance law, tax law, and a state law against conspiracy to corrupt an election by “unlawful means.” Defense attorneys do not have to prove anything or convince jurors of Mr Trump’s innocence, but they will need to convince at least one juror that prosecutors have not proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Mr Trump’s lawyers have argued that Cohen was merely paid for his work as the former president’s then-personal attorney, and that the hush money scheme – which itself was not illegal – was only to prevent embarrassing news of his affairs from getting to Mr Trump’s family, not in an attempt to hide them from voters. Before jurors are sent out of the courtroom to deliberate, Justice Juan Merchan will give them instructions – a framework for understanding the law surrounding the charges and what they can and cannot take into account as they determine his guilt or innocence. Prosecutors and defense attorneys debated the contours of those instructions and proposed their own during a two-hour hearing last week. Judge Merchan is expected to deliver those instructions on Wednesday morning before sending jurors off to deliberate in an undisclosed room in the courthouse. Jurors will be able to pass notes to the judge for things like clarifying legal language or reviewing testimony. But how long they will take to deliberate is anyone’s guess. The 12 jurors must unanimously agree on a guilty or not guilty verdict. If they can’t reach a consensus after several days of deliberations, the judge will likely ask them to keep trying. If they’re still deadlocked, he could declare a mistrial.",

Tina Knowles sat down for a conversation with Vogue and, she shares memories about her three girls -- Bey, Solange and Kelly Rowland -- growing up ... including the heartbreaking bullying her elder daughter experienced. Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media. Listen to Mama Knowles tell it ... despite her onstage persona know, Tina insists Beyoncé was quite shy back in the day -- and, unfortunately, the timidness led to some run-ins with bullies. TK says her daughter handled business when it came time to do so though ... saying Beyoncé stood up to bullies when they went after one of her friends -- and, they didn't bother her again after that. As for Solange and Kelly ... Tina remembers them as an activist and peacemaker respectively -- and, the wistful smile on her face makes it clear she's got fond memories of those early days. Beyoncé's opened up about the bullying years ago, during a 2003 interview with Oprah where she says other kids laughed at how big her ears were ... she's cracking up during the clip though, so seems clear she'd come to terms with it. Despite coming out two months ago, Bey's \"Cowboy Carter\" is still top 10 on the Billboard 200 charts -- and, it broke records on Spotify after its release. And, her \"Renaissance\" tour last year literally boosted the American economy ... so, petty grudges aren't really on her radar these days. But, those bullies better hope their names don't come out ... 'cause the Beyhive's a lot less forgiving than their queen. 👀",

        "content": "DALLAS — The Timberwolves’ biggest flaw heading into the postseason was quite obvious to anyone who paid attention throughout the course of the regular season: They couldn’t close games. The Wolves were quite literally one of the NBA’s worst teams in clutch-time situations over the back half of the season. Clutch time is defined as the time in the final five minutes of a game in which the margin is within five points. In those situations post-Christmas, the Wolves were outscored by 26.5 points per 100 possessions. Their defense was bad in clutch time, and their offense was worse. Ball holding, indecision and a lack of player movement left the team’s late-game offense often stuck in the muck. Missed shots and turnovers prevented Minnesota from getting back and setting its defense up to its optimal setup, which makes getting stops a chore. ADVERTISEMENT That figured to bite the Timberwolves in the playoffs. But it didn’t through the first two rounds, anyway. Anthony Edwards obliterated Phoenix down the stretch of Game 4 to close out the Wolves’ first-round series sweep in the only competitive game between the two teams. Against Denver, Game 1 and Game 7 were both in doubt in the closing minutes, only to have Minnesota’s offense prove largely unstoppable to secure the first and last victories of the series. The problems appeared to be solved. Until they weren’t. ADVERTISEMENT The late-game issues have reared their ugly heads in the Western Conference Finals. The Wolves led the bulk of the first two games of the series, only to squander advantages late. They rallied in the second half of Game 3 on Sunday and held a two-point lead with five minutes to play after Kyle Anderson’s toss at the hoop dropped to beat the shot clock with 5 minutes, 5 seconds to play. That was the last bucket of consequence the Wolves would score. Minnesota tallied just one point between Anderson’s miraculous shot and Anthony Edwards’ irrelevant layup with 15 seconds to play — a Naz Reid free throw. In between those buckets were seven missed shots and a turnover. Edwards said the ball was sticking too much in the Wolves’ hands, particularly his. “I thought it was our offense that broke down, more than anything. You’ve got to try to score alongside of them,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We just didn’t execute very well, didn’t find the open guy very well down the stretch. And when we had open looks, they were nowhere near going in.” ADVERTISEMENT It is tough to win that way. As it is when you commit two turnovers in the final minute of regulation, like Minnesota did in Game 2 en route to blowing a five-point advantage in the final 90 seconds. Then there’s Game 1, which the Wolves led by four points with 3 minutes, 37 seconds to play, only to then go scoreless until Reid’s basket with 10 seconds to play. That fatal scoring drought featured four missed shots and three turnovers. And Dallas is doing the complete opposite on the other end of the floor. The Mavericks — who sported the NBA’s fourth-best clutch-time net rating post Christmas, outscoring opponents by 23.8 points per 100 possessions — are routinely carving the Wolves’ top-ranked defense up with the game on the line. ADVERTISEMENT Oftentimes it’s via Luka Doncic sizing up an opponent 1 on 1 before either getting to the mid range to knock down a jumper, or hitting a stepback three-pointer. At other points, he’s catching the Wolves napping, like he did late Sunday, when he saw Edwards’ back turned to the play and made a quick pass that led to a hockey assist on a P.J. Washington triple to put Dallas up 107-104. Minnesota never recovered. “It starts with kind of a mental breakdown on a left-corner 3 from Washington when the game is tied,” Finch said, “and that gives them just enough breathing room.” The Mavericks are outscoring the Wolves by 39.2 points per 100 possessions in the clutch in this series. It’s the difference between the Mavericks being up 3-0 — the current state of the situation — and Minnesota potentially even leading the series. “The whole series, we’ve struggled to close games. These three-minute games that we’re playing, we’re losing,” Finch said. “That’s been the story of the series.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s easy to look at that and think how easily things could be flipped. But the reality is the playoffs reveal who you are — both your strengths and weaknesses. And this has been a major wart for Minnesota all season that was left unresolved, and now has the Wolves on the brink of elimination. “If we were winning these games, you would feel confident when you look up and see four minutes left and you’re winning the game, you’re going to think positive thoughts,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said. “I can’t speak for every person, but I’m sure we’re looking up and saying, ‘How are we going to win this one? How are we going to figure it out?’ “That’s a moment of the game where we have to be tight, together and figure it out. Obviously, (the struggles are) on our minds. For the majority of the series, we were giving ourselves a chance, giving ourselves leads, giving ourselves opportunity. We know what part of the game we need to be better at. The part that’s gonna win us the game is that fourth quarter.” Many basketball games are won in the final five minutes. Or, in the Wolves’ case, lost in the final five minutes.

Missed shots and turnovers prevented Minnesota from getting back and setting its defense up to its optimal setup, which makes getting stops a chore. ADVERTISEMENT That figured to bite the Timberwolves in the playoffs. But it didn’t through the first two rounds, anyway. Anthony Edwards obliterated Phoenix down the stretch of Game 4 to close out the Wolves’ first-round series sweep in the only competitive game between the two teams. Against Denver, Game 1 and Game 7 were both in doubt in the closing minutes, only to have Minnesota’s offense prove largely unstoppable to secure the first and last victories of the series. The problems appeared to be solved. Until they weren’t. ADVERTISEMENT The late-game issues have reared their ugly heads in the Western Conference Finals. The Wolves led the bulk of the first two games of the series, only to squander advantages late. They rallied in the second half of Game 3 on Sunday and held a two-point lead with five minutes to play after Kyle Anderson’s toss at the hoop dropped to beat the shot clock with 5 minutes, 5 seconds to play. That was the last bucket of consequence the Wolves would score. Minnesota tallied just one point between Anderson’s miraculous shot and Anthony Edwards’ irrelevant layup with 15 seconds to play — a Naz Reid free throw. In between those buckets were seven missed shots and a turnover. Edwards said the ball was sticking too much in the Wolves’ hands, particularly his. “I thought it was our offense that broke down, more than anything. You’ve got to try to score alongside of them,” Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. “We just didn’t execute very well, didn’t find the open guy very well down the stretch. And when we had open looks, they were nowhere near going in.” ADVERTISEMENT It is tough to win that way. As it is when you commit two turnovers in the final minute of regulation, like Minnesota did in Game 2 en route to blowing a five-point advantage in the final 90 seconds. Then there’s Game 1, which the Wolves led by four points with 3 minutes, 37 seconds to play, only to then go scoreless until Reid’s basket with 10 seconds to play. That fatal scoring drought featured four missed shots and three turnovers. And Dallas is doing the complete opposite on the other end of the floor. The Mavericks — who sported the NBA’s fourth-best clutch-time net rating post Christmas, outscoring opponents by 23.8 points per 100 possessions — are routinely carving the Wolves’ top-ranked defense up with the game on the line. ADVERTISEMENT Oftentimes it’s via Luka Doncic sizing up an opponent 1 on 1 before either getting to the mid range to knock down a jumper, or hitting a stepback three-pointer. At other points, he’s catching the Wolves napping, like he did late Sunday, when he saw Edwards’ back turned to the play and made a quick pass that led to a hockey assist on a P.J. Washington triple to put Dallas up 107-104. Minnesota never recovered. “It starts with kind of a mental breakdown on a left-corner 3 from Washington when the game is tied,” Finch said, “and that gives them just enough breathing room.” The Mavericks are outscoring the Wolves by 39.2 points per 100 possessions in the clutch in this series. It’s the difference between the Mavericks being up 3-0 — the current state of the situation — and Minnesota potentially even leading the series. “The whole series, we’ve struggled to close games. These three-minute games that we’re playing, we’re losing,” Finch said. “That’s been the story of the series.” ADVERTISEMENT It’s easy to look at that and think how easily things could be flipped. But the reality is the playoffs reveal who you are — both your strengths and weaknesses. And this has been a major wart for Minnesota all season that was left unresolved, and now has the Wolves on the brink of elimination. “If we were winning these games, you would feel confident when you look up and see four minutes left and you’re winning the game, you’re going to think positive thoughts,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said. “I can’t speak for every person, but I’m sure we’re looking up and saying, ‘How are we going to win this one? How are we going to figure it out?’ “That’s a moment of the game where we have to be tight, together and figure it out. Obviously, (the struggles are) on our minds. For the majority of the series, we were giving ourselves a chance, giving ourselves leads, giving ourselves opportunity. We know what part of the game we need to be better at. The part that’s gonna win us the game is that fourth quarter.” Many basketball games are won in the final five minutes. Or, in the Wolves’ case, lost in the final five minutes.

        "description": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 142 measles cases have been reported by 21 U.S. states so far this year.",
        "content": "A passenger had a confirmed case of measles on a connecting flight into Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) earlier this month, according to public health officials. According to a press release from the Los Angeles Department of Public Health, the passenger arrived at Gate 156 at the Tom Bradley International Terminal on May 19 around 3 p.m. PST aboard a Lufthansa flight. , an online flight tracking service, the flight was on the airline's Munich to Los Angeles route. Five hours later, the passenger , at Terminal 7, Gate 82. Individuals who were at the above LAX terminals from approximately 3:04 p.m. to 9 p.m. PST may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this traveler, according to the press release. Exposed individuals should confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles, or if they have had measles in the past. There are no additional locations where possible exposures to this traveler may have occurred, according to reports. In collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ), passengers assigned to specific seats that may been exposed on the Lufthansa flights on May 18-19 will be notified of exposure by local health officials. \"Measles is spread by air and by direct contact even before you know you have it and can lead to severe disease,\" Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County health officer, said in the press release. \"Measles is highly contagious for those who are not immune to it. Initially causing fever, cough, red, watery eyes, and followed by a rash, it can result in serious complications for young children and vulnerable adults.\" emailed the CDC and the L.A. Department of Public Health on Monday afternoon for additional comments. This article will be updated with any provided comments. Measles is a contagious respiratory infection that causes a rash and fever, and can lead to pneumonia and other complications. Symptoms include high fever, rash, cough, runny nose and red eyes. It spreads through the air via coughs or sneezes. can contract the infection up to two hours after an infected person was in the same room. Infected individuals can also spread measles four days before a rash ever appears, and four days after it does appear. According to the CDC, as of May 23, a total of 142 measles cases were reported by 21 states so far this year. There have been 10 outbreaks (defined as three or more related cases) , and 68 percent of cases (97 of 142) are outbreak-associated. For comparison, four outbreaks were reported during 2023 and 48 percent of cases (28 of 58) were outbreak-associated. The worst-affected age group is those aged under 5 years old, representing 47 percent of cases. In comparison, the 5-19 years age group represents 22 percent of cases and the 20 years-plus age group represents 31 percent of cases. The CDC also noted that 82 percent of cases have been detected in the unvaccinated or those whose vaccination status was unknown. It also warned that the vaccination coverage among U.S. children in kindergarten has decreased from 95.2 percent during the 2019-2020 school year to 93.1 percent in 2022-2023, leaving around 250,000 children at risk. The disease was officially eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, meaning that it is no longer constantly present and only appears when someone contracts the disease abroad and returns to the country. that while importations of measles cases into the U.S. are expected to continue, the risk from measles \"for the majority of the population would still remain low... because most people in the U.S. are vaccinated.\" It added: \"If measles re-establishes itself by having ongoing circulation, the U.S. will lose its elimination status. CDC defines measles elimination as the absence of continuous disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area. \"Even though we still have measles cases in the U.S., the majority of cases can be linked back to travelers who become infected with measles in other countries.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

TORONTO, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \"Today, the Government of Ontario announced the Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 , which includes banning registrations for Notices of Security Interest (NOSIs), implementing a 10-day cooling-off period for purchases of newly built freehold homes, consulting on illegal building and selling, and building more housing near transit. OREA commends Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery, Todd McCarthy, and the Ford Government for this legislation and their efforts to protect vulnerable homeowners from bad actors who unfairly exploit the use of NOSIs. Too many Ontarians, when selling their home, have been surprised by one or more NOSIs – fine print in contracts for water coolers, furnaces, or security systems that include exorbitant buyout charges to be paid before the home can be sold. Banning NOSI registrations will help reduce additional and unnecessary fees being tacked onto the price tag of a home. OREA is also pleased to see that the Ministry will implement a 10-day cooling-off period for purchasers of newly built freehold homes, a protection that is already in place for pre-construction condo sales in Ontario. Extending this protection to newly constructed homes will enhance consumer protection by allowing buyers a 10-day period to review and cancel an agreement without penalty, leveling the playing field between Ontario's hardworking families and well-resourced corporate developers with a team of lawyers. Ontario's REALTORS® commend the province for not extending this policy to resale homes – which OREA has long emphasized would negatively impact both buyers and sellers – as it would undermine certainty in resale transactions, which are typically between private citizens and do not involve corporate developers, and could lead to speculation. In addition, mandating public disclosure of a builder's history of canceled purchase agreements for newly built freehold homes is a welcome policy that will provide consumers with transparency and peace of mind. Together, these improvements will establish a higher standard for honesty, integrity, and professionalism in the homebuilding and buying process. Finally, OREA would like to commend the Ministry for acting on one of our key recommendations outlined in our most recent policy report, Analysis of Ontario's Efforts to Boost Housing Supply – modernizing zoning to support greater density along transit corridors. By exempting specific transit-oriented community lands from immunity provisions in the Planning Act, it will be easier and faster for the province to add ‘missing-middle' homes to Ontario's housing stock and increase overall density in areas that can best support high population levels. The Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 is a significant step towards protecting homeowners from bad actors during the largest financial transaction most Ontarians will make in their lives, and towards building much-needed housing supply across the Province.\" – Tim Hudak, CEO of the Ontario Real Estate Association For more information, please contact: Jean-Adrien Delicano Manager, Media Relations JeanAdrienD@orea.com 416-459-6059 Loading...

Party president Katie Morello made the announcement Saturday during the party's annual meeting in Cornwall, P.E.I. The party says the decision to wait two years was based on concerns that a leadership convention next year could come at the same time as a federal election, which must be called by October 2025. Former provincial Liberal leader Sharon Cameron resigned in April 2023 after she failed to win her seat in the provincial election earlier that month. Hal Perry, the Liberal member for Tignish-Palmer Road, was appointed interim leader at the time, which means the party will have had an interim leader for three years by the time a new leader is chosen. Morello says her party realizes the Green Party is also planning to choose a new leader in May 2026, but she says the two parties will make sure the events are held on different weekends.

        "content": "Vice President Kashim Shettima on Monday unveiled the State Action Plans on Durable Solution to Internal Displacement in the country. While unveiling the plan at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, Mr Shettima called for a global partnership to address the problem of internal displacement in Nigeria. The action plan is a United Nations Secretary General’s Solution Agenda on Internal Displacement. It aims to help internally displaced persons find a durable solution to their displacement, prevent new displacement crises from emerging and ensure those facing displacement receive effective protection and assistance. The programme is being implemented in four northern states of Adamawa, Benue, Borno and Yobe. The Vice-President pledged the Federal Government’s unwavering commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of displaced citizens. He outlined the strategy adopted by the President Bola Tinubu’s administration in tackling the country’s internal displacement challenge. “For a country that has endured the devastations of economic disadvantages across generations, we cannot afford further expansion in the displacement of our people. ” So, we remain committed to ensuring that each displaced individual returns to a safer environment and is given a lifeline to start afresh. “Let us harness the strength of our partnerships, both local and international, to bring about lasting change.” He welcomed the support of the United States and other global partners, stressing that the task ahead demands a united front that transcends political divides. ” We are here to craft solutions that will outlive us, that will offer future generations a place of hope, a home for all, and a land of opportunity where dreams can be pursued without worry. “The journey is not merely about addressing the symptoms of displacement but also about tackling the root causes,” he stated. Outlining the strategy of the Tinubu administration, Mr Shettima pledged investment in sustainable development, education, and economic opportunities as critical components of a comprehensive solution. “By doing so, we not only address the immediate needs of the displaced but also create a foundation for a more stable and prosperous future.” He called for collaborative efforts transcending borders to bring about lasting change, stating that “the task ahead is immense, but with determination, unity, and a clear vision, we can make a profound difference”. On her part, the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Ms Amina Mohammed, commended the efforts of the state governments in drafting action plans for durable solutions to internal displacement. Speaking virtually through an online conferencing platform, Ms Mohammed, said attaining such solutions “is a priority for Nigeria and for the UN. She noted the global number of internally displaced persons has doubled in 10 years to nearly 76 million globally. “Over four million Nigerians remain in search of solutions to their forced displacement. The state action plans capture the first essential steps towards solutions.” Earlier, the UN Assistant Secretary-General and Special Advisor on Durable Solutions, Robert Piper, commended Nigeria’s commitment to the programme. “Today, despite the warnings and the real challenges, I have the honour to say, on behalf of the Secretary-General, that Nigeria is the first of all our 15 pilot countries to formally launch government plans placing over four million IDPs and Returnees on pathways to solutions.” Piper said the launch of the programme was evidence of the political commitment to addressing the plight of IDPs in the country. ” In many ways, the plans you launch today provide a model of how governments can take responsibility for ending displacement. ” Let me reiterate our commitment on behalf of the United Nations: We will keep supporting on the ground; we will help rally donors and we will chase missing partners. ” We will bring lessons from elsewhere; we will celebrate your successes; we may occasionally bring you unwelcome news sometimes, as friends must; but we will stand behind you. We fail or succeed together.” Also, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno, said the state government was fully committed to the implementation of the Action Plans on Durable Solutions. He noted that 15 per cent of the state’s annual budget would be dedicated to projects undertaken under the initiative. Mr Zulum recalled the efforts of the state government in the past few years in returning displaced persons to their communities. He assured stakeholders at the meeting that the government’s commitment to the cause of displaced persons remain unwavering. On his part, Governor Hyacinth Alia of Benue State, said the launch of the plans was a beacon of hope and catalyst for the transformation of lives and livelihoods in communities affected by conflict. He commended Vice-President Shettima’s inspirational leadership as well as the commitment of all the development partners involved in the project. He noted that the commitment of Shettima aligns with the vision of the State government to build a society where all residents can live in peace and harmony. In the same vein, Governor Mai Mala Bunu of Yobe, said the state government has executed projects across health, education, social welfare and security. Mr Bunu said that this was towards the bid to ensure that displaced persons in the state return to their communities safely. He reaffirmed the commitment of the state government in the operationalisation of the action plan by allocating five per cent of the state’s annual budget over the next three years. Mr Buni called on development partners involved in the programme not to relent in their efforts toward the success of the initiative. The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Richard Montgomery, commended the progress witnessed during his recent visit to the North-East and the government’s approach to encouraging more investments. “The progress I witnessed during my visit to the North-East recently deserves commendation. ” Nigeria is the first to prove that government-led intervention is possible. We are proud to be part of the process,” he stated. He also called for the mobilisation of new financing, saying “we need to mobilise additional bilateral and multilateral financing to support these plans. “We should also think carefully about how to mobilize Nigeria’s vibrant private sector, not necessarily as a donor but as the engine for economic growth and job creation.

        "content": "On the May 10, 2017 edition of WWE NXT, Cezar Bononi wrestled Aleister Black, now known as Malakai Black in AEW, with Black going over. After initial hype as the next big NXT star, he was let go in 2020. While speaking on an episode of the Developmentally Speaking podcast, the match saved his career. Here are the highlights (per Fightful) : On the bout: “Yeah, the first match that I had on TV, for sure, with Aleister Black, Malakai. There were so many people saying to me that was not going to make it to TV ever then I had that opportunity. It was a really good opportunity. To be honest, I was going to be fired the next day but I did such a good job in that match that saved my my job.” On whether he knew he would get fired: “Cuts. Just cuts. They had to cut and I understand the business, it’s all good. They just had to cut to get new people and whoever is not getting good results, they cut. That’s how business works. I never thought there was something personal or whatever. Actually, I was not delivering whatever was necessary as well. I totally understand on the business side of that. The good thing is that I got at least one chance to do something, and I did it good.”",

        "content": "The City of Lorain’s annual Memorial Day Parade brought hundreds of people to the downtown district despite windy weather topped with cloudy skies. The parade kicked off at 11 a.m. sharp on Eighth Street and proceeded down Broadway Avenue until reaching Black River Landing, according to Lorain Mayor Jack Bradley. Bradley, who had a number of vehicles decorated with his name, walked in the parade alongside Safety Service Director Rey Carrion and others. Lorain Police cruisers led the parade under the blue and white Broadway sign with a number of its vehicles such as “The Beast,” its SWAT vehicle, and others. Multiple youth of the Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps followed the leading police cruisers in their uniforms. Amy Pruitt, a mother of four Lorain High School students, grabbed a spot on the side of Broadway Avenue at 9:30 a.m. eagerly awaiting the parade. “This is one of the first events that all four of my kids are in,” Pruitt said. “I’m proud, excited and intrigued spotting them in the crowd. I’m going to root for them when I see them.” While Pruitt was excited, it was also a bittersweet day for her as the parade was also the last time her four children would be in the parade as they will be graduating. Three of Pruitt’s children were marching with the Lorain High School band while the fourth participated as part of his duties of the Junior ROTC, she said. Shannon Argenti, also of Lorain, was sitting along Broadway Avenue with her 5-year-old stepson Hunter Argenti, who was looking forward to catching and gathering the candy which was thrown out to the crowd by several people, including the Lorain Fire Department. The Argentis were in attendance to watch 15-year-old Malicai Argenti, a member of the Junior ROTC, who was marching with the group, said Argenti. “I’m looking forward to seeing him in the parade,” she said, adding that she was excited to see the parade and share in the overall experience. Several residents in street vehicles were also a part of the parade in addition to the Lorain High School and Clearview High School bands and cheerleaders. Also represented at the parade were the Veteran’s Administration Medical Transportation and Valor Home.",

        "content": "Louisiana Republican Senator John Kennedy was shocked to discover that newspaper chain/media company USA Today quietly eliminated his op-ed in which he criticized transgender athletes. Not only did the Gannett-owned paper chain delete op-ed, they didn’t even tell him they were deleting the article that had already been published by several of the chain’s participating papers days before. The article, published in eight of the Gannett papers, was entitled, “Is transgender inclusion more important than women’s sports?” and excerpts of his piece are still on the Louisianan’s senate website. But while the article is still featured on his senate website, the full article was removed from all the papers. Now, when you click to the link where the article used to appear, readers see a that reads, “Content removed: did not meet editorial standards,” and continues saying, “This content has been removed because it did not meet our editorial standards.” The senator has since told that his article was removed because he didn’t bend his knee to the woke terminology that the paper wanted him to use when speaking about radical transgenderism. slammed the USA Today, telling Fox News, that the “USA TODAY Network apparently does not like the way I express myself.” “They think they are the speech police. Drunk on certainty and virtue, they think they are our moral teacher. This attitude is why so many Americans have lost confidence in the media. The media is not going to win that trust back until they return to neutrality instead of advocacy,” Kennedy claimed. According to his website, he made a series of claims in his article denouncing , each backed up with a link to the source he used to reach his conclusions. “Some activists claim that transgender athletes are different from typical men because they take cross-sex hormones. After two years of cross-sex hormone treatments, however, biological male athletes run 12% faster and pound out 10% more push-ups than women,” Kennedy wrote. also said, “Allowing biological boys to compete as girls will harm women’s sports. Still, many activists believe their feelings and the feelings of transgender athletes are more important.” “Men and women don’t compete for the same reasons. Yet transgender activists want athletic institutions to ignore these obvious physical differences so transgender athletes can feel included, even if it hurts biological girls in the process,” the sen. also said. After the paper published the op-ed early in May, Kennedy said he noticed by May 14 that the links he supplied to the articles on his senate website no longer worked. Kennedy told Fox News that he reached out to one of the affiliated papers that originally published the article and had an email exchange with Misty Castile, the executive editor for the Shreveport Times. At first, Castile claimed that they deleted Kennedy’s article because of a lack of “citations” to support his claims. But in a follow-up email, she backtracked on that claim after Kennedy pointed out that there were half a dozen links to citations to support his claims. In other emails, Castile accused Kennedy of using “loaded language” because he wrote “biological male” and “biological female.” Castile further demanded that he rewrite the article to use the left’s woke terminology and then she would “consider” republishing the article. Kennedy blasted the paper chain, saying, “Most people don’t support allowing biological men to participate in women’s sports because they think that will bastardize sports, skew the results, and hurt women. Other people disagree. Gannett should simply report the two sides and not try to silence the position it disagrees with.” We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

        "content": "The nonprofit Elizabeth River Project, which has worked for 30 years to clean up one of the nation’s most contaminated urban waterways, is set to officially open a global model for urban coastal resilience on June 1. The Ryan Resilience Lab, funded almost entirely through local donations, will demonstrate practical ways the world’s coastal residents and businesses can learn how to protect themselves, and the environment, as sea levels rise. The building is located along Knitting Mill Creek in Norfolk, a city where the tides are rising faster than anywhere on the East Coast. A public grand opening celebration is scheduled for June 1 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 4610 Colley Ave., Norfolk. In conjunction with the grand opening, shops up and down Colley Avenue will join forces with the Elizabeth River Project to launch an “EcoDistrict,” encouraging businesses and residents to adopt eco-friendly practices in solidarity with the new Ryan Resilience Lab in their midst. The Resilience Lab, intentionally constructed inside a flood zone along one of Norfolk’s busiest commercial corridors and flanked by multiple residential neighborhoods, showcases what the future of sustainable coastal living might look like. Inside and out, visitors will find ways to live sustainably and prepare for rising tides, project coordinators said in a news release. Everything from the floating entry pavilion and storage shed to a “living shoreline” instead of a hardened shore, an 80,000-watt solar energy system, 10 gallons of rainwater collected and reused in the toilets and a permeable parking lot to keep polluted runoff from reaching the river.

        "content": "The nonprofit Elizabeth River Project, which has worked for 30 years to clean up one of the nation’s most contaminated urban waterways, is set to officially open a global model for urban coastal resilience on June 1. The Ryan Resilience Lab, funded almost entirely through local donations, will demonstrate practical ways the world’s coastal residents and businesses can learn how to protect themselves, and the environment, as sea levels rise. The building is located along Knitting Mill Creek in Norfolk, a city where the tides are rising faster than anywhere on the East Coast. A public grand opening celebration is scheduled for June 1 from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 4610 Colley Ave., Norfolk. In conjunction with the grand opening, shops up and down Colley Avenue will join forces with the Elizabeth River Project to launch an “EcoDistrict,” encouraging businesses and residents to adopt eco-friendly practices in solidarity with the new Ryan Resilience Lab in their midst. The Resilience Lab, intentionally constructed inside a flood zone along one of Norfolk’s busiest commercial corridors and flanked by multiple residential neighborhoods, showcases what the future of sustainable coastal living might look like. Inside and out, visitors will find ways to live sustainably and prepare for rising tides, project coordinators said in a news release. Everything from the floating entry pavilion and storage shed to a “living shoreline” instead of a hardened shore, an 80,000-watt solar energy system, 10 gallons of rainwater collected and reused in the toilets and a permeable parking lot to keep polluted runoff from reaching the river. Meanwhile, green roofs and walls covered in vegetation reduce runoff and conserve energy in winter and summer. For more information and to register, see elizabethriver.org .

Amenities including an in-car refrigerator, a retractable large entertainment screen, and retractable speakers will be present.

        "content": "National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir announced on Monday that he will recommend the termination of Israel Police Commissioner Kobi Shabtai, months after extending the police chief’s tenure, during a political dispute. In a statement, Ben Gvir said the recommendation came in light of the commissioner’s performance during Hamas’s October 7 massacre in southern Israel. A letter to Shabtai quoted in the statement pointed to “mounting allegations” of general disfunction that “have a negative impact on the Israel Police in general, and in this wartime period in particular.” Examples of Ben Gvir’s complaints against the police commissioner included failure to attend an assessment on plans to close the tomb of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai on Mount Meron for Lag B’Omer this week, given concerns of a rocket attack by Hezbollah. Clashes broke out over the weekend between police and ultra-Orthodox pilgrims to Meron, when hundreds arrived at the tomb in violation of orders that deemed the site off-limits. “According to senior police officers, you were completely ‘out of touch,'” Ben Gvir charged in the letter, while adding an accusation that Shabtai only promotes officers close to him. He also wrote that Shabtai has failed to hold “in-depth meetings and status updates” on crime in the Arab community, despite being instructed to do so and raised complaints about failure to implement orders “regarding vehicle thefts, traffic accidents, recruitment, implementation of budgets, procurement and general management of the police.” Ben Gvir noted that a state commission of inquiry in March had named Shabtai as one of a number of officials personally responsible for the 2021 Meron disaster and said that were it not for the ongoing war in Gaza it would have recommended his termination. The statement recalled that the commission had instead recommended that the government determine the appropriate date for his term to end. The national security minister has already selected Deputy Commissioner Avshalom Peled as the next police commissioner, as Shabtai’s tenure was already due to end on July 17. Responding to Ben Gvir’s announcement, sources close to the police commissioner were quoted by Hebrew media as saying that the letter was delivered in an unorthodox manner, which they said was “a resounding testimony to the indecorous and thuggish behavior of a minister who does not accept the law.” The sources charged that Ben Gvir has been “violently trying to take over the police and turn it into a private militia,” according to the Ynet news site and the Israel Hayom newspaper. Ben Gvir and Shabtai have had an up-and-down relationship. The minister threatened last year not to extend the police commissioner’s term by the customary year, triggering a spat with National Unity chair Benny Gantz that was ultimately negotiated by the Likud party. Shabtai had been due to end his tenure in January, and had previously said he would not seek an extension, but changed his decision after Hamas’s October 7 onslaught and the subsequent war in Gaza. Ben Gvir’s Monday statement said that Shabtai had been summoned to a hearing on the matter next Wednesday, after which he will make his recommendation to the government.",

        "content": "Two women accused Washington Commanders kicker Brandon McManus of sexually assaulting them on a Jacksonville Jaguars team flight to London last year. According to ESPN's Michael DiRocco , the two flight attendants filed a lawsuit Friday seeking over $1 million in damages. They claimed McManus grinded up against them and tried to kiss one of them. McManus, who was playing for Jacksonville at the time, signed with Washington this offseason. Per The Washington Post's Nicki Jhabvala , the Commanders released a statement regarding the accusations against their new kicker. \"Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter,\" a Commanders spokesperson said. \"We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon's representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.\" The Jaguars declined to comment to DiRocco and have not addressed the allegations. The alleged victims named them in the lawsuit for failing to create a safe working environment for the flight crew. DiRocco wrote that McManus or his attorney will likely release a statement later on Monday. The lawsuit claimed that the Oct. 8 flight to London \"quickly turned into a party,\" with McManus and other players disregarding air travel safety and the flight staff's personal space. McManus allegedly offered $100 bills to flight attendants to persuade them to drink with and dance inappropriately for him. One of the women who filed the lawsuit claimed McManus \"smirked and walked away\" after she confronted him. The complaint said the two women were removed from Jaguars flights and \"experienced severe mental anguish, anxiety, psychological and emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation.\"",

        "content": "CHARLOTTETOWN - The Liberal Party of Prince Edward Island has decided to wait until May 2026 to select a new leader. Party president Katie Morello made the announcement Saturday during the party’s annual meeting in Cornwall, P.E.I. The party says the decision to wait two years was based on concerns that a leadership convention next year could come at the same time as a federal election, which must be called by October 2025. Former provincial Liberal leader Sharon Cameron resigned in April 2023 after she failed to win her seat in the provincial election earlier that month. Hal Perry, the Liberal member for Tignish-Palmer Road, was appointed interim leader at the time, which means the party will have had an interim leader for three years by the time a new leader is chosen. Morello says her party realizes the Green Party is also planning to choose a new leader in May 2026, but she says the two parties will make sure the events are held on different weekends. The governing Progressive Conservatives are not required to call a provincial election until October 2027. The Tories hold 21 of the legislature’s 27 seats, while the Liberals and Greens have three each. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "content": "TORONTO, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- “Today, the Government of Ontario announced the Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 , which includes banning registrations for Notices of Security Interest (NOSIs), implementing a 10-day cooling-off period for purchases of newly built freehold homes, consulting on illegal building and selling, and building more housing near transit. OREA commends Minister of Public and Business Service Delivery, Todd McCarthy, and the Ford Government for this legislation and their efforts to protect vulnerable homeowners from bad actors who unfairly exploit the use of NOSIs. Too many Ontarians, when selling their home, have been surprised by one or more NOSIs – fine print in contracts for water coolers, furnaces, or security systems that include exorbitant buyout charges to be paid before the home can be sold. Banning NOSI registrations will help reduce additional and unnecessary fees being tacked onto the price tag of a home. OREA is also pleased to see that the Ministry will implement a 10-day cooling-off period for purchasers of newly built freehold homes, a protection that is already in place for pre-construction condo sales in Ontario. Extending this protection to newly constructed homes will enhance consumer protection by allowing buyers a 10-day period to review and cancel an agreement without penalty, leveling the playing field between Ontario’s hardworking families and well-resourced corporate developers with a team of lawyers. Ontario’s REALTORS® commend the province for not extending this policy to resale homes – which OREA has long emphasized would negatively impact both buyers and sellers – as it would undermine certainty in resale transactions, which are typically between private citizens and do not involve corporate developers, and could lead to speculation. In addition, mandating public disclosure of a builder’s history of canceled purchase agreements for newly built freehold homes is a welcome policy that will provide consumers with transparency and peace of mind. Together, these improvements will establish a higher standard for honesty, integrity, and professionalism in the homebuilding and buying process. Finally, OREA would like to commend the Ministry for acting on one of our key recommendations outlined in our most recent policy report, Analysis of Ontario’s Efforts to Boost Housing Supply – modernizing zoning to support greater density along transit corridors. By exempting specific transit-oriented community lands from immunity provisions in the Planning Act, it will be easier and faster for the province to add ‘missing-middle’ homes to Ontario’s housing stock and increase overall density in areas that can best support high population levels. The Homeowner Protection Act, 2024 is a significant step towards protecting homeowners from bad actors during the largest financial transaction most Ontarians will make in their lives, and towards building much-needed housing supply across the Province.” – Tim Hudak, CEO of the Ontario Real Estate Association For more information, please contact: Jean-Adrien Delicano Manager, Media Relations JeanAdrienD@orea.com 416-459-6059",

        "description": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people.The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah.Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians.Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally.Sonoma Co. motorist arrested for alleged reckless driving after chase, crash“Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.”Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.”“We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said.At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition.In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating.An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty.Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city.Elsewhere in Rafah, the director of the Kuwait Hospital, one of the city’s last functioning medical centers, said it was shutting down and that staff members were relocating to a field hospital. Dr. Suhaib al-Hamas said the decision was made after a strike killed two health workers Monday at the entrance to the hospital.Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he says are Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries.The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters.The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah \"are heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened.French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Elsewhere in Rafah, the director of the Kuwait Hospital, one of the city’s last functioning medical centers, said it was shutting down and that staff members were relocating to a field hospital. Dr. Suhaib al-Hamas said the decision was made after a strike killed two health workers Monday at the entrance to the hospital. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he says are Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel’s strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images” from the strike on Rafah “are heartbreaking.” It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. “There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,′ the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected.

        "description": "Exclusive: Politicians and campaigners warn trust in Britain’s largest police force has ‘never been lower’",
        "content": "Dozens of Metropolitan Police officers remain in the force after having their vetting withdrawn, The Independent can reveal. The convictions of serial rapist David Carrick and rapist and murderer Wayne Couzens, both serving officers when they committed their crimes, exposed deficiencies in the recruitment processes of Britain's largest police force. Last March, the Met launched Operation Assure, which assesses the vetting of serving officers and staff when concerns have been pinpointed about their conduct. Information obtained under freedom of information laws shows that, in the last five years, 53 police officers had their vetting withdrawn while serving in the Met. Of those, 30 are undergoing appeals, 12 had their appeals dismissed and are awaiting performance hearings, and 11 have left the force due to resigning, retiring or being dismissed. The Met stopped short of confirming whether the officers still in the force are suspended but a spokesperson said: “If we have information that an officer is involved in corrupt or abusive behaviour, we review their vetting and remove it if justified. “After removal of vetting, officers can no longer perform their role or access any police systems, and face gross incompetence proceedings.” Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, who chairs parliament’s women and equalities committee, said: “It’s crucially important that the Met Police restores the confidence of women and girls across the capital and it needs to do so with utmost transparency. Following high-profile criminal cases against serving Met officers, trust in the Met has never been lower.” The Metropolitan Police was placed in special measures even before a review by Baroness Casey, in the wake of the killing of Sarah Everard by Couzens, which found it to be institutionally misogynistic, racist and homophobic. The force has faced fierce criticism over the case of Carrick who served as an officer for over two decades before being exposed as one of the country’s worst sex offenders. The serial rapist faced complaints about his behaviour both while serving and before he became an officer, yet no action was taken. Data shows a backlog of 397 misconduct cases in the Met Police yet to be heard, an increase of 42 since October. Some 344 officers remaining in the force are waiting for their cases to begin. Nadia Whittome, Labour MP for Nottingham East, said the public would “rightly expect that any police officer whose vetting had been revoked should, at the very least, be suspended”. She called for the Met Police to “urgently clarify whether or not this is the case” as she warned that “the lack of clarity” will further fuel the public’s mistrust of the force. Habib Kadiri, executive director of police reform charity StopWatch, said: “Police chiefs, as a matter of principle, owe it to the public to be transparent about the decisions they make regarding the conduct of their officers.” Met Police rolled out Operation Assure last April and is currently reviewing the vetting of around 200 officers. Amy Bowdrey of domestic abuse charity Refuge, with which The Independent has partnered, said the Met’s failure to “act proportionately to potential police perpetrators of violence against women and girls puts women’s and girls’ lives at real risk”. She added: “The police urgently need to acknowledge that people seeking to abuse women and girls are likely to be attracted to policing, as it has access to power and equipment that can be used to perpetrate this abuse.” The Independent last year revealed three-quarters of police officers and staff accused of violence against women were not suspended by their force despite the allegations against them. In the Met Police, just 12 per cent of officers and staff were suspended after being accused of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has admitted to inadequate vetting and noted police officers are not regulated by conventional employment law. A damning report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary from 2022 found hundreds, if not thousands, of police officers who should have failed vetting checks may have been in the job in England and Wales. The watchdog discovered many cases where individuals should not have been permitted to become police officers, including some with organised crime connections and predatory sex offenders.",

The midfielder has reached the end of his season-long loan from the Lisbon giants with a Premiership and Scottish Cup winners medal in his pocked - but his deal includes a clause that means a £6million bid would be enough to bring the 22-year-old to Glasgow's east end long-term. However, the Portuguese U21 international appears to have hinted that he will not return to Celtic next season as he sent a message to fans on social media. Taking to his Instagram while sharing snaps of his time at Celtic Park, he wrote: \"Grateful for this season. Thank you very very much for all the support.\" Reports in Portugal suggest that a deal is still being considered by the Hoops. O Jogo claim that the Celtic Park chiefs are \"evaluating\" a permanent move for Bernardo. He has reportedly been told that he is not in the first-team plans for Benfica going into next season.

        "content": "Three southern Albertans will be inducted into the Alberta Business Hall of Fame later this year, including a longtime high-profile oilman, an early adopter of financial technology and a former pro hockey player. The co-founder and CEO of Symend, a Calgary-based tech firm that’s among Canada’s fastest-growing companies, will meanwhile receive the Southern Alberta Young Innovator Award, given each year to a business leader under 40. The annual awards, entering their 20th year running, will be handed out in early November at the Alberta Business Hall of Fame—Southern Alberta Annual Gala Dinner. Susan Anderson, Mike Broadfoot and Brett Wilson are this year’s three inductees. Anderson started her career by co-founding DirectCash Payments Inc., a publicly traded financial services company in 1997 when financial technology — commonly known as fintech — was still a fledgling industry. Over the next two decades it became the second-largest ATM company in the world, grossing more than $400 million in revenue. The company was bought in 2017 by Cardtronics Inc. in a deal valued at about $460 million. Anderson later co-founded Digital Commerce Bank, a private Canadian chartered financial institution, and is currently the company’s board chair. She’s also currently president and CEO of Cannonball Capital Inc., a Calgary-based institutional investor in venture companies, private and public equities and commercial real estate. Anderson also serves on several boards and is on the strategic advisory board of the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Alberta. Her academic career started at the University of Calgary, where she obtained a commerce degree; she later completed her law degree at the University of Alberta. Broadfoot started his career in business after a hockey career that saw him play for the University of Alberta Golden Bears and later professionally in Switzerland, where he played for one year until moving back to Alberta. Settling in Calgary, he spent five years with Gulf and Petro Can in the oil and gas sector. Over the remaining decades, he’s been a founder or early-stage principal investor and director in sectors including energy, B2B software, medical devices, fintech and property development. Broadfoot has been involved in a number of sales, including Morgan Stanley’s 2019 acquisition of Solium Capital. He’s currently involved with JEMM Properties, a developer focused on densifying Calgary’s urban core, and two tech companies in project management software and fintech. Wilson, meanwhile, comes with the highest public profile of the three, having spent three years as a “dragon” on CBC’s Dragons Den. He got his career started in the early 1990s by co-founding FirstEnergy Capital Corp. with current Calgary Flames owner Murray Edwards, Rick Grafton and Jim Davidson. The company has gone on to become Canada’s leading energy investment bank. It was solid in 2016 to Toronto-based GMP Capital Inc. Outside of the private sector, Wilson has raised money for several causes including prostate cancer and has funded research at the Calgary Counselling Centre into studying the issue of domestic abuse. Among his many public engagements, in February Wilson moderated a conversation between conservative media personality Tucker Carlson and well-known Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson. Finally, was announced as this year’s recipient of the Young Innovator Award for southern Alberta. He is the co-founder and CEO of Symend, which has quickly become one of the top telecommunication and financial services companies in the world by providing behaviour science, data science and technology to its clients. Symend was mentioned in Startup Genome’s cleantech rankings which highlighted Calgary as one of the . Symend recently completed a $151-million fundraising round, adding to the case that fintech is becoming one of the city’s sub-sector strengths. Joshaghani is also a member of the Business Council of Alberta, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce’s AI council and sits on the board at the Alberta Children’s Hospital Foundation. X:",

        "description": "It's a constitutional guarantee of MN-S jurisdiction over \"core governance matters\" like education, language and child and family services.\"",
        "content": "Métis Nation—Saskatchewan is negotiating a treaty with the Government of Canada to cement the right to self-governance for Métis people in Saskatchewan. This would be a constitutional guarantee of MN-S’s jurisdiction over “core governance matters” like education, language and child and family services, MN-S President Glen McCallum said on Monday. “This is our moment,” McCallum said. “For many years, we’ve , and especially in the last seven years, we’ve grown very fast in regards to the relationship that we’ve built with the federal government, provincial government, industry and institutions. “(And) when you hit Treaty, it’s all the rights that we’ve always wanted, without having the federal government nickel-dime us, and not being able to have the right capacity to deal with our people.” Over the summer, Métis citizens in the province will have the chance to review the text of this modern treaty — “Kischi mashinahikan ooschi Michif, the Sacred Document from the Michif” — before voting on whether to ratify the document in the fall. If the vote passes, MN-S anticipates the treaty would be implemented in federal legislation in 2025. MN-S Vice-President Michelle LeClair said “ongoing negotiations with Canada over the last five years” and a series of self-government agreements have laid the groundwork for this treaty. The dream of a nation-to-nation agreement between Métis people in Saskatchewan and the federal government is much older than that. “This is ,” LeClair said. “Our communities have fought and died for this very thing that we are doing today.” Elder Norman Fleury said seeing this treaty within reach makes him proud of his Métis heritage, and full of hope for future generations. “Our people have been talking about this since our existence; under Louis Riel and his council, we always talked about this,” said Fleury. “(So) when I see this, the adrenaline flows in my veins — no different than when we talk about Louis Riel.” Most of all, Fleury said, this treaty would mean that he can as citizens of a self-governing Métis nation, knowing that their ancestors and forebears fought hard for their rights and ultimately won. “If I ever passed away today or tomorrow, I’ll be happy to say that Michif culture is well alive, and we got it documented through our documents that we have,” Fleury said. “It’s alive. We’re using it. It’s no longer that wish; the dream is alive and well.” In the months ahead, Fleury said he will also be thinking about his grandparents, born in the 1800s, and how proud they would have been. “They would say, ‘We’ve come a long ways since the time that we had to go through resistances to fight for our rights, to empower ourselves to where we are,’ ” he said. “And I know ... when I go home someday to where they are, we’re going to be having a party. And we’re going to have a ceremony. And they’ll say, ‘You listened really well and left something for your grandchildren, like we did with you.’ ” Over the next few months, MN-S representatives will travel to Métis communities throughout the province, sharing the draft of the self-government agreement and discussing it with citizens. Currently, MN-S has jurisdiction over its citizenship, elections and core governance under a set of agreements with the federal government, but a treaty would enshrine those agreements in perpetuity — no matter what changes in political power may take place — and guarantee stable funding for core areas of jurisdiction. To Fleury, the self-government agreement is much more than words on the page, or even a legal agreement between nations. “This is a nationality,” he said. “It’s a nation. It’s a people, with a language and a culture; with all our flag stories, all our songs, our ceremonies, our legends, our mythology.”",

        "content": "THE summer heat might be something to look forward to, but with the higher temperatures comes some unwanted creepy crawlies sneaking into your home. Spiders can hide in homes and come out during mating season, which is usually from September, but that doesn't mean they're not also around before then. Luckily, one savvy woman has shared a simple trick to get rid of them for good - and you won't have to break the bank of posh traps and gadgets to do it. Anna Louisa took to Instagram to share her top tips, which include mixing together water and 20 drops of peppermint oil . Poured into a spray bottle - you can reuse an old cleaning bottle - the trick will deter spiders from lingering in your home. However, pet owners should note that this method won't be suitable for them, as peppermint oil can be harmful to some animals. Instead, the mum suggested another trick to keep spiders and pther pests at bay. \"Fruit flies dislike the smell of white vinegar so put a small bowl of it near your fruit to keep them away,\" she explained. \"I add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to mask the smell of white vinegar but this isn’t necessary.\" Other cleaning fans loved the idea and couldn't wait to try it out. \"Will be trying these this week. We’ve had them coming in through a gap in the skirting board at the back door and now coming through the front door,\" one commented on the viral clip. A second agreed: \"Yes love this trick, I tried it last year and it worked for me.\" The best part about this trick is if you don't already have vinegar a home, you can pick some up for as little as 35p in shops including Tesco, making the trick a total bargain. And another added: \"Lavender also works with ants too and spiders.\" There's one sure fire way of getting rid of spiders in your home and that is to introduce a pet to your family. In particular cats are the perfect animals to get rid of unwanted spiders, as they chase away unwanted bugs from your home. As well as peppermint, spiders are repelled by the smell of this plant . So you can either grow it as a houseplant, or place some around your bathrooms and wardrobes to help make it a less appealing home for the insects. Plus it make your home smell wonderful, so it’s a win-win. Pest control expert Paul Blackhurst says start with your bins. He told the Express : \"As with most pests, the best way to control spiders is to limit their food source.\" There's a big chance that you will see more spiders situated around the bin in your home. That's because your waste attracts flies - which are food for spiders. To eradicate this issue, one thing that you can do it try moving your bins outside or as far away as possible, while also ensuring that you keep the lids closed whenever you're not using them. Another tip is to keep the bins clear from any doorways and windows that lead into your house. Common pests in the garden don’t need to be a cause for alarm. If you can identify them, you can work on getting rid of them and preventing them from returning. Aphids (Greenfly, Blackfly) Aphids are extremely common and can impact plant growth. They have tiny soft pear-shaped bodies, and are usually green or black. You may spot them clustered on the stem of soft shoots – look under leaves in particular – or may find a sticky substance on your plants that gives away aphids have been there sucking at the sap. Whitefly These small white-winged insects are related to aphids, at just 1 or 2 mm in length, and look very much like white moths as adults. They can be found on the underside of leaves, preferring younger, fresher leaves. They fly in clusters when you disturb them. Their lifecycle is only three weeks long, which means an infestation can occur very rapidly. Slugs An unmissable, squashy-looking body plus small sensory tentacles on its head. Slugs move along on one muscular foot. They range in scale from surprisingly small to terrifyingly large; limax cinereoniger species can grow comfortably beyond 20 cm in length. Cabbage Moth Caterpillar Cabbage moth caterpillars happily make their way into the heart of the vegetables, The caterpillars are distinguished in shades of yellow or browny green with no hair. Mealy Bug Mealybugs are tiny oval-shaped insects that have a white, powdery wax coating. There are several different species, many of which have what looks like legs coming from their sides and back end. In their earliest stage of life, it’s entirely possible to mistake them for fungus and not recognise them as insects at all.",

        "content": "Greta Pilkington is set to become the first New Zealandsailor to compete in the women's single-handed discipline atthe Olympic Games in over a decade, when she lines up inMarseille in early August. The young sailor has todaybeen named to the New Zealand Team and will make her Gamesdebut in the ILCA 6 class, previously known as the LaserRadial. The 21-year-old Aucklander is the 10th memberof the sailing team to be confirmed for the Olympics,joining Tom Saunders (ILCA 7), Jo Aleh and Molly Meech(49erFX), Isaac McHardie and Will McKenzie (49er), MicahWilkinson and Erica Dawson (Nacra 17), Veerle ten Have(women's windfoil) and Josh Armit (men'swindfoil). \"It's a dream come true to be going to theOlympics. One of my most precious memories is having mypicture taken with Molly shortly after she won her silvermedal at the Rio Olympics [with Alex Maloney in 2016]. I wasonly 13 at the time and now going to the Olympics alongsideher and many other sailors I admire is an incrediblefeeling,\" said Pilkington. Speaking at her home club,the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, Pilkington said shewas honoured to represent her country in the ILCA 6 for thefirst time since Sara Winther finished 20th at the 2012London Games. \"The ILCA 6 is such a competitive classand is one of the most physically demanding in sailing. Tobe able to firstly qualify New Zealand and then to beselected is very special and knowing I'll be the first sinceSara makes it even more special.\" Aleh is the onlyother Kiwi to have sailed in the class at the Olympic Games,finishing seventh in Beijing in 2008. Pilkington hasposted a range of impressive results recently, including asixth place finish at Sail Sydney in December - a few weeksafter finishing her three-year Bachelor of Architecturedegree at Auckland University of Technology. \"Idecided some time ago that I wanted to campaign for theOlympics and study full-time at the same pace. Naturally, Ihad to compromise a bit on both sides, but it worked out inthe end!\" She demonstrated her capabilities byqualifying for the gold fleet and eventually finishing 16thin a 70-boat fleet at the French Olympic Week regatta inHyeres in April. \"It's been a long road to get to thispoint, but being able to wear the fern on my chest andrepresent New Zealand on the biggest stage makes it allworthwhile.\" The oldest of four children, Pilkington\"basically grew up on boats\" and had her first sail on thefamily yacht at the age of 6 weeks. \"My parents [Guyand Jane] are both keen sailors and I fell in love with thesport pretty much straight away. My earliest sailing memoryis of racing my cousin in the sailing dinghy my grandadbuilt for my mum when I was about 5 or 6,\" shesays. She has enjoyed an impressive rise in the ILCA 6since first jumping in the boat in 2020 - winning thenational title at the age of 18 in 2022, and OceanbridgeSail Auckland, New Zealand's pre-eminent regatta for Olympicclasses, in 2023 and 2024. Pilkington is most lookingforward to testing herself against the best ILCA 6 sailorsin the world - some almost twice her age. \"I rememberracing against [Dutch triple Olympic medallist and multipleworld champion] Marit Bouwmeester for the first time when Iwas 17,\" she says. \"I wanted to try and win the pinand managed to do it with Marit above me, rounding the topmark in fifth. I had never been more excited, and I rememberthinking it was the coolest thing ever and that I wanted tokeep sailing against her.\" The wealth of knowledge andcoaching expertise available in the class in New Zealand hasbeen a big advantage, Pilkington says. She is coachedby experienced Olympic coach Mark Howard, with tripleOlympian and 2000 gold medallist Jenny Armstrong overseeingYachting New Zealand's ILCA 6 programme. \"There are somany great coaches and other people who have helped me alongthe way, and I hope I can make them, and the rest of thecountry, proud in France.\" NZOC CEO Nicki Nicolextended her congratulations to Pilkington. \"We'rethrilled to have Greta on the New Zealand Team for her firstOlympic Games,\" said Nicol. \"She's shown real driveand determination to make it to this point, and we wish herall the best as she puts the final touches on hercampaign.\" New Zealand has a proud Olympic sailinglegacy, having collected 23 medals since the first won byPeter Mander and Jack Cropp at Melbourne in1956. Sailing at Paris 2024 is due to get underway inMarseille on July 28th and conclude on August8th. GretaPilkington is one of the rising stars of New Zealand sailingand will represent the country in the ILCA 6 (formerly LaserRadial) at the Games. A talented youth sailor,Pilkington won two Optimist national titles and sailed arange of different boats - including the P-Class, Starling,29er and 49erFX - before settling on the ILCA 6. Shequalified for the youth world championships in 2020 and2021, with both events scuppered by Covid-19, before winningthe women's open title at the ILCA 6 national championshipsin 2022 (at the age of only 18). She also claimedback-to-back Oceanbridge Sail Auckland titles in 2023 and2024. Pilkington secured two top-10 results (at SailMelbourne and Sail Sydney) in her first full season ofinternational competition and qualified for the gold fleetat the French Olympic Week regatta in Hyeres,France.",

        "description": "No aspiring molcajete owner should be without our guide to preparing, cooking with and caring for their traditional pestle and mortar.The post Learn how to ‘molcajetear’ like a Mexican appeared first on Mexico News Daily",
        "content": "Molcajetes have been used across Mesoamerica for centuries and are cherished as one of Mexico’s most beloved kitchen tools. A three-legged stone mortar, the molcajete is made of volcanic stone, as is the tejolote, its cylindrical pestle. To “molcajetear” — Mexico has a knack for turning nouns into verbs — means pressing and grinding ingredients against the walls of the molcajete, imparting a unique flavor and texture. Its rough surface is perfect for grinding and crushing a variety of ingredients. Perfect for creating unique flavors and textures, the molcajete is a beloved tool for making salsas, guacamole, dips and marinades. It’s also ideal for grinding spices and herbs, releasing their aromatic oils. Even nuts and seeds can be ground to create flavorful pastes and powders. The molcajete’s rustic charm and efficient grinding capabilities make it a cornerstone of authentic Mexican cooking. Traditional molcajetes have always been made of volcanic stone, which is natural, non-toxic and safe for food processing. Crafting a molcajete involves a centuries-old carving technique. When you buyone made of volcanic stone, you’re supporting artisans’ craftsmanship and livelihoods. Buying an authentic molcajete isn’t just about bragging rights. Nowadays, there are many cement replicas for sale that can deceive buyers. The big reason to avoid cement molcajetes is that they’re not safe for cooking. Cement wears away when ground, releasing toxins and paint into your food. So, how can you tell if the molcajete you’re eyeing is made of volcanic stone or cement? Volcanic stone has pores, since it was once lava cooling off, passing tiny sulfuric bubbles to its surface. Some molcajetes will have a lot of wide pores, while others may have very small orifices. However, all of them have a rugged surface that makes them effective for grinding. A very smooth surface without pores is usually an indicator of a cement piece. A cement molcajete will absorb water and become evenly soaked, while volcanic stone holds water without absorbing it. However, some volcanic stone pieces have too many wide pores and can leak. While this type may still be an authentic piece, it won’t be a good option for salsa making, as the liquid will filter out. The ultimate test is curing the molcajete, as one made of volcanic stone will immediately release sediments as part of the process. Molcajetes need to be cured before you use them, because the natural stone tends to release residues that you don’t want in your food . Curing for kitchen duty is a simple process involving rice, salt and a little elbow grease: There’s nothing quite like a salsa roja molcajeteada — oh yes, Mexico also loves turning nouns into adjectives. Here’s a simple recipe to get you started. Remember, salsas are an art form, not an exact science. Channel your inner maestro when picking the type and amount of ingredients you use. 3 red chilis 3 tomatoes 2 cloves garlic 1 pinch dried oregano 1 pinch salt Fresh cilantro Molcajete can be used as a noun, a verb and an adjective. Why stop there? When you see molcajete as a dish on a menu, they’re offering you another level of deliciousness. A molcajete contains a medley of grilled meats, vegetables, cheese and salsa. This dish, meant to be shared, is served in a big warm molcajete in the center of the table. Everyone dives in with a warm tortilla in hand. It’s a joyful dining experience made special by the beauty of a molcajete overflowing with tasty goodies. Here’s a fun tidbit: I’ve seen people find solace in the act of grinding with a molcajete. Rhythmically grinding stuff with your sheer force can release pent-up energy and emotions. Who knew that whipping up a sassy salsa could be so therapeutic?

        "content": "New York: Extremely vulnerable to climate change, not rich enough to stop it on their own, and not poor enough to merit aid and development financing: the world's small island states on Monday blamed wealthy countries for their misfortune. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) \"find themselves on the front line of a battle against a confluence of crises, none of which they have caused or created,\" said Gaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, which is hosting a SIDS conference this week. The most pressing crisis is a worsening climate catastrophe as the world nears global warming of 1.5C, the upper threshold set in the Paris climate accord. \"The major contributors to climate change have failed to meet the obligations to mitigate its effects, causing significant harm to SIDS and our planet in general,\" Browne said. Seychelles President Wavel Ramkalawan warned that \"the climate crisis will destroy all of us,\" but that \"the world is taking its time while we suffer.\" Caught between rising debts and rising oceans, from the Caribbean to Africa to the Pacific, many SIDS share characteristics that make them especially vulnerable to external shocks: small landmasses home to scattered and isolated populations, with import dependent, non-diversified economies. And climate change -- with its brutal droughts, powerful hurricanes and rising seas -- is threatening to erase some of them from the map altogether. \"We cannot accept the disappearance of any country or culture under the rising waves,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said as he opened the SIDS conference, adding the international community has a \"duty\" to offer support. \"The idea that an entire island state could become collateral damage for profiteering by the fossil fuel industry, or competition between major economies, is simply obscene,\" Guterres said. \"The costs will only rise and will be paid in more and more human lives if we fail to deal with the root cause, that is fossil fuels,\" said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands. High on the agenda for the 39 states, whose populations number roughly 65 million people: increasing climate financing, even as many criticize the slow pace of fulfilling previous UN aid pledges. According to the UN Development Program, some $4.7-7.3 billion in financing is needed per year just for climate adaptation measures in SIDS countries. But most small island states are classified as middle-income countries or higher -- meaning that they're unable to access international aid and preferential financing available to the world's poorest countries. \"They are being trapped in a no man's land where financing from the international community that is often a kind of safety net is simply not available to them,\" said Achim Steiner, head of the UNDP. Beyond seeking outside aid, however, many are also turning toward reforming their own economies. Priorities include developing renewable energy sectors and engaging in the so-called \"blue economy\" of sustainable fishing and ocean conservation -- a serious opportunity for SIDS countries, which account for 19 percent of the world's Exclusive Economic Zones. Tourism, too, can be made more sustainable -- though the specter of climate change hangs over these countries' marine biodiversity and coral reefs, which draw scuba divers from across the world.",

        "description": "“It is good to spend time with family and friends. It’s good to barbecue,” James said. “But it’s even better to remember the reason we have this weekend. Today is in honor of those who have fallen and given the ultimate sacrifice.”",
        "content": "For most of Jim Burack’s life, Memorial Day was a day to reflect on the collective sacrifice made by all those who have died while serving. That changed in August 2009, when the now-retired Marine Corps colonel got a call from someone he had served with in Iraq. On that call, Burack learned Sgt. Bill Cahir — whom Burack had also served with — had been been killed by Taliban gunfire in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. “While an unlikely Marine,” Burack said of Cahir. “He was incomparably inspiring.” Cahir took an unlikely path to the Marines, spending most of the 1990s as a newspaper reporter on the east coast. He also worked under Sens. Harris Wofford and Ted Kennedy by the time he decided to join the Marine Corps at 34. “My fellow Marines out there to my right,” Burack said looking over at a group of Marine Corps Veterans Monday at Linn Grove Cemetery in Greeley. “You know all to well what a challenge boot camp is at Paris Island or (the Marine Corps Recruit Depot) for a youthful recruit, let alone a 34-year-old.” Cahir — determined to do his part in defense of his country following 9/11 and driven by his idealist view on the promise of America, according to Burack — joined the Marine Corps in 2003, serving two tours in Iraq before the tour in Afghanistan that ultimately cost him his life. But Burack wasn’t the only one who got that call in 2009. Marines from around the country who served with Cahir converged on Arlington National Cemetery for his funeral. “I don’t remember the chaplain’s words in the chapel or at graveside,” Burack said. “My mind was floating back to images of our deployment in Iraq. But I was overwhelmed by the dignity of his father, the grace of his wife — who was expecting two daughters — and the enormity of their tragic loss.” Since then, Memorial Day has meant something different to Burack. Something he believes just about everybody at Linn Grove Monday morning can relate to. “Memorial Day for me now means I mourn Sgt. Cahir and remember his life, and we know his last full measure was his devotion to his country,” Burack said. “But he is also symbolic of so many other cherished soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast guardians and guardians each with a proud and unique story of sacrifice and service to our nation.” Burack — the former Milliken police chief and current deputy director of the Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management — gave the key-note speech at Greeley’s annual Memorial Day ceremony on a sunny morning at Linn Grove. Weld County Commissioner Scott James emceed the ceremony, which — along with Burack’s speech — featured a short presentation by Greeley Mayor John Gates, a proclamation by Board of County Commissioners Chair Kevin Ross, an invocation and benediction by Chaplain Ray Delgado and a performance from singer Chad Young. Members of the Greeley Police Department Honor Guard raised a flag to open the ceremony, and placed small wreaths on crosses in tribute of those who died in a number of conflicts, spanning from the American Revolution to Afghanistan and Iraq. As the ceremony came to a close just before 10 a.m., the Honor Guard lowered the flag to half staff, and the Union Colony Marine Detachment 1093 performed a 21-gun salute. “It is good to spend time with family and friends. It’s good to barbecue,” James said. “But it’s even better to remember the reason we have this weekend. Today is in honor of those who have fallen and given the ultimate sacrifice.” Linn Grove will again be busy next Saturday, when the city hosts a ceremony celebrating the cemetery’s 150th anniversary. The celebration begins at 10 a.m.",

        "content": "WEBER COUNTY, Utah ( ABC4 ) — When storm clouds rolled into northern Utah on Saturday, a hiker became stranded on Lewis Peak, prompting a rescue that lasted until the early morning hours. Weber County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue said the hiker became disoriented amid the bad weather, and couldn’t find his way off the 8,000-foot mountain overlooking North Ogden. The search team was able to determine the hiker’s general area from a cell phone ping, and later a drone honed in on his exact location. Climb, horse and motorcycle crews responded. However, due to wet conditions and temperatures dropping into the evening, the Department of Public Safety’s helicopter was called to lift the man off the mountain. At around 1 a.m. Sunday, the rescue was completed. Officials said that neither the hiker nor the rescuers were hurt.",

        "description": "WHO ‘confident’ on pandemic treaty despite negotiators again failing to agree a draft deal on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday expressed confidence that a deal on a global pandemic accord can still be reached, Reuters has reported. For more than two years, ministers from among the WHO’s 194 member states have been struggling to draft a treaty on new pandemic response rules in the wake of Covid-19, which the global health body estimates has killed 13 million people since 2019. Negotiators once again failed to produce a draft deal last Friday for formal approval by the World Health Assembly this week. “Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly, and cross the finish line,” Tedros told the assembly in his opening address. He said “where there is a will, there is a way” and that he “remains confident” that a deal can still happen. “I know that there remains among you a common will to get this done,” the director-general told the assembly. WHO member nations had asked the UN health agency in 2021 to oversee talks for a pandemic agreement and envoys have been working in recent weeks to formulate a draft document ahead of a self-imposed deadline this month. However, according to media reports, negotiators were divided on numerous issues. Reuters reported that health officials were frustrated with discussions stretching past midnight, with last-minute U-turns on positions and with growing criticism that such a treaty would undermine national sovereignty. According to the report, a truck with a sign reading “NO to the Pandemic Treaty. STOP the UN Power Grab” was seen near the UN headquarters in Geneva, where the talks are being held. Earlier this month, Republican senators wrote a letter to US President Joe Biden denouncing the draft agreement, for “shredding intellectual property rights” and potentially “supercharging the WHO,” and called on Biden not to sign off. The whole process could take up to another two years to complete, a senior US administration official told Reuters, adding that Washington was still committed to the process. Talks are reportedly still ongoing to update existing rules on disease outbreaks, with a new tiered system of alerts being discussed as a response to criticism that the WHO was slow to act on the Covid-19 pandemic in its early stages. Covid-19 initially emerged in late 2019 and developed into the largest epidemic in nearly a century. The WHO said in a new report last week that an estimated 13 million people died during the pandemic.",

        "content": "America's Got Talent judge Sofia Vergara's heart wasn’t all in at first when it came to moving into her Los Angeles home. Things weren't “coming out the way I wanted,” she conveyed during an Architectural Digest tour of the space. But it eventually worked out in her favor. While giving Architectural Digest a tour of her abode for the March cover story, Sofia confessed that she depended on her designer Ohara Davies-Gaetano to bring her “homey and comfortable” concept to life while she was going through a difficult time in her life, per Yahoo. “I loved working with Ohara. She kind of saved my life because I was at a little of a crossroads,” Vergara explained. “It was either, ‘I’m going to hate this house or I’m going to love this house. What am I going to do? I don’t want to move in here because I don’t think things are coming out the way I wanted.’” Sofia Vergara’s top America’s Got Talent looks ranked as star turns up heat Sofía Vergara's age wasn't only reason she didn't want baby with Joe Manganiello Sofia purchased the $26 million Los Angeles residence in 2020 when she was still married to her husband at the time, Joe Manganiello. The pair reported their split in July 2023 after seven years of marriage, and Manganiello went on to file for divorce just two days later. Trying to stay positive, Vergara continued with the renovation undertaking for her home and was determined to make the house her own. She was sure to fill it to the brim with some of her favorite things, including her collections of crystal birds and fine china. A lot of thought went into the home. Sofia worked with Davies-Gaetano to curate a collection of antique items from Sweden, Spain, France, and Italy in order to create “a house with history and texture.” The home soon started to look like “a well-lived house,” which is exactly what Sofia hoped for, though the home was on the newer end and just built in the 1990s. Sofia has shared one design element in the living room and family room that always catches her eye. “I love it because they open to the backyard which is my favorite thing about the house,” she says. “Every room opens to the pool and the backyard — even when you’re upstairs in the guest rooms.” DON'T MISS...

The most special area in the house.” Some more of her favorite areas in her home include her bedroom which makes her feel “comfortable and sexy,” along with her enormous closet which houses clothing items and accessories that are in rainbow order. “This is where I actually really live, in my closet,” she said. “This is where I spend most of my time – this is like a girl’s dream.”",

        "content": "Mrs Tamunominini Makinde, the wife of Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde, on Monday, flagged off the introduction of the HPV vaccine into Oyo State’s immunisation schedule and the commencement of a five-day Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination campaign to stem cases of cervical cancer in women. Speaking at the flag-off ceremony at Saint Paul’s Anglican Primary School in Basorun, Ibadan, Mrs Makinde, represented by the wife of the State deputy governor, Chief Mrs Ajibola Lawal, stated that the HPV vaccine has been proven to reduce the risk of HPV infection significantly and, subsequently, the development of cervical cancer. According to her, the introduction of the HPV vaccine for girls aged 9 to 14 years marks a significant milestone in addressing cervical cancer in Nigeria and improving the health and well-being of Nigeria’s young girls. She added that the introduction of HPV vaccination into the state’s routine immunisation schedule reiterates the government’s commitment to reducing the burden of cervical cancer in Nigeria and providing girls with a healthier, brighter future. “This initiative promises to safeguard our children’s future and tackle a significant health challenge head-on. “Cervical cancer is a devastating disease that affects women all over the world, and Nigeria is no exception. It is a leading cause of death among women in the nation, and the burden of this disease has weighed heavily on the hearts and minds of our healthcare community, hence the reason it must be viewed with a binocular of public health importance. “Reliable scientific data informed the decision to vaccinate females between the ages of 9 and 14 with the HPV vaccination . At this age, the vaccine is most effective, providing a strong shield against the virus before any potential exposure.” Oyo State Health Commissioner, Dr Oluwaseresimi Ajetunmobi, stated that the HPV vaccine is safe, effective, and does not cause infertility and therefore encouraged parents to ensure their daughters take the vaccine. She declared that over 600,000 children aged 9 to 14 years will be vaccinated during the exercise. Subsequently, it will be part of the routine immunisation programme to be given for children aged 9 years. “We are creating awareness that cervical cancer is real; it’s a preventable disease. But the HPV vaccine is not a cause of infertility; rather, it’s a vaccine that will prevent our girls from having cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus has been in existence since, and we have so many strains. But the ones that we are targeting, particularly the 16 and 18 variants. And that is why it’s important that our girls come out. “Let’s give appropriate information and knowledge concerning this HPV virus and the vaccine. It’s not a vaccine that will cause infertility, but rather, a vaccine that will prevent cervical cancer.” UNICEF’s Health Specialist, Dr Ijeoma Agbo, stated that UNICEF had championed bringing in approximately over 15 million doses of the HPV vaccine to Nigeria because it sees the vaccine as pivotal to making the loss of 8,000 Nigerian women to cervical cancer, something of the past. “This is a practical step in breaking the cycle of preventable disease. And of course, for UNICEF, this is a priority for us. We believe that every child, every girl, needs to have the opportunity to survive, thrive, and lead a productive life,” she declared. In a remark, the Executive Secretary of the Oyo State Primary Health Care Board, Dr. Muideen Olatunji stated that cervical cancer is a public health concern and that girls between the ages of 9 and 14 were eligible for the vaccine, which normally costs between N35,000 and N95,000. “By safeguarding the female gender, we are also safeguarding ourselves, as we men will be shielded from acquiring HPV if the females are HPV-negative. HPV in men can cause other problems, including cancer and genital warts.”",

As the artificial intelligence revolution gains momentum, a bullish analyst foresees a surge in electricity demand, which they said is a boon for solar companies like First Solar Inc FSLR .

        "content": "Manchester United and Arsenal are set to go head-to-head to sign French wonderkid Desire Doue. The young midfielder has emerged as one of the most exciting talents in Ligue 1 over the past season-and-a-half with Rennes. His form has caught the eye of a host of clubs in the Premier League , who could formalise their interest this summer. According to Mail Online , United and Arsenal have both submitted enquiries regarding his services. Tottenham are also noted to be among those tracking him. Interest is not just limited to the Premier League. European clubs such as Paris St Germain, Bayern Munich , Bayer Leverkusen and Borussia Dortmund are all tracking Doue. Transfer news live - Chelsea in 'advanced' Maresca talks, Man Utd deal confirmed Anthony Martial confirms Man Utd exit after nine years with emotional message The 18-year-old has just two years left on his contract with Rennes. The French side are open to a sale but only in the region of around £35m with significant add-ons. Rennes boss Julien Stephan spoke out on the youngster’s future at the weekend and admitted an exit is possible. He said: “We know today’s market, notably for the very young players. He will decide through his personal ambition. I’m not naive. “We’re glad to have developed him during the second part of the season. He’s at risk of leaving without a single full season here, that’s a shame. I would have liked that; that would have been an ideal situation.” Desire Doue is being eyed by a clutch of clubs in the Premier League and Europe ( Image: Getty Images) Who should Man United sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below Doue has made 76 appearances for Rennes since breaking into the team. He has scored eight goals and provided seven assists. Some of his teammates are huge fans and have even claimed that he is the ‘best they have seen’. While Arsenal and United are vying for his services this season, it is not the first time that Doue has been at the heart of speculation. Newcastle were interested in him last summer as confirmed by his agent Mikael Silvestre. Speaking to The i last year, the former Premier League star said: “I know Newcastle came to watch him and were in touch with us. “Like a lot of clubs in Europe when they scout, they come and try and speak to the entourage and get a feeling and try to understand what the situation is. It’s not necessarily about the contractual situation but also what’s going on in the life of the player as much as possible before they make a move.” While United are linked with a swoop for Doue, they have already lost the services of one of his countrymen. Striker Anthony Martial has confirmed he will leave the club for nothing at the end of his contract. Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "content": "PERTH, Australia — In an industry first, Rio Tinto and BHP will collaborate on the testing of large battery-electric haul truck technology in the Pilbara, Western Australia, to accelerate the potential for its future deployment. The two companies will work with manufacturers Caterpillar and Komatsu to conduct independent trials of their battery-electric haul trucks, including testing of battery, static and dynamic charging systems, to assess performance and productivity in the Pilbara environment. The collaboration reflects the individual commitments made from BHP, Rio Tinto, Komatsu and Caterpillar to support Rio Tinto and BHP’s shared ambition of net zero operational greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As part of the collaboration, two Cat 793 haul trucks will be trialled from the second half of 2024, and two Komatsu 930 haul trucks tested from 2026 at mine sites in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Caterpillar and Komatsu will each provide one truck each to both BHP and Rio Tinto for these trials. BHP will trial the Caterpillar trucks, while Rio Tinto will trial the Komatsu trucks. Outcomes of the trials will be shared between BHP and Rio Tinto. These trials represent the first stage of battery-electric haul truck testing at BHP and Rio Tinto’s Pilbara operations. Ongoing testing, development and refinement of truck and battery design is anticipated with each manufacturer. This will inform the approach for testing a larger number of haul trucks and the potential deployment of battery-electric haul truck fleets into each company’s operations. Rio Tinto Iron Ore Chief Executive Simon Trott said: “This collaboration brings together two leading global miners with two of the world’s biggest manufacturers of haul trucks to work on solving the critical challenge of zero-emissions haulage. “There is no clear path to net zero without zero-emissions haulage, so it’s important that we work together to get there as quickly and efficiently as we can. Testing two types of battery-electric haul trucks in Pilbara conditions will provide better data, and by combining our efforts with BHP we will accelerate learning. “As we work to repower our Pilbara operations with renewable energy, collaborations like this move us closer to solving the shared challenge of decarbonising our operations, and meeting our net zero commitments.” BHP President Australia Geraldine Slattery said: “Operational decarbonisation relies on breakthroughs in technology and partnerships like this will help drive our industry forward. We are thrilled to work with Rio Tinto, Caterpillar and Komatsu on these trials. “Replacing diesel as a fuel source requires us to develop a whole new operational ecosystem to surround the fleet. We need to address the way we plan our mines, operate our haulage networks, and consider the additional safety and operational considerations that these changes will bring. This is why trials are so critical to our success as we seek to test and learn how these new technologies will work in practice and integrate into our mines. “We’ve already seen a step-change reduction in Scope 1 and 2 operational greenhouse gas emissions through switching some of our supply to renewable electricity, and we are looking to build on that progress through development of battery-electric technology to reduce diesel usage across our operations.” Note to editors In 2021, Rio Tinto and BHP worked with both Caterpillar and Komatsu to support the development and validation of their prototype battery-electric haul trucks. The trucks included in these trials are based on these prototypes. Carbon emissions from diesel consumption in our mining equipment and rail fleet accounted for 12% of Rio Tinto’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2023. Carbon emissions from the combustion of diesel accounted for around 40% of BHP’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2020. Press release from Rio Tinto .

        "description": "Marcus Rashford's latest tweet shows he's aiming to get back to his best for Manchester United next season.",
        "content": "It has been a testing season for 's main man, . The Red Devil was coming off the back of his most productive campaign during the 2022/2023 season. Expectations were through the roof as he and the club as a whole were expected to build on the progress they had started to make under Erik Ten Hag. What followed was anything but. An 8th place league finish was the worst the collective had ever managed in their Premier League history. As for the individual, eight goals in all competitions was an alarming change in fortunes. Couple this with controversies that included him , there were many speculating that the grass may be greener elsewhere for the 26-year-old. persisted, and new co-owners INEOS made it clear that Rashford was not irreplaceable. Having been dropped from the England squad for Euro 2024, the winger appears to be taking time away from the spotlight to recover mentally and physically. Perhaps this is a sign that Marcus Rashford is ready to battle his demons and fight for a future at his boyhood club. Taking to social media, United's number 10 told followers that after what had been a difficult season for both the player and the club. He stated: \"It's time to come off Socials for a few weeks. I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.\" To say that it has been a challenging season for Rashford would be somewhat of an understatement. The forward was rewarded with a new contract in the summer of 2023, . This was a testament to just how important the Englishman had been the season prior, where he had managed 30 goals and 10 assists for the entire season, by far the best output of his career to date. Games 56 43 Goals 30 8 Assists 10 5 However, the drop in form led to a perceived drop in attitude. Rashford often faced backlash from fans for his work rate in comparison to youngsters like Alejandro Garnacho and Amad Diallo. At times, this criticism turned volatile, At that point, it appeared the damage had been done and that maybe Rashford was better off finding pastures new, just months after putting pen to paper on a bumper new deal. His poor form got the better of him, with Ten Hag opting to leave him out of his team more frequently towards the back-end of the season. The abuse continued, as Rashford found himself during Manchester United's final home game of the season against Newcastle. It appeared the clock was ticking. Yet, recent developments have indicated there may still be life at the Theatre of Dreams for the academy graduate yet. Given that he had been absent from the starting line-up in recent weeks, it was a surprise to see Rashford named on the left-hand side for the FA Cup final. However, the decision to put him in from the start was justified. Last year's Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year caused havoc against Kyle Walker on multiple occasions and played a pivotal part in United's second goal, by far their best move of the game. Although he wasn't operating on the same levels he had done last season, this was a marked improvement from what Rashford had routinely produced over the last 12-months. Reasons why could be guessed upon for eternity. Perhaps he was sending a message to Gareth Southgate. He could've just been desperate to win his second FA Cup. Regardless of what spurred him on, it worked. In the hours that followed this famous victory, Rashford took to social media Underneath was the caption: 'people want to know what Man Utd means to me!' A very direct message to those who had questioned his loyalty and passion for the club in testing times. This, followed by his latest social media post, is perhaps the clearest indication that the player still sees his future in the North-West of England. Where he grew up. The FA Cup final cannot be just the end of a season for Rashford. It needs to be a springboard for him to get back to his best. This social media break might just be the next step in finding himself again off the pitch, which in turn will allow him to rediscover who he is on it.",

        "content": "Even after a six-win 2023 season, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the New York Giants. Here are three reasons they’ll bounce back in 2024. 1. Daniel Jones is not as bad as you think Jones may have won just two of six games before tearing his ACL last year but played well enough in 2022 to earn a four-year, $160M contract in 2023. In his first (and only) full season playing in Brian Daboll’s offense, Jones finished as the NFL’s 15th-leading passer with 3,205 yards. While that's hardly a Hall of Fame stat line, he added seven scores and 708 yards rushing that year. By comparison, Bills quarterback Josh Allen finished 2018 as the NFL’s 32nd-leading passer with 2,074 yards and 12 interceptions in his first season with Daboll as coordinator. If Jones and his coach can get back to what worked in 2022 and work out the bugs from 2023, there’s no reason to think they can’t succeed in 2024. 2. Malik Nabers is as good as you think Nabers ranked second in the FBS with 1,569 receiving yards and tied for third with 14 touchdowns in 2023. He helped LSU quarterback Jayden Daniels win a Heisman and could be the team's best wide receiver since Odell Beckham Jr. Malik Nabers recorded four receptions of 25+ yards in the first half against Mississippi State, the most for an LSU player in the opening half of a game since Ja'Marr Chase in 2019 vs Vanderbilt. pic.twitter.com/1H7AezsNOr At six feet tall and 200 pounds, Nabers can play all three receiver spots and may have to given the team’s lack of playmakers. NFL Network’s Lance Zierlein compares him favorably to the Vikings’ Justin Jefferson, and Pro Football Focus ranked Nabers as the best wide receiver in the 2024 NFL Draft. 3. Tyrone Tracy Jr. could be a weapon As a former wide receiver, Tracy should see the field immediately as a third-down back and possibly more as the season goes on. He played 38 games at wide receiver for Iowa before transferring to Purdue in 2022 and switching to running back in 2023. Tracy led the Big Ten in yards per carry (6.3) last season by forcing 46 missed tackles on just 114 carries. He also had eight touchdowns. Taken in the fifth round, Tracy could be the steal of this year’s draft and a valuable piece of the offense moving forward.",

        "content": "Johannesburg, May 27: The South African Border Management Authority (BMA) is on high alert as the country prepares to hold the general elections on Wednesday, the BMA said on Monday. “With just two days before South Africa’s national and provincial elections, the Border Management Authority is on high alert at all ports of entry to monitor movements,” the BMA said in a statement, Xinhua news agency reported. It arrested 28 Bangladesh nationals on Saturday evening at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg who had arrived from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, with no proper documents. In the statement, BMA Commissioner Michael Masiapato highlighted the importance of cooperation with embassies and foreign missions in verifying visa legitimacy and encouraged improvements in detection systems. “This operation underscores the importance of our continuous efforts to secure our borders and ensure that all entrants comply with our legal requirements,” said the Commissioner. He noted that law enforcement has made huge deployments across the country for the elections, including escorting ballot papers and guarding national key points.",

        "description": "The airline entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year and has a five-year restructuring plan.",
        "content": "GOL Linhas Aéreas of Brazil is working on its exit from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and earlier today announced a five-year recovery plan. is a low-cost carrier in Brazil that operates a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, one of several airlines worldwide to do so. It is the second Brazilian airline to enter the Chapter 11 Bankruptcy process in recent years and hopes to exit soon. According to a report today from , the airline will receive more than $1 billion in capital injections. Earlier today, GOL revealed its 5-Year Financial Plan to restructure and put the airline back on its feet. The plan outlines that by 2026, GOL hopes to return to its pre-pandemic capacity. Additionally, the airline aims to expand its network domestically and internationally, something that already happened last week through the announcement of a codeshare with Azul Linhas Aéreas on some routes. By 2029, GOL expects to have 169 planes in its fleet, a net increase of 31 aircraft based on the current fleet. In the coming years, many aircraft will be retired, and GOL will modernize its fleet. The airline's order book currently has 88 planes, 63 Boeing 737 MAX 8s and 25 Boeing 737 MAX 10s (which have not been certified). A significant portion of GOL's five-year plan is to inject $1.5 billion in capital by issuing new shares and refinancing nearly $2 billion of its debt. After the new plan was announced, shares in Brazil dropped up to 3.5%, and GOL said there was a significant chance its shares would hit \"minimal value upon emergence\" from bankruptcy. \"We are pleased to reach another important milestone in our financial restructuring process. Since the beginning of this process, GOL has continued to operate without interruptions, demonstrating solidity in executing our commercial strategy and cost management. We have successfully renegotiated agreements with our lessors for most of our aircraft and are investing in our engines and expanding our operational fleet.\" - Celso Ferrer, Chief Executive Officer, GOL Linhas Aéreas Last week, GOL and Azul Linhas Aéreas took a step that fed rumors of a merger. The airlines announced a codeshare agreement to expand their domestic networks. Their respective codes will only be placed on routes operated by one of the airlines. According to Azul's president, Abhi Shah, this creates more than 2,700 one-stop connection opportunities. Brazil only has three major players in the domestic market: GOL, Azul, and LATAM Brasil (formerly TAM). Between GOL and Azul, the two have 52% of seats available in May. Two big airlines joining forces in Brazil is not standard and feeds the rumors that Azul is trying to purchase GOL and merge the two airlines. Though neither airline has openly discussed the merger, Azul's CEO, John Rodgerson, has been straightforward about the airline's interest in consolidating the Brazilian market. When LATAM went through its Chapter 11 process, there were plenty of rumors that it would merge with Azul.",

        "description": "Polk certainly has some lofty goals.",
        "content": "Before the New England Patriots made Ja’Lynn Polk a second-round pick during the 2024 NFL Draft, the Washington Huskies wide receiver returned to Lufkin High School in Lufkin, Texas, to speak with current student-athletes about the next step of his playing career. \"He told the kids, 'Mark it down, I will win a Super Bowl and I will be All-Pro,'\" Lufkin football head coach Todd Quick said about Polk's visit while speaking with Keagan Stiefel of NESN. \"His goals are lofty, but they’re goals he can reach.\" New England selected quarterback Drake Maye with the third overall pick and later grabbed receiver Javon Baker in the fourth round. Over the weekend, Mike Reiss of ESPN noted how former Patriots receiver and Super Bowl XXXIX Most Valuable Player Deion Branch explained how \"it's super valuable\" for New England to have Polk, Maye and Baker develop together from springtime workouts through at least the first few seasons of their pro careers. While Polk built his reputation with Washington, he previously featured for the Texas Tech Red Raiders and played under wide receivers coach Joel Filani. During a chat with Stiefel, Filani compared Polk to two of the NFL's best players at the position. \"He’s just so strong and can control his body,\" Filani said about Polk. \"He can separate enough to where he can make contested catches but give the quarterback an opportunity to get him the ball. I know he wants to be a No. 1. He’s working toward that, and there’s only so many Justin Jeffersons and Ja’Marr Chases, but you talk about a guy like Stefon Diggs — these guys are unwilling to not be the top guy. I see him competing for the top spot, and I think he’ll attack that and take it.\" The Patriots currently lack a proven No. 1 receiver and seemingly aren't in a hurry to trade for a big-name target ahead of training camp. It's unclear if Maye or veteran Jacoby Brissett will begin the upcoming season as New England's QB1, but Polk should receive plenty of opportunities to build chemistry with both signal-callers over the next several months.",

        "content": "SEVERAL 99 Cents Stores have been saved from bankruptcy thanks to rival discount retailer Ollie's. Ollie's announced on May 24 it will acquire 11 former 99 Cents Only Stores, saving them from shuttering forever. On April 4, 99 Cents Only announced it would shut down all its stores. The discount chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy less than one week later. At the time, the chain had 371 locations across California , Arizona , Nevada , and Texas . 99 Cents Only Stores owed its top 10 creditors almost $35 million , according to court documents. The bankrupt chain was given a new lease on life thanks to Ollie's, the largest US retailer of closeout merchandise and excess inventory. Ollie’s said the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware approved its $14.6 million bid for the 99 Cents Stores, per Retail Dive . All 11 of the acquired stores are in “key markets” in Texas, according to Ollie's. Three are owned properties and eight are leased . The store acquisitions are expected to close early next month. “We are very excited to be announced as the winning bidder of these store locations,” said Ollie’s CEO John Swygert. “These stores are the right size, located in good trade areas, have attractive rents and leasing structures, and have been serving value-oriented customers for many years. \"Texas is a great market for us that has tremendous growth potential and continues to benefit from strong population growth.” Ollie’s runs 516 stores across 30 states but is looking to grow its store footprint. The retailer shared in a March earnings call that it has room to expand to 1,300 locations, which is up from a previous goal of 1,050. Acquiring the 99 Cents Only Stores is one step on Ollie's path to a larger store footprint. Ollie's Bargain Outlet is a US chain of discount closeout retailers. It was founded in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania in 1982 by Morton Bernstein and Mark Butler. There are currently 30 states with Ollie's locations: “We are maintaining our target of 50 new stores, less two planned closures, for fiscal 2024 and are in the early stages of evaluating the impact on our new store opening cadence this year,” said Swygert. Regarding the new Texas locations, Ollie's plans a quick turnaround. “We are focused on getting these stores up and running as quickly as possible, given the occupancy expenses we will begin incurring at closing,” said the CEO. In other store closure news, Red Lobster closed 17 restaurants in a single state as the bankruptcy bloodbath continues to sweep the US. Plus, a beloved supermarket is closing in days creating a \"food desert\" - shoppers have three options to get their groceries.",

        "description": "The Transmission Company of Nigeria( TCN), says its tower T290, one of the four new towers erected by its contractors along the Jos – Gombe 330 Kilo Volt (kV} transmission line, collapsed during the cable stringing process.The post TCN reports collapse of tower on Jos-Gombe transmission line appeared first on The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News.",
        "content": "The Transmission Company of Nigeria( TCN), says its tower T290, one of the four new towers erected by its contractors along the Jos – Gombe 330 Kilo Volt (kV} transmission line, collapsed during the cable stringing process. Mrs Ndidi Mbah, TCN’S General Manager, Public Affairs in a statement in Abuja said the incident occurred at about 7 a.m. Monday (Today) Mbah said the incident occurred while the contractor was stringing the cable on the last tower, which was supposed to enable the final joining of the power cable in time for energising of the line today. ‘”In spite the security challenges in the area, TCN contractors and some of our engineering staff worked tirelessly to fast-track the project, doing all that was humanly possible to meet the time-line. ” Everyday, the contractor, TCN engineers accompanied by security operatives consistently left the site by 10 pm in the night and resumed work at 6 a.m. every day. ”Constructing towers and stringing power cables at such heights is highly technical, although TCN contractors and staff have successfully completed similar projects in other parts of the country. ”The collapse of the fourth tower is a significant setback, given the extensive efforts to ensure that May 27 power restoration timeline was met, ”she said. Mbah said that TCN contractor was currently dismantling the collapsed tower members, to enable reconstruction and final restringing of the cable. She said it was unfortunate that while TCN is working on reconstructing and restringing the four vandalised towers, three towers along the Biu – Danboa 132kV transmission line were also vandalised with 16 spans of conductors stolen. She said the towers, which had all collapsed, included towers T1690, T1691 and T1692. According to her, TCN has mobilised a contractor to commence their reconstruction. This discovery was made by TCN patrol team last Friday. ”This morning also, the TCN lines patrol team discovered that tower T540 along the Makurdi – Jos 330kV double circuit transmission line has been vandalised. ”Sections of the tower have been removed, although the tower remains standing. TCN has contracted emergency repairs, to prevent its collapse. ”We reiterate our commitment to restoring normal bulk power supply through the distribution companies serving the North East and other areas affected by vandalism. ”There is, however, an urgent need for everyone to join hands with TCN in protecting our collective assets by being vigilant, and reporting any suspected acts of tower and line vandalism promptly,”she said.

        "content": "Two drivers were killed in a wrong-way car crash on I-93 in Methuen early Monday morning, according to Massachusetts State Police. Troopers were called to the three-vehicle crash around 2:10 a.m., state police said in a press release . Their initial investigation suggests that a 53-year-old Quincy resident was driving a Toyota RAV4 north on the southbound side of the road when it hit a Toyota Camry head-on. The driver of the Toyota Camry — a 21-year-old Quincy resident — was declared dead at the scene, state police said. The 53-year-old was taken to a hospital where they were also declared dead. After crashing with the RAV4, the Camry hit another vehicle, but that vehicle’s driver was not hurt in the crash, state police said. No further information, including the identities of the deceased drivers, has been released. More similar stories",

        "content": "Rick Brant has reason to be excited about next year’s National Aboriginal Hockey Championships (NAHC). Brant is the CEO of the Indigenous Sport, Physical Activity & Recreation Council (I-SPARC), the governing body for Indigenous athletics and recreation in British Columbia. I-SPARC oversees the selection of B.C. squads for the annual NAHC, which features elite Indigenous players from across the country, primarily ages 13 to 17. Earlier this month it was announced that Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc (formerly the Kamloops Indian Band) will co-host the 2025 NAHC. “It deepens the shared experience for all involved when an Indigenous community hosts such a prestigious Indigenous sporting event,” Brant said. “So, we are thrilled for Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc to be partnering with the city of Kamloops to deliver the 2025 National Aboriginal Hockey Championships.” The NAHC has been held annually since 2002. The tournament, however, was cancelled in both 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2025 event will mark the third time it has been staged in British Columbia. The tourney was first held in the province in 2004 in Prince George. And then the 2017 event was held in the Cowichan Valley district in the province. “It will be a special experience for our teams to compete for a national title in front of a home crowd,” Brant said. Based on recent history, there’s a good chance both the British Columbia female and male squads could capture some hardware at the 2025 tournament. Both B.C. entrants ended up winning the bronze medal in their categories at this year’s NAHC, which concluded earlier this month in Grande Prairie, Alta. The B.C. male program has enjoyed tremendous success in recent times at the national tournament. During the last 10 times the event it has been held, the B.C. male squad has won a medal every single tourney. That medal haul includes three golds, one silver and six bronze. Besides this year, the B.C. female team also won the bronze at the 2022 tourney, which was held in the Nova Scotia community of Membertou. The dates for the 2025 tournament have been set for May 5 to May 10. All matches will be staged at the McArthur Island Sport and Event Centre in Kamloops. Joshua Gottfriedson, the acting chief of Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc, was pleased to hear the news of where the national tourney will be held next year. “We are honored to welcome elite Indigenous hockey players from across Canada to our city,” he said. “This event not only showcases exceptional talent but also celebrates cultural unity and pride.” Kamloops’ deputy mayor Bill Sarai said his city it excited to host next year’s event. “This tournament highlights our relationship with Tk̓emlúps te Secwépemc, whose unceded ancestral lands we occupy, alongside our dedicated community partners and volunteers,” he said. “Welcoming Indigenous athletes, coaches, and families from diverse communities, we aim to amplify Indigenous voices and the beauty of the local Secwépemc culture and the culture of every athlete at the games.” Lana Popham, B.C.’s minister of Tourism, Arts, Culture and Sport, also welcomed the news of the 2025 NAHC. “These championships are a great opportunity to bring benefits to the region by attracting visitors, fostering job creation and boosting revenue for local businesses,” she said. “I also commend the celebration of Indigenous culture as a prominent feature of these games. Truth and reconciliation is at the heart of our government’s work and a priority in BC’s sport sector.” It remains to be seen how many squads will participate at the 2025 NAHC. The tournament traditionally features provincial, territorial or regional representatives. The 2024 event in Grande Prairie featured 14 competing teams, seven female and seven male. Ontario clubs ended up winning the gold medal in both categories. Besides B.C., other squads that competed in both divisions, were from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Team Atlantic and Team Eastern Door and the North (Quebec). Since 2017 the two champs of the NAHC are presented with the Turtle Island Cup, which was created by Carey Newman, a First Nations artist from Vancouver Island. Windspeaker.com",

        "content": "A new report from BC Ferries’ public engagement activities has found that the corporation has had mixed results in strengthening its public engagement process. The report , recently presented to the British Columbia Ferries Commissioner focused on the year that ended on March 31, 2024. Progress has been made in Indigenous relations, according to the report, while engagement with ferry-dependent communities has deteriorated, the commissioner noted. In September 2023, BC Ferries announced it was moving community meetings from in-person to online due to rising aggressive, threatening and abusive behaviour. On Sept. 20, during a meeting Diana Mumford was chairing for the Southern Sunshine Coast Ferry Advisory Committee, a member of the public uttered a threat to the effect that if BC Ferries didn’t make changes the individual would “take a gun to everyone” according to BC Ferries. Story continues below advertisement “It’s unfortunate, because ... I think it shows the level of frustration of our community,” Mumford told Global News at the time. 0:58 BC Ferries expanding pet area on some vessels According to the report to the commissioner, BC Ferries intends to return to in-person meetings for spring and summer. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “The Commissioners have heard from the FAC (Ferry Advisory Committee) chairs that there were high levels of frustration among FAC members due to the lack of communication from the Corporation following the cessation of in-person meetings in September,” the report states. “In addition, FAC members felt that they were not consulted nor were they involved in the development of new security measures in their communities.” For the following fiscal year, the commissioner is “strongly recommending” BC Ferries outline the steps it will take to make customers ” feel respected, heard and valued” and that those steps be developed in consultation with communities, FACs, First Nations and other stakeholders. Story continues below advertisement In addition, BC Ferries should demonstrate to the B.C. Ferries Commissioner how it intends to monitor whether the steps taken lead to an enhanced public engagement process, to clearly define and communicate what role the FACs will have in the enhanced public engagement plan and ensure that all communication is shared online in a comprehensive and timely manner.

        "description": "The dog stepped in when the owner couldn't move after he fell and obstructed his breathing.",
        "content": "A day after a dog was adopted from a New Mexico animal shelter, the employees received an unexpected call from the person who adopted the canine. Instead of potentially bad news shelters often get about adopters changing their minds about the pet they brought home, Andrew Budek-Schmeisser wanted to share nothing but praise for the dog who saved his life. Budek-Schmeisser adopted Peanut on March 9 from the Animal Welfare Department after a friend suggested getting a dog tall enough for him to lean on. He has a service dog, but a larger, more sturdy dog would help him as he has difficulty walking. He told that he has a number of illnesses, including cancer and heart problems, and his walking is shaky. The next day after bringing Peanut home, Budek-Schmeisser was outside getting to know the Great Dane and pit mix when he fell and hit his head, obstructing his airway. Peanut immediately stepped in to help. \"I couldn't do anything about it, but Peanut could,\" he said. \"Peanut cleared my airway, and when I was breathing well enough again, he sat me up. He and another dog helped move me to a chair where I could recover.\" Budek-Schmeisser assumes that Peanut and his service dog, Belle, communicated with each other during the incident. Belle is a wolf hybrid, so she doesn't have the strength and height Peanut possesses, he explained. Peanut cleared his airway and got him into a position to breathe again. Then, the two dogs helped move him to a chair. Peanut sat with him, his head against Budek-Schmeisser's chest, making sure he was still breathing and not going to fall again. \"I would not have expected a dog to understand within 24 hours what to do or to have the initiative to do what was necessary,\" he said. \"When I realized what he was doing, I had to put my life and future into his hands, I had to trust him.\" Between that incident and learning the ropes from Belle, Peanut stays by his side constantly. Peanut forgoes what he wants to do, which is chasing lizards, and instead always focuses on keeping Budek-Schmeisser safe. Budek-Schmeisser's biggest takeaway from this incredible moment was not that his life was saved. Instead, Budek-Schmeisser reflected on the fact Peanut waited in a crowded for five months, and instead of giving up, the shelter kept him and saw he could make a difference in someone's life. \"Many dogs and cats waiting out there in shelters that can make a difference in people's lives. All they need is an opportunity,\" he said. \"Healing may come on four paws.\" The shelter was touched to hear about the incredible rescue, which further proves that adopting animals is a win-win for everyone involved. \"A faithful companion is gained, a friendship is formed and a life is saved,\" marketing manager Desiree Cawley told . \"In this circumstance, they both saved each other.\" The Animal Welfare Department currently houses over 700 pets patiently waiting for their forever homes. Cawley said the adoption fee is waived for all pets at the city shelters, including spay or neuter, microchip, I.D. tag, and vaccinations. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 6.3 million pets enter U.S. shelters each year, an average of 17,260 a day. The number of dogs and cats taken in by pet shelters hit 46,807 during January 2023, an increase of 1,744 compared with January 2022, the 24Pet Shelter Watch Report found. Around 920,000 surrendered animals are euthanized every year. Shelters are striving to minimize euthanasia rates by promoting adoption campaigns, spaying and neutering programs, and behavior rehabilitation.

        "content": "A theater in Beverly, Massachusetts, is apologizing to patrons who attended a screening of “Jaws” over the weekend, after star Richard Dreyfuss allegedly made comments many patrons considered to be sexist and homophobic. The Cabot Theater hosted “An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening,” where attendees were likely fans of the Steven Spielberg classic, hoping for anecdotes about the film. However, Dreyfuss, 76, reportedly went on a rogue rant that ranged from talking about Barbra Streisand, to his opinions on transgender youth and gender affirmation, as well as the Academy Awards’ inclusivity rules. Attendees took to social media to express their disappointment. “We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic rant,” one person commented on The Cabot’s recent Facebook post . “Richard Dreyfuss is an embarrassment to society. I walked out tonight because of his small minded bigoted view of women and choice,” another wrote. One commenter shared that the audience thought the event would be “a light, fun evening listening to stories and anecdotes about RD’s time on the Vineyard making Jaws.” They wrote, “This was disgusting. How could the Cabot not have vetted his act better. Apparently (I found out too late), he has a reputation for spewing this kind of racist, homophobic, misogynistic bullcrap...We did NOT get what we paid for.” The venue sent out an apology email to attendees and expressed their regret in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter . “We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film ‘Jaws’ at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons,” a representative wrote. “We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons.” “We are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.” The Post has reached out to representatives for Dreyfuss for comment.",

        "description": "Cole Irvin threw five scoreless innings and Cedric Mullins and Kyle Stowers each had two-RBI hits in the Orioles' five-run fourth inning.",
        "content": "Cedric Mullins sprinted hard out of the box and turned on the jets just before hitting second base. He dove headfirst into third, letting out a scream before smacking his hands together. If not for the cheers from the announced 40,951 fans at Camden Yards, it appeared that Mullins expressed the emotion out of frustration. Perhaps he did. The center fielder has been engrossed in a brutal slump — a .148 batting average in May entering Monday’s Memorial Day matinee against the Boston Red Sox — and he let out his anger with a two-run triple in the fourth inning and his celebration while kneeling on third base. Mullins’ extra-base hit was one of seven the Orioles smacked en route to an 11-3 rout of the Red Sox for Baltimore’s fifth straight win after sweeping the White Sox in Chicago over the weekend. Before Mullins’ triple broke the game open in the Orioles’ five-run fourth, Kyle Stowers hit an opposite-field double to drive home two. It was the first of three hits Stowers would tally to mark the best game of his young career. Stowers debuted with the Orioles in 2022 and made the club’s opening day roster last year, but he was later sent to the minors and his 2023 campaign was marred by a shoulder injury and a fractured nose from a hit by pitch. The 26-year-old outfielder waited patiently this spring at Triple-A Norfolk and rejoined the Orioles earlier this month. His three hits Monday tie his career-high set in September 2022 — also versus the Red Sox — while his four RBIs are the most he’s tallied across the first 57 games of his career. Mullins, Stowers and the rest of Baltimore’s bats backed Cole Irvin to earn the left-hander his fifth win of the season, tying him with Grayson Rodriguez for the team lead. Irvin pitched five scoreless innings to prove once again he’s one of the Orioles’ best starting pitchers. It was the southpaw’s first start back in the rotation after he was temporarily sent to the bullpen. He has a 2.84 ERA this season and has allowed only two runs in his past 31 1/3 innings as a starting pitcher. Jordan Westburg, Adley Rutschman, Jorge Mateo and Ryan Mountcastle also clobbered extra-base hits and drove in runs for the Orioles, who scored one in the second and third before the fourth-inning outburst and four more in the seventh. The 11 runs are tied for the second most Baltimore has scored this season. The Orioles’ bullpen was sharp behind Irvin except for newcomer Thyago Vieira , who walked three batters and allowed a bases-clearing triple to Romy Gonzalez for Boston’s lone offense of the afternoon. The eight-run victory in the series opener is the largest margin the Orioles have won by since May 5 against the Cincinnati Reds. Baltimore is 34-18 and 1 1/2 games behind the American League East-leading New York Yankees, who did not play Monday. The Orioles are 4-0 against the Red Sox (27-27) and 8-2 versus AL East foes. If they win Tuesday or Wednesday, it will mark the 18th straight divisional series the Orioles haven’t lost, a streak that dates to April 2023. This story will be updated.

        "content": "Berlin, May 27: The German government remains opposed to the idea of setting up a defensive shield from NATO territory to protect against Russian airstrikes in western Ukraine, a top spokesman said on Monday. “From our point of view, that would be an involvement, a direct involvement in this conflict. And that is something we are not aiming for,” government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said in Berlin. He also referred to statements made by German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. There have been calls from some recently for NATO powers to bolster Ukrainian air defences by establishing some sort of protective shield over Ukraine. Hebestreit did not want to comment specifically on a question as to whether and in what form Ukraine had given assurances that it would not carry out attacks on targets in Russia with the weapons systems supplied by Germany. These regulations were subject to confidentiality and had proved their worth, Hebestreit said. He also noted that international law stipulates that a state under attack can also defend itself outside its borders.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInvestors preparing for a market contraction should consider these three companies among cloud computing stocks to sell.The post 3 Sorry Cloud Computing Stocks to Sell in May While You Still Can appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Though the cloud computing sector has seen generous growth over the last five years, some analysts have wondered if the market is overvalued. However, there is no simple answer to this question, as the concept of cloud computing can refer to any number of companies that provide an offsite technical solution for customers. With the industry’s potential projected to grow to $2.3 trillion by 2032, it’s important to know which cloud computing stocks to sell and which to buy. Currently, some business analysts believe the future of cloud computing is industry-specific, meaning that the companies with lucrative niches are likely to go the furthest. It also means that companies with less adaptable and relevant business models over time are likely to suffer long-term. Thus, the three stocks mentioned in this article might have upsides in the short term but are likely to remain stable as the cloud service industry progresses. Workiva (WK) When looking at the big picture regarding Workiva (NYSE: WK ) the stock is up 56% over the last five years. This is despite its lack of profitability over the same time frame and reality might finally be catching up to it. The company’s cloud-based software is essentially a one-stop shop for financial reporting, audit preparation and risk management and has been the focal point of the hype around Workiva. There are two ways of looking at the company’s current trajectory. First, the company could be undergoing a period of price correction, as many of the cloud-based and computing-centric companies are now under the microscope due to whispers of an artificial intelligence bubble. Second, the company could be overvalued and in a generous downturn as it continually struggles to generate income . Though its software-as-a-service model can be lucrative over time, its original investors could lose patience soon. Thus, it might be best to start considering Workvia as one of the cloud computing stocks to sell. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) For a brief moment during the remote-work paradigm of the COVID-19 pandemic, it seemed like Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM ) was the future of productivity. After all, between 2020 and 2021 , nearly everyone’s remote working experience involved the company’s video call application. Yet, the reality of market saturation might be setting in for ZM stock as the company faces a stagnating market for video call software. Beyond the market slowdown, Zoom now faces major competition from established industry giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO ) with their respective Teams and Webex software. Thus, the company’s stock could be approaching another selloff wave as investors recognize its uncompetitive position. Moreover, if you were one of the investors who had initially invested in the stock during its peak run in 2020, there’s likely no chance of seeing performance like that again . These days, Zoom is a shell of its former self simply because it faces competitors who can price video call products more competitively due to diversification. Zscaler (ZS) This last pick is somewhat mercurial in terms of potential, as it relies on a very specific subset of business to prosper amidst a period of tumultuous growth. As a cloud cyber-security company, Zscaler (NASDAQ: ZS ) could have a long runway ahead of it or a slow decay. Currently, the stock commands strong buy ratings from several analysts. However, its overvaluation looms. This is based on factors such as repeated quarterly losses amidst an increasingly competitive market with competitors like Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) and Palo Alto (NASDAQ: PANW ). Moreover, Baird recently adjusted its price target from $265 to $260 . While not an excessive decrease and still representing an outperformance rating, it does signal caution ahead of Zscaler’s next earnings report. Thus, the best time to sell could be after its Q3 earnings report, should investor optimism continue to drive the stock up before a correction cycle.

        "content": "DALLAS — Nicholas Kirton scored 51 runs and Ravinderpal Singh added 41 to help Canada defeat Nepal by 63 runs in a warm-up match Monday ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Kirton slammed four fours and two sixes in his 39-ball innings. Opener Navneet Dhaliwal contributed 32 runs. Nepal, ranked 17th among T20 teams compared to No. 23 for Canada, won the toss and elected to field at the Grande Prairie Cricket Stadium. Canada finished at 183 for seven in its 20 overs and then dismissed Nepal for 120 with three balls remaining. Dillon Heyliger led the Canadian bowling attack with four wickets while Jeremy Gordon and captain Saad Bin Zafar each took two. Nepal was at 57 for one at one point, before batsmen starting falling in quick succession. The Canadians will open play at the same Texas venue Saturday, facing the co-host U.S. in the opener of the tournament that runs through June 29 in the U.S. and West Indies. Earlier this year, Canada lost a three-match one-day international series 3-0 to Nepal before defeating Nepal A 2-1 in another three-game series. Canada is scheduled to face the 15th-ranked Netherlands in a final warm-up Thursday, also in Dallas. The Canadians have been drawn in Group A with No. 1 India, No. 7 Pakistan, No. 11 Ireland and the 19th-ranked U.S. After the Americans, Canada will meet Ireland on June 7 and Pakistan on June 11, with both games in suburban New York, before wrapping up Group A play against India on June 15 in Lauderhill, Fla. The top two teams in each group move on to the Super Eights, to be played in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The two top teams from each pool in the Super Eight then move on to the semifinals in Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago on June 26 and 27, respectively. The final will be held June 29 at the Kensington Oval in Barbados. First-round matches in the U.S. will be split between Nassau County International Cricket Stadium (New York), Grand Prairie Cricket Stadium (Dallas) and Broward County Stadium (Lauderhill). West Indies, which hosted the event in 2010, will hold matches at Sir Vivian Richards Stadium (Antigua and Barbuda), Kensington Oval (Barbados), Guyana National Stadium (Guyana), Daren Sammy Cricket Ground (Saint Lucia), Arnos Vale (Saint Vincent and The Grenadines) and Brian Lara Cricket Academy (Trinidad and Tobago). The Canadians qualified for their first T20 World Cup in October, defeating Bermuda by 39 runs to win the four-team ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Americas Region Final. Canada and Bermuda both finished with 4-1-0 records with one no-result. But Canada, which lost to Bermuda by 86 runs in its opening match, won the tournament by a superior net run rate (3.98 to 2.41). The Canadians failed to qualify for the eight previous editions of the T20 World Cup, which has expanded to 20 teams in 2024. — This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 The Canadian Press",

        "content": "TEXAS: At least 21 people have been killed in a series of powerful storms that swept across the central and southern United States, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation. The storms caused deaths in the US states of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky, just north of an oppressive, early season heatwave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday after tornadoes ripped through the state. “It was a tough night for our people,” Beshear said on social media platform X, later adding in a press briefing that “devastating storms” had hit almost the entire state. The governor said “at least a few” tornadoes touched down in Kentucky over the weekend, including one that travelled on the ground for about 65km (40 miles). Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. The extreme weather system, which struck the region beginning late on Saturday, overturned vehicles and ripped up homes, leaving a wake of deadly destruction in its path. The death toll over the Memorial Day holiday weekend included at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. The deaths in Texas came after a tornado tore through the Valley View area north of Dallas, Cooke County Sheriff Ray Sappington told reporters. It destroyed homes and a petrol station, and overturned vehicles on an interstate highway. In Oklahoma, at least two people were dead after a tornado hit Mayes County late Saturday, the county head of emergency management, Johnny Janzen, told the Fox News affiliate in Tulsa. In Kentucky, the latest place left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny community of Charleston. “It’s a big mess,” said resident Rob Linton. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the Power Outage.

        "content": "OTTAWA (Reuters): Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians’ relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. “While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,” Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program’s efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said 448 Gazans had been issued a temporary visa, including 254 under a public policy, and 41 have arrived in Canada so far. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza’s population, have been displaced, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike.",

        "content": "Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/Getty Images This fall marks Tom Brady's first foray into broadcasting with FOX Sports after two years away from the game. Now as he transitions to the booth, the seven-time Super Bowl champ shared with Colin Cowherd how he'll view success as an analyst for the network's primetime games. Certainly as broadcaster, I don't think for me its about competition. I think for me it's about did I put everything I could into it and did I give the fans everything that they tuned in for. That's really how I'll end up gauging myself and I'll have to look at myself at the end of every Sunday night going, 'Did I do a good enough job? Did I live up to the expectation FOX had for me? Did I live up to the expectations of my teammates?' ... That's ultimately how I'll judge myself in that new role. Few athletes have dedicated themselves to their craft like Tom Brady has and it's hard to imagine that won't extend into his job at FOX. The network reportedly signed Brady to a 10-year, $375 million deal to call \"America's Game of the Week\" every Sunday alongside Kevin Burkhardt. It's certainly not a given that Brady ends up being an all-time sportscaster. But it also wasn't a given that he'd go from being a sixth-round pick to the GOAT at quarterback.",

        "content": "The discovery that pollution from a paper mill is contributing to the long-standing mercury poisoning afflicting Grassy Narrows First Nation is another example of widespread environmental racism, say federal MPs. The mercury contamination at Grassy Narrows dates back to the 1960s and ‘70s, when Dryden Chemical dumped roughly 10 metric tonnes of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system. The pollution has caused serious health problems for the vast majority of members of Grassy Narrows and Wabaseemoong First Nations, including neurological issues, birth defects and more. “The reality is Indigenous communities, racialized communities have to continue to suffer when corporations pollute,” Edmonton-Griesbach NDP MP Blake Desjarlais said, pointing to the Grassy Narrow’s case and Danielle Smith’s government’s RStar program that “uses tax dollars” to remediate industry’s abandoned wells. And this is not the first recent, high-profile example of environmental pollution driven by corporate interest that has impacted Indigenous communities. Last year, it came to light that local Indigenous communities including the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation were not properly notified of seepage from tailings ponds until a large spill, nine months later, brought the issue into the spotlight. Imperial Oil and the Alberta Energy Regulator say there were no impacts to the water supply or environment, but this did not assuage the fear and anxiety felt by ACFN and Mikisew Cree First Nation members, many of whom rely on fish, game and gathering out on the land. Communities have long been calling on the federal government to conduct health studies on the cumulative impacts of the oilsands development, pointing to cases of a rare bile duct cancer. Then, in late April, Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Sarnia Ont. — also known as Chemical Valley due to the more than 60 petrochemical plants in the region — measured benzene levels 424 times higher than acceptable levels. Benzene is highly toxic and a known carcinogen, used in chemical manufacturing to produce certain types of plastics. The chemical is known to cause cancers and increase rates of respiratory illness. Aamjiwnaang First Nation said elevated benzene levels in the air from the Ineos Styrolution facility caused several community members to fall ill. In response, on May 17, Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault issued a 14-day emergency interim order to the petrochemical industry in Sarnia, ordering companies to implement abatement measures to contain pollution, including fully closed vents and vapour control on storage tanks that contain high concentrations of the chemical. News of the Grassy Narrows mercury poisoning made a stir in Question Period on May 23, when NDP MP Charlie Angus called it “an unprecedented corporate crime.” “We now learn that the Dryden Fibre Canada mill has been dumping sulfates into the Wabigoon River, which has been driving the mercury crisis for a new generation,” said Angus. He asked the federal government what it will do to hold the company accountable and clean up the contamination. Liberal MP Jenica Atwin pointed to an Indigenous Services Canada project that received $57.5 million in Budget 2024 to construct a care home to offer specialized care and assisted living to people with methylmercury poisoning. “We can’t just slap a hospital or a special medicalized program that’s going to help mercury victims, it should have never happened to begin with,” Desjarlais said. “Imagine if this happened in Montreal, imagine if we dumped all of the metallurgic chemicals into the St. Lawrence, how fast, how quickly this problem will be resolved,” he added. In recent years, sulfur and organic compound discharge from the Dryden Fibre Canada mill has created a dangerous chemical reaction in the Wabigoon River resulting in high levels of methylmercury, researchers from Western University said Thursday. The levels of methylmercury — the most toxic form of mercury — in the river’s fish may be twice as high as they would be without the mill discharge, the researchers said. “We have individuals who are eating the fish that is now highly contaminated with an even worse substance than they would have ever imagined,” Desjarlais said. “These things were preventable.” Desjarlais said there are two root causes for these repeated instances of environmental racism, the first being the current neoliberal economic system, which favours free markets and deregulation. “Neoliberalism has given corporations unfettered power to act as an individual, for the better pursuit of their own interests at the cost of other people,” he said. This should be countered by giving those same individual rights of corporations to water, air and the land, Desjarlais said. “The things we rely on most for our longevity as a species should be protected,” he said. He also advocates giving greater power to Indigenous jurisdictions, referring to the fact that Indigenous lands make up 20 per cent of the world, but contain 80 per cent of the world’s biodiversity. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May also called out Alberta’s tailings pond debacle as another example of environmental racism in action. “It’s been proven now for more than a decade that the toxic chemicals from the tailings ponds are reaching the Athabasca River, which is a violation of the federal Fisheries Act, yet no charges are laid,” said May in a phone interview with Canada’s National Observer. May has a private members bill that seeks to address environmental racism. Bill C-226 is one Senate vote away from becoming law. May said it’s unclear when the vote will be held, but the bill is expected to pass. Once passed, the bill will require the federal government to examine the links between race, socio-economic status and environmental risk as well as compel the environment and climate change minister to develop a national strategy to address the harms caused by environmental racism. May hopes the passage of C-226 will “result in a meaningful change” to get us beyond just talking about the pattern of environmental pollution and racism, by identifying the responsibility of governments to protect marginalized, racialized and Indigenous communities. She looks to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental justice program — created in 1994 – as inspiration for what Canada should do. — with files from Paola Loriggio, the Canadian Press Matteo Cimellaro & Natasha Bulowski / Canada’s National Observer / Local Journalism Initiative",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — A former business associate of James Biden has agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to defraud Medicare of $51 million through a lab-testing company linked to the first brother. Keaton Langston, 39, admitted to using pharmacies, durable medical equipment companies and a laboratory in which he had a financial interest to bill for unnecessary tests and orders, the Justice Department disclosed last week in court filings. James Biden, 75, has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing and has sought to distance himself from Langston, whose father Joey Langston also was associated with the first brother. Keaton Langston founded Fountain Health, a lab company, in May 2017 and offered its services to rural hospital operator Americore Health, which later went bankrupt. Records show James Biden was involved with Fountain Health in 2017 before connecting with Americore, which provided him in $600,000 in loans in 2018 as he allegedly vowed to use his political connections to secure foreign investors . James passed $200,000 of the funds to Joe Biden in an alleged loan repayment. Shortly after the lab firm launched, Joey Langston emailed James Biden and his son Keaton and three others on July 12, 2017, about an upcoming “meeting for Fountain Health partners,” Politico reported in February. “Jim will report to the group the results of his discussions earlier today with a contact at [Blue Cross Blue Shield],” the elder Langston wrote. “There will also be discussion about how to proceed with the Union contacts that have been made by Jim and Keaton, within the last two weeks.” Paul Fishman, an attorney for James Biden, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but previously said his client “conducted himself ethically and honorably in all his business dealings.” Keaton Langston agreed in September to repay Americore $240,000 in a civil settlement. James Biden agreed in 2022 to repay Americore $350,000 . The Bidens and the Langstons have been linked financially for years. The elder Langston hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden when he was a senator, ProPublica reported . Joey Langston also loaned James Biden $800,000 , with most of the installments coming toward the end of the Obama-Biden administration in 2016, and ended up only being repaid $400,000 of the amount, he told House impeachment investigators in February. The wealthy Mississippi lawyer pleaded guilty in 2008 and was sentenced to three years in federal prison for being part of a plot to bribe a judge in an asbestos legal fees dispute. He was seeking to overturn his conviction when he made loans to the then-vice president’s son. Joey Langston’s alleged co-conspirator in the bribes case, attorney Dickie Scruggs, was involved in a second prosecution for attempting to bribe a different judge. James Biden was wiretapped by the FBI in 2007 as part of its investigation of the second bribery case, the Washington Post reported in December. James was in talks at the time with Scruggs and conspirator Tim Balducci about setting up a law firm that would have employed himself, his nephew Hunter Biden and James’ wife Sara. Then-Sen. Biden went from an opponent of federal legislation to sanction tobacco companies for lying about the addictiveness of cigarettes to a supporter after Scruggs — who planned a multibillion-dollar lawsuit — paid James Biden’s lobbying firm $100,000 in 1998, the Washington Post reported. “I probably wouldn’t have hired him if he wasn’t the senator’s brother,” Scruggs told the paper.

Scruggs also flew Joe Biden to a fundraiser on his private plane, the Washington Post reported. Joe Biden has consistently claimed he “never” discussed business with his son or brother and said in December and again in March that he “did not” interact with their partners, including foreign associates in countries where he held sway as vice president. Evidence including photos, emails and witness statements indicate that Biden actually interacted with his son and brother’s associates from two Chinese government-linked business ventures and their patrons from Kazakhstan , Mexico , Russia and Ukraine . James Biden was a partner with first son Hunter in many ventures and allegedly wasn’t always coy about the angle he was pushing to investors. “We’ve got people all around the world who want to invest in Joe Biden,” James allegedly said in the early 2000s as he and Hunter were in the process of acquiring investment bank Paradigm , according to a 2021 book by Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger.",

        "content": "In a heart-wrenching incident, a distraught dog-owner found that her much-loved pet was up for adoption nearly a year after she had made the painful decision to put him down. Kristie Pereira, 32, received a devastating prognosis for her puppy Beau from a veterinarian who suggested the pup was dealing with an incurable neurological issue predicted only to worsen over time. However, Kristie was stunned to discover him listed on the website of the pet rescue center where Beau was initially adopted, almost a year after she'd painfully decided to euthanize him. Police officer shoots and kills blind, deaf dog Teddy in the street Woman has social media in stitches over dog's strange habit Kirstie was dealt a further emotional blow when the center declined to return Beau to her. Overwhelmed with grief, she recounted: \"The person that called me was so rude and just disrespectful and just being really nasty towards me. Just saying that I abandoned him, and that I left him to die. That I never cared about him. I want him back with me.\" In late 2022, Kirstie adopted Beau, then just two months old, at a cost of $450 (£353) from the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue Foundation in Maryland, USA. Soon after adoption, Beau's health issues became evident. Initial blood tests indicated a possible liver condition and Kirstie was furnished with liver enzymes for him. When Beaus condition deteriorated, three veterinarians reached the conclusion that his impaired bowel control and hind leg mobility pointed towards a serious neurological disorder. Kirstie was slammed with a staggering $12,000 bill for tests to diagnose her puppy, Beau, with the vet warning her that there was \"there's a very slim chance of finding what is wrong\" and \"an even smaller chance\" it could be treated. After discussions with the Lost Dog and Cat Rescue team, she made the tough call to euthanize Beau, believing it to be the kindest option. Living in San Antonio, Texas, Kirstie recounted, \"After I talked to them is really when I felt that I was going to be doing the right thing by putting him down.\" \"They really gave me that support and that encouragement that, although it's hard, sometimes that's the best thing to do.\" In a heartbreaking twist, Kirstie paid just $15 for Beau's euthanasia in March last year, under the shelter's policy which prohibits owners from being present during the procedure. However, during a recent trip to Maryland to visit her mother, Kirstie was shocked to find Beau alive on the rescue's website, now healthier and larger but still recognizable by his unique markings and the name Amos Hart given by the shelter, a nod to the musical \"Chicago\". The rescue center's vets had apparently found no neurological issues and instead treated a liver condition with a $7,000 (£5493) surgery funded by GoFundMe, after which Beau was declared healthy. Kirstie, who claims she was kept in the dark about these developments, has since offered to cover the $7,000 surgery cost to reclaim Beau. Chloe Floyd, a spokesperson for the rescue, stood by their decision not to return the dog to Kirstie. She stated: \"LDCRF does not re-home an owner-surrendered dog with its former owner. Our mission is to save adoptable and safe-to-the-community dogs from euthanasia.\"",

The post Ab ki baar, 10 lakh paar is Varanasi’s clarion call for PM Modi’s election battle appeared first on Greater Kashmir.",
        "content": "Varanasi (UP), May 27: The people of Varanasi have decided that they will gift Prime Minister Narendra Modi his third-straight victory from the Lok Sabha seat with a bigger margin of votes and they have given the clarion call of ‘Ab ki baar, 10 lakh paar.’ A young BJP worker, Aditya Singh, sums up the sentiments of the people of the constituency when he remarks, “The political heavyweights who are flocking to Varanasi, actually need not do so. They are here only to mark their attendance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi does not need any campaigning. Unka naam hi kafi hai.” In the last few days, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Union Minister Piyush Goyal, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav, Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Ministers Brajesh Pathak and Keshav Maurya, along with BJP President JP Nadda have campaigned here. While these bigwigs have been interacting with students, traders, artisans, weavers etc. the people of Varanasi – on their own – are campaigning for PM Modi. For instance, the Gujarati community held rituals that lasted several days to pray for a bigger victory margin for the PM. Music recitals and dance performances by artists from across the country, particularly southern India, serve as a reminder of the Kashi-Tamil Sangamam that the PM launched in 2022 to foster a cultural connect. BJP spokesperson KK Sharma said, “Varanasi has witnessed a remarkable makeover in the last ten years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done much more than what he promised. The cultural scene is relatively vibrant. Infrastructure is better. Tourist footfall has increased manifold. The law and order has improved. It was a city that stayed indoors after dusk. Today, you will find people queuing up for the morning darshan and aarti from 2.30 A.M. onwards.” A local SP leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told IANS, “PM Modi has turned Varanasi from a domestic tourist destination to an international tourist attraction. So many Heads of State have visited the city and the footfall of foreign tourists is increasing by the day. We are contesting against him because it is a democratic compulsion but nothing actually matters when he is in the fray.” The electoral battle in Varanasi, according to locals and political experts, is not about whether PM Modi will win for a third-successive time, but whether he will increase his share of the votes polled and his victory margin and to what extent. “The people are chanting ‘10 lakh paar’ and everyone is excited to set this target for the Prime Minister this time. It will be our tribute to him,” said Lokesh Mazumdar, a local businessman adding that the people are treating the elections as a celebration of sorts. PM Modi had secured 56.37 per cent of the votes polled in Varanasi in 2014 when Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, had challenged him. In 2019, his vote share increased to 63.6 per cent. Interestingly, the number of contenders for the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat, which was 42 in 2014 and 26 in 2019, is only eight in 2024. According to the Election Commission’s website, as many as 55 people filed their nominations, but only the papers of eight contestants were accepted. He further said, “People are keenly observing the political landscape. The Congress candidate Ajay Rai, who is a part of the INDIA bloc, and BSP’s Ather Jamal Lari, are merely working to put up a decent fight. They also know that they are nowhere near the victory post.” The Opposition campaign in Varanasi is tepid. Their supporters claim that it was more vigorous in localities and nearby villages known to be supporters of the SP, BSP and the Congress. The INDIA bloc is also trying its utmost on a seat where the result appears to be a foregone conclusion. The Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi and the SP’s Dimple Yadav held a roadshow on Saturday. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi are scheduled to address a rally later this week, but though they are drawing crowds, it is unlikely to have any impact on the results. The enthusiasm and excitement in Varanasi, in fact, is bound to have a cascading impact across Purvanchal.",

        "description": "The Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays meet for the first time this season Tuesday night at the start of a three-game series at St. Petersburg, Fla., that matches a pair of clubs trending in opposite directions.",
        "content": "The Oakland Athletics and Tampa Bay Rays meet for the first time this season Tuesday night at the start of a three-game series at St. Petersburg, Fla., that matches a pair of clubs trending in opposite directions. In Oakland's 112-loss campaign in 2023, not much went right on or off the field. This season, though, manager Mark Kotsay's club is playing much better baseball and is out of last place, at least for the time being. Last week, during a six-game homestand, the American League West's fourth-place team split its six games and two series, taking two of three from the Colorado Rockies before dropping two against the Houston Astros. In Sunday's 5-2 setback in the home finale, shortstop Max Schuemann bobbled an easy two-out grounder in the fourth inning, committing two errors on the play and watching five runs (four unearned) cross the plate as the Astros went on to win the series. Kotsay said key miscues hampered his group in both defeats against Houston. \"The play is made and it's a one-run game,\" Kotsay said of Schuemann's gaffe. \"It really impacted the game. Physical errors are going to happen. Nobody is trying to go out there and make an error. Max has played a good shortstop. ... You look back on Friday's loss, we had one (bad) inning. Today, we had one inning that let the game slip away from us.\" Like the A's, Tampa Bay finds itself near the bottom of its division -- fourth in the AL East, leading only the struggling Toronto Blue Jays. Injuries have played a role in the Rays' struggles. Against Kansas City on Sunday, Brandon Lowe hit a three-run triple that helped the Rays earn a 4-1 victory to salvage the final game of the series. During their struggles this season, the Rays are finding it hard to win at home, which has not been the case during manager Kevin Cash's tenure. Entering the season, the AL East squad had a reputation for defending its turf and playing 8 1/2-inning games. Since the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, the Rays held a 176-96 mark (.647 winning percentage) at home, but this year's struggles have led to a 15-17 record including 1-5 on the current nine-game homestand. \"We're not getting it done,\" Cash said. \"Every facet of it. I mean, we're expanding on pitches that we probably can't handle. The pitches we can handle, we're not doing any damage with. We're not able to piece too much together right now. So I mean, it's kind of all-encompassing.\" In his 11th start, Rays right-hander Zack Littell (2-2, 3.42 ERA) will take the ball in the series opener. It is the first of seven matchups with the A's this season. Littell's last two starts were no-decisions against the Boston Red Sox when he combined to allow six earned runs in 10 2/3 innings with two homers. Over nine career appearances against the A's, all in relief, the right-hander is 0-0 with a 4.00 ERA. Oakland is expected to start rookie right-hander Mitch Spence (3-2, 4.09) for the first game of its six-game road trip.

        "content": "was all smiles when . The TV personality, , beamed from ear to ear as he returned to his Britain’s Got Talent presenting duties alongside close pal Declan Donnelly. The duo, who looked suave in matching navy blue three piece suits, reunited on Monday, 27 May for the first of this year’s Britain’s Got Talent live semi-final shows at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. Fans at home welcomed 48 year old Ant’s return to work with open arms and many took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to praise the TV presenter’s appearance on the ITV show. “Simon congratulating ant becoming a dad and the birth of his baby boy and he’s happy for him #BGT #Britainsgottalent,” wrote one. “Ant's first time on live TV since the birth of his child and he's happier than ever #BGT,” another added. “Simon saying congrats to ant and him having the biggest smile my heart #bgt,” wrote a third. Ant’s return to work comes just days after after welcoming Wilder into the world. As he greeted the monarch, 48 year old Dec explained that co-host Ant was unable to be at Buckingham Palace himself because he was on parenting duties - and part of that meant feeding his son. As he apologised to King Charles for his pal’s absence at the event for The Prince’s Trust, Dec, who attended the event with wife Ali Astall, joked that he “broke royal protocol” as he gave an update about his pal. After meeting the King, Dec admitted that he may have made a faux paus. He said: “I passed on Ant's apology that he couldn't be here today because he was at home breastfeeding.” With a laugh, he continued: “I don't know whether I broke royal protocol by giving that information.” The Prince’s Trust reception allowed the monarch to interact with winners of the Prince's Trust Awards as well as celebrities including Martin Freeman, Pixie Lott and Ellie Simmonds who presented awards. Speaking about the award winners, Dec said: “All the young people behind us here, some incredible stories again about people getting their life on track and making a real difference to their communities, and some incredible stories yet again.”",

        "description": "Hungary is committed to blocking a massive EU military aid package for Kiev and a new round of sanctions on Russia, FM Peter Szijjarto says Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "The European Union’s proposed 14th package of sanctions against Russia over the Ukrainian conflict goes against Hungary’s own interests, and Budapest therefore will not support it, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has said. The country is also committed to continue blocking a massive €6.5 billion (just over $7 billion) military aid package for Ukraine, despite a “ruckus” caused by fellow EU foreign ministers, he said. The senior diplomat made the remarks on Monday during a press conference in the aftermath of a ministerial meeting in Brussels. “We continue to insist on the need to make peace, to stop the senseless killing, and to prevent the escalation of this war, so we have not and will not contribute to the release of another €6.5 billion to finance arms shipments to Ukraine,” the minister stated. Szijjarto acknowledged having a “huge row” with some of his colleagues during the meeting but vowed to stand his ground in the future. “There was a huge ruckus on this, as the German, Lithuanian, Irish, Polish, and other colleagues lashed out at me on this issue, but that couldn’t sway us in our position,” he revealed. Speaking about the draft 14th package of sanctions against Russia, the diplomat confirmed Budapest is set to oppose it, as the new restrictions would hurt the country’s own interests, namely in the energy sector. Some foreign ministers of EU member states have publicly expressed their exasperation with Hungary’s stance on the Ukrainian conflict and on the bloc’s efforts to prop up Kiev against Moscow. Ahead of the meeting, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis urged the bloc to find a way to “work around” Budapest’s vetoes. “We looked into this and apparently about 41% of resolutions by the EU on Ukraine have been blocked by Hungary,” he claimed. “It has gone very, very far. We have to find a way, really, as a community to work around this,” Landsbergis added. It was not immediately clear how exactly the diplomat wanted to “work around” the Hungarian stance, given the fact that collective, EU-wide decisions such as imposing sanctions or allocating war chest money must be backed unanimously. Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib has also expressed dissatisfaction with Hungary, arguing the bloc “must absolutely assume our responsibilities and do what is necessary to help Ukraine militarily.”",

The Pune Police on Monday submitted its enquiry report in a court stating there is prima facie truth in the complaint filed against Rahul Gandhi by V D Savarkar's grand nephew who had accused the Congress leader of defaming the Hindutva ideologue in a speech made in London in 2023.",
        "content": "Pune, May 27 (PTI) The Pune Police on Monday submitted its enquiry report in a court stating there is prima facie truth in the complaint filed against Rahul Gandhi by V D Savarkar's grand nephew who had accused the Congress leader of defaming the Hindutva ideologue in a speech made in London in 2023. The report was submitted in the court of judicial magistrate (first class) Akshi Jain, said advocate Sangram Kolhatkar, who represents Satyaki Ashok Savarkar, the complainant. Kolhatkar said the court may issue a notice to Rahul Gandhi seeking his appearance. Satyaki Savarkar had said his lawyers moved the city court with a complaint under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code last April. The court had asked the Vishrambaug police to verify the proof submitted by Satyaki and submit a report by May 27. \"Vishrambaug police stated that Satyaki Savarkar had filed a complaint in the court last April accusing Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of making false claims about the late revolutionary (V D Savarkar) in a speech made in London in March 2023,\" said Kolhatkar. As per the complaint, Rahul Gandhi claimed in his speech that V D Savarkar had written in a book that he and five to six of his friends once beat up a Muslim man and he (Savarkar) felt happy. Satyaki Savarkar had said that no such incident had ever taken place, and V D Savarkar never wrote any such thing anywhere, the complaint stated, terming Rahul Gandhi's allegation as fictitious, false and malicious. \"The Vishrambaug police submitted a report today before the court and told the court that in their probe, it has been revealed that V D Savarkar had not written about such incident in any of his books but despite that Gandhi made that kind of remarks during his speech in London in March 2023 and defamed Savarkar,\" said Kolhatkar. Police stated that prima facie there is a truth in the complaint filed by Satyaki Savarkar that Rahul Gandhi had defamed V D Savarkar in his speech. When contacted Tukaram Nimbalkar, assistant police inspector, confirmed that the report had been submitted in the court. Notably, a metropolitan court in Surat last March convicted Rahul Gandhi of criminal defamation for his 2019 remark, \"How come all thieves have Modi as the common surname?\", and sentenced him to two years in jail. Subsequently, the sessions court granted him bail on April 3. The Supreme Court in August stayed his conviction in the defamation case.",

        "content": "A Massachusetts man was arrested Saturday in connection with two stabbings Saturday. Jared Ravizza, 26, of Chilmark on Martha’s Vineyard was arrested after the Porsche he was driving crashed, according to the . The crash followed an unsuccessful attempt by police to pull over Ravizza after two people were stabbed Saturday night at a McDonald’s in Plymouth, the outlet reported. The McDonald’s came after four girls between the ages of 9 and 17 were stabbed in a Braintree movie theater. Police believe the incidents are related. : Police are blocking off, shutting down the AMC in Braintree after a reported stabbing. We spoke with an employee who said multiple people were stabbed in a theater tonight. Several people reportedly rushed away by ambulance. More details to come. — Daniel Coates (@danielcoates_25) The X account identified Ravizza as a “trans activist.” An account that appeared to belong to the suspect said he is an artist who uses the pronoun “she.” A 2021 report in indicated that Ravizza was active in counseling people with disabilities. The Plymouth County District Attorney’s Office said he was arrested in Sandwich around 7:15 p.m. after the Porsche accident. Earlier, a McDonald’s employee was after a customer reached in through the drive-thru window and grabbed him, the Times reported. The suspect then stabbed a 21-year-old woman working at the McDonald’s. “Preliminary investigation suggests a likely connection to an earlier incident at a movie theatre in Braintree resulting in non-life threatening injuries to four juveniles,” the Massachusetts State Police said in a statement. According to the Times, Ravizza will arraigned in Plymouth District Court on Tuesday on charges of assault with intent to murder and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Those charges refer only to the McDonald’s incidents. The man who attacked the girls at the movie theater was “laughing the whole time,” Lisa Dembowski, the mother of three girls who were stabbed, told in Boston. Massachusetts stabbing spree suspect Jared Ravizza was ‘laughing’ during movie theater attack, mom says — Fox News (@FoxNews) “They had just sat down, they had just got their concessions. I guess he came up behind them, they were in like the second row,” she said. “He came up behind them. My oldest was leaned over to get something, he got her in the back. My other daughter in the chest. My last daughter across her arm.” Dembowski said the man stabbed their friend and left. She said the girls were . “They don’t want to go to the movies ever again,” Dembowski said. “Shaken up. They are physically fine. Kids are resilient. But I think they are terrified that they could just go to a movie on a Saturday night, and this could happen. Someone could just walk into a movie theater and someone could do this.” Dembowski said children face too many risks. “More and more this is happening, and it makes parents sick to bring their kids anywhere, or let them go anywhere without them. I absolutely feel that way,” she said. “I hope he gets what he deserves. I understand mental health. I’m a counselor. I understand it. I think it’s a pretty sick individual to harm children,” she said. Plymouth District Attorney Timothy Cruz said Ravizza was wanted for unspecified “other incidents,” according to . State Police in Connecticut reported a fatal stabbing Saturday and said the suspect was in custody in Massachusetts. We are committed to truth and accuracy in all of our journalism.",

        "description": "Friends and supporters of Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford say reports their marriage had been falling apart for months are wrong and that the TV couple's relationship broke down recently",
        "content": "The breakdown of Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford ’s marriage was very recent, their friends say. Some reports have claimed that the TV couple, who have announced they are divorcing, had been living completely separate lives since 2022. But while both have suffered immense personal challenges in recent years as they coped with bereavement, work and health issues, they have been very much living together and supporting each other until “the past few months”. Eamonn, who hosts on GB News, and Ruth who presents on Loose Women and shopping channel QVC, began this year muddling through together at their home in Weybridge, Surrey. “They did not split up two years ago, one year ago or even six months ago,” one friend said. “Their breakup has been very recent and only happened in the past few months. At the beginning of the year they were living together and working in the normal patterns, except for when Eamonn was off for reasons relating to his health. Eamonn Holmes announces new career move with glam pal, 40, after bitter Ruth split Holmes underwent surgery for back pain in October 2002 ( Image: Beretta-Sims/Raw Image Ltd) Ruth was by his side during an accident in January 2023 ( Image: Beretta-Sims/Raw Image Ltd) “To suggest that this has all been going on for years is simply wrong. It hasn’t. They have been juggling things and getting by as they have for a very long time. Their marriage broke down very recently and while it is a sad time for them both, they are absolutely determined to keep things amicable.” Friends have suggested that the idea Ruth is driving the divorce is also wide of the mark. “That’s not the case but whatever has caused them to divorce is private,” a pal said. “It is between them.” Eamonn and Ruth, who are both 64, have had a lot to contend with in recent years. His health woes and financial struggles over a tax bill have been widely reported, along with the death of his mother in 2022. Eamonn and Ruth have been married for almost 14 years ( Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) He had surgery for his ongoing chronic back pain in October 2022 but things worsened considerably when he fell down the stairs at home during his recovery and broke his shoulder. In January of 2023 Eamonn described how Ruth had been by his side at the time of the accident, caused by his legs giving way. He explained: “I was on a curve of the stairs, and I just went back down the stairs, boom, boom, boom down the whole staircase until I hit the stone floor in the hallway. “Blood was pouring out my mouth, and a bone was sticking out my shoulder. Ruth came rushing down the stairs. She kept saying, ‘You’re fine, everything’s okay, you’re fine.’ I said, ‘Ruthie, there is a bone sticking out of my shoulder — I’m not fine’.” The couple endured a four-hour wait after Ruth called for an ambulance. Eamonn and Ruth at Buckingham Palace ( Image: PA) Eamonn said: “Ruthie put a pillow under my head and sat with me in the hall and we tried to sleep.” The following month the pair were pictured out celebrating their son Jack’s 21st birthday. And by the end of 2023 they were preparing for Christmas , with Ruth admitting that Eamonn’s ongoing health challenges were something they were getting to grips with. “With any care situation – and there are millions of carers in this country – it isn’t always easy, but if something happens to somebody you love, you help them,” she told a magazine. And looking forward to this year, she added: “For 2024, I obviously hope for Eamonn that his back improves, he’s not in pain and can move around more.” Ruth appears on Loose Women ( Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock) Eamonn moved to GB News after ITV ( Image: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock) Much has been made of the couple being pictured leaving the TRIC awards in 2022 in different cars. But this, was not because they were living separate lives but because their schedules meant they needed to be in different places. Eamonn’s struggle over a tax bill ended a year ago when he lost his appeal – meaning he has since had to sell the home he maintained in his native Belfast in order to pay what was owed. For her part Ruth went through the shocking suicide of her sister Julia in 2019 and now cares for her elderly mother, who has Alzheimer’s and lives in residential care near their home. Eamonn and son Jack during a recording of Strictly Come Dancing ( Image: BBC) She has also spoken about her struggle with empty nest syndrome since the departure of son Jack, who is now 22, and lives in Manchester . Throughout all of this she has been caring for Eamonn – who at times has been barely able to walk, not only because of his bad back but because he had a double hip replacement in 2016. “Eamonn has been looked after and cared for by Ruth for a very long time,” one pal said. “How would she have been able to do that if they had not been together? It would be impossible. She has been there for him all this time, the split is a recent development not one that’s been secretly going on for years.” Eamonn has complained that ITV treated him unfairly when the pair were replaced by Dermot O’Leary and Alison Hammond on This Morning in 2020. But both have moved on with their careers – Eamonn is the regular host of GB News’ breakfast show from 6am each day while Ruth is on Loose Women. Both regularly supported the other’s ventures – he has spoken of his pride over her successful fashion venture via QVC, now in its sixth year, while she has been known to message in while he is on air to contribute.

        "description": "After his French Open first round exit Rafael Nadal has indicated he will not be playing at Wimbledon, focusing instead on a return to Paris for the Olympics.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has pledged to carry on playing as long as he is enjoying his tennis, despite a first round exit at Roland Garros at the slam he made his own, but strongly hinted he will not be playing at Wimbledon this year. Nadal said the rigours of switching to grass for the London showpiece, then reverting to clay for the Paris Olympics, would probably be too demanding given his age and recent injury issues. The 22-time grand slam champion lost in straight sets to No.4 Alexander Zverev on Monday - but showed enough flashes of brilliance to suggest he would have beaten most opponents. Having only recently returned from a near 18-month absence that has encouraged him to keep going - and to target more gold. Nadal won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and doubles gold at Rio 2016. That this year's tennis tournament will be on his favourite court, where he won 14 French Open singles titles, has further tempted him. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. However, that does mean Wimbledon, where he won in 2008 and 2010, is likely to be sacrificed. He has only competed in SW19 once in the last four years - in 2022 when he had to withdraw through injury ahead of his semi-final with Nick Kyrgios. \"It looks difficult, honestly, to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" said Nadal. \"I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, [but] I don't think it's a positive idea right now. \"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.\" Nadal, 38 next week, missed most of 2023 with a hip problem and this year's comeback was hampered by a muscle tear, then a series of minor issues affected his Paris preparation. \"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal added. \"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. \"Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. My main goal now is to play the Olympics.\" Longer term, sounding much like his old friend and rival Andy Murray who also lost in the first round in Paris, he said he wanted to carry on playing while he was healthy and having fun. And even in defeat on the clay where he had so rarely lost before, he had fun. \"If it's the last time that I played here,\" Nadal said, \"I am at peace with myself.\"",

        "description": "Martha-Ann Alito told a Post reporter in 2021 the flag was \"an international signal of distress.\"",
        "content": "LOADING ERROR LOADING The Washington Post published previously unreported details about a flag associated with former President Donald Trump ’s “Stop the Steal” movement that was flown outside Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito’s home in 2021 . On Saturday, the Post revealed it first spoke with Martha-Ann Alito, the justice’s wife, in January 2021. Alito told the Post the flag — an American flag flown upside down — was “an international signal of distress” that was present as part of a dispute with her neighbors. Advertisement That reporting corroborates a statement Justice Alito gave The New York Times, which released an investigation into the flag earlier this month. “I had no involvement whatsoever in the flying of the flag,” Alito said. “It was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor’s use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs.” According to The Washington Post, reporter Robert Barnes, now retired, first visited the Alitos’ home to report on the flag on Jan. 20, 2021 — President Joe Biden ’s inauguration day. The Alitos, who did not attend the inauguration, ran into Barnes while exiting their home, and Martha-Ann Alito shouted that Barnes should “ask them [her neighbors] what they did!” Cameron Barr, the former senior managing editor of the Post, told Semafor he decided not to run the story in 2021 “because it seemed like the story was about Martha-Ann Alito and not her husband.” The actions of the Supreme Court justices and their significant others have come under considerably more scrutiny in recent years after it was revealed Ginni Thomas, Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife, attended the Jan. 6, 2021, rally at the U.S. Capitol and made efforts to overturn Biden’s election win.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais) Following its investigation of the upside-down flag, the Times published a report on another flag embraced by far-right groups being flown outside the Alitos’ beach home in New Jersey. The “Appeal to Heaven” flag , linked to the Christian nationalist movement, flew outside the beach home in the summer of 2023. Some Democrats have asked Chief Justice John Roberts to meet “as soon as possible” to discuss the flag controversy, arguing Alito should recuse himself from Supreme Court cases relating to the 2020 election.

        "content": "MADRID: Spain has pledged 1 billion euros ($1.1bn) in military aid to Ukraine as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have signed a security deal in Madrid. The deal “includes a commitment for 1 billion euros in military aid for 2024”, Sanchez said at a joint news conference on Monday. The pact, which covers the next decade, calls for the supply of modern military equipment for ground, aerial, naval and other uses, “prioritising Ukraine’s key capacity needs”, and an emphasis on protecting sea routes for Ukraine’s food exports, but it gave no specifics. “It will allow Ukraine to boost its capabilities including its essential air defence systems to protect its civilians, cities and infrastructure, which are still suffering indiscriminate attacks as seen this weekend in Kharkiv,” Sanchez said, referring to a Russian strike on the northeastern city that killed at least 16 people at a hardware hypermarket on Saturday. Zelenskyy visited the Spanish capital as Ukraine battles a Russian ground offensive in the Kharkiv region that began on May 10 in Moscow’s biggest territorial advances in 18 months. With Russia’s full-scale invasion now in its third year, Ukraine has been pleading for more weapons for its outgunned and outnumbered troops, notably seeking help to address its lack of air defence systems. Sanchez said Spain had already pledged to supply Patriot missiles but what Zelenskyy needed from Ukraine’s allies was “the systems to launch these missiles”. In a post on the social media platform X, Zelenskyy thanked Spain for “its tangible and truly life-saving support to Ukraine in this time of war” and said he also discussed how Madrid could play a role in strengthening Kyiv’s air defences. Spain will send “another batch of Leopard tanks and above all ammunition”, Sanchez said, pledging to keep working with Kyiv “to understand how else – and with what other alternative systems – we can help ensure Ukraine’s air security”. Zelenskyy has signed bilateral security agreements with several other countries, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom. He said Ukraine needed at least seven more Patriot missile launchers to defend itself and would pressure its allies to obtain them. The president said Russian forces have used about 3,200 guided aerial bombs this month. “How do you fight that? There aren’t enough air defence missiles to stop thousands of bombs a month. ... Those partners who are afraid to give us this or that weapon should understand that air defence is defence, not offence,” he added. Zelenskyy will next visit the Portuguese capital, Lisbon, where he is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa on Tuesday and is expected to sign a similar 10-year agreement.

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: A heat wave will sweep across most of the states in the country in June, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast on Monday. “Above-normal monthly maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of the country in June, except many parts of the southern peninsular India, where normal to below-normal temperatures are most likely,” the IMD said. Above-normal heat wave days are likely over most parts of northwest India and adjoining areas of central India during the next month, the IMD forecast states. Above-normal monthly minimum temperatures are also likely across most parts of the country in June, except for the extreme northern parts of northwest India and a few pockets of east and northeast India, where normal to below-normal minimum temperatures are most likely, the IMD said. The IMD has also warned that during heat waves, vulnerable populations, like the elderly and those with health conditions, face risks of heat-related illnesses. Prolonged extreme heat strains infrastructure and leads to dehydration. Authorities must act proactively by opening cooling centres, issuing advisories, and reducing urban heat islands. These steps are crucial for protecting public health during heat waves. One has to stay hydrated, remain in an optimally cool environment, and avoid strenuous activities during peak heat hours to stay safe during heat waves.",

        "description": "Simon has welcomed baby Wilder into the BGT family.",
        "content": "Ant McPartlin ’s baby boy has already been welcomed into the Britain’s Got Talent family. The Geordie TV presenter, 48, and his wife, Anne-Marie Corbett, 46, welcomed their first child together just weeks ago. Announcing the adorable news, Ant took to social media with a cuddly snap, showing off his bundle of joy as well as a family tree tattoo on his arm. Revealing the baby’s name, he wrote to his millions of followers: ‘Welcome to the family Wilder Patrick McPartlin. Born, 14/05/24 at 8.54am. ‘Baby is beautiful, Mummy’s a legend, Sisters are over the moon. Dad’s a mess!’ The first live semi-final of this year’s BGT marked Ant’s return to work after becoming a dad, with the likes of Simon Cowell keen to congratulate him. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video During the show’s opening alongside co-star Declan Donnelly, Ant chatted to judges Simon, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, and Bruno Tonioli about the week ahead and the acts’ performances. Before the first performer took to the stage, Simon took a moment to say: ‘Can I just say congratulations to you, Ant.’ The audience then cheered as Ant graciously thanked his boss, a big smile on his face. ‘I really am happy,’ added the former X Factor judge. Ant replied: ‘And thank you for your lovely gift.’ The Saturday Night Takeaway host then joked that he was ‘still waiting’ on a present from the other judges, as the one he received was only ‘signed’ by Simon. Viewers took to X after the sweet exchange, hearts fully melted. ‘Aww Simon sent ant a gift bless’, wrote bluekittens1234. They also wrote: ‘Simon saying congrats to ant and him having the biggest smile my heart’. ‘Awwww Simon congratulating Ant!!!’, wrote ThemGeordieLads. ‘Simon congratulating ant becoming a dad and the birth of his baby boy and he’s happy for him’, wrote mlawelshwoman. ‘Ant’s first time on live TV since the birth of his child and he’s happier than ever’, added TwellyWatcher. Ant was inundated with congratulatory messages after welcoming baby Wilder, including from a plethora of fellow ITV stars. Former This Morning host Holly Willoughby commented on his Instagram post: ‘Congratulations... welcome to the world Wilder... such beautiful news... 🥲❤️’ Awwww Simon congratulating Ant!!! â¤ï ̧â¤ï ̧â¤ï ̧ #BGT Awww Simon â¤ï ̧ Awww Ant â¤ï ̧ #BGT Simon congratulating ant becoming a dad and the birth of his baby boy and heâs happy for him ð #BGT #Britainsgottalent Simon saying congrats to ant and him having the biggest smile my heart ð¥1ð¥1ðð #bgt Fellow BGT star Amanda wrote: ‘Oh my gosh, this is just the most amazing news. Congratulations.’ Alesha also said: ‘Awwwww darling I’m so happy for you both! Baby shares the same birthday as my mummy! Can’t wait to meet buba and to celebrate soon! Love you both ❤️❤️❤️’ Joel Dommett, Cat Deeley, and Scarlett Moffatt also offered their well wishes. Meanwhile, Ant’s long-time pal and colleague Dec has taken on a major role since Wilder was born. As fans probably expected, the star is godfather to the little one. Ant is also a godparent to Dec’s two children, daughter Isla and son Jack, the latter of whom has the middle name ‘Anthony’ in tribute to their friendship. Venturing into fatherhood means that Ant probably won’t appear on TV screens as much in the coming years, as he has said he wants to spend more time at home. It comes after he and Dec decided to park Saturday Night Takeaway for a while, putting the show on hiatus after its 20th series.

        "description": "Harbor Freight has a wide variety of budget-friendly tools, including heat guns. But who makes them and how many cordless options are there?",
        "content": "When it comes to budget-friendly tool deals , few names can beat Harbor Freight. The iconic store has been around since 1977 , and it's been providing quality tools at affordable prices ever since. While many people think of Harbor Freight for its wide selection of mechanic's tools , the store stocks nearly every type of gadget you can think of, from electrical devices to HVAC supplies and more. It even stocks several heat guns. These niche tools are commonly used in the automotive and electrical industries, where technicians use them for things like removing gaskets, applying shrink wrap to electrical connections, and performing auto body repairs. However, heat guns aren't limited to those industries, and you can use them for everything from working with fiberglass to removing old stickers from various surfaces. Harbor Freight sells five different heat guns. Two of those tools are made by Bauer, one of Harbor Freight's many in-house brands . Two more of Harbor Freight's heat guns are made by Hercules, another one of the store's tool lines , while the last heat gun is built by Warrior, which is, you guessed it, another one of Harbor Freight's in-house brands . The prices are what you'd expect from Harbor Freight, with the cheapest tool starting at $19.99 and the most expensive one coming in at a modest $59.99. Three of them are corded, while the remaining two are battery-powered. Let's dive in and take a deeper look. Harbor Freight's two cordless heat guns are made by Hercules and Bauer. The Bauer heat gun is the cheapest of the two and costs $39.99. It uses a 20-volt battery and is capable of temperatures up to 825 degrees Fahrenheit. The tool features an LED light to help you work in all conditions, a guard nozzle to protect your work and materials, and concentrator and deflector nozzles for fine-tune heating. The Bauer heat gun has a quick-release collar, making removing or installing attachments quick and simple, while a six-second cool downtime contributes to a longer internal coil lifespan. The tool is well-rated by customers and features 4.1 out of five stars based on 216 reviews. However, it does not include a battery or charger, and if you want to buy those items, you'll need to fork out roughly $100 more. Harbor Freight's second cordless heat gun is made by Hercules and costs $49.99 . It's also powered by a 20-volt battery and can produce temperatures up to 905 degrees Fahrenheit. The tool features high-performance coils, capable of reaching max temperatures in five seconds, a guard nozzle to protect yourself and your work, and a built-in LED light to help you see your projects in all conditions. The Hercules heat gun is also well-rated by Harbor Freight customers and features 4.2 out of five stars based on 102 reviews. Like the Bauer tool, the Hercules heat gun does not include a battery or charger. If you need to buy those items, it'll cost you around $120 extra.",

        "content": "Less than two weeks away from the annual 4H Show and Sale in Prince Albert, the main cattle barn on the city’s exhibition grounds has been destroyed by fire. On Saturday, at approximately 6:30 p.m., the city’s fire department was called to the scene. Upon arrival, heavy smoke could be seen coming from the roof and eves of the large barn. The first arriving crew gained entry through a man door to extinguish the interior fire. The crew then had to cease the interior attack due to roof trusses collapsing. Exterior cladding was removed to access and extinguish the remaining fire. The structure sustained significant structural damage. The cause is currently under investigation and there were no injuries to report. Greg Dionne, president of the Prince Albert Exhibition Association, informed paNOW the structure is insured and he’s been told by investigators that the fire was started outside the building. With respect to the upcoming 4H show, Dionne described the loss of the barn as devastating but added alternative arrangements are being made. paNOW has reached out to event organizers for comment. It’s been just over 15 since months since a horse stable on the exhibition grounds was destroyed by fire. The fire was deemed suspicious in nature. — nigel.maxwell@pattisonmedia.com On X: @nigelmaxwell",

Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 3.23 days to cover their short positions on average.

Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock.

Wayfair Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Wayfair has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted. Comparing Wayfair's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro , Wayfair's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 13.70%, which means the company has more short interest than most of its peers.

Now the parents have come under fire after the father publicly slapped his toddler in the face. The parents, Malcolm and Simone Collins, told BI they think the backlash is overstated — and racist.

Advertisement Remember the American couple who's following in the steps of the ultra-rich people who want to repopulate the world with their children? Now they're in hot water after publicly smacking one of their kids. Malcolm and Simone Collins previously told Business Insider that they're on a mission to have a litter of children because, as pronatalists, they want to \"set the future of our species.\" This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in . \"I do not think humanity is in a great situation right now. And I think if somebody doesn't fix the problem, we could be gone,\" Malcolm Collins previously told BI in 2022. The couple has done several interviews with the press in an effort to explain their objectives as a couple and speak on behalf of a burgeoning pronatalist movement . Advertisement But a recent interview the couple gave to The Guardian is getting a bad reception. The Guardian described a scene when Malcolm Collins slapped one of his toddlers in public after the child \"knocked the table with his foot and caused it to teeter, to almost topple, before it rights itself.\" \"Immediately – like a reflex – Malcolm hits him in the face,\" The Guardian's Jenny Kleeman wrote. \"It is not a heavy blow, but it is a slap with the palm of his hand direct to his two-year-old son's face that's firm enough for me to hear on my voice recorder when I play it back later. And Malcolm has done it in the middle of a public place, in front of a journalist, who he knows is recording everything.\" Malcolm Collins resumed his conversation with the stunned reporter after telling his child: \"I love you but you gotta be nice in restaurants. No, Toastie. You're going to get bopped if you do that.\" Related stories Soon afterward, the episode went viral on X — the platform owned by Elon Musk, whom Malcolm Collins was incidentally gushing over moments before striking his toddler. Advertisement \"The pro-natalist couple hits their children,\" one X user said, sharing a screenshot of the article. \"Jesus Christ the kid is two!!!! My kid is two!!!! The idea of hitting her has simply never occurred to me and if you know any two-year-olds it should be obvious how obviously nuts it is to do this!!!!\" another shared on X . In an email to Business Insider, Simone Collins said the toddler, named Torsten Savage, was intentionally acting out, and tipping over a table with glassware on top of it \"could be deadly in a house with infants\" if it were to happen at the couple's Pennsylvania home. \"He is an incredibly sweet, smart, analytic kid, but he also has a major rebellious streak and is in the middle of his twos. This is all to say that yes, 100%, Torsten was pushing boundaries and not acting unintentionally,\" Simone Collins wrote. \"Incidents in which we 'bop' our kids are unusual—usually when physical safety is at stake.\" Advertisement Over the phone, Malcolm Collins told Business Insider that he \"bopped\" his son on the nose to jar him, not to hurt him. The couple chose the punishment specifically after observing \"animal parenting models,\" he said. \"Basically, across the nose is what we aim for,\" Malcolm Collins said. \"The reason I think it's better than a slap on the wrist is because it doesn't need to be painful to have the same impact. By that, what I mean is when somebody enters the space around your face, it is very shocking and very reorienting, especially if you're in an emotional loop, which is easy for kids to get into.\" He added: \"The only way you could achieve the same effect by hitting a child's wrist is to hit it large enough to cause a significant amount of pain, which I wouldn't want to do, but I can understand why visually people might be, 'Oh, the slight hit on the nose or the face is really bad' because it looks visually bad.\" The couple both said they found the backlash they faced on social media to be racist since, they argued, minorities often hit their children without the same backlash. Advertisement \"We are kind of shocked by the racism threaded throughout this recent controversy. It is pretty well-documented that African Americans and other minority groups practice corporal punishment much more than other groups,\" Simone Collins said via email, linking to a CNN article published in 2011. Malcolm Collins said it was \"uniquely offensive\" to him considering \"the majority of Americans practice some form of corporal punishment, as you can see from the statistics with specifically that being the minority groups of Americans. So yeah, I think it's an arguably racist position.\"",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27: Cyclone Remal struck the coastal regions with wind speeds reaching up to 130 kmph, losing much of its strength as it passed over the Sundarbans, which acted as a natural shield. Several structures were destroyed, and many trees were uprooted in the coastal areas. Reports from North and South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore districts indicate extensive damage to thatched roofs, electric poles, and trees. Severe flooding affected low-lying areas near Kolkata. Authorities are still assessing the full extent of the damage caused by the cyclone. The centre of the severe cyclone landed between Khepupara in Patuakhali, Bangladesh, and Sagar Island in West Bengal. Bangladesh, located east of the cyclone’s eye, bore the brunt of the storm. Over one lakh people were evacuated to safer areas in the coastal districts of West Bengal. The cyclone brought heavy rains and tidal surges, with waves reaching one to two meters in Bengal and up to three meters in Bangladesh around midnight. According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), wind speeds reached up to 120 kmph, with gusts up to 135 kmph as the storm hit West Bengal’s Sagar Island and Bangladesh’s Khepupara area. The system is expected to move north-north-eastwards and gradually weaken into a cyclonic storm over the next few hours. The IMD bulletin at 6:30 am on Monday indicated that the system was weakening after landfall. At the time of landfall, the cyclone had maximum sustained surface wind (MSW) speeds of 110-120 kmph, gusting to 135 kmph. By 4:30 am, the MSW had decreased to 85-95 kmph, gusting to 105 kmph. The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) reported that a marine heatwave of moderate intensity impacted 38% of the Bay of Bengal basin on Friday. This unusual warmth contributed to the intensification of Cyclone Remal, although other conditions were not conducive to its further intensification. Earlier warnings from the IMD predicted extremely heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of West Bengal and heavy to very heavy rainfall in northern Odisha on Sunday and Monday. Assam and Meghalaya and other northeastern states, including Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Tripura, may receive some showers on Monday. Flights from Kolkata remain suspended and are expected to resume by late afternoon. An Airports Authority of India (AAI) spokesperson confirmed that around 400 flights, both domestic and international, will be grounded during this period. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued advisories predicting heavy rainfall and strong winds in Tripura and other northeastern states from the night of May 26 to May 29. Local administrations, along with the Indian Coastal Guard, have relocated thousands of fishermen’s families and continuously advise coastal residents to seek safer locations. Several makeshift camps have been established by volunteers and officials to provide shelter. The Indian Navy has initiated extensive preparatory actions, following Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), to ensure a robust Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) response. Two ships equipped with HADR and medical supplies are on standby to support the affected areas.",

        "content": "Loading... Loading... Broadcom's AVGO short percent of float has fallen 4.41% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 5.24 million shares sold short , which is 1.3% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.58 days to cover their short positions on average. Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Broadcom Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Broadcom has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted. Comparing Broadcom's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro , Broadcom's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.65%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers. Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

        "content": "Ottawa is developing a new artificial intelligence strategy for federal government operations, Treasury Board President Anita Anand said on May 27. “It is a big step towards a cohesive and consistent federal approach to AI,” Ms. Anand said at a meeting of AI experts in Gatineau, Que., where the strategy is being discussed. The intention is to make government operations more efficient and improve services for Canadians, while also improving capacity for science and research. Anand said the question is about how to “add greater efficiencies but also simplify the interactions of the Canadian population and organizations and businesses with federal services.” She said AI could be used to automate routine tasks, but said generative AI “isn’t generally going to be used” when it comes to confidential uses like those involving containing cabinet confidences. The effort is not about reducing the number of jobs in the federal public service, she said. The initiative will include setting up a specific division to retrain existing public servants. Ms. Anand said the government will also work on hiring “quickly and competitively” to bring in more top tech talent. In addition to Monday’s meeting of experts, the government will consult broadly in the coming months before unveiling the strategy. There is no deadline for producing the strategy. The federal government has already begun incorporating AI into its operations, using the technology in hundreds of different ways. As the largest employer in Canada, the federal government sets an example for employers in the private sector, Ms. Anand said. She said there is a need for balance when it comes to responsibly using AI, which includes ensuring that privacy laws are respected and that AI isn’t used for “discriminatory or unsavoury” purposes. The announcement came as eight more private organizations signed on to a voluntary federal code of conduct for artificial intelligence, including Mastercard, Lenovo and the Quebec real-estate brokers’ association. Adopters of the code launched last year must agree to undertake several measures aimed at reducing the risks of AI, including screening data sets for potential biases and monitoring systems for possible harms.",

        "description": "Created by The Viral Fever, Panchayat S3 is a comic satire series, directed by Deepak Kumar Mishra. Having premiered on Prime Video on May 27, the series has become an unfortunate victim of piracy.",
        "content": ", one of TVF (The Viral Fever)'s most popular shows, is also one of Amazon Prime Video's most followed Indian shows. A satirical comedy series, Panchayat follows the journey of engineering graduate Abhishek, who, unable to find a better job, becomes the secretary of a Panchayat office in a remote Uttar Pradesh village. Created by Chandan Kumar and directed by Deepak Kumar Mishra, the first season of premiered on April 3, 2020, followed by the second season on May 20, 2022. The much-anticipated third season has now premiered on May 27, 2024. The series stars Jitendra Kumar, Raghubir Yadav, Neena Gupta, Sanvikaa, Chandan Roy, Durgesh Kumar, Ashok Pathak, Faisal Malik, and Sunita Rajwar. In season 3, the plot thickens with the arrival of a new secretary and the protagonists' clash with the local MLA. Unfortunately, the new season was pirated on its release day, with reports indicating that season 3 was leaked on torrent sites such as MovieRulz, Tamilrockers, 1337x, and Telegram channels in high-definition format. This incident is part of a growing trend where movies and shows are quickly pirated upon release, despite efforts to combat these illegal activities. Even with previous attempts to block these sites and enforce restrictions, they persist, enabling the spread of piracy. Cybercrime authorities must take stronger actions against these platforms. . Returning to S3, director Deepak Kumar Mishra, who is also one of the writers, shares insights on how the story connects seamlessly with the previous seasons, ensuring long-term audience engagement. Mishra hints at spoilers, discussing how Neena Gupta’s character, Pradhan ji, faces a challenge to her position, adding an intriguing twist to the series.",

The crash happened Sunday at Silver Lake State Park Sand Dunes in western Oceana County, about 270 miles (430 kilometers) northwest of Detroit, MLive.com reported. Police said the driver of a modified Jeep CJ lost control, veered off the racing strip toward the crowd and hit another vehicle, causing that vehicle to strike 33-year-old spectator Kadie Price of Pierson. Price pushed her 2-year-old daughter to safety just before she was hit, sparing the girl serious injury or worse, police said. Price died shortly after the crash. An investigation is ongoing.",

        "description": "A nation-wide moving company that threatened to drive away with a Chilliwack, B.C., couple’s furniture, has compensated the customers nearly $1,000.",
        "content": "A nation-wide moving company that threatened to drive away with a Chilliwack, B.C., couple’s furniture, has compensated the customers nearly $1,000. In early May, Kim Jans and her husband hired Let’s Get Moving to help them move from South Surrey to their new home in Chilliwack, based on excellent feedback on the company’s website. “The reviews were absolutely fabulous,” said Jans. The couple had already moved a lot of their belongings themselves using a U-Haul, and all that was left were about 30 boxes and the heavy furniture from a two-bedroom home. Jans ordered a 26-foot truck with three workers, for $229 an hour. But on a moving day, the wrong truck arrived, one Jans figured was too small to fit all of their furniture. It took another two hours for the right one to arrive. “In the meantime, they kept loading up the wrong truck, and I kept saying to the workers ‘please stop,'” Jans told CTV News. Then she said it took the movers about five hours to load the right truck, almost twice as long as she expected. “I could just see them standing inside the truck, just standing there chatting,” she said. But the most alarming moment for the couple, came when the movers got to the couple’s new home. The workers stopped unloading the truck before it was completely empty, and presented the couple with a bill. The grand total read $3,486.53, and was about a $1,000, or four hours more than they anticipated. She said the movers wouldn’t unload the rest of the furniture, until they paid up. “When we challenged the bill, they pretty much said, ‘no this is the bill, this is the amount, and you need to pay it, or we're going to drive away with the remaining items that are in the truck,'” Jans recounted. “They hold you hostage once they get your property in their truck. You are completely held hostage,” she said. The couple felt they had no choice, and paid the bill on the spot. They filed an official complaint with Let’s Get Moving, and although the company responded almost immediately, they couldn’t agree on compensation. But when CTV News asked Let’s Get Moving for comment, Jans heard from the owner of the South Surrey franchise a few hours later. “I am deeply sorry for the mistakes that occurred,” read the email from Daniil Sychev. He also followed up with a phone call, and offered to refund the couple $961.80 for a move that he agreed “should've been done a little bit faster.” Jans found him sincere, and accepted the compensation. Sychev confirmed some movers will be getting more training, and at least one is no longer with the company. From the head office in Toronto, Let’s Get Moving representatives told CTV News that it is running a good company with excellent service and that “90 per cent of customers are very, very pleased with us.” They acknowledged that in order to get paid, movers have refused to unload furniture in the past, but that it is not company policy. “That should never happen,” said customer representative, Kelvin Anil. What remains is a settlement agreement that customers are asked to sign when they receive compensation. It states that they are not allowed to say or post any negative comments about Let’s Get Moving or “the customer specifically and IRREVOCABLY agrees to pay the company liquidated damages in the amount of $5,000.” In the end, Jans did not have to sign.",

        "content": "Watch the trailer for NCIS' Ducky tribute episode WARNING: This article contains spoilers from NCIS. NCIS season 22 will follow-up on that cliffhanger ending which put Jimmy and Jessica’s relationship in jeopardy. When season 21 ended earlier this month, Jessica Knight (played by Katrina Law) was offered a promotion working as the new REACT chief training officer at Camp Pendleton. This meant that she would have to relocate to the other side of the country and following a particularly terrifying mission, she decided to take it. Her relationship with Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen) has been a little shaky as of late and this could be the final nail in the coffin if they decide long distance won’t work for them. And now a CBS viewer has shared that this could open a door for Jimmy to get himself a new girlfriend. Read more: NCIS season 22 could see Agent Sam Hanna take over from Jessica Knight NCIS season 22 to see Jimmy find ‘someone else’ as fan predicts end of him and Jessica. (Image: CBS) Sharing their theory with the Reddit community, they wrote: “I believe that Palmer will find someone elsewhere at the office, and Jess comes back on a case to find out Palmer moved on.” They went on to add that Jessica would be “distraught” at the thought of Jimmy falling in love with someone else “but would come to accept it” if she did choose to return. If season 22 is going to start with Jessica leaving the team, then her spot as an agent would need to be filled, meaning a potential new cast member. Jessica’s particular role has always been filled in by a feisty female agent as well, from Caitlin “Kate” Todd (Sasha Alexander) and Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), to Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham).

(Image: CBS) So could it be that Jimmy will find himself in a relationship with Jessica’s replacement in season 22? Even though this theory is plausible, not everyone on Reddit seemed to be on board with the idea. In response, a fellow viewer wrote: “First NO Jess will not leave all is a plot and cliffhanger out of storyline. “Somewhere Nick will ask her ‘Are you sure? You got us and you have a family and [are] a step-mum to Victoria!’ And no Jimmy will not find someone else like people think!” Trending SUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Find out how to watch Disney+ for free. NCIS was renewed for season 22 at the end of April with the show predicted to return sometime in September. Series 21 was the shortest outing yet for the police procedural with just 10 episodes thanks to the Hollywood actors and writers’ strikes. Season 22, however, is expected to consist of around 24 episodes, which is roughly how long each NCIS series lasts for. NCIS is available to watch on CBS and Disney+.

        "content": "The global pandemic in 2020 was memorable for the TSX, particularly for . If not for and , Canada’s primary stock market index would not have ended 2020 with a 2.2% positive return. The e-commerce platform delivered a substantial 184.8% overall gain for the year. Shopify quickly became the TSX’s darling for its meteoric rise. In May 2020, it also became the country’s most valuable company, unseating the . But in a sudden twist post-pandemic, the stock plummeted. The Big Bank reclaimed the throne in 2021, and SHOP lost 74.8% in 2022. Fast forward to 2024 and SHOP is down 24.5% year to date. Also, at $77.67 per share, the total return in 3 years is -47.2%. The rise to superstardom was phenomenal but fleeting. Today, the hype is on artificial intelligence (AI), not e-commerce anymore. ( ) is the top candidate if you’re looking for the next growth star in the North. The tech stock flew under the radar when Shopify was climbing in 2020. It rose from obscurity in 2023 following a 159.8% overall return. As of this writing, the share price is $80.73 per share, a year-to-date gain of 107%. If you had invested $6,500 (222 shares) at year-end 2023, your money would be $17,835.04 in May 2024, But why Celestica? Unlike Shopify, the company never incurred losses beginning in 2020. Net income has been consistently increasing yearly in the last four years. Celestica is cross-listed in the NYSE and is slowly getting attention from American investors for its growing earnings and market-beating returns. Those who missed out on can shift to the Canadian stock. The AI stock is too pricey after topping US$1,000 recently, while Celestica is cheaper with enormous price appreciation potential. The $9.5 billion company provides supply chain solutions and products to clients in North America, Europe, and Asia. It caters to cloud-based firms, defence, and industrial companies, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Celestica is known for its engineering expertise, notably from product and test development to assembly technology. Celestica takes pride in its proprietary SpectrumPro software platform in aftermarket services and support. The customizable web-based platform is for real-time data collection and machine integration throughout the manufacturing and repair process. The Advanced Technology Solutions (ATS) segment handles the aerospace, defence, industrial, health technology, and capital equipment markets. Its second reportable segment, Connectivity & Cloud Solutions (CCS), serves communications and enterprise (servers and storage) end markets. In Q1 2024, revenue rose 20% year over year to US$2.2 billion, while net earnings jumped 312% to US$101.7 million compared to Q1 2023. The quarterly financial results were impressive, notwithstanding materials constraints that caused production delays. Management said this is a continuing risk in the mid-term, especially for high-demand components and materials. NVIDIA dominates the AI scene, but Celestica is well-positioned to garner significant market share. The Canadian firm developed the Photonic Fabric, an optical interconnect platform for AI computing and memory infrastructure. Besides the foundational technology to unleash AI advancements, the Photonic Fabric boasts sustainable and profitable business models. Celestica can match, or even better, NVIDIA’s returns.",

        "description": "Dollarama (TSX:DOL) looks like a great buy, even at these frothy levels.The post Dollarama Stock: Time to Close the Register? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "Whenever a stock surges to a new all-time high, some shareholders may naturally be inclined to ask themselves if it’s a good idea to ring the register. Undoubtedly, taking profits after a seemingly extended (perhaps even overextended rally) can be a good idea, especially if the fundamentals haven’t gotten much better since the rally began. At the time of writing, shares of Canada’s top discount retailer, ( ), are starting to get overheated. Though I’d be tempted to sell with shares near a peak, I think that who do so may stand to miss out on further performance. When it comes to taking profits, investors must realize there’s the risk of being left out of a rally’s continuation. At this juncture, I’d argue that Dollarama stock is getting a tad ahead of itself, now up more than 50% in the past year alone and over 80% in the last two years. What’s behind the boiling surge? Dollarama continues to win the business of many loyal Canadian consumers seeking super-low prices. Indeed, Dollarama’s strategy is simple and predictable. Consumers just love a good deal The company has outstanding direct sourcing deals and relationships with suppliers at home (think Canadian-branded snacks) and overseas (China and Vietnam, specifically). Such impressive relations have helped Dollarama bring in goods at incredibly steep discounts. And it’s Dollarama’s willingness to share in on the savings that’s won it such a massive following in recent years. The past four years have been really tough on Canadian consumers, with the price of everything soaring while wages are barely budging higher. Whenever the amount of money that goes out (spending) surges while the money coming in (income) stays the same, or worse, falls due to recent layoffs in the tech and financial sectors, consumers need to cut spending accordingly. Normally, it’s enough to cancel a few of those unused monthly subscriptions. But with inflation running rampant for many years now, some consumers have had to cut on utilities, food, and other necessities. Dollarama stands out to me as the best discount retailer on the continent. Why? The management team would rather keep prices as low as possible to attract repeat sales than obtain more margin from consumers. Indeed, Dollarama could charge a nickel more for any one of its already cheap goods to add to margins. In many cases, it just doesn’t. With such a focus on maximizing consumer value over padding margins, it’s no mystery why Dollarama is soaring while other discount retailers are in a slump. Indeed, Dollarama has the magic formula, which should lead to predictable earnings growth over the next seven years or so as the firm grows its unit count. Dollarama is expanding fast! The company is steadily expanding, and as it aims to open its 2,000th store in 2031, I find DOL stock will likely be trading much higher than where it is today. At the in-store level, Dollarama gets top grades for offering a slew of great, affordable products that allow consumers to fill up their baskets without going into shock once they head to checkout. The only question is whether the company can continue driving sales growth at this magnitude as disinflation or even deflation (don’t cheer for that, folks!) becomes a potential new reality a few years from now. I think Dollarama will do well, regardless of where prices, as a whole, are headed. Why? Customers know they’re getting very competitive prices (at least for goods in smaller form factors) on everything over at Dollarama. All considered, I’d rather buy DOL stock than sell it right now.",

        "description": "Coronation Street fans are convinced Sarah Barlow will lock lips with another resident on the famous ITV cobbles after she made friends with a hunky new resident",
        "content": "fans are convinced they have worked out who Sarah Barlow will fall into bed with next on the cobbles. Over the past years, the blonde bombshell’s (played by Tina O’Brien) love life has been following her separation from her husband Adam Barlow. The couple separated after she dated and fell pregnant with TV bad boy Damon Hay (Ciaran Griffiths) behind his back. After he discovered her infidelity, the couple separated with the solicitor demanding a divorce. Since then, she has had an on-off relationship with Gary Windass behind his partner Maria Connor’s back. But viewers believe the TV favourite may have set her eyes on another resident in the village. During Monday’s visit (May 27) to the ITV cobbles, Sarah was caught red-handed trying to plant evidence that could get her daughter Bethany Platt’s assailant arrested for her murder. At the start of the episode, Nathan Curtis (Chris Harper) drove past the journalist, breaking her restraining order on him. But the builder argued that he didn’t break her order because he believed she still lived in London. When Bethany reported him to the police, PC Craig Tinker confirmed that there was nothing they could do. It was at this point that Sarah decided to take matters into her own hands when she found one of Lauren’s bobbles in the Barlow family home, wrapped in strands of her hair. As she stormed over to the builder’s yard, the doting mum was caught red handed by new detective Kit Green moments before she hid the evidence. Thankfully, the newcomer was kind to the heartbroken mum and let her off with a warning as they had a heart-to-heart in his car. Before he let her go, he swiped the incriminating evidence as she insisted that Nathan was responsible for Lauren’s murder. Later on in the episode, Sarah checked in on her daughter, but her day quickly turned around for the better. Just as Sarah brought Bethany in for a comforting hug, her boyfriend Daniel Osbourne announced that her assailant had been arrested and taken away in handcuffs. It was at this point that fans flooded to X – formerly known as Twitter – to share their suspicions online. Many are convinced that Sarah will fall in love with the hunky new detective on the street in a matter of days. One user penned: “How long till Sarah starts making her bedroom eyes at Bernie’s son [cry0laughing emoji] #Corrie.” Another agreed: “I loved Adam/ Sarah together but... I like Kit & Sarah together... #corrie.” A third echoed: “Sarah will end up bedding Kit... I can sense it #Corrie” as a fourth chimed in with: “Is this the start of Sarah and the copper getting it on keep on watching [shifty eyes emoji, cry-laughing emoji] #corrie.”",

Although he was convicted in 2007 for the deaths of six women, Pickton once bragged to an undercover cop that he had killed 49 women. The remains or DNA of 33 women were found on Pickton’s pig farm in Port Coquitlam, B.C. Georgina Papin’s remains were discovered at the Pickton farm in July 2002. Stabbed a week ago with a broken-off broom handle wielded by another inmate at the maximum-security Port-Cartier Institution, Pickton lay in an induced coma in a Quebec hospital as doctors weighed whether to wake him up to see if he could survive. Bateman, who lives in Las Vegas, is party to one of several ongoing lawsuits filed by Vancouver lawyer Jason Gratl against Pickton and his brother, David Pickton, by family members of victims . Like her lawyer, Bateman believes Pickton had an accomplice. “He mentioned to authorities that other people were involved — investigators should still be looking into the allegations. I don’t feel like justice has been served completely,” said Bateman. “And I’m still going to always be trying to find the truth — more of the truth.” Gratl, representing family members of victims in nine lawsuits against the Pickton brothers, has said the potential death of the killer would have no bearing on proceedings. “Robert William Pickton’s state of health or well-being — I don’t anticipate it will have any significant effect on the progress of the civil trial,” he told The Canadian Press. A B.C. Supreme Court hearing is scheduled for June 26 to hear applications for standing in the RCMP’s bid to dispose of 14,000 pieces of evidence, mostly collected during the 18-month-long search of Pickton’s farm in 2002 and 2003. Gratl said a bigger issue than whether Pickton survives is the potential destruction of the evidence. “I act as legal counsel for 16 children of nine women who were killed by Robert Pickton,” he said. “It’s in their interest to preserve the evidence seized by the RCMP on the Pickton farm to allow my clients to prove that Robert Pickton and David Pickton caused them to suffer loss.” In 2014, the botched investigation into Pickton resulted in a settlement of $50,000 for the victims’ children who had sued all three levels of government and the RCMP. Gratl said statements by the defence, Crown and jury also “strongly suggest a shared belief that he did not act alone and others may be implicated in the deaths of the six women Robert Pickton was convicted of killing.” Bateman was raised in Las Vegas by her father’s side of the family, but was close to her mother, and stays in touch with her other surviving seven siblings, the children of Georgina Papin. She believes that what goes around is coming around for Pickton. “Karma was definitely involved. For evil people that do things like what he did, I think he definitely deserved it,” Bateman said. “We can’t forget about the victims. Even though he wasn’t charged with all of them, we can’t forget about all the other women that he wasn’t charged with.” Had she lived, Georgina Papin would have turned 60 on March 11. “I know she’d have been a great grandmother,” Bateman said, wistful for her two children who never got to know their grandmother. “We talk about her every day, like she’s still in our lives. And we sing happy birthday to her every year.” Yvette Papin was raised with her cousin, Georgina Papin, spending many happy hours with their mutual grandmother. She remembers Georgina as sweet and loving, a woman who put others first. “Georgina never had any issues with anybody at all, not even a fight or an argument. That’s just how beautiful and sweet she was,” she said. Listening to accounts of the attack that left Pickton near death, Yvette finds herself torn. “A part of me was sad but a part of me was happy — it just kind of triggered a lot of mixed emotions on what their siblings, the children are going through,” Yvette Papin said. Pickton deserves to suffer for all the suffering he caused others, she said. “I don’t wish this upon anyone, but it was expected to turn around and come back to him eventually. I don’t think he’s suffering enough. Don’t get me wrong — I don’t wish suffering on anyone, but what the women went through — I can’t imagine. I will not imagine just what they had to endure before they passed away,” she said. “This is a lot of trauma not only to the families, but to the investigators,” Yvette Papin said. “What he got was nothing compared to what he’s done to the women.” jcarmichael@postmedia.com",

        "content": "The royal family is sending their condolences. Prince William and Kate Middleton honored the death of Mark Long , a British Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot who crashed while flying a World War II-era Spitfire plane on May 25. \"Incredibly sad to hear of the news this afternoon from RAF Coningsby,\" the couple shared on X , formerly known as Twitter, the same day. \"Our thoughts this evening are with the pilot's loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family.\" Mark's death was confirmed by Group Captain Robbie Lees , who called the pilot a \"great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator.\" \"An investigation into the cause of this tragic event has now begun,\" the May 26 statement explained . \"The RAF will not be offering any comment on the accident until that investigation has concluded, and likewise, we ask others not to speculate.\" \"I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the RAF personnel and our emergency services colleagues who responded so swiftly yesterday,\" the message continued. \"Our thoughts remain with Mark's family and friends to whom we offer our deepest sympathies. We ask that their privacy be respected at this tragic and shocking time.\" The Spitfire is the most famous British fighter aircraft in history, according to the Royal Air Force Museum . It became a symbol of freedom in the summer of 1940 when it was used against German air attacks during the Battle of Britain. And it's no surprise that Kate and William professed their love and grief for the late pilot. The couple—who share kids Prince George , 10, Princess Charlotte , 9, and Prince Louis , 6—is deeply involved with the RAF. In fact, King Charles III bestowed William with the title Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps earlier this month, a title the monarch held for 30 years. Kate—who's been out of the spotlight recently after being diagnosed with cancer—was also given a new title when taking over her husband's previous role as Honorary Air Commandant Royal Air Force Coningsby in August. Now, read on to keep up-to-date with the royals. Nearly two months after the Princess of Wales went public with her cancer diagnosis, a spokesperson for Kensington Palace said the royal has no immidiate plans to return to her public-facing duties . \"The princess is not expected to return to work,\" the rep said in a May 21 statement to BBC, \"until it's cleared by her medical team.\" On May 13, King Charles III bestowed the title of Colonel-in-Chief of the Army Air Corps to his oldest son, sparking controversy as many royal watchers believed the title would be more suited for Prince Harry , who trained and served in the military branch. On April 26, nearly three months after sharing his cancer diagnosis, Buckingham Palace announced that Charles will return to public-facing duties . The queen consort attended the Royal Maundy Service on March 28 in place of King Charles III , making her the first spouse of the Monarch to continue the ancient tradition . In a March 22 video message, the Princess of Wales shared that she'd been diagnosed with cancer after undergoing abdominal surgery in January. \"It was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful,\" she said before noting that tests after the operation found cancer had been present. \"My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventative chemotherapy and I am now in the early stages of that treatment.\" After photo agencies pulled the picture Kensington Palace shared of Kate since having her abdominal surgery on March 10, the Princess of Wales addressed claims the photo was doctored. \"Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,\" she tweeted on March 11. \"I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day. C.\" Princess Diana 's niece celebrated Mother's Day in the U.K. by sharing she and her husband Michael Lewis privately welcomed their first baby. “It’s the joy of my life to be your mummy, little one. I love you unconditionally,\" she captioned her March 10 Instagram post . \"Happy Mother’s Day to those who celebrate today.\" After keeping up her full slate of engagements in the wake of her husband's cancer diagnosis, the palace cleared Camilla's schedule. The Times pointed out March 2 that the 76-year-old didn't have any engagements on her calendar until March 11, when she'd be due at Westminster Abbey to observe Commonwealth Day. The husband of Lady Gabriella Windsor and ex-boyfriend of Pippa Middleton , was found dead Feb. 25. Days later, a coroner's inquest found that he died by suicide. While King Charles III was in the hospital for his benign prostate enlargement procedure, the royal family member was diagnosed with cancer . \"His Majesty has today commenced a schedule of regular treatments, during which time he has been advised by doctors to postpone public-facing duties,\" Buckingham Palace said Feb. 5. \"Throughout this period, His Majesty will continue to undertake State business and official paperwork as usual.The King is grateful to his medical team for their swift intervention, which was made possible thanks to his recent hospital procedure. He remains wholly positive about his treatment and looks forward to returning to full public duty as soon as possible.\" The Duchess of York's rep said in a statement on Jan. 21 that Sarah was recently diagnosed with malignant melanoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer. Several months prior, she underwent a single mastectomy to treat breast cancer. On Jan. 14, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark made history as she officially abdicated the throne, handing the crown over to her son, now known as King Frederik the 10th . Kensington Palace announced on Jan. 17 that Kate Middleton underwent planned abdominal surgery and was set to remain in the hospital for 10 to 14 days. \"Based on the current medical advice,\" the Palace said, \"she is unlikely to return to public duties until after Easter.\" Amid Kate's recovery, Prince William postponed a number of engagements as he supported his family, including the couple's three children, Prince George , Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis . Shortly after Kate's hospitalization was made public, Buckingham Palace shared that Charles \"has sought treatment for an enlarged prostate.\" \"His Majesty's condition is benign and he will attend hospital next week for a corrective procedure,\" the statement added. \"The King’s public engagements will be postponed for a short period of recuperation.\" Princess Claire and Prince Felix of Luxembourg welcomed son Balthazar Felix Karl on Jan. 7, the first royal baby of the New Year!",

        "content": "Alabama football has a great opportunity in front of it win a College Football Playoff National Championship. Nick Saban’s decision to retire was probably one of the best things that happened to the Crimson Tide. Alabama gets a fresh reset with Kalen DeBoer and a hunger to prove why it remains the best program in the sport. The Southeastern Conference has done away with divisions and the Tide lost a lot to the NCAA transfer portal, but it should remain in peak position for a national title. Some feel like Alabama will suffer a major setback, but three reason are below on why the Tide win a national title? Jalen Milroe Alabama has one of the best retuning quarterbacks in college football. Jalen Milroe is back with experience and hunger. He carried the Crimson Tide to a Southeastern Conference Championship last season and returned to the CFP. Milroe earned Most Valuable Player honors in the SEC Championship Game, but he finished the 2023 season with 2,834 passing yards, 531 rushing yards, and 35 total touchdowns. The 6-foot-2, 220-pounder has worked this offseason to assure the masses he is a complete player at quarterback. He made huge strides with his passing mechanics in spring practice, and has continued to progress under Yo Murphy and Jordan Palmer training him. Milroe wants every naysayer to know that Alabama is still the measuring stick of college football. His fire, drive, and improvement as a passer should have the Tide winning a national title. Coaching staff has something to prove Kalen DeBoer and his staff want to show they can win in the SEC. They took this opportunity at Alabama for the resources, the competition, and wanting to come behind a legend in Nick Saban. Names such as Nick Sheridan, JaMarcus Shephard, Kane Wommack, Maurice Linguist, Colin Hitschler, and Christian Robinson don’t have the resumes of former assistant coaches for the Tide, but they have the energy, motivation, and teaching skills to This article first appeared on Touchdown Alabama Magazine and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "A former member of the House of Representatives Tajudeen Yusuf has ruled out the possibility of an alliance between Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar. Talks of an alliance between Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 election, and his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) counterpart Atiku gained mileage following a meeting between the duo some weeks back. Obi was Atiku’s running mate in the 2019 presidential election under the PDP before the former joined LP in the leadup to the 2023 poll. But Tajudeen does not see both working together when Nigerians head to the ballot in 2027. “They have worked together before in 2019. It would not be out of place if they work together again. I am not in their minds but I don’t see the possibility,” he said on Monday’s edition of Channels Television’s Politics Today. According to him, Atiku’s comment after the meeting and other roadblocks make an alliance between the duo a herculean task. “They met a few days ago and after the meeting, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar came out to say he will continue to contest as long as he’s alive and healthy,” the former lawmaker insisted. “To me, that was to send a signal to those, especially the media, who were running with the notion that Alhaji Atiku Abubakar might step down and shelve his political ambition for Peter. But the follow-up statement a week later clarified that.” He thinks both men may contest the poll in 2027 which makes talks of a merger difficult. READ ALSO: Obi Not Interested In A Merger Seeking Only Power, Says Tanko Also speaking on the show, a spokesman for the Obi-Datti campaign council in the 2023 election Yunusa Tanko also said his principal is only interested in a merger that will make the country better. “His Excellency, Peter Gregory is not interested in a merger that is only for the interest of seeking power. He is interested in a merger that will bring Nigerians out of the poverty level, bringing the Nigerian people to a comfortable state of health care,” he Tanko said. “Making sure Nigerians have potable drinking water; making sure the problem of power supply is being solved. “So, therefore, he is interested strongly in a merger that is driven by ideology and a programme. But if it’s only for the purpose of power, he is not interested.”",

        "content": "Clothes dipped in toxic have been sent to inmates, says a shock report into a prisoner’s death. Burglar Jamie Tate, 33, was found dead at Strangeways in Manchester in March 2021, after allegedly being supplied with some of the socks. The report by Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Sue McAllister said: “Intelligence suggested prisoners were having clothes sent into them by friends and family that had been soaked in psychoactive substances and then smoking the ripped-up fabric.” A fellow inmate had told his mum to dissolve 50mg fentanyl tablets – an opiate painkiller – in water and soak socks in it. He then gave some to Tate. The report added: “The inmate distributed it on the wing and it had led to prisoners collapsing.” Prison bosses have been warned by Ms McAllister: “More needs to be done to reduce both the supply of, and demand for, psychoactive substances.” A e for allowing inmates to get rid of their most irritating or troublemaking cellmates. The Category B prison, meaning its home to highly dangerous prisoners for whom an escape must be made very difficult, allows fellow cons to kick out misbehaving roommates by way of a vote cast during regular \"wing meetings\". Glendon Prison, in Buckinghamshire, generally only accepts well-behaved cons from other jails. The inmates must then adhere to strict rules and if they fail to do that they can be exiled from the place by their peers, If booted out, they are made to return to the jail they originally came from.",

That case goes to closing arguments on Tuesday.The host asked Christian a series of questions about Trump's ongoing trial, including one about a Truth Social post in which Trump appears to be complaining about the instructions that will be handed down to jurors before they make their decision. Those decisions are not yet public.ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy\"I want to show something he posted on Truth Social,\" the host says. \"I wonder if this gives a hint about jury instructions and what they might be. I know we haven't gotten an announcement from Judge Merchan, but I wonder if he has said something to the prosecution or defense, and I'm asking because Donald Trump said this, 'The reason the highly conflicted Judge Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is the corrupt Soros' ... so he's talking about three options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous.

        "content": "Donald Trump just dropped a \"hint\" on social media about the jury instructions in his criminal case in New York, and it shows prosecutors have a new advantage, a former prosecutor said Monday. Catherine Christian, a onetime assistant district attorney, appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump's hush money cover-up case, where he stands accused of paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels in order to impact the results of the 2016 presidential election. That case goes to closing arguments on Tuesday. The host asked Christian a series of questions about Trump's ongoing trial, including one about a Truth Social post in which Trump appears to be complaining about the instructions that will be handed down to jurors before they make their decision. Those decisions are not yet public. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy \"I want to show something he posted on Truth Social,\" the host says. \"I wonder if this gives a hint about jury instructions and what they might be. I know we haven't gotten an announcement from Judge Merchan, but I wonder if he has said something to the prosecution or defense, and I'm asking because Donald Trump said this, 'The reason the highly conflicted Judge Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is the corrupt Soros' ... so he's talking about three options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous. Is he talking about federal election crime, state election crime, tax crime as the underlying felony charge, and do you have a sense that they know what the jury instructions are going to be?\" Christian replied, \"I would hope that the defense and the prosecution know what the jury instructions are going to be since they're giving their summations tomorrow. I understand why the press and why we would all want it, [but also] why the judge didn't release it.

A “self--inflicted wound” could be to blame if Donald Trump is found guilty in his hush money trial, a former federal prosecutor told the Washington Post . Jim Walden, who is now in private practice, said the former president's constant attacks on the judge in his case — coupled with disrespect from a witness — are likely to backfire when jurors start deliberating this week. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden said. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound. \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be — a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician — he's a dumb lawyer.” Among major errors in Trump’s defense, Walden said, was calling attorney Robert Costello to the stand. Costello infuriated the judge by rolling his eyes and making snide remarks while being questioned. Judge Juan Merchan’s fury forced him to clear the courtroom to reprimand the witness. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden told the Post.

He had a good story to tell, and instead, they put the throttle right back in the prosecutor's hands.\" Trump is facing 34 charges of business fraud involving allegations that he paid adult movie star Stormy Daniels to keep quiet about a sexual relationship the two had. Closing arguments are expected in the case Tuesday, with jury deliberations following. CONTINUE READING Show less Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) will have a difficult time winning over some Republicans when she runs for re-election in a new district. CBS Colorado reporter Olivia Young spoke to Republicans in the state about which candidate they would back in the primary election later this year.

Several voters told Young that they would be backing the controversial lawmaker . \"America first, and that's what Lauren Boebert stands for,\" Douglas County Republican voter Susan Reynolds said.

Thank you for your lovely gift. Judges - still waiting on yours!\" Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight . Dec is said to have been coaching his co-star and best friend through being a dad for the first time. The pair reunited yesterday to host The Prince's Trust Awards at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London.

        "content": "( KTLA ) – Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency on a flight headed to Los Angeles from Miami on Sunday night. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” Tyson’s representatives said. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Reports that the flight was delayed due to the emergency are inaccurate, Tyson’s reps said. The flight took off two hours later than scheduled. “It’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,” his team stated. “This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” According to In Touch Weekly , the flight was also delayed 25 minutes once it landed at LAX as paramedics boarded the aircraft to tend to Tyson. This comes a little under two months before Tyson, 57, is set to return to the ring after almost 20 years. On July 20, about a month after his 58th birthday, he’ll take on 27-year-old Jake Paul in a boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix.",

        "content": "By Curtis Williams HOUSTON (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago received six bids from BP (LON: BP ), Shell (LON: RDSa ) and US shale producer EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG ) on four blocks to explore for oil and gas as its 2023 shallow water auction closed on Monday. Trinidad plans to announce the winners in four months, Energy Minister Stuart Young said at the closing of the auction. All three companies bid for the Modified UC block, which is close to the Teak, Sammaan, Poui producing fields. The auction had no other bidders. Trinidad is Latin America's largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with installed capacity of 15 million metric tons per year of the super-cooled gas. It also is one of the world's biggest exporters of methanol and ammonia, but its plants have been operating below full capacity in recent years due to a lack of gas. In October 2023 the Trinidad government put out 13 blocks for bids. Monday's results mean that nine of the 13 blocks did not receive any interest and all the bids were from companies already operating on the Caribbean island. EOG Resources bid on three blocks, the Modified UC; the Lower Reverse L, which is west of Shell's Manatee discovery and on the border with neighboring Venezuela; and NCMA 4, in an area operated by Shell. Shell had one bid on Modified UC while BP, which bid on Modified UC also placed a bid for NCMA 2 which is north of Trinidad and not in the Columbus basin where the company has operated since the 1970s. Trinidad made several changes to the fiscal terms to attract more bids after the failure of its 2019 bid round, including reducing the tax liability for shallow-water producers, raising cost recovery to 60% from 50%, cutting the windfall tax to 50% from 70%, increasing the exploration period to eight years from six years and lowering the bid fee to $30,000 from $40,000.",

        "content": "Smartphone ban for kids 'worth considering' - MPs 3 days ago Nathan Standley , Vanessa Clarke Share BBC / Ann Gannon Schoolboy Jasper says having social media is important for 'finding people you can connect with' The next government should consider proposals to ban smartphones for under-16s within its first year, a committee of MPs has said. The Education Select Committee report outlined some of the \"serious dangers\" posed to children online. Government guidance to bar phone use in schools in England earlier this year prompted a debate on how much screen time children should be having. But children's charity the NSPCC said that so far, the voices of the young people themselves had been \"glaringly absent\" from it. The report, published on Saturday, said the risks of increased screen time for children and young people significantly outweighed its benefits. Committee chairman Robin Walker said its inquiry had heard \"shocking statistics on the extent of the damage being done to under-18s\". The report found there had been a significant rise in screen time in recent years, with one in four children now using their phone in a manner resembling behavioural addiction. The report said almost all children own a phone by the age of 12, and that 79% had encountered violent pornography before the age of 18. It said the Online Safety Act, which puts responsibility on social media firms to protect children from some legal - but harmful - material, would provide some protection, but not until the law was fully implemented in 2026. The committee says that without urgent action, more children could be put in harm's way. It recommended the next government should work with the regulator, Ofcom, to... Nathan Standley",

Scottish leader, Alex Cole-Hamilton, accused the SNP and Conservative governments either side of the border of \"neglecting\" services and turning parts of the UK into \"dental deserts\". UK leader Sir Ed Davey joined him at a campaign event in North Queensferry, and predicted the Lib Dems would make gains in Scotland and become the UK's third largest party. He said his party would not form a coalition with the Conservatives, but did not rule out an agreement with Labour. \"There are lots of hypotheticals but I'm going to focus on the campaign,\" Sir Ed told BBC Scotland News. Sir Ed said electing Lib Dem MPs would help to \"send a message\" to the SNP government, who he accused of \"failing\" on NHS dentistry. Although he acknowledged dentistry was a devolved issue, the party leader said UK-wide measures, such as cutting VAT on children's toothbrushes and toothpaste, would have an impact in Scotland. He told BBC Scotland News the NHS was the biggest issue for voters north of the border. \"It is things like GPs and dentists and hospital times and cancer waiting times,\" Sir Ed said. \"And then issues like sewage and the state of the economy. \"This is an election...

        "content": "What is the Tory national service plan and how might it work? 13 hours ago Sean Seddon , BBC News Share Reuters The Conservatives have set out a plan to require 18-year-olds take part in a form of national service if the party wins the general election on 4 July. Rishi Sunak said the scheme would promote a \"shared sense of purpose among our young people and a renewed sense of pride in our country\". Labour has labelled the plan a \"gimmick\" and other parties have criticised the government for its record on cutting troop numbers. However, there is still much we do not know about how it would work. Here is the detail we have so far. What is the national service scheme? The proposed new scheme would not be conscription, where people are legally required to join the armed forces for a period. But it would compel people by law to complete a community programme over a 12-month period, or enrol in a year-long military training scheme, when they turn 18. The name is taken from the mandatory military training British men aged 17-21 had to undertake between 1949 and 1960. Then, national service meant 18 months of military training and spending four years on a reserve list, meaning they could be called up to fight at short notice. The scheme being proposed now would not force anyone to do military training, Home Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC. It would be made up of two broad streams for 18-year-olds to choose from: Community volunteering: Spending one weekend every month - which equates to 25 days over a 12-month period - volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance, search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure Spending one weekend every month - which equates to 25 days over a 12-month period - volunteering with organisations such as the NHS, fire service, ambulance, search and rescue, and critical local infrastructure...

        "content": "Mandatory national service would 'get young people out of their bubble' 1 day ago Jennifer McKiernan , BBC political reporter , @_JennyMcKiernan Share Cleverly: National service would 'address fragmented society' National service would engage young people in society again when \"too many live in their own bubble\", Home Secretary James Cleverly has told the BBC. The Conservatives have pledged that, if they win the general election, 18-year-olds will have to take part in a scheme involving military or non-military service. Mr Cleverly said it would \"address the fragmentation in society\" - but added that sending people to jail for not taking part was not being proposed. Labour said the plan was \"a desperate gimmick\" with no viable funding. Mr Cleverly told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme the move was about \"coming together\". \"Too many young people are living in their own bubble, whether that's a digital bubble or a social bubble. \"We want to get back to a situation where young people are mixing with people - in different areas, different economic groups, different religions - to try and find a way of addressing the kind of fragmentation that we see too much of,\" he said. The Conservatives say the scheme would involve 30,000 selective military placements where \"the brightest and best\" volunteers would get involved in cyber security, logistics, or civil response operations full-time for a year. Everyone else would do 25 days, or one weekend a month for a year, with... Jennifer McKiernan",

        "content": "Leaders pitch for votes on first campaign weekend 2 days ago Share John Swinney was among Scottish party leaders out on the campaign trail The leaders of Scotland's major parties have hit the campaign trail on the first weekend of the general election race. The SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats held events across the country in the early stages of the campaign. John Swinney, Anas Sarwar, Douglas and Alex Cole-Hamilton have 41 days to make their case to voters before they head to the polls. The vote will take place on 4 July after prime minister Rishi Sunak's surprise announcement earlier this week. The first minister used his event in Glenrothes, Fife, to hone in on the SNP's anti-austerity message. He accused the Conservatives of presiding over a \"punishing and damaging process\" of reduced public spending, adding only his party could exert enough influence at Westminster to ensure the policy is reversed. However, Mr Swinney denied his handling of the Michael Matheson expenses scandal threatened to overshadow his campaign. The first minister took aim at the makeup disciplinary panel that recommended a 27-day suspension after the former health secretary racked up an £11,000 charge on a parliamentary iPad during a family holiday. He said: \"We're fighting hard to win. We know we've got a challenge on our hands, it has been a tough time for the SNP but there's fresh... BBC News",

Mr Gove, first elected MP for Surrey Heath in 2005, is understood to have made the decision in the last couple of days. He is the most high-profile of the nearly 80 Conservative MPs who have stepped down ahead of the 4 July vote - alongside public health minister Dame Andrea Leadsom.

        "content": "IRELAND AM star Alan Hughes has admitted he is \"terrified of dying\" after experiencing multiple tragic family deaths. The Virgin Media star first experienced grief at just 10 years old after his parents died within six months of each other. Alan has now opened up about his grief and how the passing of his loved ones has made him \"more determined\". Speaking to the RTE Guide , the 60-year-old discussed how he was orphaned at a young age after his mum and dad both passed away. Describing the tough time, he said: \"It was a shock for all the family. She [his mother] had been unwell, so I was in her room, just lying with her and she passed.\" The popular presenter also went through a hard period when his sister Doreen passed away, just a year after he got married to his husband Karl Broderick. The Irish star recalled the first time his sister met his partner and laughed: \"When Doreen first met Karl, she said 'I really like you but if you do anything on him, I'll come and haunt you!' \"Now, when something good happens for myself and Karl I say, 'Ah they are all looking down on us.\" And Alan's brother David sadly died back in 2017 after a short battle with lung cancer. The TV host has highlighted how his siblings passing has made him \"very determined\". He said: \"When you see your sister and your brother die at a youngish age, you just want to grasp life and live it. And I've always been a glass-half-full person.\" Alan told how he \"believes there is a God\" and \"hopes there is a life after this one\". He continued: \"I hope it's where I'll meet all those family and friends I've loved, but maybe I have that hope because I'm terrified of dying.\" Separately, Alan recently enjoyed a \"fun night\" with his husband and his fans have all said they looked \"very handsome\". The popular presenter and his long-term partner Karl Broderick got married in October 2011, however they have been together for over 30 years . Alan and Karl recently attended the fashion event of the year at the Platinum VIP Style awards. The happy couple documented themselves getting ready for the event. Alan posted the fun video to his Instagram with the caption: \"Fun fun night at the @vip.magazine style awards last Friday. \"Thanks to @guyclothing in Tullamore for dressing me and @karlbroderick for the night. Thanks @luykxbianca @taradolloconnor for the invite and to @intercondublin and @nickylogue1 for the lovely stay. \"So be honest who wore it better me or Karl.\" In the video, Alan and Karl could be seen standing in white robes as they held up suit bags with their outfits in them. The famous pair then walked towards the camera with big smiles and covered it up. In the next clip, the love birds both posed in smart suits while holding up two glasses of champagne. Alan stunned in a beautiful green blazer with a black satin trim. The 60-year-old finished off the look with a clean white shirt a black dickey bow and some black tailored trousers.

        "content": "oozes confidence when she's on stage and has millions of fans around the world who look up to her. What's more, the award-winning singer's life wasn't always this way, and her personality has changed a lot since her early years too. During a rare interview, her mom, Tina Knowles, gave an insight into what Beyoncé was like as a child, making the heartbreaking revelation that she was bullied for a while. Tina also disclosed that the Texas Hold 'Em hitmaker was incredibly shy as a child. The 70-year-old told Vogue: \"Beyoncé, she was very shy and she got bullied a bit, but the day that she stood up for someone—she didn't stand up for herself she stood up for them. I'm getting emotional talking about it. I was just, I couldn't have been more proud of her.\" Tina also spoke about her other \"girls\", daughter Solange and Kelly Rowland, who she often refers to as her third daughter. She said: \"Solange, was her signing a petition in school, she was only in, like, fifth grade and she was out getting petitions signed. So she's always been an activist. \"And Kelly was always this kid that just tried to protect everybody. I have a memory of her with her best friend Barbara and her being a mediator and just being this little peacemaker.\" Tina adores her family and recently gave an insight into her grandchildren's personalities too. During a chat with E! News, she gave a rare insight into the lives of Beyoncé's twins Rumi and Sir, six, who unlike their sister Blue Ivy, 12, have kept a lower profile in their young lives so far. She said: \"Rumi is amazing—an amazing artist, painter, and creator.\" Reflecting on the twins' flourishing creativity, Tina mused, \"How could they be anything else growing up in that environment?\" She emphasized that their family life is steeped in discussions about creativity and fashion, nurturing their innate talents from a very young age. Sir, on the other hand, shares more similarities with his father, Jay-Z. \"Sir is very quiet,\" Tina noted, revealing that he gravitates more towards numbers than fashion. \"He does all of the numbers stuff, so he's not into fashion as much,\" she explained, but quickly added that Sir is \"very, very smart,\" hinting at the diverse talents the twins possess. Beyoncé shares her three children with husband Jay-Z. Despite being one of the most famous couples, they are notoriously private when it comes to their personal lives. However, in the last year, the family have been in the news more and more thanks to Beyoncé's numerous projects, from her Renaissance World Tour - which saw daughter Blue step into the spotlight and join her mom on stage - to the release of her new country music album, Cowboy Carter. During the same interview, Tina spoke of her pride for Beyoncé stepping into the country music scene, which saw her recently make history as the first Black woman to top the country charts. \"We're from Texas,\" Tina explained. \"We’ve been part of that culture for a long time, and I was very excited about it.\" She described Cowboy Carter as a \"nice history lesson\" for fans, applauding Beyoncé’s ability to educate subtly through her music. \"She has this way of doing things subtly but educating, and so I’m really proud of that,\" Tina shared.

        "content": "Indigenous leaders were in Ottawa on Monday to call on the federal government to follow through on a commitment to fund a new hospital in Moosonee, along Ontario's James Bay coast. They say the federal government promised to set aside $1.3 billion to help build the hospital, but that money wasn't included in the last federal budget. The hospital would replace a 74-year-old facility in neighbouring Moose Factory, which is Canada's oldest, non-renovated hospital. \"It's not just a building, it is a symbol of the enduring colonial legacy our people are forced to confront daily,\" said Lynne Innes, CEO of the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority, which runs health-care services in the region. The Moose Factory hospital was built in 1950 as a tuberculosis sanitorium, where children who were taken from their home communities were isolated from their families and culture. Built in 1950, the Weeneebayko hospital in Moose Factory is set to be replaced by a new regional James Bay hospital currently under construction in Moosonee. (Erik White/CBC) Because Moose Factory is on an island, patients have to be transported by helicopter to receive care. Dr. Elaine Innes, the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority's chief of staff, said patients from James Bay communities often have to travel south to Kingston, Ont., for care. \"We struggle with providing specialty services,\" she said. \"We can no longer provide obstetrical care because we no longer have the health human resources.\" James Bay health authority says 'huge surprise' in federal budget could halt hospital construction New Moosonee hospital to replace 74 year old facility in Moose Factory Moose Cree First Nation Chief Peter Wesley extended an invitation for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to visit Moose Factory and see the state of the hospital. \"There's no other hospital where you walk down the hallway and the roof is caving in,\" Wesley said. \"This would not be tolerated in any other urban community. This would not be tolerated in Ottawa. This would not be tolerated in Toronto, or Sudbury. Why do we have to tolerate it as First Nations people?\" National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak says that in 2007, the federal government committed to help fund a new hospital in Moosonee. (Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) Assembly of First Nations National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak thanked the provincial government for its support on the Moosonee hospital project, but said the federal government has fallen short. \"Now we need the feds to come back to the table,\" she said. Woodhouse Nepinak and others noted that the federal government agreed to support the new hospital in 2007, when plans were first unveiled. 'I'm not walking away from that commitment' Indigenous Services Minister Patty Hajdu previously said in the House of Commons that she remains committed to the project. \"I'm not walking away from that commitment and we will get that hospital built,\" Hajdu said. In an email to CBC News, Indigenous Services Canada spokesperson Ryan Tyndall said the federal government's 2018 budget included $158.4 million for the construction of the hospital. But Tyndall added that health care is a provincial responsibility. He said the federal government has \"significantly increased\" health transfers to the provinces to support them in delivering health care. In Ontario, those transfers went from $13.1 billion in 2015 to $20.3 billion in 2024.",

        "content": "Former Love Island stars Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury have headed off on a romantic UK break as they put on a united front following rumours that they had split Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury had shut down rumours of a split as they continue celebrating her 25th birthday. Fans had been left concerned over the pair's relationship in recent weeks, after they both jetted off away without one another. However, the pair have since put on a united front, with both Molly-Mae and Tommy sharing photos of her 25th birthday. Molly even shared a clip of Tommy surprising her with a delicious-looking birthday cake at home. And keeping the celebrations going, the former Love Island runner-ups have now headed on a romantic UK-based getaway as they and their one-year-old daughter Bambi enjoy a stay at Oxfordshire's Estelle Manor. Both Molly-Mae and Tommy have been sharing snaps and videos of their family getaway, with Tommy sharing a sweet one of Molly kissing their daughter. Sharing a photo of the lavish location, Molly-Mae quipped that she was in her \" Saltburn element \" while staying at the country estate turned hotel. Molly-Mae sweetly shared that Tommy had \"spoilt\" her with the luxury birthday getaway. After sharing a number of pics, Molly-Mae revealed that she was staying in the lavish Estelle Manor - adding that she's wanted to visit the hotel \"for so long.\" Molly and Tommy continued to share snaps of their romantic getaway, just weeks after they each jetted off abroad - with Molly heading to her sister's hen do in Ibiza , while Tommy flew to Dubai to support his brother, Tyson Fury, in a boxing match. The couple's separate holidays raised a few eyebrows, and some eagle-eyed fans quickly pointed out that they had also not been interacting with one another on social media - with Molly-Mae even failing to publicly wish her fiance a happy birthday. After arriving back in the UK the couple shut down rumours of a split when Molly shared a photo of Tommy confirming he was back at their Cheshire home . And they have since been sharing photos of Molly's birthday celebrations in which they appear as loved-up as ever. Molly and Tommy have only continued to show that they remain solidly loved-up as they make the most of the romantic getaway. Molly-Mae shared a \"special\" photo of Tommy and Bambi going for a stroll hand-in-hand. Molly then shared a sweet photo of Tommy playing croquet with their one-year-old daughter.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal was beaten by Alexander Zverev in the first round of the French Open on Sunday, with the 14-time champion giving an emotional speech to the crowd after the match",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has addressed his future after a surprising first-round defeat to Alexander Zverev at the French Open. Despite avoiding direct comments about retirement, the 14-time champion in Paris hinted that this might have been his last appearance at Roland Garros. Despite a 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3 loss, Nadal believes he \"was not that far off\" and \"had his chances\" against the world No. 4, who had recently clinched the Italian Open. \"I played I think at a good level in all ways, compared to the way that I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that. Of course disappointed for losing, but in terms of body feelings, happy that I finish healthy, you know, and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more,\" he said, before making a significant remark about his future in Paris. \"So that's it. Accept the moment. If it's the last time that I played here, I am in peace with myself,\" he said with a smile, suggesting that he may have already bid his farewell to the French Open. \"I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and the last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here, no? At least I did. I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\" Andy Murray's French Open journey ends in defeat to Stan Wawrinka as retirement looms World No. 1 Novak Djokovic candid about his struggles and modest hopes for French Open Despite the uncertain future for Nadal, one thing remains evident - the Spanish tennis ace is determined to participate in the upcoming Olympic Games, slated for Paris' iconic Stade Roland Garros. The 22-time Grand Slam champion revealed: \"I need to finish all this process. My mindset was ready 'til Olympics, you know, and then I need to check how I feel in different ways, I mean, in terms of personal motivation, body feelings, and then in terms of the level of tennis it makes sense to keep playing.\" Beginning to rediscover his form, the soon-to-be 38-year-old explained: \"For me the feeling of coming back home with the personal satisfaction to do all what's in my hands to make the things work well, give myself everything, that's the only way that I understand my life, you know.\" He further clarified. \"That's why I am not saying I am retiring today. You know, at the end, it's about not having the feeling in one year or one year and a half that, you know, I didn't give myself a chance, a real chance, you know, because immediately that I started to become a little bit healthier, I stop.\" Nadal, who is still relishing his time on the tour, expressed his desire to continue playing \"for a while\". He said: \"So in terms of what's driving me, what's the force behind driving me, I mean, as I said, I'm a simple guy. I enjoy what I do. You know, I am passionate about sport, I am passionate about competition. I like to practice, I like to play tennis. I'm in a different moment of my personal life too, traveling with my son, wife, you know. I am enjoying these moments that will not come back. \"So if I keep enjoying doing what I am doing and I feel myself competitive and healthy enough to enjoy, I want to keep going for a while. I don't know for how long, but I want to keep going for a while, because they are having fun, I am having fun, and I need to see, I need to give myself a little bit longer chances to see if my level is growing and my body is holding, and then let's make a decision.\" While he hinted at the future of his career, Nadal refrained from making any official statements. \"But give me two months till Olympics, and then let's see if I am able to keep going or I say, okay, guys, it's more than enough. Let's see. I mean, today is not a moment to analyze all these kinds of things. It's a moment just to keep going, accept the moment, and let's see what's going on,\" he concluded.",

        "content": "QNA DOHA: The Shura Council held its regular weekly session at Tamim bin Hamad Hall on Monday under the chairmanship of Speaker of the Shura Council HE Hassan bin Abdullah Al Ghanim. The council took note of the request for public discussion submitted by a host of members of the council on supporting national and foreign investment. Speaker of the Shura Council highlighted that investment is a core pillar to advance the national economy, noting the interest of the country's wise leadership in this field as stipulated in article (28) of the constitution, which underscored that the state shall ensure freedom of economic activity based on social justice and balanced cooperation between public and private activities to further achieve economic and social development, as well as increase production. The Qatar National Vision 2030 vowed in its third pillar to develop a diversified and competitive national economy capable of meeting the current and future needs of citizens and ensuring a high standard of living, His Excellency pointed out. He highlighted some impediments facing the investment sector that should be handled by exploring appropriate solutions in the implementation of the directives of the wise leadership represented by His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, underscoring the council's keenness to strengthen the economic development and drawing investment, stemming from its role as the state's legislative authority. For their part, members of the council underlined the interest of the state's wise leadership in fostering investment, in pursuit of achieving economic development through enacting laws that encourage investment and establish institutions to help support economic diversification, in addition to upgrading small and medium-sized enterprises and providing the facilitations that attract investment and encourage investors to lend impetus to the development in the state. Members of the Shura Council highlighted a range of impediments that face the investment sector and require appropriate and rapid solutions, such as unclear procedures, the complexity of licensing procedures, lack of unification, complexities of using electronic services, overlapping requirements and standards for licensing, difficulties related to investment sites and attracting professional manpower, problems in some legislation related to the labour market, as well as rise in some government fees, et al. In their remarks before the council, the members underscored the importance of optimizing labour market and investment-related laws and legislation to ensure a stable and rewarding environment, support startups, and streamline administrative and financial procedures. Upon conclusion of the discussions, the council decided to refer the request of public discussion to the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee for further perusal and submission of its report accordingly. Additionally, the council approved the request to extend the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee's works to study the draft law on job localization in the private sector. The session discussed its delegation's participation in the 14th plenary session of the Asian Parliamentary Association (APA), and its associated meetings, held in Azerbaijan in February 2024, in addition to the report of its delegation's participation in the Fourth Counter-Terrorism Coordination Meeting, convened in Vienna in October 2023. In conclusion, HE the Speaker of the Shura Council briefed the council on the participation of the Council's delegation under his chairmanship in the 36th conference of the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union (AIPU), held in Algeria on Sunday, noting the topics and issues that were of interest to the conference.

        "content": "Cleveland Guardians star José Ramírez is known for being extremely confident, so it's not a surprise he compared himself very favorably to one of the best players in MLB history. On the latest episode of the Cleveland Baseball Talk Podcast (starts at 19:05 mark), Paul Hoynes explained that he was talking to Ramírez about receiving the Barry Bonds treatment when he drew a four pitch bases-loaded walk in the top of the sixth inning of Sunday's 5-4 win over the Los Angeles Angels. \"I'm better than Barry Bonds,\" Ramírez responded. The Angels didn't give Ramírez the full Bonds treatment because Bonds' most famous walk with the bases loaded was meant to be intentional. During a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, D-Backs manager Buck Showalter ordered Bonds to be intentionally walked with two outs, the bases loaded and his team holding an 8-6 lead over the San Francisco Giants. The move paid off because Brent Mayne followed Bonds by lining out to end the game with an 8-7 win for Arizona. Ramírez's walk turned out to be the difference in the game. It gave the Guardians a 5-2 lead at the time and they held on to win for their ninth straight victory overall. It's not hard to figure out why Angels manager Ron Washington didn't want to pitch to Ramírez in that situation. The five-time All-Star is hitting .325/.388/.766 with as many homers as strikeouts (10) in his last 20 games dating back to May 5. Ramírez hit three homers in the first two games of the weekend series against Los Angeles. He was hitless on Sunday, but still got on base twice via walks, drove in a run and scored a run in the win. The Guardians have been one of the most pleasant surprises so far this season. They enter Monday with the best record in the American League (36-17). Their current nine-game winning streak is the team's longest since their AL-record 22-game streak in 2017. Ramírez doesn't quite have as many accolades as Bonds. He's still chasing his first MVP award, so winning seven of them seems like it will be out of the equation. But when it comes to active big leaguers who teams would prefer not to face in clutch situations, Ramírez is likely to be very high on that list based on his current hot streak and long track record of sustained excellence.",

        "content": "PLYMOUTH — The Chilmark man prosecutors said stabbed two workers at a local McDonald’s, then injured himself when he crashed his car during a State Police pursuit in Sandwich Saturday night, was held without bail Monday after he was released from the hospital, according to the Plymouth District Attorney’s office. Jared Ravizza, 26, is due to be arraigned Tuesday in Plymouth District Court on charges including assault with intent to murder, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon in connection with the stabbings, prosecutors have said. Officials Monday released few new details about the investigation into the attacks, which State Police and Braintree police have said may be connected to the stabbing of four girls at the AMC Braintree 10 theater at about 6 p.m. Saturday, about an hour before the McDonald’s attack. Advertisement The attacks occurred at the McDonald’s location at the Route 3 service plaza around 7 p.m. Saturday. Prosecutors said surveillance video appears to show Ravizza grab a 28-year-old man working at the drive through window, and stab him with a large knife. Ravizza then parked his car, entered the restaurant, and stabbed a 21-year-old woman who also worked there, prosecutors said. After the attacks, Ravizza got back into his black 2018 Porsche Macan and fled the scene. A witness reported the car’s plates to State Police and troopers tried to pull Ravizza over, but he wouldn’t stop, authorities said. Ravizza crashed his vehicle in Sandwich, and he was arrested by troopers and local police around 7:15 p.m., officials said. He was taken to South Shore Hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, and had remained in the hospital Sunday. The district attorney’s spokesperson did not have information about Ravizza’s attorney Monday, and no court files were available online. Ravizza is referred to using male pronouns on a professional website and in court papers. Ravizza uses “she” on Instagram. Advertisement At the McDonald’s location in Plymouth Monday, the restaurant was operating normally, with little sign of the chaos that unfolded less than two days earlier. Two managers on duty at the restaurant, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak about the event, both said that the stabbing was a “very scary” situation. They said the two employees who were injured in the stabbing had been discharged from a hospital and were in stable condition, and declined to provide any further details. In an emailed statement Monday, Mark McBee, a McDonald’s Franchisee who owns and operates several McDonald’s restaurants in the region, said he was grateful to law enforcement for their quick response to the stabbing incident at the restaurant. “We are shocked and devastated by this senseless act of violence,” McBee said. “The safety of our crew and customers is always our top priority.” McDonald’s did not provide further details about the health condition of the workers. On Sunday, Lisa Dembowski — the mother of three of the girls injured in the theater attack — said the girls were fine physically, but remained terrified following their ordeal. Dembowski’s twin 9-year-olds were injured, along with her 17-year-old and their friend. Dembowski criticized AMC staff for failing to immediately respond to the stabbings, and said employees initially didn’t believe the girls were stabbed. Her oldest daughter was the one who called police for help, she said. Advertisement “I give her an enormous amount of credit, because in my mind ... her and her friend kept the two little ones completely calm,” Dembowski said. AMC Theatres, in a statement sent Monday, said the company was saddened by Saturday’s “senseless act of violence,” and are reaching out to the girls’ families privately. The company said it has started a review of the incident. “Based on theatre associate accounts and video footage, the theatre team jumped into action immediately, calling emergency services and administering aid to the victims,” the statement said. “A visible security presence will be in place at this location for the immediate future.” Saturday’s stabbings came about six weeks after Ravizza attacked his father in their West Tisbury home, according to court filings. Ravizza was charged with assault and battery on a family or household member, and the case was directed to pretrial diversion. His father said Ravissa had suffered a “mental break” and attacked him, according to a police report on file at Edgartown District Court. West Tisbury police took Ravizza to Martha’s Vineyard Hospital for a mental health evaluation, but Ravizza “did not meet their standards to be held,′′ the police report said. The hospital is part of the Mass General Brigham system, and a spokesperson declined to answer questions Monday about Ravizza’s evaluation due to patient privacy laws. Along with the stabbings, Ravizza was sought by law enforcement for “other incidents,” according to the Plymouth district attorney’s office, which did not provide additional details. Advertisement Connecticut State Police said a suspect sought in connection with a fatal stabbing in the town of Deep River had been arrested by Massachusetts authorities Saturday. The agency on Monday declined to provide further details or say on Sunday whether there was a connection between Ravizza and the Connecticut death.

        "content": "The Esan South East Local Government Council of Edo State, led by Hon. Louis Imhandegbelo has been given kudos for being the first local government council in the state to pay the new minimum wage of N70,000 to workers. The council’s implimentation of the new minimum wage has drawn widespread jubilations across the length and breadth of the local government area. The council workers were seen singing and dancing on Monday at Ubiaja, the council headquarters, praising governor Godwin Obaseki soon after receiving the month of May salaries. Some of them were said to have been dumbfounded on receiving the unexpected bank alerts reflecting the newly established N70,000 minimum wage in Edo State from their various banks. Governor Godwin Obaseki in his speech on May 1st, 2024, to mark this year’s workers day announced N70,000 new minimum wage for Edo State workers which was paid this month by the state government. The development has garnered accolades both within and beyond the borders of Nigeria. The chairman of Esan South East Local Government Council, Louis Imhandegbelo while expressing his gratitude to Governor Godwin Obaseki said, “today, May 27, 2024, my council has paid the new minimum wage to workers and praises should go to God and the governor who believed that the workers were no longer getting things easy since the removal of fuel subsidy by the Federal government”. “As you can see, upon receiving their May salaries, which reflected the new wage structure, the workers are very happy and are jubilating, I asked them to continue to pray for the governor to end his tenure successfully”. Hon. Imhandegbelo however affirmed his commitment to fostering policies that enhance workers satisfaction, promote community development, and bring joy to the people of Esan South East.",

        "content": "The Nigerian Army, on Monday, confirmed the immediate reopening of the popular Abuja Banex Plaza following an understanding between the authorities, plaza management and traders’ association. The plaza had been shut for over a week following a mob attack on some personnel of the Nigerian army by unidentified hoodlums on May 18. This is contained in a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Maj.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on Monday in Abuja. Mr Nwachucku said a high-level meeting was convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser including the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, Commissioner of Police FCT and the FCT Director of the Department of State Services. Others on the panel, according to him are the Leadership and Management of Banex Plaza, a Representative from the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the National Chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders Association. He said the primary objective of the meeting was to identify and apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the continued security of the Federal Capital Territory. “The following resolutions were agreed upon: Immediate reopening of Banex Plaza to the public and the leadership of Banex Plaza is instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect. “The owners of the shop who orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers are to be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. “Market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. “Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action. “The Nigerian army will also thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack,” he said. Mr Nwachukwu reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel were not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order. He urged members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. According to him, there are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities. “It is imperative that these channels are utilized to maintain order and respect for those who serve and protect our nation. “The Nigerian army remains committed to ensuring safety and security of all citizens and will continue to work diligently to prevent such incidents in the future,” he added.

        "content": "COMMUTERS can see a refund automatically issued to their account as part of a $450 million benefits package to frequent toll road users. The program is running for the second year in a row and run until early next year. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis brought the state's Toll Relief Program back to reward commuters with SunPass or other state transponders who frequently use toll roads. The Sunshine State is allocating $450 million in funds to reward commuters in hopes of easing the financial burden of commuting. \"That is a way for us to provide relief for folks, given that we’ve been in this inflationary period,\" said DeSantis, quoted by FOX affiliate WTVT . \"You’ve got groceries and all these other things.\" Last year, the program reportedly saved 1.2 million drivers a total of $500 million in toll fees . Each driver then saved around $400 a year, thanks to the program. \"Every little bit helps,\" a driver said on camera. Patty Shay, who told the outlet she crosses over a toll road on an average of four to five times a day, said she'd be excited to see a discount come her way. \"I'd be more than happy to get a reduction on the tolls,\" she said. For Shay, it wasn't just the tolls that made commuting costly. \"The gas adds up,\" she said. \"The tolls add up. I can’t even tell you how much I spend in tolls over a month. It’s quite a lot.\" Therefore, drivers like Shay who cross a toll road more than 35 times per month can expect to see a rebate coming in May. The program starts this week and will run until March 2025. Last year when the program was announced, users had mixed feelings about the parameters for drivers to meet the discount. \"So, someone who drivers through 34 tolls a month is going to purposely go through a toll to get the rebate,\" a viewer of the announcement wrote. Another viewer was thankful for the relief, even if it was small. \"Every little bit helps in today's economy,\" they wrote. \"Thank you, Governor DeSantis!\" Other drivers, though, disagreed with tolls. \"You know what, they need to take the tolls out and just make them straight roads,\" wrote a viewer. Someone else made light of the situation with some backhanded humor. \"Next they're going to make us pay to walk in the parks,\" they said.",
