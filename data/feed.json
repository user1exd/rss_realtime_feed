        "content": "Autism is often a huge challenge for a family. About 85% of children diagnosed before age 5 will never be able to live independently as adults. This increasingly common developmental disorder is expressed by problems socializing and communicating, and repetitive and restrictive behaviors. A recent study reported by UC San Diego Today shows how digestion affects brain development. “Behavior and metabolism are linked – you cannot separate them,” says Robert Naviaux, professor in the Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics and Pathology at UCSD School of Medicine. There are large differences in the metabolic profiles of kids who are neurotypical and those who develop autism. UCSD researchers investigated 50 separate biochemiocal pathways. They found that “14 were responsible for 80 percent of the metabolic impact of autism,” according to UC San Diego Today. “The pathways that were most changed are related to the cell danger response, a natural and universal cellular reaction to injury or metabolic stress. “The body has biochemical safeguards in place that can shut down the cell danger response once the threat has passed, and Naviaux hypothesizes that autism occurs when these safeguards fail to develop normally. The result is heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and this effect contributes to sensory sensitivities and other symptoms associated with autism.” There’s been a dramatic increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism — now clinically referred to as ASD, autism spectrum disorder — since the 1960s. In the 1980s, quacks and personal injury attorneys attributed the growing number of autism diagnoses to childhood vaccinations. Bogus lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers were so costly that some lifesaving vaccines became unavailable. Congressional action in 1986 ended that emerging public health crisis. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program shielded pharmaceutical companies from these lawsuits. The public has since paid the bill — about $5 billion! — any time a jury awards compensation to a “victim” of vaccinations. So, if not vaccines, what accounts for the large rise in ASD? Most of the change is due to greater awareness of the diseases that are now grouped together as autism spectrum disorder. It was not until 1994 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) categorized autism as a spectrum; and not until 2013 that the term autism spectrum disorder was coined, combining what had been a variety of diagnoses. According to autism researcher Christina Corsello of the University of North Carolina, “Those revisions have allowed us to capture and include children who might have more mild difficulties, more subtle difficulties and less comorbid cognitive delays or intellectual disability.” In the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the percentage of Black children diagnosed with ASD. Almost all of that can be attributed to better awareness among physicians and more widespread access to autism specialists. “As recently as 2010, white kids were deemed 30% more likely to be diagnosed with autism than Black children and 50% more likely than Hispanic children,” according to a 2023 Associated Press article. These numbers have largely reversed. “The new estimates suggest that about 3% of Black, Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander children have an autism diagnosis, compared with about 2% of white kids,” according to the AP story. Genetics plays a large role in autism . But another important factor in whether a child will be diagnosed with ASD is maternal obesity. “Compared with children whose mothers were at normal weight, children born to overweight and obese mothers have a 28% and 36% higher risk of developing ASD, respectively,” according to a 2016 study published in Nature . Americans are much more likely to be overweight or obese now than they were in the 1960s. According to a 2011 CDC study, in 1960-62, 24% of white women had a body mass index greater than or equal to 27.3, putting them in the overweight category. That rose to 46% during 2005-08. For Black women, the numbers rose from 42% overweight or obese (1960-62) to 66% (2005-08). “Based on data collected between 2017 and 2020, 41.9% of adults in the U.S. have obesity,” Forbes Health reported earlier this year. Children born to mothers who are obese and diabetic are “more than four times as likely to develop autism compared to children born to normal weight mothers without diabetes,” according to research published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Even though autism does not present itself when a baby is born, there is increasing science that the disorder starts in utero. During the second trimester of a pregnancy, organization of the cortex begins. Autopsies of autistic children who have died reveal patches of disorganization in the cortex, harming cells that are needed for learning and memory. “So something must have gone wrong at or before that time,” Eric Courchesne, director of the Autism Center of Excellence at UCSD, told NPR. In a neurotypical child, the cortex will have six distinct layers, each composed of a specific cell type. However, in kids with ASD, Courchesne says, “there are patches in which specific cells in specific layers seem to be missing.” Rather than distinct layers, the brain cells appear as disorganized collections. Going forward, researchers hope to find effective treatments that, if given before symptoms appear, will perhaps fix the cortex, prevent autism or reduce its severity. That gets back to the research done by Dr. Naviaux and his colleagues, including Chelsea A. Kelland and Judy Van de Water at UC Davis. They are studying the use of a drug called suramin. When a child’s cell danger response malfunctions, they hope suramin can repair the body’s adenosine triphosphate (ATP) signals, eliminating an autistic child’s heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli. At the same time, if we can tackle the obesity epidemic, we’d make a lot of progress in reducing ASD. — Rich Rifkin is a Davis resident; his column is published every other week.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged there was a “tragic mistake” after an Israeli strike killed dozens of people in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. In a speech before parliament on Monday, he said Israel was investigating the strike that occurred the night before. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below. TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told Italy's SKY TG24 news channel. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list on Monday after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury in the Braves' 8-1 win at the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday. After opening the game with a double, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt. His left knee gave way when he stopped in an attempt to return to second base. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña's second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL on July 20, 2021 . Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases, becoming the first player to have at least 40 homers and 70 steals in a season. The 26-year-old from Venezuela was hitting .250 with four homers, 15 RBIs and 16 steals this season. The Braves recalled outfielder J.P. Martinez from Triple-A Gwinnett and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Catcher Sean Murphy, who suffered a strained left oblique muscle on March 30, was activated from the injured list. AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief has warned Tehran has enough enriched uranium for “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.",

        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — The number of heat-related howler monkeys deaths in Mexico has risen to 157, the government said, with a tragically small number of the primates treated or recovering. A heat dome — an area of strong high pressure centered over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America — has blocked clouds from forming and caused extensive sunshine and hot temperatures all across Mexico. Last week, environmentalists had reported that 138 of the midsize primates, known for their roaring vocal calls, had been found dead in the Gulf coast state of Tabasco since May 16. Almost two-thirds of the country are expected to see highs of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday. Late Sunday the Environment Department reported that number had risen to 157, and that research was continuing into the causes of the deaths. But a wildlife biologist on the scene said it appeared to be heat stroke. The department said deaths were occurring in both Tabasco and the neighboring state of Chiapas, and that 13 monkeys were under treatment and seven had been treated and released back into their habitat. The department said some of the monkeys were being treated for dehydration, and that three were in serious but stable condition. Moreover, with heat, fires, and deforestation hitting the trees where the howler monkeys live, it was unclear whether even releasing them could ensure their survival. Wildlife biologist Gilberto Pozo attributed the deaths to a “synergy” of factors, including high heat, drought, forest fires and logging that deprives the monkeys of water, shade and the fruit they eat, while noting that a pathogen, disease or other factor can’t yet be ruled out. Normally quite intimidating, howler monkeys are muscular and some can be as tall as 90 centimeters (3 feet), with tails just as long. Some males weigh more than 13.5 kilograms (30 pounds) and can live up to 20 years. They are equipped with big jaws and a fearsome set of teeth and fangs. But mostly they’re know for their lion-like roars, which bely their size. There have also been reports from Mexico's southeastern states of birds being affected by the heat. With below-average rainfall throughout almost all the country so far this year, lakes and dams are drying up , and water supplies are running out . Authorities have had to truck in water for everything from hospitals to fire-fighting teams. Low levels at hydroelectric dams have contributed to power blackouts in some parts of the country.",

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea's state media said a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded in mid-air on Monday. State media said the explosion was possibly caused by engine failure. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story is below: North Korea launched a rocket likely carrying its second military spy satellite on Monday night, hours after its announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center in the northeast at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket” during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, and at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. “We know that there are at least four families this morning that have suffered the loss of a loved one less than 24 hours ago that are hurting,” Beshear said. “And we ought to rally around them and do everything we can to carry them.” The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in Cooke County, Texas, from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" More than 600,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were without power Monday morning, including more than 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to PowerOutage.us . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. Storms killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday. To follow the progress of the storm system, see The Associated Press Tornado Tracker . Schreiner reported from Louisville, Kentucky.

        "content": "Håfa Adai! Especially during this period of visitor industry recovery, it is incumbent upon anyone with a stake in our inter-island economy to practice, preserve, and promote our priceless CHamoru culture. Our very livelihoods depend upon it. Our 4,000-year-old language and way of life are not only Guam’s chief differentiators as a destination of choice, but “i kottura” is literally and figuratively the breadbasket of the whole Marianas archipelago and has always attracted visitors to Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. The ancient, adventurous, pioneering aspects of espiritun CHamoru have also drawn more outdoorsy types into the CNMI’s “Northern Islands” district, including the likes of Agrigan, Anatahan, and Pagan islands. These ancient haunts are either uninhabited or sparsely inhabited and largely untouched by human contact. Way up north is where CHamoru and Carolinian survival skills are taught in an atmosphere of “trial by fire” and put to the most demanding test! But nowhere is our CHamoru heritage more inviolably retained and ingrained than in i islan Luta, the island of Rota, the southernmost landfall of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. And to the Guam Visitors Bureau’s everlasting delight, Rota is the Northern Mariana Island that sits closest to the U.S. territory of Guam. We have good reason to be enamored by our neighbor to the north. Unblemished Rota, once known as “Zarpana,” is the trifocal glass through which we most profitably behold, filter, and practice the CHamoru arts. Above all other Mariana Islands, including Guam, in many ways Rota is the ultimate keeper of the CHamoru identity. This is true from the practical everyday rhythm, depth, and authenticity of its indigenous people’s spoken vernacular to their culturally intrinsic, sustainable use of the island’s unspoiled flora, fauna, land, and surrounding seascape. So, imagine our delight when Rota Mayor Aubry Hocog stopped by the GVB offices a little over a month ago, just to learn a few marketing and promotional ideas by picking up some collateral materials and asking our marketing division for tips. Are you kidding me? We should’ve been asking Mayor Hocog for advice on cultural authenticity! When I learned of her visit, I joined the meeting right away and was deeply moved by Mayor Hocog’s humility as well as her passion for breathing fresh new life into Rota’s economy. This soon led to our familiarization tour of the Friendly Island earlier this month. Local historian, guide, and cultural practitioner Ben “Guelo” Rosario led the tours, along with his brother, Antonelli “Ton” Rosario from the Historic Preservation Office, and David Santos, an accomplished Rota native who works for the CNMI’s Governor’s Office. All three of these capable gentlemen were magnanimous, knowledgeable, kind, and hospitable. Mayor Hocog’s right hand, Dina Songao, also made sure we were all taken care of and performed an abundance of legwork and logistics for our itinerary. The Department of Fire and Emergency Medical Services even accompanied us on every outing to make sure we were safe. We thank everyone for an insightful, hazard-free, enjoyable trip! Our Guam contingent toured Rota’s historical and natural hotspots, including the scenic I’Chenchon Park Bird Sanctuary and Alaguan Bay, the ancient Mochong latte stone village, the coastal Agusan Swimming Hole, and the largest banyan tree in the Marianas. We experienced nighttime crab catching and deer hunting and took in traditional customs, cuisine, artwork, music, and dance. Sustainable “spot-only” fruit bat hunting and catch-and-release coconut crab hunting are promising pastimes in Rota, since there are plenty of local experts who can monetize these activities for visitors. Imagine how rejuvenated a city-weary Japanese couple would feel setting ponne or tåhu coconut baits, then returning with flashlights to pick up crabs before midnight, or walking the reef flats looking for lobsters under cover of darkness. This is eco-tourism at its most basic level. It’s exhilarating, cost effective, sustainable, and lucrative. These kinds of activities could grow into a cottage industry for families in Rota. Southern Guamanians take note! We received red carpet treatment and first class hospitality every step of the way from the neighborly Rota community, inclusive of many businesses operating there. Star Marianas Air, TJ Enterprises, Kin & Rit, Inc., Tan Holdings Corporation, PJM Enterprises, As Paris Restaurant, Puesto Grill, Tokyo En Restaurant, Calvo Enterprises, Inc., Blue Palms Dive Service, and Rota Cave Museum all treated us as welcome guests. Although the island features a few small hotels and a handful of restaurants, some guest amenities are closed indefinitely due to the economic hardship of late. Be that as it may, home-owning locals are more habituated to growing, preparing, and consuming fresh “whole food” delicacies and traditional living in Rota, anyway. What’s more, Friendly Islanders are delighted to share the fruits of their bounty with visitors who discover the calming allures of Rota’s Sinapalo and Songsong villages, the verdant magnificence of its Wedding Cake Mountain (Mt. Taipingot), or the mystery of the “never excavated” largest capstones ever discovered in the Marianas, at As Nieves Latte Stone Quarry. GVB sends its sincerest gratitude to the people of Rota for hosting us and showing us the incredible natural beauty of their glorious island and all the special ways i taotao ginen Luta take care of it. Extra shout-outs to Mayor Hocog’s staff, Sen. Donald Manglona, the Rota Municipal Council, Rota Chamber of Commerce, Marianas Visitors Authority, CNMI Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, and the CNMI Department of Land and Natural Resources. As many of you know, I am a born-and-bred “wartime Guam” CHamoru who grew up learning the rich Marianas traditions of hunting, fishing, farming, ranching, cooking, and social gathering from elders who knew our way of life before the three-year Imperial Japanese occupation and Battle of Guam. Our forebears trebled their survival instincts and traditional methods of living with the innate CHamoru trait of adaptability, so their children could thrive on the other side of war without forgetting their roots. Although Rota was occupied, farmed, and excavated by Imperial Japanese interests mostly during the last few seasons of the Land of the Rising Sun’s 30-year reign over the Northern Marianas, the island itself was not a major WWII battleground. Nor was it a primary launching pad for U.S. military maneuvers that turned the Pacific Theater to America’s advantage. Rather, Hispanicized CHamoru prewar life was arguably less disturbed during and after “war and occupation,” due to limited battle-era engagement. And this is an abundant blessing to Saipan, Tinian, and Guam. For it is my humble but informed opinion that Rota soon became the living, breathing institution of our least-touched “CHamoru culture intact,” and remains precisely that to this very day. Therefore, Rota deserves special attention among our most ardent efforts to carry on the traditions of yore through every modern or ancient means within our grasp. With each of us, let the renaissance begin – whether it be in the simple act of smiling and waving at more of our fellow guests and passers by, just like Friendly Islanders are famous for doing, or devoting more of our time to language learning and cultural immersion. In fact, certain leaders from Rota have expressed a heartfelt desire to formalize culture camps to teach Guamanians more about the prewar ways that have endured on that 1,800-person island in spite of the modernization that has swept over all of Micronesia since the Second World War. And bula taotao ginen Luta (many people from Rota) are eager for their island to become an optional tour for Guam’s growing number of visitors. I say, “na’i animu!” What blesses one, blesses all. GVB welcomes the challenge. The traditional prewar arts of talåya fishing, hunting, gathering, palm frond weaving, “hotnu” oven baking, animal husbandry, and preserving the CHamoru cookbook are worth every effort to practice and perfect. We should also continue to do our utmost to retain and preserve artifacts, even if doing so sometimes entails the reclamation and return of treasures lost to outside interests. GVB’s familiarization tour of the “Friendly Island” of Rota served as a stark reminder of how critical the rapidly evolving “One Marianas” mission must remain in the months and years ahead. It was a wakeup call for Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guam – the permanently inhabited islands of the Marianas archipelago that depend on a thriving visitor industry to keep standing on our own feet – that we must rely on one another for solutions and support in the development of new air routes, refurbished attractions, and reopened guest quarters. Fascinating as our Friendly Island exchange was for everyone involved, it was also a subtle admonition that the consistent practice, preservation, promotion, and presentation of our generous CHamoru folkways must be the glue that holds us together as a people. The shocking reality of U.S. armed forces and military contractors hardening defenses across the Marianas and Micronesia is necessary for the protection of our shared liberty. It is also a cultural invasion that comes at a steep price. And it will be up to island people to ensure that our cultures stay intact.",

        "content": "One game was the difference-maker for the top spot in this week's ESPN WNBA Power Rankings. And for the first time in over 650 days, a team other than the or is No. 1. The beat the 83-82 in overtime Tuesday. Combined with the Aces' loss to the , Connecticut -- the lone unbeaten team in the WNBA -- moves to the No. 1 spot. The top two teams in our preseason rankings -- the 2023 champion Aces and runner-up Liberty -- have lost home games already, which few would have predicted. Chelsea Gray's absence (foot injury) is one of the things that has kept the Aces from being their best, while the Liberty have looked really good at times -- and really out of sync other times. The Sun have proved they don't have to be atop any particular statistical category to top the WNBA standings. But the categories they lead -- free throws made (20.6 per game) and attempted (24.6) -- illustrate how aggressive the Sun are. The Lynx, meanwhile, have won every other game this season. Minnesota leads the league in field goals made (33.0), field goal percentage (47.0), 3-point percentage (38.6), assists (24.4) and steals (11.8). And that helps make Wednesday's Lynx-Aces matchup in Minneapolis one of the most anticipated games of this week. Las Vegas or New York ranked first every week of ESPN's 2023 Power Rankings. Up until this week, the are the most recent team outside of the Aces or Liberty to lead the rankings, in August 2022, the final week of that regular season. | 3 vs. PHO (May 28), vs. DAL (May 31), @ ATL (June 2) Nothing stopped the Sun last week. They held off upset-minded Indiana by four points, beat surging Minnesota by one in overtime and then got past Chicago on the road by four, despite star being ejected in the third quarter after a hard foul on Sky rookie . led Connecticut with a combined 61 points in the three victories, which included the winning free throws in the OT victory. 4 vs. LV (May 29), vs. PHO (May 31), vs. DAL (June 2) It's not too late to play! Sign up now for Fantasy Women's Basketball and start your championship run. The Lynx were a basket away from the top spot in the Power Rankings, but they suffered a tough 83-82 overtime loss at Connecticut on Thursday. But despite that defeat and the indefinite loss of second-year player (knee injury), Minnesota's top draft pick last season, the Lynx got back-to-back wins Saturday (New York) and Sunday (Atlanta). had a big day Sunday with 31 points, making her first nine shots from the field. joined the Lynx after finishing her overseas season; she had eight points and eight rebounds in the weekend games. This week brings a big three-game homestand. 1 at MIN (May 29), at ATL (May 31) The Aces lost just one regular-season home game last year, plus the Commissioner's Cup final. Both of those were in August. So we weren't expecting an Aces loss in Las Vegas so early in the 2024 season. But the Aces' defense let them down in Tuesday's 98-88 loss to Phoenix. Coach Becky Hammon said it would be a good wake-up call for the two-time defending champions, and they responded Saturday with a blowout win over Indiana. After starting with four consecutive home games, the Aces play four of their next five on the road. Check out the top fantasy players in the WNBA on Saturday, including big performances from A'ja Wilson, Breanna Stewart and Arike Ogunbowale. 9 @ CON (May 31), @ MIN (June 2) Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers. • • • The Wings made a big jump in the Power Rankings by winning two of three on the road last week. They started with a loss at Atlanta on Tuesday but bounced back with weekend victories at Phoenix and Los Angeles. Guard scored 24, 40 and 20 points in the three games. Her 19-point fourth quarter against the Mercury is the highest-scoring quarter this season by a WNBA player. Second-year pro also had her two best back-to-back games: vs. the Mercury (22 points, 9 rebounds) and Sparks (15 points, 8 rebounds). And is making the Sparks regret waiving her just before the start of the season. She had 18 points, 12 rebounds and 4 assists against Los Angeles and is averaging 15.3 PPG and 8.5 RPG. 5 @ CON (May 28), @ NY (May 29), @ MIN (May 31), vs. LA (June 2) Tuesday's victory at Las Vegas was the Mercury's highlight last week. The biggest frustration? Giving up 107 points at home in Saturday's loss to Dallas. Kahleah Copper leads the WNBA at 29.2 PPG, and seems to have turned back the clock a bit as she's at 19.0 PPG. The Mercury eagerly await the return of center from a toe injury, but overall, they've had a good start without her. 2 vs. PHO (May 29), vs. WAS (May 31), vs. IND (June 2) After a 4-0 start to the season, the Liberty had a rough week. They lost at home to Chicago and at Minnesota. New York was outrebounded in both games, while was held to single-digit scoring in each while shooting 38.5% overall. For as good as the Liberty have looked at some points this season, they really don't seem in sync at others. Maybe three games at home this week will help. Check out the top performers in fantasy WNBA on Thursday, including big performances from Napheesa Collier, Breanna Stewart and Angel Reese. 7 @ CHI (May 28), @ IND (May 30) The Storm beat two teams they were \"supposed\" to beat last week -- Indiana and Washington at home -- but wins are wins, especially for a team trying to build chemistry with the additions of and . was key in the Storm's tight 85-83 victory against the Fever, with 32 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists. In a 32-point blowout of the Mystics, five Storm players scored in double figures as Seattle shot 61.7% from the field. Diggins-Smith (16 points) had a season-high nine assists. 8 vs. SEA (May 28), vs. LA (May 30), at IND (June 1) First-year coach Teresa Weatherspoon's Sky are off to a much better start than most were predicting. Their victories were on the road against 2023 playoff teams (Dallas in week 1 and New York this past week) and both losses were by single digits against playoff teams (Dallas, Connecticut). Guard leads the way with 19.3 PPG, 7.0 RPG and 5.5 APG. Rookie is the Sky's top rebounder (7.3 RPG) and second-leading scorer (12.3). She took a hard foul from Connecticut's (who was ejected) on Saturday and got right back up. Reese wants to improve her shooting percentage (35.7) but overall is doing well. Angel Reese scores 13 points and grabs nine boards in the Chicago Sky's 90-81 victory over New York Liberty. 6 @ WAS (May 29), vs. LA (May 31), vs. CON (June 1) The Dream went 1-1 last week -- they beat Dallas and lost to Minnesota -- and just got passed by other teams to drop three spots in the Power Rankings. That happens a lot over the course of the season as teams with similar talent jockey for position in the standings. (2022 No. 1 pick) is off to a strong start, leading Atlanta in scoring (21.0) and steals (2.8). Vets , and are also averaging in double figures. 12 vs. LA (May 28), vs. SEA (May 30), vs. CHI (June 1) The Fever got their first win (78-73 at Los Angeles on Friday) and their first look at the two-time defending champion Aces (99-80 loss in Las Vegas on Saturday). They have played the most games of any WNBA team and looked weary at Vegas. It's another busy week for the Fever, but all three games are at home. leads in points (15.4), assists (6.3) and steals (1.1); she and fellow guard (14.0 PPG) are starting to jell. Veteran center -- whose energy has been a lift to the Fever -- moved into the starting lineup at Vegas. And had her best game of the season at Los Angeles. Check out the top performers in fantasy WNBA on Friday, including big performances from Caitlin Clark, Dearica Hamby and Temi Fagbenle. 10 @ IND (May 28), @ CHI (May 30), @ PHO (June 2) The Sparks have just the one victory -- last Tuesday vs. Washington -- but three of their losses are by single digits. So there are positive things for Los Angeles to look at despite the record. Over the weekend at home, the Sparks lost to Indiana by five points and Dallas by one. Rookie had a combined 36 points in those games and leads the WNBA in blocked shots (3.2 BPG). She and teammate will face two other high-profile rookies this week in Clark (for the second time) and Reese. 11 vs. ATL (May 29), @ NY (May 31) There was little doubt this could be a challenging season for the Mystics, with Elena Delle Donne not playing and leaving as a free agent for Phoenix. Things got worse with the May 17 injury to guard (ankle). And in Saturday's 32-point loss at Seattle, the Mystics also were without center (not with team, personal reasons). This is Washington's worst start since losing its first eight games in the 2007 season. It's not all gloom: The Mystics' first five losses were all by single digits, and they've played four of their first six games on the road.",

        "content": "SAN MARCOS, Texas ( KXAN ) — At 104 years old, Ernie Columbus could be called a thrill seeker — especially after his latest adventure taking to the skies. We found the WWII veteran in San Marcos, Texas, as he geared up for his second-ever skydiving trip. “I don’t remember doing this the last time,” Ernie said as the instructor strapped on some new devices. Ernie served in the Army during WWII. After the war, he moved over to the Air Force to serve out the remainder of his 26-year military career. In that time, he never skydived, but now he said he’s hooked. “I just decided I was going to jump, and that was it,” Ernie said. Ernie was paired with instructor Victor Krusi for the jump, who says tandem jumping gives almost anyone the opportunity to go skydiving. “It is much easier now with tandem skydiving,” Krusi said. “We just strap you to someone who is very, very, very experienced.” Ernie says he enjoyed every second of the free fall, but especially the view from so high up. “I could see everything around, and the guy back there was talking to me and I was all tied up to him,” Ernie said. Nexstar’s KXAN asked Ernie if he would be jumping again anytime soon. “Someone asked me if I was going to do it again and I said, ‘I don’t know,’ but I think if the opportunity comes up, I may just do it,” said Ernie. Ernie says if he does jump again, he would like to do it on his 107th birthday.",

        "description": "He was just signed three days ago to serve as a depth infielder for the club.",
        "content": "The Braves announced a series of roster moves Monday, reinstating catcher Sean Murphy from the injured list and recalling outfielder J.P. Martínez . In corresponding moves, outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. was placed on the 10-day injured list and infielder Joey Wendle was designated for assignment. Wendle, 34, was just signed three days ago to serve as a depth infielder for the club. However, Atlanta was delivered a devastating blow yesterday when Acuña tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He will undergo surgery and miss the remainder of the 2024 season. With Acuña out of the picture, Atlanta was left with just Michael Harris II , Jarred Kelenic and Adam Duvall for the outfield. They have recalled Martínez today to give them a fourth outfielder, which quickly nudged Wendle off the roster shortly after being added. Atlanta will now have a week to trade Wendle or pass him through waivers. The Mets are on the hook for the majority of his $2M salary since they released him last week. That means any club that brings him aboard would only have to pay the prorated league minimum for any time spent on the roster, with that amount subtracted from what the Mets pay. Wendle has had some good years as a solid bat who can competently play multiple positions, but he’s been in a rough skid at the plate for a while now. He hit just .259/.297/.360 in 2022 for a wRC+ of 84 and has been even worse since then. Dating back to the start of 2023, he’s hit .213/.247/.300 for a wRC+ of just 47. But he’s still capable of bouncing around the diamond, with experience at the three infield positions to the left of first base and the outfield corners. Even without much offensive output, he’s capable of being a glove-first bench piece. He also hit .275/.330/.416 from 2017 to 2021, 106 wRC+, which could lend some hope to a bounceback at the plate. For the moment, Atlanta’s roster depth is tenuous, and it wouldn’t be a surprise if further moves were coming. Murphy’s activation gives the club three catchers, alongside Travis d’Arnaud and Chadwick Tromp . The club could have optioned Tromp to the minors but perhaps felt that would have left them thin behind the plate. Murphy is just returned from missing around two months due to an oblique strain while d’Arnaud missed some time this week after taking a foul ball to the mask and experiencing some dizziness. Perhaps the Braves opted to keep Tromp around while they make sure both Murphy and d’Arnaud are healthy enough to play regularly. In the meantime, that leaves them with no real backup infielder. Austin Riley hasn’t played in about two weeks due to some side soreness, but the club hasn’t placed him on the injured list. That has forced Zack Short to step in as the regular third baseman. As of now, Atlanta’s bench consists of Riley, two catchers and one outfielder, at least until Riley is able to return. Perhaps Tromp will be optioned out for another infielder shortly, or Riley will return to the lineup and nudge Short back to the bench. How the club decides to play the outfield will also be interesting to monitor. Kelenic and Duvall have been in a platoon this year, since Kelenic is a lefty who hits better against righties and Duvall is the opposite. Kelenic has hit .220/.298/.401 against righties in his career but just .189/.254/.309 against lefties, leading to respective wRC+ numbers of 96 and 60. Duvall has hit .235/.307/.474 against southpaws and .230/.285/.468 otherwise, producing respective wRC+ tallies of 104 and 95. With Acuña’s injury, they will likely give regular playing time to those two, with Martínez in the fourth outfielder role. The 28-year-old Martínez was acquired from the Rangers in January. He has a line of .265/.337/.394 in Triple-A this year, 90 wRC+, stealing 14 bases in 20 tries. Double-digit steal totals have been a regular feature for him for a long time, including 41 in the minors last year. He also hit .298/.418/.543 in Triple-A last year, for a 133 wRC+, but hasn’t maintained that here in 2024. Like Kelenic, Martínez hits from the left side and has been better against righties this year. He has a .260/.348/.415 line against righties and .277/.306/.340 against southpaws this season.

For Peter Hum's story 0528 tvo kids Photo by Lovina Peres / POSTMEDIA Article content Ariana Ibit, a 16-year-old who lives in Orléans, calls herself a super-fan of the TVO show All-Round Champion. The award-winning half-hour-long series features young athletes like Ariana coming together to learn and compete in each other’s sports with the hope of becoming the titular champion. Article content “We loved watching,” says Ariana, which isn’t surprising since her parents are athletic, while she has pursued a range of sports from gymnastics to volleyball to field hockey to curling to touch football to swimming to tennis to track and field. In 2022 and 2023, Arian was named athlete of the year at St. Peter Catholic High School. Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Activate your Online Access Now Article content Meanwhile, Michael Peres, a 16-year-old who lives in Kanata, had not heard of the show. The Holy Trinity Catholic High School student was too busy focusing on soccer, which he has been playing since he was five or six. Both teenagers wound up among the cast of athletes appearing in the sixth and latest season of All-Round Champions, which launches Wednesday at 5 p.m. Ariana says she was in disbelief when she learned last year that her application to appear on the show had been accepted. She is this season’s beach volleyball expert. Michael was essentially recruited for the show, but not as a soccer star. He quickly became an expert in Teqball, a sport that’s a cross between soccer and table tennis. The teenagers spent all of last fall making the show, based in Hamilton and Toronto, continuing their schooling online while undergoing their athletic odyssey. Nine other athletes from as far as Kamloops, B.C., Texas and England were part of the show. Between them, the young athletes covered beach volleyball, teqball, pickleball, roller derby, cricket, synchronized diving, mixed martial arts, canoe sprint, cheer, ice dance and breaking. Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. Article content Michael says taking part in the show was right up his alley. “I’m really competitive. I like stepping out of my comfort zone... Some of the sports I’ve never heard of before,” he says. “There’s not much we could prepare for this. We didn’t. It was kind of like a leap of faith,” he continues. “Some sports were extremely fun to compete in and some were extremely not fun to compete in.” Ariana recalls being very nervous and excited when the show began shooting. But the young athletes “clicked instantly,” she says. “We lived in a really big house together. We all became best friends really quickly,” she says. “I was surprised at how much I wasn’t homesick. I felt the three months flew by.” The show is hosted by Canadian Olympian and world-champion hurdler Perdida Felicien, who mentors the young athletes, as do a roster of other sports stars. Both teenagers plan to take their passion for sports as far as they can. Ariana says she would like to pursue volleyball at the NCAA level and even represent Canada at the Olympics. Michael says he dreams of playing professionally “at the highest level possible, in Europe or North America.” But the two teenagers have a lot of living to do until then. As well, they’ve begun dating — each other, to be clear — and they try to see each other on weekends. “We’ve been together almost six months,” Ariana says. “On the second-last day (of making the show), he asked me to be his girlfriend.” All-Round Champions season six premieres on May 29 at 5 p.m., with new half-hour episodes released weekly on Wednesdays and Thursdays with repeats on Sundays at 6 p.m. Watch it on TVOkids YouTube, TVOkids.com, TVOkids smart TV app or on the TVO broadcast channel in Ontario. phum@postmedia.com Article content Share this article in your social network Share this Story : Two teenaged athletes from Ottawa star in the new season of TVO's All-Round Champion Copy Link Email X Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Comments You must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.

        "description": "North Korea fired the projectile on a southern path off its west coast at around 10:44pm, the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, hours after Pyongyang said it would be launching a satellite some time before June 4.",
        "content": "North Korea said its attempt to launch a new military reconnaissance satellite ended in failure on Monday when a newly developed rocket engine exploded in flight. The attempt came just hours after Pyongyang issued a warning that it would try to launch a satellite by June 4, in what would have been its second spy satellite in orbit. Instead, the launch became the nuclear-armed North’s latest failure, following two other fiery crashes last year. It successfully placed its first spy satellite in orbit in November. “The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage,” the deputy director general of North Korea’s National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a report carried by state media. An initial analysis suggested that the cause was a newly developed liquid fuel rocket motor, but other possible causes were being investigated, the report said. Officials in South Korea and Japan had earlier reported that the launch seemed to have failed. North Korea fired the projectile on a southern path off its west coast at around 10:44pm, the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. JCS said it had detected a large amount of debris from the rocket in the sea just two minutes after launch, however. The object launched by North Korea disappeared over the Yellow Sea, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters, adding the government presumes nothing had entered the space. “These launches are in violation of relevant security council resolutions and are a serious matter concerning the safety of our people,” Hayashi said. Japanese public broadcaster NHK showed video of what appeared to be an orange dot flying into the night sky and then bursting into flames in an area close to the border between China and North Korea. A Japanese defence ministry official told reporters that the colour of the flames in the footage suggests that liquid fuel may be burning, but details are currently being analysed, NHK reported. The launch appeared to originate from Dongchang-ri, a northwestern area of the country where North Korea’s main space flight centre is based, JCS said. The Japanese government issued an emergency warning on Monday for residents in the south to take cover from the possible threat of a North Korean missile, before lifting the warning and saying it was not expected to fly over Japanese territory. Japan said over its J-Alert broadcasting system that North Korea appeared to have fired a missile, sending out the warning to residents in the southern prefecture of Okinawa. The launch would be the nuclear-armed North’s attempt to place a second spy satellite into orbit. After several failed attempts that ended when the rockets crashed, North Korea successfully placed its first such satellite in orbit in November. The North’s first bid to launch the new Chollima-1 satellite rocket, on May 31 last year, ended after a failure in the second stage. State media blamed the setback on an unstable and unreliable new engine system and fuel. After the May launch attempt, South Korea retrieved the wreckage of the satellite from the sea and said an analysis showed it had no meaningful use as a reconnaissance platform. Another attempt in August also ended in failure, with stages of the rocket boosters experiencing problems, resulting in the payloads crashing into the sea. North Korea’s space authorities had described the August failure after the rocket booster experienced a problem with its third stage as “not a big issue” in terms of the rocket system’s overall reliability. 02:01 North Korea’s Kim Jong-un guides country’s 1st ‘nuclear trigger’ simulation drills In February, US space experts said North Korea’s first spy satellite, dubbed the Malligyong-1, was “alive”, after detecting changes in its orbit that suggested Pyongyang was successfully controlling the spacecraft – although its capabilities remain unknown. North Korean state media reported that the satellite had transmitted photos of the Pentagon and White House, among other areas, but has not released any of the images. The successful November launch was the first after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un made a rare trip abroad in September and toured Russia’s most modern space launch centre, where President Vladimir Putin promised to help Pyongyang build satellites. Neither country has elaborated on the extent of that future aid, which could violate United Nations Security Council resolutions against North Korea. Russian experts have visited North Korea to help with the satellite and space rocket programme, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency reported, citing an unnamed South Korean senior defence official. Pyongyang has said it needs a military reconnaissance satellite to boost monitoring of US and South Korean military activities.",

        "content": "This news has been read 117 times! Kuwait City, May 27: Zain, a leading provider of innovative technologies and digital lifestyle communications operating in seven markets across the Middle East and Africa, continues to be recognized for its leadership endeavors in the areas of Sustainability and Gender Diversity, in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Zain was presented with the Leadership in SDGs Award 2023; and Championship Award in Women Empowerment 2024 at the 9th Annual Global Good Governance Awards organized by Cambridge IFA, a UK-based think tank. The Awards celebrate individuals, governments, public and private sector institutions, and NGOs that exhibit governance and sustainability as their strategic priority. Zain remains one of the most active organizations in the region with respect to delivering meaningful connectivity that leads to equitable systemic change through its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) initiatives, with the company playing a crucial role in empowering the markets in which it operates to reap the benefits of digital transformation for the benefit of the communities it serves and beyond. The recognition of these prestigious awards is testament not only to how much Zain believes in its purpose, but how relentless the company is ensuring its operations are a positive, inclusive force for good, with a commitment to continuing to instill these principles at the heart of the organization. SUSTAINABILITY Zain Group’s 2023 Sustainability Report (SR), marking its 13th annual sustainability report entitled ‘The Pathway to Value Creation’ reflects the company’s progress and efforts to address deficits and challenges across its footprint while providing Meaningful Connectivity that leads to Equitable Systemic Change through the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. The report demonstrates how the company addresses its social, economic, environmental, and human rights related impacts and how Zain continues to execute on its five-year, 2025 corporate sustainability strategy aiming to deliver meaningful and sustainable value across Zain’s operating companies and beyond. In 2023, Zain joined the United Nations (UN) Global Compact initiative, a voluntary leadership platform for the development, implementation, and disclosure of responsible business practices as well as committing to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) emission. Notably, the A- score that Zain maintained in the latest ‘CDP Score Report–Climate Change 2023’, positioned the company first in the region and among leaders globally with respect to climate action initiatives. Gender Diversity (WE) Zain has been actively working on narrowing the gender divide in leadership roles at the company. Under its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion women empowerment (WE) pillar, Zain Group has been a pioneering force for women empowerment regionally since 2017. This gender diversity initiative was created at a time when only 14.5% of Zain’s leadership comprised of women, and a target was set to increase this percentage of women leadership to 25% by 2025. Three Zain operations have already achieved their WE leadership targets in 2023, Zain Jordan at 27.3%, UAE based ZainTECH at 27.0%, and Zain Kuwait at 26.9%. For some time now, women have represented the higher proportion of university graduates in the region, yet this does not translate into positions within the workforce, let alone senior positions. Hence, the issue of women’s empowerment is an important topic for Zain, which has embedded this issue into the DNA and heart of the company’s corporate strategy. During 2023, women made up over 33% of Zain’s total recruitment, and the company recently revolutionized its staff-friendly Family Leave Policy clauses, reinforcing its position as one of the most impactful DEI organizations in the region, if not the world.

        "content": "Two persons from a finance company in allegedly duped people of Rs 35 on the pretext of getting them benefits from government schemes. A case has been registered against the pair with the police, reported PTI on monday. Based on a complaint lodged by eight women, the police have registered a case under , 406 (criminal breach of trust and other relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code, reported PTI citing an official. ADVERTISEMENT The accused, one of them operating a finance company, allegedly recruited the complainants as field executives to visit people's homes to help them fill out forms for government schemes and charged a fee for the service, he said. The complainants were asked to charge fees ranging from Rs 100 to Rs 9,500, which they then handed over with the forms to the company's manager, the official said. The firm had collected Rs 35 lakh over five months last year and then suddenly shut the office and ceased the operation without paying the complainants, he said, adding that no arrest has been made in the case. Earlier this week, , a district judge from Maharashtra's Solapur was allegedly duped of Rs 50,000 by an unidentified person who used the photo of a judge from the Bombay High Court as a WhatsApp display picture (DP) to ask for the money, reported PTI citing the police on Saturday. Based on a complaint lodged by the high court's registrar a first information report (FIR) has been registered by the Mumbai Police under relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code and IT Act, said the PTI report. As per the complaint, the district judge received a WhatsApp message on Friday from a phone number which had the photograph of a high court judge as the display picture, he said. The district judge was acquainted with the HC judge, said the PTI report. The sender of the message asked for Rs 50,000, which he claimed he would return at the end of the day, the official said. Without any further verification, the transferred the sum but got suspicious when he got another message with more demands, he said. The district judge then contacted the registrar's office at the high court and learnt that the judge whose photo was used had never asked for money, the official said.",

        "content": "Each year the NFL world witnesses several players raising their game to new heights. While most of these talents were already well known and regarded around the league for the contributions they've made early in their careers, they become the class of their respective positions by taking necessary steps such as putting in extra work in training camp, adding new skills to their repertoire or capitalizing on an improved roster surrounding them. There's plenty of room for new players to follow this path and make an All-Pro leap of their own in 2024. With the retirement of several well-established superstars such as Aaron Donald and Jason Kelce, there are spots openly available for the next generation to step up and take.. With that in mind, here's a look at six players primed to make their initial appearance on the All-Pro first team next season Brocky Purdy has experienced a meteoric rise from being the Mr.Irrelevant selection of the 2022 draft to becoming an MVP finalist in just his first full season as a starter. At the age of 24, the rising SanFrancisco 49ers star is already a Pro Bowler and experienced playoff signal-caller who is only scratching the surface of his potential. Purdy should soontake another leap towards greatness. While his rapid development had some luck involved since he was fortunate enough to land with an elite team and injuries helped him ascend the depth chart, it was sheer talent that allowed him to put a stranglehold on the job once he secured it. After winning his first five regular season starts and two playoff games as a rookie, it took a serious injury in that year's NFC Championship Game to slow Purdy. San Francisco's brass clearly saw enough by then to commit to him and proved that by trading away Trey Lance, ending any chance of a quarterback controversy in the Bay Area. Purdy healed in time for the 2023 campaign and took advantage of the clearpath towards superstardom. His stellar campaign now hashim set up to be San Francisco's top signal-caller for years to come. While Purdy's chances of earning an MVP award in 2023 were derailed with some uncharacteristic turnovers and middling play late in the year, he still completed 69.4 percent of his throws for 4,280 yards and 31 touchdowns. His output dipped with the competition ratcheting up in the playoffs, but Purdy still led his side back from a huge deficit in the NFC Championship Game and went all the way to overtime in the Super Bowl before coming up just short of his first Lombardi Trophy. That likely won't be the last glimpse of Purdy on the league's biggest stage. With San Francisco returning most of the key talent from last year's squad and augmenting it with several key free-agent and draft acquisitions, the Niners' quarterback will be better than ever in 2024 following his first healthy offseason as the team's QB1. Despite playing in one of the league's most inept offenses for the entirety of his two-year career, George Pickens has still managed to put up some respectable numbers while positioning himself to soon emerge as one of the NFL's next great wideouts. The 23-year-old put himself on the map as a rookie when hecaught 52 passes for 801 yards and four scores and further elevated his game duringa 63-catch, 1,140-yard, five-touchdown sophomore campaign in 2023. Pickens accomplished these impressive numbers while working within the constraints of former offensive coordinator Matt Canada's scheme, a limited system primarily orchestrated by quarterback Kenny Pickett, who failed to develop into the franchise signal-caller the Steelers were hoping he'd become. With Arthur Smith taking over as Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator and nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson ready to revitalize his career with the club, it should come as little surprise if and when Pickens makes a herculean leap in Year 3. There's no shortage of motivation for Pickens to improve his game. He's already publicly griped about being denied a Pro Bowl invite during his rookie year and again came up short of that stated goal despite the increase in production last season. According to Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , the wideout admitted he hasn't even been sleeping some nights while thinking about football. He also stated that he has plenty of untapped potential, a ceiling that Wilson should be able to help him reach in 2024: When asked by Mackey to put a percentage on the talent he's shown so far in the NFL, Pickens responded: \"I'd probably say 80%. I can only go off of how the quarterback plays. I can thrive more...The yardage showed it. I should have made the Pro Bowl.\" If the already ultra-talented wideout gets 20 percent better this season, opposing defenses are going to have a hard time stopping Pickens. He's already set for a noticeable increase in production with Diontae Johnson out of the picture, but Pickens will become a legitimate All-Pro superstar should he raise his game while garnering more targets. The Dallas Cowboys proved they made the right decision in letting incumbent No. 1 tight end Dalton Schultz walk in free agency last year. The replacement, Jake Ferguson, not only matched his predecessor's impressive contributions, but surpassed them in his first year as a starter. Ferguson, a fourth-round pick in the 2022 draft, quickly became an impact talent at a position that can often take multiple seasons to meaningfully contribute at after being drafted. While he hadjust 19 catches for 174 yards and two scores as a rookie working behindSchultz, he stepped into the spotlight in 2023 and finished the year with 761yards and five scores on 71 receptions. That output helped earn Ferguson his first Pro Bowl nod—something Schultz never accomplished—and there appears to be plenty more accolades in his future. In an interview with ESPN's Todd Archer , the 25-year-old admitted his game is far from complete and spoke about his plans to improve this offseason. Jason Witten, the gold standard for a Cowboys tight end, believes Ferguson is a worthy heir to his throne and believes he'll continue to develop further in 2024 (per Archer): \"I think he can do it all,\" Witten said, \"He'sa willing blocker. He can bend. ... Looks like he's smart. He's got greatchemistry with Dak. Good charisma. He can run. He understands separation. So Ithink now seeing himself do it, here's where the growth comes.\" If Ferguson rounds out his game and becomes an even bigger part of Dallas' offensive plans this coming season, he'll be right in the mix for All-Pro honors. The Philadelphia Eagles have been reaping the rewards of the NFL's International Pathway Program. The club took a chance on former Australian rugby player Jordan Mailata, who came up through the program, late in the 2018 draft and rapidly molded his raw, inexperienced talent into one of the league's top left tackles. Mailata had the unteachable size and athleticism to dominate at that position, but it took tutelage from the club's coaching staff to turn the 6'8\", 365-pounder into a premium NFL player. Now that he's entering his seventh campaign—and fifth as a starter—Mailata looks ready to make a leap into the top-tier of his profession. Despite signing a four-year, $64 million contract in 2021and re-upping on a pricy three-year, $66 million extension back in April,Mailata has yet to earn any Pro Bowl or All-Pro distinctions. Pro Football Focus has taken note of his contributions, however, as the site has consistently dishedout stellar grades to the Sydney native. Mailata earned a strong PFF grade of 84.1 in 2023 after he gave up just three sacks across 1,147 offensive snaps. He was named to PFF's second-team All-Pro squad at the left tackle position, trailing only a generational star in Trent Williams. It was the second time in the last three years that Mailata finished as a runner-up to Williams and he will have an opportunity to finally surpass Williams in 2024. Although he now has plenty of reps under his belt, Mailata is only 27 years old and still honing his craft after getting such a late start playing football. The Philadelphia standout is on the cusp of finally putting it all together and will become a fixture on the All-Pro team once he does. Maxx Crosby has established himself as a true force on the edge, but he's still lacking the hardware to prove he's the premiere talent at his premium position. While he's garnered three consecutive Pro Bowl nods and made the second All-Pro team in two of the last three years, he's yet to make a first-team leap. Expect that to change in 2024 as Crosby prepares to take his game to the next level. During an appearance on the The NFL Report with Steve Wyche, Brian Baldinger, and James Palmer, Crosby said he's made major strides this offseason: \"I pride myself on being the best in every category, and I know I'm getting close to that every single day, So, it's been an incredible offseason, I feel great, my knee is feeling great, my hand as well. So, yeah, I've got the best team around me.\" Opposing quarterbacks should fear an even more dangerous Crosby, as he's been consistently contributing since placing second in the Defensive Rookie of the Year race back in 2019. The Eastern Michigan product has tallied 52 sacks—including a career-best 14.5 last year—and 202 pressures . He's also established himself as a true three-down defensive end who has logged a considerable 4,746 defensive snaps since entering the league. The Raiders clearly expect more from Crosby in 2024 too as the club raised his pay to be more commensurate with his contributions. According to ESPN's Adam Schefter , the pass rusher had an additional $6 million tacked onto the four-year, $95 million contract extension he signed in 2022 without any years being added to the deal. With more financial security and a strong offseason underhis belt, Crosby will be in the running to lead the league in sacks and finally breakthrough as a first-team All-Pro superstar. The Chicago Bears made plenty of headlines this offseason for their marquee draft selections and free-agent signings, but the long-term extension they hammered out with a homegrown talent was arguably one of their mostimpactful moves. By locking down rising star corner Jaylon Johnson through the 2027 season, the Bears shored up the cornerback position for the foreseeablefuture Johnson had a career year, earning his firstPro Bowl nod and securing second-team All-Pro honors to prove it. Although he's been a fixture in the starting lineup since the club selected him in the second round of the 2020 draft, Johnson elevated his game to another level. He secured a career-high four interceptions—including one returned for a touchdown—and only allowed a personal-best completion rate of 55.2 percent while giving up just two touchdowns across the 58 targets he faced in 2023. Johnson scored a phenomenal 90.8 Pro Football Focus grade and landed a spot on the site's first-team All-Pro squad . PFF noted that he allowed a mere 195 yards on plays in which he was the primary coverage defender—the fewest of any corner to log at least 250 coverage snaps this past season. Chicago rewarded Johnson by giving him a four-year, $76million contract just days after hitting the cornerback with the franchise tag. Only 25 years old and barely scratching the surface of his immense potential, Johnson will play a critical role over the next few years for a Bears squad seeking to exit its rebuild and become a contender. If Johnson develops into a regular on the All-Pro first team—a real possibility based on his rare mix of proven production and vast potential—Chicago will be a nightmare matchup for opposing quarterbacks.",

BANGKOK – Canadian boxer Terris Smith defeated Bulgaria’s Aslahan Mehmedova 3-0 on points in their round-of-16 bout Monday to advance at a last-ditch Olympic qualifying tournament. The 31-year-old from Victoria moves on in the women’s 60-kilogram division at the Haumark Stadium. Also Monday, Montreal’s Keven Beausejour, 24, lost 3-2 to Japan’s Go Wakaya in round-of-16 action in the men’s 80-kilogram class. On Sunday, Junior Petanqui defeated Shain Boniface from the Seychelles in a round-of-32 bout in the men’s 71-kilogram division. The 25-year-old from Montreal earned a 5-0 decision in his round-of-32 bout. Canada coach Samir (Sammy) El Mais called it “a great performance for his first bout.” “His jab couldn’t miss all fight,” he said in a statement. “He used his range, his experience and out classed his opponent winning unanimously.” On Tuesday, Petanqui faces Armenia’s Gurgen Madoyan and Scarlett Delgado, a 28-year-old from Brampton, Ont., meets Kenya’s Amina Faki in round-of-16 action in the women’s 54-kilogram class. Canadian Victor Tremblay lost via walkover Friday after failing to make weight for his first fight in the 57-kilogram bracket. “Victor has demonstrated incredible dedication and commitment to representing our nation on the international stage,” El Mais said. “However, ensuring the safety and well-being of our athletes always takes precedence. It was a tough decision, but ultimately, it was the right one.” The 19-year-old from Montreal is remaining with the team. “While I am disappointed that I won’t be able to compete, I understand the importance of maintaining my health and safety,” Tremblay said in a statement. “I will continue to train hard and support my teammates in any way I can.” Nine Canadians entered the Bangkok tournament trying to fight their way into this summer’s Olympic field Canada has already qualified two boxers for Paris, which features 13 weight classes — seven for men and six for women. The number of Olympic boxing divisions for men has gone down by one while the women’s competition has added one since Tokyo. But there will parity in total numbers of athletes with 124 men and 124 women. Middleweight Tammara Thibeault (75 kilograms) and welterweight Wyatt Sanford (63.5 kilograms) secured their Olympic berths via gold-medal performances at year’s Pan American Games. Both were members of Canada’s five-boxer team for the Tokyo Olympics. The Bangkok qualifier, which runs through June 3, will determine the final 51 quota places (23 for women and 28 for men) for the Paris Games. Olympic boxing qualification comes in the form of several steps. The first were five continental qualifiers, with the Pan American Games in Santiago, Chile, covering the Americas. A first World Qualification Tournament was then held in Busto Arzizio, Italy, from Feb. 29 to March 12. Competitors essentially had to finish in the top four in Italy to secure Olympic qualification, although that figure varied in some weight classes. Canada had two athletes finish in the top eight — Delgado and super-heavyweight Alexis Barriere, who subsequently opted to focus on a pro career. Just making the Olympic field is an accomplishment, given the sport’s popularity around the world and the fact each country can have no more than one competitor in a weight class. More than 75 countries took part in boxing at the Tokyo Games. Competitors will again need to crack the top four in Bangkok to punch their ticket to Paris. That measuring stick can change, however, given host France is guaranteed a maximum of six quota places (three for women and three for men) so can claim a spot in a weight class even if it doesn’t qualify a fighter. That means some weight classes may require a top-three finish for Olympic qualification. It could also become top five if an already qualified competitor is injured or suspended. There will be no title bouts at the Bangkok event, with action in each weight class coming to a halt when the final Olympic berths are determined. Canada has won 17 Olympic boxing medals (three gold, seven silver and seven bronze), but none since 1996 when heavyweight David Defiagbon won silver in Atlanta. The Paris boxing competition runs July 27 to Aug. 1 in the North Paris Arena and Roland-Garros Stadium. The Olympic qualifying events were organized under the authority of the Paris 2024 Boxing Unit (PBU), an ad-hoc group created by the International Olympic Committee’s executive board. The PBU was tasked with overseeing qualifying and running the boxing competition at the games following the IOC’s suspension and the subsequent withdrawal of recognition of the International Boxing Association (IBA). — This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "Nick Carter's ex Kaya Jones reveals she believed 'something horrific' happened to his rape accuser Melissa Schuman in explosive new docuseries By Deirdre Durkan-simonds For Dailymail.com Published: 16:24, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:41, 27 May 2024 e-mail 7 shares View comments Pussycat Dolls ' Kaya Jones revealed that she believed 'something horrific' happened to Nick Carter 's ex-girlfriend Melissa Schuman, who accused him of raping her . In a preview for Investigation Discovery's docuseries, Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter , Jones, who dated the former Backstreet Boy between 2004 to 2005, recalled reaching out to his rape accuser in 2017 through a direct message on X (previously known as Twitter ). 'Nick Carter was my boyfriend when I was in the Pussycat Dolls, and I saw the very detailed allegation about Nick and the response,' Jones, 39, said in the clip. 'It bothered me. Because it was discrediting this girl [Schuman]. So I wanted to hear what Melissa had to say.' After jumping on the phone with Jones, Schuman recalled that 'Kaya was so kind to' her. Pussycat Dolls' Kaya Jones revealed that she believed 'something horrific' happened to Nick Carter's ex-girlfriend Melissa Schuman, who accused him of rape 'I think we must’ve spoken for hours. I needed someone to tell me that my life wasn’t over,' the He Loves U Not hitmaker said. Jones recalled that after Schuman came forward, she saw a 'young woman trying to speak and someone who thought he had more power and authority to try to shut her up.' This led her to tweet a message to Nick, warning him that she was 'no longer keeping' his secrets and not to 'push it.' 'Because he knows what I know he knows,' she told the cameras. 'He knows why I left him, and, so do I believe that something horrific happened to that girl? Yes, yes, I do.' Schuman, 39, best known for being a member of the American girl group Dream, claims Carter raped her in his Santa Monica apartment back in 2003. She alleged, at the time, she was just 18-year-old, and a virgin. Nick has previously denied her accusation, and insisted their sexual encounter was consensual. The docuseries will feature on-camera interviews with both Jones and Schuman as well as third accuser, named Ashley Repp, who has also accused Nick of sexual misconduct. In a preview for Investigation Discovery's docuseries, Fallen Idols: Nick and Aaron Carter, Jones, who dated the former Backstreet Boy between 2004 to 2005, recalled reaching out to his rape accuser in 2017 through a direct message on X (previously known as Twitter); Nick Carter seen last year In an earlier trailer, released last month, Jones said she knew things that could 'burn' Nick's 'house down.' 'Nick looks like a perfect, pretty Ken doll,' she said. 'But I know who evil he can be.' Last year, following the most recent accusation from Repp — who was referred to only by her initials at the time — Carter's attorney Dale Hayes Jr. told DailyMail.com that Nick denies her claims, while describing the three lawsuits as 'malicious schemes.' In February 2024, Carter named Schuman in a $2.3 million suit against another accuser, named Shannon Ruth, who has also accused Carter of sexual assault, TMZ reported. In the suit filed by Carter, the boy band alum said Schuman coached Ruth in an extortion attempt he says has cost him millions in lost wages. 'Nick Carter was my boyfriend when I was in the Pussycat Dolls, and I saw the very detailed allegation about Nick and the response,' Jones, 39, said in the clip. 'It bothered me. Because it was discrediting this girl [Schuman]. So I wanted to hear what Melissa had to say' Schuman, 39, (seen above in 2018), best known for being a member of the American girl group Dream, claims Carter raped her in his Santa Monica apartment back in 2003. His lawyer, Liane K. Wakayama, told TMZ in a statement: 'Melissa Schuman has been peddling this tale for many years, but her allegation was false when she first made it back in 2017 - and it still is.' Wakayama told the outlet that 'a judge in Nevada recently ruled, after reviewing the extensive evidence we laid out, that there are strong grounds for Nick Carter to proceed with his lawsuit against Ms. Schuman for plotting to damage, defame and extort Nick, his associates, his friends and his family.' Carter's lawyer went on to call Schuman's latest filing a 'PR stunt' and vowed that it won't distract the singer 'from his determination to hold Ms. Schuman and her co-conspirators to account for the immeasurable pain and suffering their extortionate conduct has caused.'

        "content": "Princess Charlene of Monaco cuts a glamorous figure at the principality's Formula 1 Grand Prix on Sunday Princess Charlene opted for a stylish, double-breasted jumpsuit by Louis Vuitton READ MORE: Princess Charlene risks awkward run-in with Prince Albert's ex-mistress Nicole Coste at Grand Prix after posting solo picture with Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella to mark Monaco Mother's Day By Monique Rubins For Mailonline Published: 10:23 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 12:00 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 7 shares 39 View comments Looking statuesque in a designer jumpsuit with her cropped hair impeccably style Princess Charlene of Monaco displayed the same elegance and poise her late mother-in-law Grace Kelly was known for, as she attended the Formula 1 Grand Prix of Monaco on Sunday. It's quite the turnaround for the mother-of-two, 46, who attended with her husband Prince Albert of Monaco , 66, who in recent years has been notably absent from public life for significant swathes of time. In 2021, she alarmed fans by spending most of the year in her native South Africa , posting a series of photos on social media where she looked worryingly frail. But yesterday, in a smart navy blue jumpsuit by Louis Vuitton and a pair of large black sunglasses by the same French designer, elegant Charlene was every inch the glamorous and confident European royal. Princess Charlene of Monaco (pictured) cut an elegant figure in a navy blue jumpsuit by Louis Vuitton on Sunday The royal, 46, sported a pair of Louis Vuitton sunglasses, only adding to the glamourous look Princess Charlene smiled as she embraced the winner, Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc (left) With a double-breasted blazer and wide-leg trousers, the jumpsuit was a stylish alternative to the more feminine dresses that other guests chose to wear. Charlene, a lover of fashion, completed her outfit with a pair of £890 Louis Vuitton slingback pumps in black and beige and the designer's Ombre Blossom extra-large hoops in pink gold and diamonds. With her short blond hair brushed to one side and only subtle make-up, the smiling mother-of-twins looked fresh-faced at the event, which saw her embrace the winner, Ferrari's Monegasque driver Charles Leclerc , as he took to the podium to claim his trophy. Prince Albert, meanwhile, looked typically smart in a navy blazer and a pair of cream trousers. Charlene is in her native South Africa in 2021. She infamously shaved her head in the style of a punk rocker and appeared notably frail in social media snaps Charlene sparked concern in October 2021 when she was pictured looking frail during an extended stay in her native South Africa To protect himself from the sun, he sported an event cap along with a pair of dark sunglasses, both of which he removed when it came to congratulate Leclerc. Sources have previously claimed that Charlene's transformation is down to her increasing devotion to her Catholic faith, as well as the close proximity of her parents Lynette and Mike who have joined her brother in the principality from their native South Africa to support the Princess. The couple have moved more than 8000 miles from their home in the suburbs of Johannesburg, to live permanently in the Monaco area. So as to be as close to their daughter as possible, they have moved into an imposing property in La Turbie, a French village next door to the tax haven principality where their daughter lives in regal splendour between a range of properties. 'It has made the world of difference,' said a palace source in Monte Carlo who has known Albert and Charlene since before their wedding. 'The Wittstocks have moved into a house that's just a few minutes' drive away from Charlene, and they meet all the time. 'They make her feel safe and secure, and remind her of the far more carefree life she enjoyed in South Africa before becoming a Monaco princess.' Charlene's brother, Gareth Wittstock, 42, first moved to Monaco to 'make sure his sister was being looked after' a decade ago, and her second brother, 40-year-old Sean Wittstock, is 'on the phone every day from South Africa,' said the source. Yesterday's outing was a further sign that the former Olympic swimmer, has well and truly put her health woes behind her after she spent almost a year away from the Mediterranean principality in her native South Africa, undergoing treatment for an unspecified condition. Princess Charlene and Prince Albert stand behind winner Leclerc of Monaco (front, second from right) and Ferrari, Oscar Piastri of Australia and McLaren (front, second from left), who came in second, and Carlos Sainz of Spain and Ferrari (front, right), who scored third place in the race.

She wasn't pictured in Monaco from January 2021 until March 2022, citing a sinus issue which stopped her from flying. She missed the seventh birthday of her twins Gabriella and Jacques and her tenth wedding anniversary with Albert. In interviews at the time, Albert explained he had stepped up to play a bigger role in his children's lives as the family coped with Charlene's ongoing health issues.

Speaking to People magazine at the time, Albert said the family reunion in Monaco initially went 'pretty well' in the first few hours, but it then became 'pretty evident' that Charlene was 'unwell.' He said the former Olympian 'realised she needed help', adding: 'She was overwhelmed and couldn't face official duties, life in general or even family life.' The Monegasque royals appeared to be enjoying the event together, with Charlene putting her arm around her husband at one point and leaning in towards him as he was speaking. Whilst she was able to mask any awkwardness, Charlene may well have been anxious about bumping into Prince Albert's former mistress, who was also in attendance on Sunday. Earlier in the day, Nicole Coste - who dated Albert in secret for seven years and shares a son with the royal - posted on her Instagram that she would be attending the event. The fashion designer, who met the royal while working as a flight attendant in 1997, shared a photo of herself dressed in a white trench coat and admiring the view from the venue. Aligning herself with the Ferrari team, Nicole gushed: 'We are waiting for the victory of Charles Leclerc the the country’s child. Loving this jacket!' The Monegasque royals appeared to be enjoying the event together with Charlene putting her arm around her husband at one point Charlene beamed as she embraced Leclerc as he took to the podium to claim his trophy Prince Albert, 66, looked on as his stunning wife, a former Olympian swimmer, posed for the cameras Prince Albert prepared to open a huge bottle of champagne to congratulate Leclerc Both Princess Charlene and Prince Albert were beaming as Leclerc sprayed his teammates with the champagne Later, Carlos Sainz, the Spanish Ferarri driver who came in third place, sprayed his teammate, winner Leclerc, with champagne The smiling Monegasque royals shared a sweet moment when Prince Albert held onto his wife's wrist With her cropped hair impeccably styled for the event, Princess Charlene looked every inch the glamorous royal in her large Louis Vuitton sunglasses Albert and Nicole's liaison became the best-kept secret in Monaco society. Although they both attended red carpet events and mixed with socialites and celebrities, the majority of Albert's subjects knew nothing of the relationship. Ahead of her 2011 wedding to Prince Albert, Charlene reportedly fell out with Nicole after she put her step-son Alexandre up in the Palace's staff wing. While she has previously had a frosty relationship with Albert too - claiming he 'doesn't want to see his son' - she has recently lavished praise on the monarch. On his birthday, Nicole shared a photo with him. The caption read: 'Happy birthday Albert. The world will recognise you as The Loyal, the Dignity, the KING'. In November 2022, she shared another shot of Albert with Alexandre and Jazmin in New York, New York, with the cheeky caption: ' Paternally king'. The Monaco royals were further rattled earlier this year when Prince Albert's former accountant made a string of allegations about their finances. He claimed that Princess Charlene hired illegal immigrants on less than £90-a-day while her personal spending allowance rocketed to more than £1million-a-year. Charlene leaned in as her husband, who sported dark sunglasses and an event cap, was speaking Princess Charlene has shared a sweet photo with her twins Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella to mark Monaco's Mother's Day Claude Palmero, 67, was in charge of palace finances for more than two decades but stepped down in July 2023 after he was targeted by an anti-corruption website. His 'secret notebooks' detailing the spending of the Monaco royal family have now been shared with French newspaper Le Monde, and it was the 'illegal migrants' who made up much of Charlene's full-time personal staff of eight that Mr Palmero was particularly worried about. 'Her Serene Highness the Princess makes people work for her who are not compliant,' Mr Palmero warned Prince Albert, also referring to 'a moonlighting Filipino woman who ties up dogs in the shower.' In a letter written in January 2017, he said another employee from the Philippines had been 'illegal for five years', despite solely being on a one-month tourist visa.

        "description": "NHL: San Jose Sharks are searching to replace David Quinn, who was fired April 24.",
        "content": "SAN JOSE – At least two candidates, Ryan Warsofsky and Jeff Blashill, have had or will have second interviews for the San Jose Sharks’ head coaching job, according to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman. Another candidate, Marco Sturm, also recently interviewed for the position, Friedman said on his “32 Thoughts” podcast published Monday morning. The Sharks recently received permission from the Los Angeles Kings to speak with the former NHL winger about the opening. Sturm has coached the Kings’ AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign, for the past two seasons. Friedman said Blashill was “due” for a second interview and was told Warsofsky has had two interviews. Warsofsky, 36, was on former coach David Quinn’s staff for the past two years and coordinated the team’s penalty kill and defense. Quinn was fired by Sharks general manager on April 24 after two seasons and a 41-98-25 record. Grier said on May 7, after the Sharks won the NHL draft lottery, that he had already spoken with prospective candidates. Before coming to San Jose, Warsofsky had been an AHL head coach for four years, including from 2020 to 2022 with the Chicago Wolves. In 2021-2022, Warsofsky became the youngest coach to win the Calder Cup since Peter Laviolette in 1999, as the Wolves finished the regular season with a 50-16-10 record and went 14-4 in the playoffs. Warsofsky began coaching in 2012 as an assistant at Curry College in his native Massachusetts. He then became an assistant coach for the ECHL’s South Carolina Stingrays. After three years, he was promoted to head coach and led the team to the Kelly Cup Finals in his first year. Warsofsky then spent two years, from 2018 to 2020, with Charlotte of the AHL, the first as an assistant when the Checkers won the Calder Cup and the second as the team’s head coach. Blashill, 50, has been an NHL head or assistant coach for 10 years. He was a Detroit Red Wings assistant during the 2011-2012 season, then was the team’s head coach for seven seasons from 2015 to 2022. The rebuilding Red Wings missed the playoffs in each of Blashill’s final six seasons and had a 204-261-72 record during his tenure. Blashill has been an assistant on Jon Cooper’s staff with the Tampa Bay Lightning for the past two seasons. Sturm’s Reign teams were a combined 76-55-13 over the past two years, and Ontario just finished a season in which it went 42-23-7 and reached the Pacific Division final. Sturm was a first-round draft pick by the Sharks in 1996 and played seven-plus seasons with the team from 1997 to 2005 before he was traded to the Boston Bruins as part of the deal that brought Joe Thornton to San Jose.",

        "description": "Talks between China and the United States on the future development of artificial intelligence have been constructive.",
        "content": "Agreement has not yet been reached, but the world should take heart that the United States and China recently met to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) – an issue with profound global implications. The Geneva talks were the first intergovernmental exchange since leaders of the world’s two largest economies agreed to cooperate on reducing risks and improving governance of the technology. The high-level delegations exchanged views “constructively” at the May 14 meeting, according to readouts from both sides. China’s foreign ministry said both delegations reaffirmed a commitment to implementing the consensus President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden reached in November in San Francisco. A US National Security Council spokeswoman said Washington’s representatives stressed the importance of harnessing the benefits of AI for sustainable development and the need to build global consensus to ensure AI systems are “safe, secure and trustworthy”. US delegates raised concerns over the misuse of AI, including by China, as it affirmed the need to maintain open lines of communication on AI risk and safety as part of “responsibly managing competition”. China’s delegates said Beijing had stuck to a principle that AI technology should be people-centred and used for good and laid out a “solemn position” regarding US restrictions on AI. Chinese delegation leader Yang Tao said Beijing was willing to step up communication with Washington. He said China supported strengthening global governance of AI and “for the United Nations to play the role of main channel”. A global framework for AI governance, with standards and norms formed by wide consensus, is a sensible goal. It is right to focus on an issue that stands in the way of mending bilateral ties and deepening engagement. Earlier in the month, freshly appointed climate envoys from the US and China also held inaugural face-to-face discussions. Both sides have said that environmental issues should be free of the divisive rancour on other fronts. It is time for progress to be made. Market suppression and security concerns threaten to make AI talks relatively thorny. However, the benefits of AI, and the threat we all face if the technology is left unchecked should drive both sides to cooperate.",

        "content": "News Haris Rauf: Injury lay-off could be 'blessing in disguise' Fast bowler returned to Pakistan ranks for second T20I at Edgbaston on Saturday Danyal Rasool 27-May-2024 • 51 mins ago Haris Rauf talks to the media ahead of the third T20I against Pakistan • Getty Images Elite athletes may have everything at their beck and call, but one thing they usually lack is time. In Pakistan cricket, no player has ever voluntarily taken time off from any kind of cricket - except to play cricket elsewhere during a calendar clash. Haris Rauf knows that better than anyone else after he decided to pull out of Pakistan's Test series in Australia to play the Big Bash, and paid for it with his central contract. As he worked his way mending fences with his cricket board, any notion of voluntary time off was fanciful. But events took their course, and an untimely dive during the final over of the PSL's highest-profile match saw him dislocate his shoulder. He would be ruled out for three months, missing the remainder of the PSL, Pakistan's home series against New Zealand and away series in Ireland, and he only made his competitive return in Birmingham on Saturday. All that time off, Haris acknowledges, may not have been such a bad thing. \"I was injured the last few months but if you believe in yourself, then the layoff can be a blessing in disguise,\" he said at a press conference ahead of Pakistan's third T20I against England in Cardiff. \"Because you have time to recover and reassess your gameplans. I felt good coming back to cricket. When you play for your country, it makes you very proud.\" His comeback at Edgbastan was solid, if short of spectacular. He was the pick of the fast bowlers, taking two wickets for 34 in his allocated spell. It included an ill-advised Powerplay over - by far Rauf's weakest phase - that conceded 17. For the rest of his spell he maintained consistent pace and accuracy, and went at less than a run a ball while picking up two wickets., Related A nervous smile and a forced handshake - dealing with a crisis, the PCB way PCB terminates Haris Rauf's central contract for not committing to Australia tour Jos Buttler backs England to learn lessons from 50-over World Cup debacle Jofra Archer impresses on comeback as Jos Buttler makes the difference in 23-run win Jofra Archer's smooth comeback gives England a 'different level mood' It wouldn't ultimately be enough as Pakistan fell comfortably short in the end. \"When you lose a game it hurts, but as a team, we are confident,\" he said. \"We feel we can beat any opposition on any day. We've done it in the past, too. When you make mistakes you learn and try not to repeat those mistakes. We're looking to play better in the next few games and make a comeback. \"The camp is relaxed. We're enjoying ourselves. We're trying to follow our gameplans and execute them well. The results haven't often been in our favour recently but if you stick to your plans they can sometimes follow.\" Rauf also spoke of the psychological and physical struggles of returning from a long-term injury, particularly for a fast bowler - a topic that Naseem Shah also addressed recently. \"It's hard,\" he said. \"It's a struggle during your rehab, and it's difficult when you come back to maintain that pace and accuracy. But if you believe in yourself, it makes things easier. When I wasn't in the team and rehabbing, I had a lot of time to think about my game and work on myself. Thankfully I'm back now, and the World Cup is coming up.\" Pakistan have ensured they get as much match practice as possible ahead of the World Cup; in 2024, they will have played 17 T20Is by the end of this series, in addition to the PSL. It has included experimentation with the top order, the bowling combinations, and indeed a change of captain . It hasn't all gone their way, with the 2-1 win in Ireland their only T20I series win since the 2022 World Cup. Rauf admits winning the next two games would give Pakistan much-needed confidence, but insists these games are about more than just that. \"Before the World Cup, if you win a series it gives you confidence, but even if you lose you understand where you made mistakes and you learn from them,\" he said. \"This series is difficult, but we'll try to win it. The focus is of course on the World Cup, which we aim to win to make our country proud.\" Haris Rauf Pakistan England vs Pakistan Pakistan in England Danyal Rasool is ESPNcricinfo's Pakistan correspondent. @Danny61000",

        "content": "A slow start in the Indian Premier League put Mitchell Starc’s record price tag under the microscope but the Australian all-formats hero underlined his worth as he lifted Kolkata Knight Riders to a third title. Starc, the costliest cricketer in the history of the league, was named Player of the Match after taking 2-14 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, including bowling opener Abhishek Sharma with an unplayable delivery that pundits judged the tournament’s best. A post shared by IPL (@iplt20) The performance followed on from his brilliant semi-final when he took three wickets and bowled Australia team mate Travis Head with the second ball. Starc started the tournament as one of its least economical bowlers, generating headlines across the world that compared his $2.98 million price tag with his paucity of wickets. It also led to a few light-hearted barbs from team-mates. None will be laughing at him now. “There have been plenty of jokes. A lot has been made of the money,” said the rangy left-armer. “I am older and more experienced now, so that has helped with managing the expectations and leading the attack. “It’s been a lot of fun, it’s been great to learn and see how these guys go about it but full credit to the whole players and staff, it’s made my life pretty easy.” Starc’s stunning return to form in the IPL burnishes his record in big matches and comes days before the T20 World Cup starts in the United States and the Caribbean. The 34-year-old took three wickets in the final of last year’s 50-over World Cup against hosts India and will likely be important for Australia’s hopes of becoming the first nation to hold cricket’s three global trophies in tests, ODIs and T20. Kolkata’s eye-watering bid for Starc during the IPL auctions stunned the cricket world late last year but it now appears to have been a master stroke. They may have to fork out more to retain his services in 2025. Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins will no doubt be happier playing with Starc for Australia than against him in the IPL. “I thought they bowled fantastically,” Cummins said after Hyderabad were skittled for 113. “Unfortunately, my old mate Starcy turned it on again.” Starc, Cummins and Head will link up with the rest of Australia’s T20 World Cup squad in the coming days ahead of their opener against Oman next week. Captain Mitchell Marsh said Australia felt lucky to have “world-class” Starc. “He’s so important for the make-up of our team,” Marsh said after training in Trinidad. “We know that Starcy is the X-factor, and you see throughout T20 cricket these days it’s the X-factor players who win you games, win you tournaments.”",

        "content": "FanCamp was set to offer accommodation with a garden, a bar and a shared lounge, for fans basing themselves in host city Cologne – which will host Scotland’s second group stage match against Switzerland on June 19. The campsite was said to be on a headland directly on the river Rhine, centrally located near the Cologne Messe/Deutz long-distance train station, and right next to the public viewing “Tanzbrunnen”. However, the camp, which bosses said was “particularly popular with Scottish and English football fans”, has been forced to cancel due to heavy rainfall making the water level on the river rise. As many as 150,000 Scots are expected to make the trip to support the national team as they play in their first major finals overseas since the World Cup in France in 1998. Organiser Dirk Stoeveken apologised to Scotland fans, but insisted they were left with no option but to cancel after the camp was put “almost completely under water”. He said: “The camp site is currently almost completely under water and the forecast is that the water level of the Rhine will continue to rise. “This is having a huge impact on the preparations and unfortunately does not allow for a reliable forecast regarding the timeframe and possible cost development.“ Gregor Timmer, the City of Cologne’s representative for the European Championships: “It is a great pity that we had to make this decision. “We were all very much looking forward to this offer, which was particularly popular with Scottish and English football fans. “However, the safety of everyone involved is always our top priority and we take concerns about this very seriously. It was important for us to make a decision as early as possible to allow fans to make alternative arrangements. “We are also avoiding a financial risk that would otherwise have been borne in full by the City of Cologne. “Unfortunately, a serious assessment of all these points has left us with no option but to cancel.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

        "content": "CHELSEA ARE REPORTEDLY in advanced talks to make Leicester’s Enzo Maresca their new head coach. The Italian, who until last summer was Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Manchester City, has guided the Foxes back into the Premier League at the first time of asking following their relegation 12 months ago. That, and the style of football with which he achieved it, has impressed the Chelsea hierarchy who are looking for a successor to Mauricio Pochettino after they parted ways after just one season. Reports suggest Chelsea have asked for permission to speak to Maresca, whom Leicester would demand compensation for with a figure of £10 million (€11.7m) being floated. Brentford’s Thomas Frank and Kieran McKenna, who got Ipswich promoted from the Sky Bet Championship behind Leicester, were also apparent contenders for the role. The task of identifying a replacement for Pochettino, who departed on amicable terms having failed to reach agreement with the club over how much responsibility he would be given over football matters, is being overseen by co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart. A final decision on any appointment must ultimately be signed off by the club’s co-controlling owners Todd Boehly, Behdad Eghbali, who is understood to have been lukewarm on the prospect of Pochettino remaining in the job, and Jose E Feliciano. Chelsea and Leicester have been approached for comment.",

        "content": "David Raya, who was on loan at Arsenal this season, has been announced as a part of the Spain provisional squad for the Euro 2024 in Germany. David Raya Gets Euro 2024 Call-up for Spain Raya’s exploits in goal coupled with Arsenal’s resolute defence helped the Spaniard win the Golden Glove this season. He kept 16 clean sheets in total and thus beat his nearest competitor Jordan Pickford who had 13. The Brentford goalkeeper moved to Arsenal on loan in a deal with an option to buy for £27 million. The move was initially met with scepticism, especially due to Aaron Ramsdale’s popularity among the fanbase. But soon he started winning over the critics with his calm and composed nature at goal. Mikel Arteta went on to describe him as ‘magnificent’ after the recent North London Derby, which the Gunners won 3-2. Arguably his best moment in an Arsenal jersey came against Porto in the Champions League round of 16 . He saved two penalties in the shoot-out to send the Gunners to the quarterfinals of the Champions League after 14 years. Owing to his excellent performances Arsenal are expected to make his loan move permanent this summer. Spain manager Luis de la Fuente named his 29-man provisional squad for the upcoming Euros in Germany. Raya was one of the 3 goalkeepers named by him. The 28-year-old is expected to provide heavy competition to Athletic Bilbao keeper Unai Simon for a spot in the starting lineup. So far he has featured for Spain just four times. Simon on the other hand has been Spain’s first-choice keeper for the last four years and played in all of their matches in Euro 2020. The Arsenal man is accompanied by fellow Premier League stars Rodri(Manchester City) and Marc Cucurella (Chelsea). Pedro Porro and Pau Torres were prominent names missing from the squad despite having a good season for Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa respectively. Goalkeepers: David Raya, Unai Simon, Alex Remiro Defenders: Aymeric Laporte, Robin Le Normand, Alex Grimaldo, Dani Carvajal, Dani Vivian, Jesus Navas, Nacho Fernandez, Marc Cucurella, Pau Cubarsi Midfielders: Mikel Merino, Fabian Ruiz, Alex Baena, Martin Zubimendi, Rodrigo, Marcos Llorente, Pedri, Aleix Garcia, Fermin Lopez Forwards: Alvaro Morata, Dani Olmo, Joselu, Lamine Yamal, Mikel Oyarzabal, Ayoze Perez, Ferran Torres, Nico Williams Spain will kick off their Euro 2024 campaign against Croatia on June 15, 2024. They are placed in Group B, considered the ‘Group of Death’ since it also contains Italy and Albania, making it the toughest group in the tournament.

        "content": "Kolkata: The Union government on Monday accepted the West Bengal government's plea for the extension of service of Chief Secretary B.P. Gopalika for another three months. A communique from the Department of Personnel & Training, under the Union Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, reached state Secretariat Nabanna on Monday afternoon, apprising the state about the approval for the extension. Gopalika was supposed to retire on May 31 and the state government sought an extension of service on the ground that his scheduled date of retirement would be before the seventh, and final, phase of ongoing Lok Sabha polls on June 1 and the counting day on June 4. Now after the extension, Gopalika will be retiring on August 31. A state Secretariat source said that before receipt of the central communique, the state government was not quite sure whether the plea for extension would be granted or not. \"In normal times, such extension pleas by the state government are granted. But this time, the matter was different with the model code of conduct being in force and the extension would not be possible without the concurrence of the Election Commission of India (ECI). However, after it is being granted, there is a sigh of relief in the state administration,\" the source said. The issue of Gopalika’s extension became complicated for another reason as the Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Suvendu Adhikari, requested the ECI to replace Gopalika, who was supposed to retire before the election and counting process was completed.",

Whether it’s ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, or Perplexity, I’m essentially chatting with AI. Apple has to play catch-up to all those services, and most rumors agree that Apple won’t have a ChatGPT equivalent of its own ready in time for the arrival of . That’s why Apple might have to integrate ChatGPT or Gemini into iOS to ensure that base is covered. Alongside that third-party chatbot, Apple might deliver a different approach of its own to AI.

Yes, I’d be interested in ChatGPT and similar products, even if such interests weren’t part of my job. I genuinely believe genAI can transform computing in ways we can’t even imagine yet. But I do follow generative AI news more closely than most regular iPhone users, and I try every new service that pops up. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the What I’m getting at is that plenty of regular iPhone users might not be exposed to ChatGPT and Gemini. They might not use genAI products even if they’re aware of their existence. Then again, thanks to , plenty of iPhone users have unwillingly experienced genAI in the past few weeks. People who aren’t currently reliant on ChatGPT and other chatbots might find Apple’s implementation of AI more useful. They might not even realize that genAI or machine learning is blowing up in popularity. That’s what a report from says. Apple will be “focusing on tools that ordinary consumers can use in their daily lives,” Mark Gurman writes. “The idea is to appeal to a user’s practical side — and leave some of the more whiz-bang features to other companies.” The reporter listed several AI features Apple is reportedly building into iOS 18 that could become useful tools people start taking for granted. Project Greymatter Gurman says Apple will spend plenty of time at WWDC 2024 next month talking about the fruits of Project Greymatter, the internal name for Apple’s suite of AI tools coming to iPhone apps. Here’s what genAI will do for you in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15, according to the report: Finally, developer tools like Xcode will also get AI Integration. These features will sound “boring” to anyone using genAI features already. For example, Samsung’s Galaxy S24 and other flagships support the Galaxy AI suite of generative AI features. Google added Gemini to plenty of apps, and there’s deeper integration on its Pixel phones. , and I’m not talking about chatbot functionality. But Apple will have at least two key advantages. First, Apple can make these genAI features available to hundreds of millions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac users at once. As soon as iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 roll out, the built-in genAI features will be available to them. Gurman says Apple could become one of the main players in AI tech because of its large user base. I agree with that point of view. Apple’s approach to genAI on the iPhone and other devices might have a better chance than rivals. That’s assuming the iOS 18 AI features above are accurate and work as described. Secondly, Apple can make a bigger play about privacy than its rivals. Apparently, Apple wants all of its genAI features to run on the device. For those cases where cloud processing is needed, Apple will pass on data to its own servers. But Gurman says that Apple will probably “tout the security features of the M-series chips that it’s using to conduct the cloud processing” and reassure users it’s not building profiles of customers with the information. What about ChatGPT functionality? The report also notes that Apple won’t be able to deliver its own ChatGPT chatbot and that some execs oppose the need for one. But customers will want one, and that’s something I agree with. I already use ChatGPT via the standalone app, but I’d love it if the chatbot got deeper integration. The report doubles down on something Gurman has said recently. Apple has apparently chosen , even though Gemini seemed to be the favorite a few months ago. The Apple-OpenAI partnership will become official at WWDC, the report notes. Interestingly, the report says Apple is also working with Google for potential Gemini integration just so it has an alternative to ChatGPT. Such a deal is meant to ensure Apple isn’t stuck with ChatGPT, as OpenAI comes with risks. The , even though I still prefer it over Google.",

Brooke - whose new movie Mother Of The Brides is in the top 10 on Netflix - insists she's taking a hands-on approach to the brand. She told WWD : 'We have to establish ourselves as experts. Just because I'm Brooke Shields and I have hair doesn't make me an expert. 'The efficacy of the products is what I'm painstakingly focused on.

'I wanted this optimism to be something that we all shared with regards to how we age.' She previously explained her plan at the SHE Media Co-Lab Whole Life Health SXSW panel in March, saying: 'It's coming this summer, but it was really about tapping into the community and finding what their needs are.

        "content": "Tiwa Savage surprised fans by announcing her debut Prime Video film “ Water and Garri , ” an extension of her creative vision from her 2021 EP of the same name . While the EP showcased her musical talents, the film allowed her to shine as an actress and executive producer through her company, Everything Savage. Tiwa Savage isn’t new to the acting scene. She previously played Sade , a club owner and over-protective adoptive mother of a son who’s HIV positive in the MTV series “ Shuga Naija ” (season 3) and made a cameo in Funke Akindele ‘s “ Jennifer’s Diary .” In “ Water and Garri ,” Tiwa takes centre stage as Aisha , an ambitious fashion designer returning to Nigeria after a decade in the U.S. following a family loss. Upon arrival, she grapples with the many changes she finds back home. “Performing as Aisha allowed me to be totally vulnerable and pushed me to express myself in a way that I’ve never done before,” she says about the role. She co-stars with Jemima Osunde (known for movies like “Shuga,” Lionheart ” and “ Far From Home “) who played the character of Stephany , Aisha’s cousin, who broke the news of her father’s passing. In a press interview with the cast and crew of the film, we hear from Jemima Osunde, Mike Afolarin, and Vannessa Amadi-Ogbonna, about their experiences on set, the music score, working with Tiwa, bringing the story to life and lots more. Jemimah Osunde on her experience on set: It was a very beautiful shoot. We were in a very beautiful location, so even when I wasn’t filming, walking around was a very awesome experience. But I would say that there was a particular day when we were in a keke maruwa , it was Tiwa and I and it was very funny. We had a lot of things going on, we were filming in the middle of the street, so people were going on with their daily activities and the maruwa had to move, we had to get to the director, and there was just a lot going on and it was really funny. Tiwa cutting in: She was actually teasing me because she was saying I hadn’t been in one before, but have you been in one before? Jemima : Yes! I have Tiwa : Oh! Jemima: It was your first time, not mine. Davidson on being a part of the project. When I got the call from the lovely Tiwa and Vanessa, I was like I am going to do this. It was a yes. When I read the script, I really connected with my character and everyone’s character, and I saw the vision, the idea of what this movie was about to bring to life, and I wanted to be a part of it. If I am being honest, this movie for me I haven’t seen such substance, especially coming from Nigeria and Africa. You will feel the movie when you watch it, you will feel connected even to the minutest detail. Vannessa Amadi-Ogbonna on the soundtracks to the film and working with Tiwa Savage: It’s an incredible film that you will all get to experience. There’s also a brilliant ten-track album that Tiwa put together while recording the initial EP, “Water & Garri.” There’s a project called “Water & Garri,” an EP of five songs that came out. Tiwa recorded additional songs that were supposed to be part of the film project, but as we were filming, she decided to scrap them. So naturally panic. We had no time. We were ready to wrap up filming. Tiwa, in her entrepreneurial self, said she was going to create completely new music for the project. She went out to Malibu and spent ten days on ten records. I have never experienced working with anyone who works as hard as her. Even when we were doing the New York premiere, Tiwa slipped away to record even more music because she had another project coming up. One of the other things I wanted to highlight was the strength of a woman. It’s important for me as a woman and as a mother to highlight that we are special and that the work that gets put in is not talked about enough in this industry, and that’s why I am personally really proud to have the opportunity of a lifetime to work with someone like Tiwa and show that we can do it all honestly. Mike Afolarin on the Water & Garri story and how the audience will connect to it. There are times when you feel like you have choices to make, and I feel like that’s literally the story of Water & Garri. Someone abroad has to come back to the realities of the country that she left. She knows, of course, that times have changed. She knows that she would have to navigate those troubles, for whatever reason it is that she came back. You also find touch points on family, community, and all of that. So I feel like everyone who watches this will have something to connect with. It was just an amazing journey for me with these creatives. I got to work with the creative genius that is Meji Alabi. I got to watch Tiwa work through creating music, acting, and producing. It’s just mind-blowing to watch her work and still care about the actors on set and them not hurting themselves doing stunts and all of that. We had a great time making this.",

        "description": "The number of VAR errors made by Premier League officials have been revealed, with two referees making four errors in 2023/24.",
        "content": "Another season is in the books, and there were plenty of talking points across the year. None have proven to be more controversial, though, than VAR and the league's officiating. The 2023/24 season saw numerous contentious decisions made by referees on match days - from Luis Diaz's offside against Tottenham to several other disallowed goals, fans and clubs have been left frustrated with how the video officials have operated at times. So much so that Wolves have even at the next AGM meeting in June. With so many individuals taking charge of games over the course of the season, there have been a few talking points, and also several mistakes. And ESPN's Dale Johnson, a VAR expert, has trawled through the archives of the most recent term to pick out who was on VAR duty for at least 10 games during the 23/24 season, ranking them from worst to best depending on the frequency of their errors. While some have almost perfect records, others really did have years to forget. VAR Officials Ranked Based on VAR Errors Made in 2023/24 Rank Referee Games Errors Frequency 1. Michael Salisbury 35 1 35.00 2. John Brooks 33 1 33.00 3. Michael Oliver 26 1 26.00 4. Robert Jones 21 1 21.00 5. Simon Hooper 14 1 14.00 6. Craig Pawson 10 1 10.00 7. Peter Bankes 35 2 17.50 8. David Coote 30 2 15.00 9. Chris Kavanagh 23 2 11.50 10 Andy Madley 20 2 10.00 11. Darren England 11 2 5.50 12. Tony Harrington 10 2 5.00 13. Jarred Gillet 31 3 10.33 14. Paul Tierney 31 4 7.75 15. Stuart Attwell 30 4 7.50 * Must have officiated a minimum of 10 games Six Referees Make Just One VAR Mistake While fans are often quick to criticise officials for their performances during games, what stands out here is the number of referees who made just a single mistake during the year while on VAR duty. A total of six individuals made just one error, although no ref had a spotless record out of all those who took charge of the technology for a minimum of 10 games. The best performer of the bunch, just about, was Michael Salisbury, who's only error during the 2023/24 season came during the first week of the season. He was the man in charge for Wolves' trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United, when Andre Onana cleaned out Sasa Kalajdzic, only for no penalty to be given, . Impressively, Salisbury would then take charge of an additional 34 games, making him the official to be on VAR duty the most. During that run, he made no errors at all, which make him the best performing match official based on frequency of errors. In February, ESPN estimated the accuracy of key Premier League match decisions to be 96% in 2023/24, a marked increase from the 82% recorded before VAR. Not far behind him, though, with just one error in 33 games, was John Brooks. That mistake came in March 2024 when Chelsea were awarded a penalty against Burnley after Lorenz Assignon fouled Mykhailo Mudryk inside the penalty area. The Clarets' defender was shown a second yellow card for the challenge, adding further insult to injury, with Vincent Kompany handed a two-match ban for his reaction to the incident. Michael Oliver, Robert Jones, Simon Hooper and Craig Pawson only made one error apiece too, but each of them took charge of VAR on significantly fewer occasions. Peter Bankes might have been tied with Salisbury for the best record, but his failure to award Brighton a penalty against Chelsea in May, as well as failing to intervene over a potential red card for Joao Palhinha during Fulham's draw against Brighton in October 2023. Paul Tierney and Stuart Attwell Make Most Mistakes At the other end of the table, the performances of six referees is cause for concern, as they made mistakes while on VAR duty in one of every 10 games they took charge of or less. The worst performing individual in terms of frequency, Tony Harrington, made an error every five games! Darren England was not much better than the aforementioned Harrington, as he also made two errors. The only reason he records a higher frequency is because he took charge of an additional game. However, England was the man on VAR duty during Tottenham's 2-1 win over Liverpool, when despite the Colombian international being onside - arguably the most high-profile error of the season. Neither man, though, made the most errors while on VAR duty. That title was shared by Stuart Attewell and Paul Tierney, who both made four errors during their games in charge. The former allowed three goals to wrongly stand during the course of the season, while he was also on VAR duty during Everton 2-0 Nottingham Forest when a penalty was not awarded to the visitors. Attwell will be at Euro 2024 as an official, and will be hoping less controversy circles around him at the international tournament. Tierney, meanwhile, is just above Attwell on frequency of errors purely because he took charge of an additional game. He failed to intervene over Alexis Mac Allister's red card against Bournemouth, which was subsequently overturned by the FA, while he failed to advise that a red card must be shown to Jack Robinson during Sheffield United's 2-2 draw against Chelsea. His worst day at the office, though, was during the Blades' visit to Luton Town, when Tierney wrongly advised two penalties be given during United's 3-1 win. VAR Vote Likely to Fail The table shows just how inconsistent the technology has been used by the men in charge of it during the 2023/24 season, with a total of 31 incorrect decisions made by referees. But while clubs may be frustrated by the use of the technology, it is likely to stay for the 2024/25 term despite Wolves' motion. Per Ben Jacobs, eight clubs have already made their stance clear on the matter, with . Considering that the motion requires a two-thirds majority to pass (14 out of 20 clubs), VAR will likely be used next season. However, significant changes can be expected. PGMOL chief Howard Webb has confirmed that a process is being outlined for referees to explain their choice to the crowd, should they visit the monitor and change their on-field decision. While the new policy requires approval, it will be a welcome shift for supporters in attendance. Nevertheless, further consistency will be required of fans to get on board with VAR once and for all in 2024/25. If another season of chaos is to follow, then expect the discussion over its abolition from the English top flight to resurface.",

        "content": "Kilkenny welcomed a major European gathering on intellectual property rights last week as The Marble City hosted the European Union Intellectual Property Office’s (EUIPO) annual meeting. The conference was jointly hosted by the EUIPO and the Intellectual Property Office of Ireland (IPOI), which is based in Government Buildings, Kilkenny. Delegates from 27 countries across the European Union gathered to discuss the EUIPO’s strategic plan to 2030 and the future direction of the European Union Intellectual Property Network (EUIPN). The meeting was officially opened by the Minister of State for Business, Employment and Retail, Emer Higgins. The Minister outlined the importance of Intellectual Property (IP) for business and the economy during her visit. \"I recognise the important role that a progressive intellectual property ecosystem plays in encouraging innovation and creativity and in fostering the EU’s ability to compete in the global economy,\" she said. \"We must ensure that the EU IP ecosystem continues to evolve so that European investors, creators, and businesses are assured of an effective and efficient IP protection system that will be an incentive to invest in research and development, leading to the creation of high-quality innovative goods and services. \"Therefore, the role and contributions of the EUIPO and the EU Intellectual Property Network in further developing these ecosystems is vital.\" The Executive Director of the EUIPO, João Negrão, commented that it was a pleasure to host the European Union Intellectual Property Network (EUIPN) annual meeting in Kilkenny. \"During the two days, we discussed the future of IP at EU level, and how best to continue our cooperation going forward in the context of the next strategic plan 2025-2030 of the EUIPO,\" he said. Over the two days the conference included visits by delegates to some of Kilkenny’s best known landmarks, including Kilkenny Castle, Smithwicks Brewery, Butler House and the National Design and Craft Gallery - culminating with a very special musical event in St Canice’s Cathedral. IPOI has been based in Kilkenny for over 25 years with 47 staff working in the Hebron Road offices. The Office is responsible for administrating and registering intellectual property rights, such as patents, trade marks, industrial designs and copyright. The Office also represents Ireland at international meetings which ensures Irelands position on intellectual property is represented at EU level.",

        "description": "T-Rex motorcycles are a little different from typical bikes, in that they're not bikes at all, instead going for a 3-wheel design. Who makes these trikes?",
        "content": "Three-wheeled vehicles are an uncommon configuration for a modern conveyance, as well as a rare sight on American roads when compared to the ubiquitous four-wheel or two-wheel forms most road-legal vehicles take. Manufacturers that opt to go tri-wheel often blur the line between car and motorcycle, including the Polaris Slingshot , the Morgan 3-Wheeler , and the T-Rex RR from Campagna. Based out of Quebec, Canada, Campagna first introduced the T-Rex in 1995. The T-Rex is built at Campagna's Boucherville, Quebec assembly plant. Originally conceived by F1 mechanic Daniel Campagna and automotive designer Paul Deutschman, the T-Rex RR is powered by a Kawasaki 1441cc four-cylinder engine making a claimed 208 horsepower and driven through a sequential six-speed gearbox — all in a vehicle that weighs only 1,098 lbs according to the manufacturer. For comparison, the base curb weight of a 2024 Mazda MX-5 with a manual transmission, a four-wheeled roadster with similar sporting intentions to the T-Rex RR, tips the scales at a comparatively hefty 2,341 lbs. With such a high horsepower-to-weight ratio and serious sporting pretensions, how much does it cost to get behind the wheel of a T-Rex RR as an owner? The 2024 T-Rex RR starts at $68,999. For comparison, the aforementioned Mazda MX-5 begins at $28,985. At that price, the T-Rex RR is equipped with weather-resistant black vinyl upholstery, 3-point safety belts, an Alcantara-covered Sparco steering wheel, and a fully adjustable suspension. Like other boutique manufacturers, Campagna has a multitude of colors and options that can lighten both the vehicle and your bank account. The T-Rex RR is available with seven different body colors, six color options for the chassis, five color options for the headlight bezels, six different seatbelt colors, three colors for the seats, five color options for the wheels, and three different colors for the brake calipers. In case the available hues don't suit the buyer's fancy, Campagna gives the option to customize the trike further with custom colors. The T-Rex RR has available performance enhancing options including carbon fiber body panels and an up-rated brake package featuring Wilwood four-piston calipers. Configurable, indeed. Campagna does not show the pricing for its optional upgrades. Inspecting the inventory of authorized T-Rex RR dealers does not offer any insights either, as they do not list available new inventory. Interested parties are encouraged to contact an authorized dealer or the manufacturer directly. Pre-owned examples are also available from those same authorized dealers, as well as other used-vehicle retailers. Consulting EBay motors at the time of publication found two used T-Rex RR models from recent model years with \"Buy It Now\" pricing at a bit less than $60,000.",

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. In tit-for-tat comments and diplomatic actions, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leaders of the Hamas militant group. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu’s government does not like,\" Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it's too heavy. It's too important.” Angry words abounded Monday, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognizing a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence — those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares slammed the comments, and said his colleagues from Ireland and non-EU member Norway were “also receiving absolutely unjustified and absolutely reprehensible provocations from our Israeli colleague” because of their plans to recognize Palestine. \"In the face of those who want to divide us with any type of intimidating propaganda, the unity of Europeans is essential to send a very powerful message,\" he said. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The latest attacks have centered on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 people Sunday , hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that such strikes will have long-standing repercussions. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. The strikes came after the U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice , on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. Albares said that Spain and other countries asked Borrell “to provide a list of what measures the European Union could apply\" to make Israel heed the ICJ’s ruling and explain what the EU has done in the past in similar circumstances \"\"when there has been a flagrant violation of international law.” Spain, Ireland and Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. Their joint announcement last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries' ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by the three countries might make on the ground. The recognition, however, is a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Albares criticized the treatment of the European ambassadors in Israel. “We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” he said. “But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall for any provocation that distances us from our goal,” he added. “Our aim is to recognize the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.” Colleen Barry contributed from Milan and Aritz Parra from Madrid.

        "content": "BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza's city of Rafah. In tit-for-tat comments and diplomatic actions, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leaders of the Hamas militant group. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu’s government does not like,\" Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it's too heavy. It's too important.” Angry words abounded Monday, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognizing a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence — those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz.

        "content": "The end of the polling process for the five Lok Sabha seats in Jammu and Kashmir marks a significant milestone in the region’s democratic history. It is the first such poll after the abrogation of Article 370 in August 2019. The turnout was 58 percent, the highest in 35 years. This election has shattered previous records, reflecting a degree of renewed faith in the electoral process among the people of J&K. The election stood out not only for its high turnout but also for the peaceful conduct of the polling process. Despite the region’s history of election boycott and violence, the exercise was largely incident-free, with only isolated disturbances reported. Over the past more than three decades, Kashmir has consistently witnessed low voter turnout due to conflict and political disillusionment. The Anantnag-Rajouri seat which was the last to go to poll saw a turnout of 53 percent, the highest since 1984. This is a stark contrast to the 9 percent turnout in 2019, highlighting a dramatic shift in voter engagement. Similarly, Baramulla and Srinagar saw turnouts of 59.1 percent and 38.49 percent, respectively, the highest in decades. However, the high voter turnout should not overshadow the need for ongoing efforts to ensure free and fair elections. The Election Commission must continue to address challenges such as electoral fraud, voter intimidation, and logistical hurdles that undermine the integrity of the electoral process. Transparent and accountable electoral practices are essential to maintain public trust and confidence in democracy. As the region moves forward, it is imperative that the authorities build on this momentum by addressing underlying issues, fostering political stability, and ensuring that the voices of all citizens are heard and respected. And to start it would be helpful if the central government holds Assembly elections in the union territory, now that the parliament polls have been a roaring success without the usual boycott or the spurt in violence. On a positive note, home minister Amit Shah has said that the Assembly election will be held before September this year in line with the Supreme Court’s direction. Should that happen, J&K will have a democratically elected government after September. And subsequently, it would be in the fitness of things if the union government reinstates statehood, which again is a promise made by the prime minister Narendra Modi and home minister Shah. .However, much depends on what happens on June 4 and which party’s or a coalition’s government comes to power at the centre. Until then all we can do is keep our fingers crossed.",

The elections to the Upper House will take place on June 25. The number of vacancies in the respective states are: Kerala-3 and Maharashtra-1. The term of office of three Kerala members of Rajya Sabha is due to expire on their retirement on July 1, 2024. The MPs are Binoy Viswam, Elamaram Kareem and Jose K Mani.

        "content": "With springtime ushering in the warmer weather, longer days and (whisper it) breaks from school, it's the best time to get the family outdoors for a wee day out to keep them entertained. One museum not far from the city is ideal for wee ones who love farm animals, tractors or just fun days out in general. The , in East Kilbride, is just over 20 minutes drive from the city centre. It offers not only the museum but also a working farm, where you can get up close and personal with their most recent arrivals, the adorable purebred baby Highland cows, Maisie and Ishbel. The farm is also home to other farm favourites including Heilan coo mums Ceo and Airgead, dad Lewis, rare-breed Tamworth pigs, this year’s new lambs, hens and cockerel Russell, as well as Anna and Gina, the Museum’s two magnificent Clydesdale horses. Alongside learning about life on the farm, you'll also be able to enjoy a tour and even get to enjoy watching the milking of the Ayrshire dairy herd at 3.15 pm each afternoon. Open seven days a week, from 10 am until 5 pm, the top museum, farmhouse and historic working farm also features a play park, picnic and play area where children can have fun. Not only that but their magnifying glass posts allow wee ones to inspect things like insects and plants up close to learn more about them. They will also get then chance to see Scotland’s largest collection of tractors, combine harvesters and other farming machinery. You can also visit the Georgian farmhouse where Lanarkshire’s Reid family lived for 10 generations, with rooms decorated as they would have been in the 1950s. While the museum building houses galleries that reveal the story of Scotland’s rural past. Tickets are priced at £10 per adult (£9 for concessions) and £7 for children 5-15 (Under 5s go free) while family tickets are also available. Free for members of either National Museums or the National Trust for Scotland.",

She added: “I’ll cherish the five years we had. I guess he just wasn’t my Prince Charming.” The unexpected announcement has sent fans into a frenzy with one asking: “Is this about Ryan or your ex?” Another person asked: “But didn’t you just move to another country with him?” Responding to being asked if “this is for real”, AJ said: “Unfortunately it is, no jokes this time.” AJ’s ex-partner Ryan is from London, while AJ is from Australia. The pair met at a college and have been inseparable since. In a follow-up video, AJ said she’s “waiting for this to be a prank”. Speaking to , AJ opened up about how gender-reassignment surgery “really did change my life”. Talking about coming out as , she added: “The first person I told was my little sister Kiana. We would talk about it a lot and we basically grew up together, so she created a safe space where I knew she would understand. “Even though there were people [who] already knew (I didn’t really have a coming out process), I just knew I could talk to her about it and she would love me either way.”",

        "content": "Calgary Flames defenseman Nikita Okhotiuk has signed a two-year deal with CSKA Moscow of the Kontential Hockey League (KHL). Okhotiuk was acquired by the Flames from the San Jose Sharks for a 2024 5th round pick. That pick was originally included as part of the return from Vancouver in the Nikita Zadorov trade. The Flames can still retain Okhotiuk’s rights if they give him a qualifying offer by June 30th, as he’s a pending restricted free agent. Nikita Okhotyuk has signed a 2 year deal with CSKA. Clearly no concern with the intentional ban that remains in effect. The 23-year-old was originally a 2nd-round pick by the New Jersey Devils in 2019. He was then traded to San Jose as a part of the blockbuster Timo Meier deal . He only appeared in nine games for Calgary and managed to record one assist. He was a plus/minus – 2. In his NHL career so far, Okhotiuk has played 67 games notching 12 total points. In his short stint with the Flames, he mostly played a shutdown role on the 3rd defensive pair. Regarding Okhotiuk’s departure, Calgary has many options available for defensive depth. Players such as Brayden Pachal , Joel Hanley and Ilya Solovyov are all solid third-pair options who play a similar style. The Flames also have young defenders in Jeremie Poirier , Artem Grushnikov, and Hunter Brzustewicz. It’s a likely scenario that we see these young players get looks with the big club next season as the youth movement continues. It’s unfortunate that Okhotiuk didn’t get a longer look, but his departure just opens up an opportunity for another young player to potentially earn a job. Flames Have Other Defensive Decisions To Make There’s also the issue with Oliver Kylington and whether he’ll be extending his contract in Calgary. The 27-year-old Swedish defenseman missed the entire 2022-2023 season due to personal reasons and re-joined the team in January. Kylington was solid in his return with the team as in 33 games, he recorded three goals and eight points. There’s no doubt that Kylington is a top-4 defenseman on this current Flames team. Calgary would love to bring him back but news on negotiations has been minimal. If Kylington does return with the Flames, it’ll be on a short-term deal. The term would likely be around 1-2 years and more of a “show me” type of deal. The Flames may also look to bring in another top-4 defensemen via trade or free agency. If a quick retool is what the Flames are going for, the blueline is an area that must be addressed. This article first appeared on NHL Trade Talk and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "V Venu has said media reports hinting at a relaxed liquor policy were baseless.",
        "content": "After the Tourism Director's explanation on May 26, it is now Chief Secretary V Venu's turn to defend Tourism Minister P A Mohammad Riyas and the government. An official release put out by the Public Relations Department in the Chief Secretary's name termed media reports that hinted at a relaxed liquor policy as \"baseless\". \"Media reports on the lines that the State Excise Policy will be tweaked to do away with dry days are baseless,\" the PRD release said quoting the Chief Secretary. \"Such propaganda is being spread by misinterpreting the meetings called at the behest of the Chief Secretary to improve the financial position of the state,\" it said. It was a voice clip that popped up recently that made the tourism director (in charge) Shikha Surendran’s meeting with tourism stakeholders on May 21 controversial. The voice clip - of Animon, the Idukki district president of the Bar Owners' Association, and recorded on May 23 - exhorted members across Kerala to contribute Rs 2.5 lakh each to get the Excise Policy revised in their favour. This was widely seen as a bribe mobilisation drive two days after the tourism director's meeting to discuss the 'dry day' issue. The tourism minister denied any knowledge of such a meeting. \"I have not asked to make any changes in the Excise Policy,\" Riyas said. The tourism director (in charge), too, said that the meeting was not held under the instructions of the minister. She said the meeting discussed the hurdles that stood in the way of transforming Kerala into a wedding destination and also the problems of MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, conventions, exhibitions) tourism. The PRD release on Monday said that a meeting called by the tourism director on May 21 was part of a series of meetings that were held after the Chief Secretary convened a meeting on March 1 and asked secretaries to come up with innovative measures to tackle Kerala’s fiscal distress. The meeting of secretaries called by the Chief secretary on March 1 discussed the state's fiscal situation and also ways to improve the efficiency of governance. \"Many issues were discussed during the meeting, including the consequences of the centre's move to curb the state's borrowing limit,\" the release said. \"The utilisation of Urban Infrastructure Development Fund, cases pending in courts and ways to improve Ease of Doing Business were also discussed,\" it said. At the March 1 meeting, the secretaries were told to hold further discussions on the issues. They were told to actively participate in these discussions, contribute ideas and eventually come up with plans of action within two months. The March 1 meeting also identified various issues and sectors that required greater attention. One such issue, according to the Chief Secretary, was the 'dry day' problem and how 12 dry days a year was affecting the MICE sector. The Chief Secretary had also directed the tourism secretary to do a fact-based assessment of the losses suffered by the tourism sector as a consequence of the 'dry day' policy. He also told the tourism secretary to hold discussions with various stakeholders in the tourism sector and to submit a detailed report. The release also said that it was routine for the tourism director to hold constant interactions with stakeholders in the tourism industry. Further, Venu said that the demand to scrap 'dry days' was a long-standing demand of the tourism sector. The same demand had been voiced by stakeholders in the excise sector, too. The issue came up during a meeting of excise stakeholders called by the Chief Secretary on January 4. However, a final decision on this has not been taken. \"Such discussions on improving the finances of the state were held only at the level of officials. It was these discussions of a routine nature that are now being misinterpreted to mean that the government was planning to revise the Excise Policy,\" the Chief Secretary said.",

        "content": "The Bank of Industry (BOI) has announced the extension of the application for the Rural Area Program for Investment and Development (RAPID) for Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and Community groups in rural areas to June 12. This was disclosed in a post on the official X handle of the bank where it explained that the extension of the deadline was to allow entrepreneurs the opportunity to apply for the loan. It states, “The application deadline for the RAPID initiative has been extended to June 12, 2024, allowing all interested entrepreneurs the opportunity to participate.” Related Stories Development Bank disburses N787 billion to 495,000 MSMEs in Nigeria Gender bias hinders financial backing of women entrepreneurs-IFC The RAPID funding program aims to provide loans of up to N10 million to MSMEs in rural areas at a 5% interest rate for a tenure of 3 years. The bank noted that interested applicants visit its website to apply. The objective of the program is to assist communities in rural and economically disadvantaged areas in utilizing available resources to develop enterprises. These enterprises aim to provide employment, improve the standard of living, contribute to national growth, and address insecurity stemming from youth restiveness. The Bank of Industry (BOI) earlier in May launched the RAPID program in Lagos with the target of empowering 10 beneficiaries per state and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) totalling 370 beneficiaries. Following the removal of fuel subsidy, the federal government announced various grants and loan programs aimed at alleviating the impact of the subsidy removal on their businesses. The programs include; the N75 billion single-digit loan to manufacturers and the N50,000 grant to nano businesses across the 744 local government areas of the country. There is also a N200 billion grant to Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) all over the country. The Federal Government’s Presidential Conditional Grant Scheme (PCGS) , offers non-repayable financial grants to eligible small business owners in various sectors, including trading, food services, ICT, transportation, creative industries, and artisans. The PCGS plans to allocate 70% of the grants to women and youths, 10% to individuals with disabilities, and 5% to senior citizens, with the remaining 15% designated for other demographics. The Bank of Industry (BOI) is also partnering with the federal government in the distribution of the N200 billion loan to manufacturers and SMEs across the country which has already been launched. According to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Dr. Doris Uzoka Anitie, under the program, N75 billion will be distributed to MSMEs while another N75 billion will be distributed to the manufacturing industry under the Presidential Intervention Fund.",

        "description": "IPL 2024 was one of the most exciting seasons with several thrilling contests taking place. Kolkata Knight Riders ended up winning the IPL 2024 title with a dominant eight-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad. Read below to check full list of IPL winners after end of season 17.",
        "content": "After 74 high-octane matches, IPL 2024 has come to an end, with Kolkata Knight Riders emerging as the champions. Shreyas Iyer and his men were dominant all season and deservedly came out on top in one of the one-sided contests of the season. Batting first, Sunrisers Hyderabad were bowled out for just 113 runs, the lowest score in an IPL final and later, Kolkata Knight Riders chased down the target in just 10.3 overs with Venkatesh Iyer scoring a quickfire half-century. This was KKR's third title win and first after 10 years. The Kolkata Knight Riders also became the third team in IPL history to win more than three titles. IPL 2024 will always be remembered by fans as one of the most exciting ever. Batters put up explosive shows with totals in excess of 200 and even 250 on some occasions breached quite easily. While the initial phase of the competition was all about batters putting up big scores at astoundingly high strike rates, bowlers made a comeback in the later half of IPL 2024. IPL 2024 also saw the record of most sixes hit in a single IPL season with the ball being sent over the boundary for a whopping 1260 times. Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians are the most successful teams in the history of the IPL, winning the title five times each. KKR are second on the list of most trophies won, with the Knight Riders winning their third title. Rajasthan Royals were champions of the inaugural edition with Shane Warne guiding them to the title. Deccan Chargers (now defunct) and Sunrisers Hyderabad have won one title each. Royal challengers Bengaluru (RCB), Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) are the teams who are yet to open their accounts. After reaching the finals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru had hard luck three times; they couldn’t make it to the podium. They reached the finals in 2009, 2011, 2016 and were declared runner-ups all three times.",

Meaning taking 2 slots overall? Think a backpack slot, that can resupply any mech.” Many players noted that a Stratagem should as a Mech should not be as weak as it is, including who said “I don’t usually complain about balance but this is borderline sabotage considering this should be the one that gets the playerbase excited again.

        "content": "London 'Felt like I was at the Bud': Knights players feeling fan support at Memorial Cup Share Riding a six-game win streak, the Knights want to keep the momentum going tonight in Saginaw, MI. London faces Moose Jaw in their second game of the Memorial Cup tournament, and a victory would put them one win away from the final. That is where the host Saginaw Spirit find themselves after Hunter Haight of Strathroy, Ont. scored the game winner Sunday night in a 4-3 win over Drummondville. With London only three hours southwest of the tournament, they expect to have another large fan base Monday. Of the 4,936 fans in attendance for their first contest Saturday, it felt like the majority were wearing green and gold. “I scored and I felt like I was at the ‘Bud’ [Budweiser Gardens],” said Oliver Bonk. “I heard a lot of people, and it was great to have that much support. There were ‘Go Knights Go’ chants all around. It is really cool to come to an away barn and have that support.” London defeated Drummondville, the champions of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, Saturday 4-0. The London Knights practice in Saginaw, Mich. ahead of their game against the Moose Jaw Warriors Monday night. (Brent Lale/CTV News London) Monday they meet the Warriors, another team they have never played against. “It’s a little bit unknown, that’s the way it is in this tournament,” said Knights Coach Dale Hunter. He felt both Moose Jaw and Saginaw showed a little rust Friday in the opener, so it was tough to gauge which version of the Warriors showed up.

The play picked up as the game went on.” The Warriors trailed 4-0 to the Spirit Friday, but bounced back after a slow start and nearly tied the game. The Moose Jaw Warriors lace up their skates before practice in Saginaw, Mich. on Sunday May 26, 2024. (Brent Lale/CTV News London) “They are a very good team, very good players in there as we saw [on TV Friday],” said Kasper Halttunen, Knights forward who scored in game one. “If you give them anything they'll score. We’ve got to be ready.”The Warriors coaching staff were in the stands Saturday to see the Knights play live for the first time. They saw what they expected after tracking London on game film for a couple of weeks. “It was as advertised with London, as we've seen them on video a lot,” said Warriors head coach Mark O’Leary. “It's pretty easy to access all that stuff [game video], but it was nice to watch them live and in person. They are a heck of a team. They are deep up front and on the back end, and they have a goaltender [Michael Simpson] that can make saves when they need it.” Moose Jaw Warriors head coach Mark O’Leary explains a drill to his players during practice in Saginaw, Mich. on Sunday May 26, 2024. (Brent Lale/CTV News London) With Drummondville losing both games to start their tournament, the Warriors could guarantee at least a spot in the tiebreaker game with a win tonight. “We need this win,” said Warriors forward Pavel McKenzie. “Hopefully we get off to a strong start. Last game, we didn't get off to a strong start.”In a short tournament, every game has huge implications. A victory would give the Knights a 2-0 start, and set up a winner-direct-to-final matchup with host Saginaw Wednesday. A loss and London could face anything from tiebreaker game to Sunday final depending on the result of their next game.

        "description": "Akshata Murty gets proactive as hubby Rishi Sunak fights to keep Tories afloat",
        "content": "Akshata Murty, Britain’s Indian first lady, has begun getting proactive as prime minister and husband Rishi Sunak hits the campaign trail in a tough race ahead for the governing Conservatives, starting with a supportive message to say she’s with him “every step of the way”, hours after a rain-soaked Sunak announced 4 July as the general election date on the steps of 10 Downing Street. The 44-year-old businesswoman has used her Instagram handle to post campaign messages in favour of Sunak, who is hoping to prove all the pre-election surveys forecasting a drubbing for the Tories wrong. The couple, who met while studying at Stanford University in the US and are among the richest incumbents of Downing Street in history — in large part owing to Murty’s Infosys shares worth millions of pounds — are expected to work as a team through the course of the just over five-week campaign. “People always ask us – ‘What is the thing you have most in common?’ It’s not just our shared love of watching ‘Friends’ reruns and eating Spanish food. It’s the values that we share,” reads a joint statement signed 'Akshata and Rishi' on social media. Also Read: UK: Labour scrutiny over closure of company owned by Akshata Murthy “We share the belief that hard work should decide where you go in life. We share the belief that it takes bold action to make a difference. We share the belief that our children will inherit a better world than the one we share today,” it reads. It was posted on Instagram over the weekend soon after a campaign stop at Harrow in north London, where the duo said the focus was on the “values that matter\". During her time at 10 Downing Street — where the family settled in October 2022 on Sunak being chosen Conservative Party leader — Murty has been hosting 'Lessons at 10' for schoolchildren to learn more about life behind the iconic black door on the most famous street in London. Last week, just as the snap summer election date was revealed by her husband, she hosted a special event to commemorate the D-Day Landings of World War II that laid the foundations for the victory of the allied forces against Nazi Germany. Accustomed to a more behind the scenes role, Murty has often stepped up to the forefront in support of her husband’s premiership since a surprise debut on the political stage in October last year when she introduced “best friend” Sunak for his first speech as British prime minister to the Conservative Party's annual conference in Manchester. “Rishi and I met when we were 24 when we were both studying abroad in America. Right from the very beginning, I was struck by two things about him... his deep love for his home, the United Kingdom, and his sincere desire to ensure as many people as possible have a chance to have the opportunities he was lucky enough to have had. It completely energised him. Being with Rishi was the easiest decision of my life,” she said at the time. Murty, daughter of Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy and author Sudha Murty, had claimed her decision to make the speech had surprised their daughters Krishna (12) and Anoushka (11). Now, with the general election campaign set to gather momentum in the coming weeks, the Sunak family is expected to be out in full force to support the country's first prime minister of Indian heritage to appeal to voters across the UK for a fresh mandate Follow us on: Facebook , Twitter , Google News , Instagram Join our official telegram channel ( @nationalherald ) and stay updated with the latest headlines",

        "description": "Brighton look set to make a major change at the Amex",
        "content": "The days of 'away ends' at football are all but over, especially in the higher divisions. Those two words are still used but they usually refer to the away section, which tends to be in a corner or down one side of the pitch rather than an actual ‘end’ behind a goal. Ironically, Albion – who had an away corner at the Goldstone when most others had ‘ends’ – now have the last genuine 'away end' in the Premier League. But that may well change 15 months or so from now. Albion are looking to move the 3,000-seat away section from behind the goal in the South Stand to a different area – which would obviously be in one corner and/or side area of the Amex. The view is the current configuration gives an illusion of greater away support and takes away part of the home advantage. Such a move would put them in line with every other current Prem club and most in the Championship. Yes, away fans are technically behind a goal at Newcastle but they are way, way up in the top tier, far from the pitch and behind a huge bank of home supporters. Other clubs offer visitors part of one end, such as at Liverpool, Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Fulham. Sheffield United had an away end, with visitors given the lower tier and generally having a ball there, but they have now departed. In the Championship, there are away ends at Millwall, QPR and Preston. Otherwise, you will find yourselves on the side of the pitch, towards one end, at Everton, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and promoted Ipswich. At both Manchester clubs, Arsenal, Tottenham, West Ham, Brentford, Southampton and Leicester you will be in, or close to, the corner, although some of those sections extend to near the goal. Wolves generally give visitors the full length of the pitch along the lower tier, which can make it hard to co-ordinate singing, although there is an alternative corner section. The trend extends to Europe. Albion fans were in corners at all four Europa away games. Any change at the Amex would purely be for perceived sporting advantage. In their account of a recent appearance by chief executive Paul Barber at Seagulls Over London, the club reported: “Paul said that away fans will almost certainly be moved to a different part of the Amex from the 2025-26 season. “Although there was no statistical evidence that the current South Stand arrangements gave visitors any benefit, the consensus inside the club is that what looks like 25% of the stadium being given to visitors (despite the 10% allocation) can motivate away sides where they attack the South end where their fans are.” Visiting fans have been in the South Stand ever since the Amex opened in 2011, although some smaller away allocations have allowed home supporters to be behind that goal. Away teams clearly enjoy attacking that way in the second half and it is very rare for a visiting skipper to turn the teams around on winning the toss at kick-off. Aston Villa were among the first teams to do away with an away end and put visiting fans in a side area. That was back in 2007, when manager Martin O’Neill said it would be advantageous to have home supporters behind both goals. It remains to be seen to what extent Albion will follow suit. Barber has also given some more information as to how the Fan Zone at the Amex will operate. The new £7 million facility, opposite the ticket office, will open a few weeks into the coming season. Capacity will be about 1,000 people in colder months, when it is an indoor venue. But that number will double in warmer weather with sides opened out. There will be no admission fee and Albion promise lots of different food and drink options, live music and big screens for live sport. The Fan Zone will also be used for events away from matchdays.",

        "content": "JJ Redick is the reported front-runner to succeed Darvin Ham as Lakers head coach. Although Los Angeles is in the early stages of its coaching search, several insiders expect Redick to edge out other candidates such as Sam Cassell, James Borrego and Chris Quinn for the high-profile job. On the Sunday issue of his substack , Marc Stein reported that the Lakers are leaning towards naming Redick their new coach. The report further named three high-profile assistants earmarked as Redick's potential staff members should he get the Lakers job. \"More smoke to support the idea that ESPN's JJ Redick is indeed the leading candidate to land the Lakers' head coaching job,\" Stein wrote. \"Rumbles about possible staff targets for Redick have already begun to circulate. League sources say fellow Lakers search candidates Sam Cassell [Boston] and James Borrego [New Orleans] would be prime targets for Redick's staff. As well as an expected run at trying to bring Mavericks assistant coach Jared Dudley back to Lakerland.\" The report also cited Dudley's \"strong relationships\" with LeBron James and Anthony Davis as a factor in the Redick-led staff wanting to bring him on board. Dudley played his final two seasons with the Lakers and won a championship with them in 2020. The idea of Redick — who co-hosts a podcast with James — being named Lakers coach has incited polarizing reactions from former NBA players. While Udonis Haslem believes Redick and James' friendship could give birth to a \"cynical locker room,\" Channing Frye has cautioned Redick against taking \"a death sentence\" of a job. Others such as Matt Barnes and Jamal Crawford have expressed confidence in Redick succeeding in the role.",

        "content": "The Immutable X crypto project stands out from the crowd as a promising investment option in the crypto world that goes through constant ups and downs. In this article, we provide an in-depth prediction of the IMX token’s price, giving you valuable advice if you want to invest in this project. Our analysis will help you decide whether it is a good time to invest in the IMX token or if you should hold your horses for a while and wait for the right time to invest. Additionally, we will explore another potential investment option, the 5thScape project, which has been making the rounds on the internet this year. Can the 5thScape project, despite being a new entrant, beat the odds and become a more promising investment opportunity than Immutable X? We will explore both projects’ native token utility and understand how they differ from each other. Unlocking the Future: A Look at Potential Price Paths for IMX Immutable X is an NFT trading project based on Ethereum’s blockchain technology. At the moment, it is addressing issues that are typically related to traditional NFT marketplaces, which include limited scalability and high fees. The project tackles these two persisting issues with its own Layer-2 solution. Based on our analysis, Immutable X’s price forecast is bullish, predicting a jump of 228.5% to $7.85 by June 26th, 2024. While technical indicators suggest a neutral sentiment, the Fear & Greed Index indicates Greed (74). Over the past 30 days, Immutable X has seen 15 green days, i.e. positive days (50%) with its token’s price volatility of 7.04%. Immutable X (IMX) vs. 5thScape (5SCAPE) – Which Holds More Potential? The Immutable X platform is focused on developing a platform designed explicitly for Web3 games. It addresses common issues in these games, such as limited player control over in-game items. With Immutable X, players can own their in-game items as real assets using NFTs (non-fungible tokens). This eliminates the frustration of losing virtual items when you stop playing a game. Its technology tackles slow transactions and high fees but faces competition from similar projects. The IMX token service has a less-than-exciting purpose. Thiss native token of the Immutable X platform only secures the blockchain technology that the platform runs on. It is also used to reward the traders and marketplaces that support the Immutable X network. >>Click Here to Visit 5thScape Presale Page On the other hand, 5thScape has created a unique niche. It is a VR content hub that uses blockchain technology to offer a vast library of VR experiences. It has everything in an immersive setting, from movies and games to educational content. The native token of 5thScape, 5SCAPE, holds a broader use case as it is a golden ticket to explore the 5thScape’s VR universe. 5SCAPE token holders can access the vast library of 5thScape for a heavenly entertainment experience. Additionally, various staking opportunities come with this token. So, IMX is a solid option if you are looking for a hot NFT marketplace. But if you crave unique VR experiences and want to be part of a growing VR community, the 5SCAPE token might be the more promising choice due to its platform’s established position in this innovative field. Know 5thScape – Unlocking New Worlds: 5thScape’s Vision for VR Entertainment As mentioned earlier, 5thScape offers a vast and ever-expanding VR library beyond games. Here, one can dive deep into immersive VR movies, educational content that makes learning engaging, and the latest addition to its library—the exhilarating Cage of Conquest MMA fighter game available on MetaQuest. Everything within the 5thScape platform, from the content library to exciting games, requires the 5SCAPE token as your access ticket. However, the VR experience continues. To truly feel like you have stepped into another world, 5thScape offers a range of physical VR accessories designed for seamless integration with its online platform. These include the innovative SwiftScape VR Chair for ultimate comfort and the Ultra HD VR Headset for stunningly high-resolution visuals, ensuring you are fully immersed in the virtual scene. With VR technology rapidly setting its foothold across multiple markets, 5thScape’s comprehensive VR experience positions it as a leader. This makes it a dream destination for VR enthusiasts. With a continuously growing user base, the value of the 5SCAPE token, which fuels this entire ecosystem, is likely to increase, matching the unparalleled growth of VR technology. Why 5thScape (5SCAPE) Might Be a Bolder Investment Than Immutable X (IMX) While Immutable X (IMX) offers a compelling solution for NFT ownership in web3 games, 5thScape (5SCAPE) presents a potentially more groundbreaking opportunity. Here’s a breakdown of why 5thScape might be the stronger investment! The key difference lies in market position. Immutable X faces competition from a growing pool of similar NFT marketplaces. 5thScape, however, carves a unique niche in the booming VR entertainment market. Its VR content hub offers a vast library of experiences (movies, games, education), while Immutable X limits itself to NFT content. Furthermore, the adoption of Virtual Reality (VR) technology is rapidly increasing, driving user growth for platforms like 5thScape. This expanding user base creates a strong foundation for the 5SCAPE token’s value. Although the NFT market holds promise, its long-term trajectory remains to be seen. The utility of the tokens also differs. The IMX token facilitates NFT trading on the Immutable X platform. The 5SCAPE token, however, serves as a gateway to the entire 5thScape ecosystem. Users need 5SCAPE to access the VR content library, creating direct demand for the token and potentially driving its value. Finally, 5thScape is a leader in VR content built on blockchain. This first-mover advantage could solidify its position in developing VR entertainment, attracting users and developers before competitors catch up. Final Thoughts on 5thScape – A Promising Player in VR While Immutable X offers a promising solution for NFT ownership in web3 games, with our analysis suggesting a potential price surge, 5thScape might be a more future-proof option for savvy investors. Unlike IMX, which faces competition in the crowded NFT marketplace, 5thScape has created its prime position in the rapidly growing VR entertainment sector. Its diverse VR library offers experiences beyond games, creating a distinct value proposition. Not to mention, the adoption of VR technology is skyrocketing, driving user bases for platforms like 5thScape. This expanding user base creates a strong foundation for the 5SCAPE token’s value, potentially surpassing the long-term trajectory of the NFT market. Additionally, the IMX token primarily facilitates NFT trading, whereas the 5SCAPE token acts as a gateway to the entire 5thScape ecosystem. It serves more utility than the IMX token. Ultimately, both IMX and 5thScape represent exciting ventures with significant potential. IMX offers a familiar NFT solution with a chance of high returns, while 5thScape presents a lucrative opportunity in the surging VR entertainment space. Further fueling its appeal, 5SCAPE has witnessed a massive price increase since its first presale round, reflecting growing demand for the token. This momentum suggests a strong debut on exchanges, making it one to watch for long-term investors.",

        "description": "European airports with the best and worst pre-flight experiences have been revealed, with Berlin Brandenburg, Munich Airport, Brussels Airport, Hamburg Airport and Stockholm Arlanda Airport making the top five",
        "content": "A major European airport has been named the worst to get stuck in in the Continent. Going on holiday or travelling is normally always exciting, but when travellers get to their airport usually a few hours before their flight, a lot of boredom can kick in. Picture this - you just got to the airport and it is 4am. All you are dreaming of is a good coffee to take the edge off your tiredness. But instead of being greeted by fast wait times and a cosy café, you see a lengthy security queue and no sign of a coffee shop. To try and help reduce airport dismay this summer, the travel experts at eurochange have revealed the airports with the best and worst pre-flight experiences in Europe. Analysing the 40 busiest airports across Europe, airports were scored for their number of flight delays , average security wait times, array of restaurants and shops, the cost of an airport lounge ticket, and even the presence of unique attractions. World's most turbulent flights mapped after passengers injured in terrifying incidents - see list Germany secured two of the top five spots, while London Heathrow missed out on fifth by one point ( Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Henri Coandă, Bucharest At the bottom of the pile is Henri Coandă in Bucharest. The Romanian airport has been ranked as the most ‘boring’ airport on the Continent, it doesn't get better when it comes to prices around the airport. An airport lounge ticket will set travellers back £40 per person making it the second most expensive in Europe for airport lounge tickets, behind Charles de Gaulle in Paris. On review website Skytrax the airport has been awarded a meagre 3/10 from more than 100 reviews. One unhappy customer wrote: \"This is the worst airport. There are no sitting areas at all. People sit on the floors, on rails, stairs. I had a business class ticket but because I arrived too early to the airport I couldn’t use the business class lounge Because the check in for my baggage was an hour before the flight! Shame on you! Total disappointment.\" Another joined in the kicking, adding: \"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience. The airport was eerily empty, creating a rather unwelcoming atmosphere. But the real frustration began with the inefficiency in handling our luggage. It took them over an hour to offload our bags from the plane. \"This caused us to miss our connecting flight. Their lack of urgency and disregard for passengers' schedules was appalling. The entire ordeal was not only time-consuming but also added unnecessary stress to our journey. I strongly advise travellers to consider other options if possible.\" A third wrote: \"Horrible experience, long queuing times especially at security, and rude, unprofessional staff. Flying is already a stressful experience, every time I am at this airport it makes it an absolutely horrible experience. Would definitely not recommend, and a shame for anyone visiting Bucharest to have this as a first point of contact.\" Other travel airports named among the worst were Porto Airport in Portugal, Nice Côte d'Azur Airport in France and Warsaw Chopin airport in Poland. Bristol airport came 38th out of the 40 airports assessed, scoring zero for both kids attractions and unique attractions. 'I'm solo travelling the world in my 70s - it's better than being old and lonely' 'Person behind me demanded I stop reclining my plane seat – I was fuming' Berlin Brandenburg, Germany The number one airport on the list for the best pre-flight experience is Berlin Brandenburg in Germany. The airport has the fewest delays, in fact, you’re least likely to be delayed at this airport in the first place. An impressive 80% of flights depart on time and its average security wait time is just 7 minutes. There is also lots to do at Brandenburg including options for kids, such as an entire playground and a special children’s TV corner. For the art lovers, make sure you look up at the ceiling when they check in — it features a beautiful Magic Carpet art installation. For many, a good alcoholic beverage makes being stuck in that two-hour limbo period waiting to board a place, more bearable. At €4.90 (£4.17) for a large beer, the airport scored full marks for its beer price, compared to Copenhagen , where it will set you back 249 Krona (£18.31). Munich Airport, Munich, Germany Munich airport closely followed behind Berlin Brandenburg, where the average security wait time is just five minutes. Munich also has plenty to offer while travellers wait including the world’s first airport brewery, where you can even get a guided tour before you fly. It also has an observation deck on level five, above the terminal two check-in area. Brussels Airport in Belgium followed in third, Hamburg Airport in Germany fourth and Stockholm Arlanda Airport in Sweden took the fifth spot. London Heathrow narrowly missed out on the top five by just one point, scoring well on its shops, flights departing on time and its average wait times.

        "content": "The Minnesota Twins had a couple of players they could have traded this offseason with an ownership group determined to cut payroll. Max Kepler was among the key names in that group . Ultimately though, Kep stayed and it was Jorge Polanco sent packing, instead. On Opening Day, Max Kepler fouled a ball off of his leg and was clearly in pain. When he attempted to play through it, he went a putrid 1-for-20. Finally, the decision to put him on the injured list was made. After 15 days on the IL, Kepler returned to the Twins’ lineup on April 22nd while manager Rocco Baldelli was searching for answers. As it turned out, Kepler was a big part of what was missing. He posted a 1.089 OPS through his first eight games. And he hasn’t looked back since. Max Kepler has overtaken Ryan Jeffers for the team lead in OPS. Pretty amazing considering Kepler was off to a 1-for-20 start when he went on the injured list in mid-April. Kepler has an OPS well over 1.000 since returning. pic.twitter.com/P7peamblN5 In May, Kepler is slashing .333/.403/.623 with 10 doubles and three homers. His wRC+ this month puts him fourth in baseball behind only Aaron Judge, Shohei Ohtani, and Kyle Tucker. What he is doing has helped to provide a necessary thump for a Twins lineup that couldn’t get out of its own way at the beginning of the year. This to follow up one of the best half seasons of his career to end 2023. Of course, we aren’t even halfway through the 2024 season, but but if Kepler continues to produce like he has for nearly a full year now, the Minnesota Twins will have a big decision to make this offseason. In the final year of his six-year extension (signed before the 2019 season), Kepler is set to become a free agent for the first time in his career, after this season. Next summer, Max will be 32 years old, meaning he’s unlikely to get peak value or length of term on the open market. Should he continue to go like this though, Derek Falvey will be hard pressed not to dabble with a qualifying offer. For 2025, the qualifying offer should be expected to check in around $20 million. While that might seem like a lot for Kepler, keeping him in right field provides a consistency on both offense and defense that the Twins can’t really afford to lose. Minnesota has some emerging stars that can play the outfield, but the other corner position is hardly cemented at this point . And as long as Byron Buxton is the center fielder, they will need help at that position too. And Max has made it clear that CF is not for him. It’s hard to fathom that the guy who struggled to post a league average OPS+ in either 2021 or 2022, and has been a constant source of trade talk throughout his career, would be back (especially at $20M) but that’s where we are.
