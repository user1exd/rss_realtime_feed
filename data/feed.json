(SMC) might still pursue the P81.53-billion Pasig River Expressway (Parex) as it puts the project only on hold for further review, taking into consideration the public’s opinion before proceeding. Ramon Ang, SMC president and CEO, told reporters on Monday in Pasay they were “clarifying” the concerns of the public about the project. “[If] it will benefit more people, why not,” he said when asked if they would still go ahead with the project after postponing it for further review.This showed Ang’s easing of stance about the tollway project as he previously said in March they were dropping it due to adverse public opinion. In 2021, the scientist group Advocates of Science and Technology for the People said the proposed elevated expressway would cause damage to the river as it would block the natural sunlight and “affect the remaining food chain of Pasig River.” Private-sector group Ilog Pasiglahin, in a statement in March, said it was critical to preserve the Pasig River as it is also connected to other bodies of water, including Manila Bay, Laguna de Bay, and the rivers of Marikina, San Juan, and Taguig. Toll Regulatory Board Executive Director Alvin Carullo told the media last week the project was on the final engineering design stage. The planned Parex project is a 19.37-kilometer six-lane expressway passing through the Pasig River from Radial Road 10 in Manila and the proposed South East Metro Manila Expressway at Circumferential Road 6.Following the cancellation of the Parex project, SMC announced they broke ground for the 76.8-km Pangasinan Link Expressway, which is seen to support economic activities by linking the eastern and western corridors of the province. —Tyrone Jasper C.

        "content": "Philippine National Bank (PNB) — INQUIRER.net photo MANILA, Philippines — Philippine National Bank (PNB) will be raising $300 million via a medium-term note offering, to build up its coffers for its financing requirements. In a disclosure on Monday, the Lucio Tan-led lender announced that its board had approved the issuance of the note, with an option to upsize, from its $2-billion euro medium-term note program. The bank, however, has yet to disclose further details about the offer period and interest rates attached to the notes, among others. PNB’s euro medium-term note program was established in 2018 to provide a funding source for the company. In 2019, the listed financial institution raised $750 million via the offshore bond market, drawing down from the program. The offered fixed-rate senior notes maturing by September 2024 have a coupon rate of 3.27 percent per annum. READ: PNB raises $750M via offshore bond issuance The bank also tapped the medium-term note program for the launch of $300-million fixed-rate senior note offerings with a coupon rate of 4.25 percent annually and a tenor of five years. Last month, credit watcher Moody’s Ratings affirmed the bank’s foreign currency senior unsecured medium-term note program rating at “(P)Baa3,” which means moderate credit risk. Moody’s also noted that PNB’s nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio has remained “stable” at 7.3 percent as of end-2023 compared to 7.2 percent in 2022. An NPL ratio indicates how much loans extended to clients have remained unpaid and a lower figure means less credit risk for the lender. Should NPLs rise, banks allocate a bigger credit loss provision, which will eventually hurt their bottom line. In the first quarter, PNB grew its net income by 10 percent to P5.3 million as interest income improved by 17 percent to P16.08 billion. Total assets stood at P1.196 trillion as of end-March, while net loans and receivables amounted to P610 billion and deposit liabilities reached P916.4 billion.

        "content": "A recent decision of the Supreme Court is cautionary to people who sign contracts without reading or understanding their content. The case involved a woman who died of hypertension shortly after she finished her exercise routine at a fitness center. Her husband sued the center for negligence on the grounds that it failed to take her blood pressure and for not having a doctor on-site at all times. The lower and appellate courts decided in favor of the husband, but the high court reversed their rulings and dismissed the claim for damages. It said the center was not negligent because she stated in her application that she was not suffering from hypertension despite her duty to inform it of any medical problem before engaging in any exercise activity. In addition, the center’s records and handouts to its members showed that it had no obligation to take their blood pressure and have a doctor on standby at the premises at all times. This case brings to mind the dismissive attitude of many Filipinos toward written contracts in business transactions that require the accomplishment of supporting documents. Thus, for example, transactions with banks, insurance companies, and car dealers are accompanied by various kinds of documents that spell out in detail the duties and responsibilities of the parties, including the consequences that may arise in case those terms are not complied with. Because those papers often consist of several pages and are written in legalese or arcane business words that can cause a nosebleed to a layperson, their signatories often hardly read them and simply affix their signatures. They assume that the other party would act in good faith and would not take advantage of the trust they’ve given them. Besides, requesting clarifications or asking questions may not sit well with the counterparty who may want to conclude the transaction as soon as possible and receive his or her commission, if any. Those documents may be described as “contracts of adhesion” or agreements that have been prepared by the party with whom a transaction is being forged and, for obvious reasons, contain fine print that is favorable or advantageous to it. These are often cleverly concealed in “provided, however” clauses or references to other provisions elsewhere in the document that require close reading. Under these circumstances, the party being asked to sign them is put in a “take it or leave it” position, with the chances of making changes or adjustments in their terms practically nil lest they result in unsustainable precedents. Although going through those papers may look tedious or time-consuming, it is prudent that they be read carefully and when some items are unclear, to ask for clarification. There should be no room for shame or embarrassment about requesting explanations, if warranted, because once the document is signed (and in most cases, notarized) it becomes binding on the parties. Belated claims that a party did not understand the meaning of some of the terms and conditions or had misinterpreted the consequences of failure to comply with them will not receive a favorable ear if the contract becomes the subject of litigation. Bear in mind, however, that business transactions cut both ways. That is, they would, if satisfactorily completed, be mutually beneficial as they would serve the interests of the contracting parties, so the right to be enlightened on vague provisions should be exercised. Another flaw in the treatment of documents in business transactions is ignoring or making light of disclosure requirements or provisions that request relevant personal or professional information. Because these data are relevant to the transaction under consideration, it is essential that they are accurate or up to date, otherwise the failure to do so could be cited as legal basis to invalidate any claims that may arise from the subject documents. Going back to the case of the disallowed claim for damages, the high court had no choice but to dismiss it because if the rules were bent for humanitarian reasons, it would create an unfavorable precedent on the principle of sanctity of contracts that businesses feel very strongly about.

        "content": "Bureau of the Treasury MANILA, Philippines — Rates on short-dated securities snapped four straight weeks of decline during Monday’s sale of Treasury bills (T-bills) amid hawkish signals from the US Federal Reserve. Auction results showed the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) was still able to fully raise its target amount of P15 billion via T-bills sale. The offer attracted total demand amounting to P38.3 billion, 2.5 times larger than the original size of the issuance. Michael Ricafort, chief economist at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., said T-bill rates “corrected slightly higher” after some Fed officials hinted at a delayed rate cut, which may have an influence on the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas’ own easing moves. “Treasury bill average auction yields corrected slightly higher after slightly declining for four straight weeks, after consistent higher-for-longer signals from most officials and from the Fed minutes recently that reduced the odds of a rate cut,” Ricafort said in a commentary sent to journalists. READ: Less hawkish central bank tempers T-bill rates According to the BTr, the 91-day T-bill fetched an average rate of 5.719 percent, more expensive than 5.712 percent in the previous auction. The yield on the 182-day debt notes stood at 5.886 percent, higher than 5.864 percent previously. The 364-day T-bill fetched a rate of 6.043 percent, up from the previous auction’s 6.007 percent. The Marcos administration plans to borrow P585 billion from local creditors in the second quarter of 2024—the same as the financing program in the first quarter. Under the plan, the government is targeting to raise P195 billion via T-bills and P390 billion via Treasury bonds. Overall, the Department of Finance had announced a bigger borrowing plan for this year at P2.57 trillion—from the old program of P2.46 trillion—as the government raises funds to plug a bigger-than-previously-expected budget hole of P1.5 trillion.

        "content": "A new drama has unfolded amid the “ghost employees” scandal haunting the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). On Monday, Monetary Board (MB) member Benjamin Diokno said he “strongly objects” to the “allegation” that the BSP was “politicized” during his term as central bank governor from 2019 to 2022. He issued a strongly worded statement related to the scandal hounding his two fellow MB members—Bruce Tolentino and Anita Linda Aquino, whose offices allegedly hired ghost employees who may have been on the BSP’s payroll for over a year. READ: BIZ BUZZ: MB seats going vacant soon? Diokno took over the BSP as governor in 2019 when he was appointed by former President Rodrigo Duterte, who also picked Tolentino and Aquino as members of the MB, the highest policy-making body of the BSP. “I’m proud of what I did as BSP governor,” Diokno said, adding that Duterte “has respected the independence of the BSP during the most difficult period in the Philippines’ recent history.” “President Duterte never called me to influence monetary policy. It was never politicized,” an incensed Diokno said. Sources said the BSP wants to recover a “significant” amount of salaries and bonuses paid to the ghost employees, as well as give the MB members tied to the controversy an “orderly exit.” That said, the scandal could potentially trigger a major revamp of the MB at a time the BSP is battling stubbornly high inflation and tackling a volatile peso. And markets are watching how the BSP would come out of this crisis that has brought reputational risks to an institution revered for professionalism. —Ian Nicolas P. Cigaral During the Philippine Economic Briefing in Pasay on Monday, tycoon Ramon S. Ang made his stance clear on the country’s territorial dispute against China in front of top government officials. The chief of San Miguel Corp.—an industry giant with diverse business interests including Petron Corp.—told the country’s economic managers the contested West Philippine Sea would benefit the country in terms of oil production. “We have a very big reserve at the West Philippine Sea. That’s why they’re very interested in the Philippines,” said Ang, who was standing tall and poised in the middle of the Philippine International Convention Center’s reception hall as he delivered his short speech. “Let’s not let go of it. We should claim our territory,” he stressed. A round of applause filled the room after. The Department of Energy estimated in 2021 that the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone has 6.2 billion barrels of oil reserves. — Tyrone Jasper C. Piad The government is eyeing bigger private sector participation in the capital buildup of Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), as the state-run lender moves to beef up its buffers following its hefty contribution to the country’s nascent sovereign wealth fund. The Department of Finance’s (DoF) version of a bill seeking to amend DBP’s 26-year-old charter included a proposal to allow the lender to float 30 percent of its capital stock for public ownership, instead of the 20-percent minimum requirement that corporate regulators currently impose to publicly listed firms. READ: IPO seen to strengthen LandBank, DBP Such a proposal came from the DoF, not from DBP, according to Michael de Jesus, company president and CEO. The bank official said such an amendment would give DBP “more flexibility” in raising capital and “encourage” investments from the private sector. De Jesus said that, at the end of the day, the government would still own more than 67 percent of DBP. ”It’s still a super majority,” he said.

At the heart of the charter amendment is the increase in DBP’s authorized capital stock to P300 billion, from the current P35 billion. The proposed capital hike, in turn, would pave the way for the bank’s stock market debut. — Ian Nicolas P. Cigaral",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — Cyberattacks targeting Philippine businesses surged by over threefold last year as threat actors stepped up their game amid increasing digitalization, according to Kaspersky. In a statement on Monday, the Russian cybersecurity firm reported that web-based attacks aimed at local enterprises surged to 1.69 million last year from 492,567 in 2022. Web attacks come in different forms, including the typical phishing emails embedded with suspicious web addresses linking to fake websites. The goal of cyber attackers is to illegally obtain sensitive and personal data they can use to take over one’s bank, e-wallet, and other accounts. Perpetrators have remained active because of financial motivation. With a successful account takeover, they can siphon off money and transfer the amount to their own accounts. Southeast Asia, in total, dealt with more than 13 million cyberattacks last year—about the same amount it fended off in 2022. Kaspersky tracked most of the digital threats in Indonesia with nearly five million attacks, followed by Vietnam with about two million. READ: PH faces more cyberattacks from China-based hackers More than 36,000 online attacks were deployed every day last year in the region, Kaspersky noted. “As most governments in the region build and boost their policies to foster their digital economy and infrastructure, it is urgent for local businesses to prioritize strengthening their cyber defenses against threats lurking online which can hamper their efforts to harness the benefits digitalization brings about,” said Yeo Siang Tiong, Kaspersky general manager for Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Kaspersky also blocked nearly 300,000 ransomware attacks last year in the region. Most of these were detected in Thailand with 109,315 incidents, followed by Indonesia, with 97,226, and Vietnam with 59,837. The Philippines came next with 15,312 ransomware attacks foiled during the period. READ: PH cyberdefenses building up; attacks down in 2023 Ransomware is a cyberattack whereby hackers hold an entity’s network hostage until a ransom is paid. The disruption in operations caused by such cyberattacks is detrimental to the business due to spending related to the retrieval of their data or system, in addition to opportunity costs because of the downtime.

        "content": "A royal source has claimed Princess Kate may not be returning to work for the ”rest of the year” as she continues her cancer battle. Speaking to the Daily Beast last week, an insider close to the princess, 42 - who heartbreakingly revealed her cancer battle in March - has claimed the mother of three currently has an “empty” diary for the rest of the year, insinuating she may not return to public facing duties until 2025. “Lots of people involved in planning need to know what all the principals are doing a long way in advance,” the source said. “I am told that Kate’s diary for this year is empty. There is nothing planned. She may not appear in public for the rest of the year.” The insider continued to allege that the princess is largely focused on her mental health and is doing everything she can to avoid any compromising situations, “The key thing for her now is avoiding any kind of stress or anxiety and just getting on with the business of getting better,” they said. Referencing Prince William and the couple’s three children, Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, 9 and Prince Louis, 6, the source added, “They will bail out and be off to Sandringham the moment school breaks up.” Elsewhere, Page Six has reported that parents whose children attend the same school as William and Kate’s have not seen the future Queen for months. “There have been rumours she has done drop-off, but I haven’t seen her since the video,” one parent told the outlet. “We all feel very protective of her. Ask anyone at the school — they are amazing parents.” It comes after a source shut down claims that Prince Harry sought to mend his estranged relationship with Kate and William after her cancer diagnosis, insisting any chance of a reunion is “a fantasy”. “Meeting with Harry is the last thing that William or Catherine want or need right now,” the source said. “It’s a fantasy. It’s not about apologies or who said what, it is about protecting his family. Kate is recovering from cancer, and they are avoiding stressful situations.” They continued to claim if the Sussexes believe they will “descend on Balmoral this summer” it would be “wishful thinking”. “It’s all just very sad,” the source said. Rumours first began swirling about the alleged phone call when royal expert, Tom Quinn claimed, “Since leaving the UK, Harry has actually contacted at least one royal: Kate.” He added, “She is sympathetic, but fully supports her husband and, struggling with her own health problems, has no intention of playing peacemaker.” Kate announced in March she was undergoing treatment after doctors detected cancer in her body following her major abdominal surgery in January in The London Clinic. She said in the short video: “In January, I underwent major abdominal surgery in London and at the time, it was thought that my condition was non-cancerous. The surgery was successful, however, tests after the operation found cancer had been present. “My medical team therefore advised that I should undergo a course of preventive chemotherapy and I’m now in the early stages of that treatment.” The princess solemnly confessed the news had come as a “huge shock” and continued to praise her husband for his support during “an incredibly tough couple of months for our entire family”.

        "content": "A bakery that was hit with nearly 20 infractions earlier this year has been shut down by Toronto health inspectors. New King of Kings Bakery, which received 18 infractions in March but remained open after receiving a conditional pass, is closed until further notice. The bakery, which offers fresh baked goods and boasts a hot table with everything from turkey to fried fish, had previously passed with no or minor infractions prior to March’s inspection. However, New King of Kings, located at 248 Eddystone Ave. in North York, was forced to shut down after health inspectors issued it a summons and health hazard order on Friday, according to Toronto Public Health . The first of two new crucial violations pertained to the food premises being maintained in a manner permitting a health hazard, specifically insects. The other crucial infraction was that the establishment was “maintained in a manner permitting adverse effect on food,” but the bakery received a “notice to comply” action for the issue. The bakery received five additional infractions — four significant and one minor. The four significant violations were that it failed to protect against the breeding of pests, used food equipment not of readily cleanable form, did not maintain hand-washing stations with soap and paper towels and did not provide an adequate number of hand-washing stations. The one minor infraction was that its equipment surfaces were not sanitized as necessary. A detailed list of infractions at Toronto restaurants can be found on DineSafe .",

Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Anne Wennberg, University of Oslo An international meta study reveals that there may be less of certain mold toxins in organically grown grain, compared to grain grown in the conventional manner. This, and other findings from research into agricultural products, can have major consequences. \"Up until now, the general assumption has been that grain grown using organic methods is more contaminated with mold toxins than grain grown in the conventional way and contaminated grain can pose a health risk to humans. \"An extensive meta analysis published in Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety , demonstrates the opposite,\" says professor Per Ole Iversen. He is one of two scientists from the Department of Nutrition at UiO who participated in the study. Carlo Leifert, professor of organic agriculture and currently a guest professor at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, also both initiated and participated in the study. Iversen is the representative of human medicine in the research group and believes that the study is greatly strengthened by being interdisciplinary. \"The meta study we have just published makes it clear that organic methods of cultivation do not lead to a higher incidence of mold in crops than conventionally grown grain, and to some extent, the opposite is the case: for two types of mold, there was no difference.\" In addition, the study has also revealed a number of advantages linked to organic cultivation. \"Research into organically grown foods has been carried out for many years and many people believe that this type of cultivation is good for both livestock and farmers—and for human health—but we were not quite sure about the latter. \"Now it looks as if organically grown fruit and vegetables have a more favorable content of antioxidants and micronutrients than agricultural products produced in the conventional way, and this can be good for both you and me,\" says Iversen. Iversen believes that the study will have major consequences. \"The myth that organic cultivation has a higher risk of being affected by mold has now been largely refuted. In any case, it should not weaken the message that organic food production is to be recommended,\" says Iversen, adding that these findings are very surprising and have weight, since they are based on a large number of well documented findings from different parts of the world. Iversen and his colleagues have previously conducted a randomized, clinical study among university students , where they also found that organically grown food is advantageous compared to agricultural products cultivated in the normal way. \"We are currently carrying out a new randomized study, which examines two groups of pregnant women : one group is eating organic food while the other is eating ordinary food during pregnancy. We will then carry out a thorough study of the effect of the organic food intake on both mothers and babies for two years following each baby's birth,\" he explains. Per Ole Iversen played two roles in the extensive meta study. \"I participated in the selection of the studies to be included. In addition, I contributed with reflections from a doctor's point of view on what kind of consequences the study could have for the health of ordinary people.\" More information: Juan Wang et al, Mycotoxin contamination in organic and conventional cereal grain and products: A systematic literature review and meta‐analysis, Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety (2024).

        "content": "Kieran McKenna is set to stay at Ipswich and sign a new long-term contract after attracting interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Brighton. The 38-year-old coach has guided Ipswich to back-to-back EFL promotions and a first Premier League campaign at Portman Road for 22 years, but there were question marks over whether he would remain at the club next season. Sky Sports News revealed McKenna was a candidate for the vacant Brighton job following Roberto De Zerbi's departure, while Man Utd officials met with representatives of the Ipswich boss . McKenna was also linked with replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Chelsea, but was told by phone on Sunday that the club were looking elsewhere. Sky Sports News also learned that Ipswich Town majority shareholder Ed Schwartz flew into the UK from the United States at the end of last week for talks with the club's chief executive officer Mark Ashton and McKenna. It is understood discussions were over a proposed new deal. And now the speculation around the Ipswich boss' future is set to end with McKenna poised to extend his stay at Portman Road in what would be a major boost for the newly-promoted club. Ipswich appointed McKenna in 2021, and in his first full season in charge he led Ipswich to promotion from League One to the Championship.

They would prove to be pivotal as Ipswich went on to win 13 of their 15 remaining league games, including eight in a row, to amass 98 points and automatic promotion back to the Championship after a four-year absence. It felt good to be back in the second tier and as this season began, many supporters were hoping to just win more games than they lost and use it as a chance to continue building on the good work of the previous 18 months. But 46 games later they are heading back to the top flight. A season of free-scoring, free-flowing, full-throttle football has seen both Ipswich's and McKenna's stock soar. Erik ten Hag will be replaced as Manchester United manager only if the club believe there is a better option out there. The final decision on Ten Hag’s future will be made during the season review United are carrying out now. Ten Hag is waiting for the outcome of the review but is convinced he is the best man for the job. He is confident United will perform much better in the league next season if he stays – especially if key players remain fit and the club sign a centre back, midfielder and striker.

        "content": "B.C. Place is going to turn into “Da Club” with U.S. rapper 50 Cent set to perform at a pre-game concert at the B.C. Lions’ home opener. The team announced Monday that 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, will headline the Lions’ third annual concert kickoff on June 15 before its first home game of the season against the Calgary Stampeders. “It’s an honour to give our great fans the opportunity to see a world class performer who resonates across multiple generations of music lovers,” said Lions’ owner Amar Doman in a statement. “Concert Kickoff has become a great tradition in Vancouver and 50 Cent is our best one yet.” The Grammy- and Juno-award winning artist skyrocketed to fame in 2003 with his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin’ and its massive hit In Da Club. The rapper was a guest performer in Super Bowl LVI halftime show in 2022 in Los Angeles, performing with Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Mary J. Blige and Kendrick Lamar in what was the first Super Bowl halftime show to feature entirely hip-hop music.

        "description": "Over 130 people died at a single hospital in Sudan's besieged city of El Fasher, inDarfur region, according to Médecins Sans Frontières",
        "content": "Fighting between rival groups in Sudan’s civil war in the battle for control of the city has recently intensified. El Fasher is the last major urban centre in Darfur that remains in the hands of Sudan’s army. The army has been fighting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for more than a year, in a civil war that has killed thousands and forced millions from their homes. The army remains in control of El Fasher. The city has become a refuge for people displaced by fighting in other areas. On 10 May the RSF intensified their assault on the city, in what UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called “an alarming new chapter” in Sudan’s conflict. MSF said one of its hospital was struggling to cope with the increased casualties. South Hospital had treated 979 casualties in just over two weeks, the charity said on Sunday. 134 had died, “a sign of the violent intensity of the fighting”, it added. The medical director of El Fasher’s government-run Saudi hospital told the BBC the situation was “terrible”. “Since the early morning, the RSF began violent artillery shelling of the city, targeting residential areas, markets, and hospitals,” Modther Ibrahim Suliman said. The Saudi and South hospitals are the last functioning in the region. The Saudi Hospital was previously shuttered by the violence but it partially reopened to treat emergency cases. Supplies at the hospital are running low and will last barely a week, the UN said. MSF said it treated more than 900 casualties in the past two weeks. El Fasher residents say that access to food and water has become increasingly difficult. The RSF has been attacking the city from three sides and blocked all supply routes. Despite the hardships, many residents in the city are not leaving their homes because of the fighting, even for emergency medical care. Journalist Mohamed Zakaria said he had no plans to flee. “There is no place to go to... the road is very difficult and dangerous right now”. Earlier this week, a UN expert warned civilians in El Fasher were being targeted because of their ethnicity. Special adviser Alice Wairimu Nderitu added that the Darfur region as a whole was facing a growing risk of genocide as the world’s attention remained focused on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. War erupted in the East African nation on April 15 last year, when the RSF militia and Sudan’s army turned on each other. That followed months of talks over merging their forces and transitioning the mineral-rich country toward democracy. The fighting has killed almost 15,000 people and left half of the population of 50 million in need of food assistance. Some 11 million are displaced internally, and the capital, Khartoum, lies in ruins. The UAE is a key backer of the RSF, supplying it with weapons and funding, according to a report by United Nations investigators seen by Bloomberg in January. The US is engaged in talks with Emirati officials about their role in the war, while the UK has initiated discussions on Sudan at the UN Security Council in New York. Those moves have irked officials from the UAE. Last month, UK Deputy Foreign Secretary Andrew Mitchell told Channel 4 News that his boss, David Cameron, had raised the issue directly with the UAE. “They must not allow arms to get into this conflict — because if they do it will damage them, as well as everyone else. So it’s a message which Britain is putting very forcefully,” Mitchell said. The UAE affirmed its “categorical rejection” of the allegations in a statement on Tuesday, saying the country was engaging with the US and others to work for a settlement. “This dissemination of disinformation and false narratives by a warring side of the conflict after more than a year of this crisis aims to only deflect responsibility and undermine international efforts to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan,” the UAE said. At least 134 people have been killed in the past two weeks as a result of recent escalations in the ongoing conflict between Sudan’s military and paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Doctors without Borders reported Sunday. Doctors without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said, “We have now treated 979 casualties since the fighting began over two weeks ago, and the death toll has reached 134 – a sign of the violent intensity of the fighting.” The loss of life is a result of escalated conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group aided by Arab militias known as Janjaweed. The conflict began in April 2023, when tensions between the two groups boiled over in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. Over a year later, the fighting has anchored itself in el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur and the military’s final stronghold. The abhorrent humanitarian crisis that grips Sudan continues to leave a pathway of displacement and loss of life in its wake. USA executive director Avril Benoît says, “Our medical teams on the ground are providing emergency medical treatment, carrying out trauma surgery and caesarean sections, and running mobile clinics for displaced people”. Benoît warns of a looming famine and alarming backdrop of malnutrition, as well as the intensification of ethnic violence as the conflict wears on. Per Benoît, “What has been a collection of localised humanitarian crises has quickly evolved into an all-consuming humanitarian catastrophe”. Last month, the UN Security Council issued a press statement urging the Sudanese Armed Forces and RSF to de-escalate the conflict, seek a sustainable ceasefire and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law. The Security Council has also called on all Member States to refrain from external interference, which could threaten instability. Member States must adhere to the arms embargo measures in Resolution 1556 (2005). The resolution obliges states to prevent the sale or supply of arms to the Janjaweed operating in North, South, and West Darfur. Doctors without Borders is an international aid organisation whose mission is to offer medical humanitarian assistance to those in war-torn, disease-stricken areas. On May 25, the group reported the loss of a staff member who was tragically killed when shelling hit his home in Sudan; “[m]any of our staff lost family members or their homes during the shelling as well”. As the fighting continues, the shortage of medical staff and the urgent need for medical supplies become ever-apparent. The warning of Claire Nicolet, head of emergency programs, rings clear: Medical supplies are running out—we have only around 10 days of supplies left, so we urgently need to be able to restock the hospital. We need safe access and authorizations from the warring parties to be able to do this. If we don’t get these supplies, it will be extremely difficult to continue to treat the wounded.",

        "content": "( ) – Mike Tyson suffered a medical emergency on a flight headed to Los Angeles from Miami on Sunday night. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” Tyson’s representatives said. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Reports that the flight was delayed due to the emergency are inaccurate, Tyson’s reps said. The flight took off two hours later than scheduled. “It’s false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,” his team stated. “This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.” According to , the flight was also delayed 25 minutes once it landed at LAX as paramedics boarded the aircraft to tend to Tyson. This comes a little under two months before Tyson, 57, is set to return to the ring after almost 20 years. On July 20, about a month after his 58th birthday, he’ll take on 27-year-old Jake Paul in a boxing match at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix.",

With this bundle usually going for $6,097, this is the lowest price we have seen to date, with only two previous discounts to speak of. You can find the mower with its normal battery amount currently discounted to the same rate, meaning you’re getting two extra batteries for no added cost while already saving you $1,098. You can also find a similar bundle on , down from $6,597. The comes stocked with four 10.0Ah batteries that allows it to cover up to 2 acres of land on a single charge (which can be slightly extended with the extra two batteries). Its four independent brushless motors are housed within the 42-inch weather-resistant steel cutting deck, equivalent to a 22-horsepower engine, allowing it to move at up to 8 MPH. You’ll have 10 cutting heights to choose from here, ranging from 1.5 inches to 4.5 inches, three different driving modes, as well as 3-in-1 functionality for mulching, bagging, or side-discharges. It also sports some premium features like the 32 LED lights laid out on its front, sides, and rear for those early morning or late evening jobs – and even Bluetooth connectivity and a USB charging port for devices. As part of its , Best Buy is offering the . Regularly fetching $1,949, in 2023 we saw this particular model drop farthest during Black Friday sales, where it was brought down to $1,499. With this colorway no longer being offered from Aventon directly, we’ve mainly seen it included in Best Buy flash sales since the start of the new year, with today’s deal coming in as a $450 markdown that returns costs to the third-lowest price we have tracked – not only matching Black Friday rates, but also matching Aventon’s current Memorial Day rate. It’s also among some of the , which you can read about in our or by heading below. This comes ready to carry you wherever needed around town with its 500W rear-hub motor (750W peak) paired alongside a fully-integrated 14.0Ah battery that provides a 60-mile travel range on a single charge. Using only its throttle you’ll top off at 20 MPH, but when utilizing the five different levels of pedal assistance, that limit is bumped up to 28 MPH. It also comes with a rear-mounted rack for carrying along cargo as well as front and rear fenders to protect the bike from any adverse elements during your journey. It features integrated head and taillights, with the rear lights offering a brake light function, and you’ll find a handy backlit LCD display attached to the handlebars that gives you real-time status of all the important metrics: speed, travel distance, pedal assistance settings, and battery levels. As I stated before, this lowered price currently matches rate, albeit there is one tradeoff worth noting – by sacrificing the colorway, you’ll receive a free extra battery from Aventon’s direct sale that doubles the e-bike’s mileage from 60 miles to 120 miles! Alongside its , Amazon is offering the , . Already down from its $200 price tag, it entered the new year at $150 before steadily rising at small rates until April, when we finally started seeing some short-lived price cuts before once more rising back up. Today’s deal comes in to shake up the stagnation as a combined 36% markdown off the going rate that gives you $72 in savings and drops costs to a new all-time low. This can be stowed away in your vehicle (or kept out for regular use thanks to the included accessory parts) for quick and effortless charging solutions whenever you find yourself far from any official charging stations. It features an LED display that conveys in-time information, as well as a smart chip that provides protection against lightning, leakage, grounding, over voltage, under voltage, over charge, over current, and overheating. You’ll also be able to fully monitor and control the device through your smartphone, letting you even schedule charging for 1 to 12 hours, with options to take advantage of off-peak hours. It is compatible with vehicles and plug-in hybrids that comply with the J1772 standard, requiring only a NEMA 14-50 outlet to plug the charger into. The savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear. and subscribe to the .",

        "content": "Portugal is present at ITB China, the largest tourism fair in China, which takes place between May 27th and 31st, with the country represented by a delegation of 20 companies, led by Turismo de Portugal. In a statement sent to the press, Turismo de Portugal explains that participation in ITB China aims to “explore opportunities for cooperation between tourism entities in both countries, encourage cooperation in the area of student training and the training of tourism professionals and encourage local companies investing in the Tourism industry in Portugal”. “It is effectively an issuing market with strategic importance, not only because of its size but also because of the history that unites us. Tourism plays a key role in deepening bilateral relations and achieving a greater balance in Portugal's trade balance with China”, says Carlos Abade, president of Turismo de Portugal, remembering that this coincides with the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Portugal and China. In addition to participating in the fair, the occasion will also be used to sign contracts with local companies to launch marketing campaigns to promote Portugal throughout China, also giving rise to a roadshow that will take place in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Macau, and which should bring together more than 200 Chinese companies and encourage meetings with CEOs of the main partners of the tourism operation. China is the largest outbound tourism market in the world, which is why it is viewed strategically, especially because it continues to be a market with high potential for Portugal, since, between January and February 2024, it was the 17th tourist market in external demand for the destination Portugal measured by the overnight stays indicator (share 1.3%) and occupied 14th place in the guests' indicator (share 2.1%) totalling 37.1 thousand.",

        "description": "Bill Walton was larger than life, on the court and off.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died today, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Related articles NBA star diagnosed with Bell’s palsy 'Untapped potential': NZ Breakers confirm savvy new signing Share this article",

        "description": "PARIS — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out ” Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years.",
        "content": "PARIS — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out ” Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him on this afternoon-into-evening match against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal’s last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. “It’s difficult for me to talk,” said the Spaniard, whose 11⁄2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother’s lap in the stands. “I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure.” While Nadal said it’s doubtful that he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics’ tennis competition will be held at the French Open’s site. When Monday’s match ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion simply unable to play at his usual level after 11⁄2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the shouts of his two-syllable nickname echoed. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; indeed, he’d never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances going back to his days as a teenager. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal’s uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty beige chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday’s look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player, one coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday’s start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, he faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph ace and a 117 mph service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with a trademark on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain that level, and soon it was 2-all. Zverev later broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. “The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during my entire tennis career is amazing. But now I’m 28,” Nadal said, then paused and corrected himself with a chuckle: “Well, no, 38. I would love to be 28!” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around and applaud right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!”",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 On Thursday, May 23, history was made as BARK Air ‘s first-ever flight departed from New York, carrying six dogs of varying breeds and eleven humans, including both passengers and crew, to Los Angeles. This milestone marks the beginning of a revolutionary approach to air travel, offering a unique, pet-friendly experience designed specifically for dogs and their human companions. BARK Air is the world’s first airline focused exclusively on canine comfort. The innovative service promises to transform the often stressful ordeal of traveling with pets into a joyful and comfortable journey. With a mission to prioritize the needs of furry passengers, BARK Air has redefined the flight experience from the ground up, ensuring a stress-free journey for both dogs and their owners. Upon booking a flight with BARK Air, human passengers are contacted by a dedicated concierge who gathers detailed information about their dogs and travel plans. This personalized approach ensures that each dog receives the best possible travel experience tailored to their specific needs. On the day of travel, passengers and their dogs arrive at the airport just one hour before the flight, bypassing the typical hassles associated with air travel. The check-in process is streamlined and efficient, eliminating the need for crates and avoiding stressful lines. At the gate, a highly skilled BARK Air concierge welcomes the dogs, helping them socialize and settle into their journey. The cabin is equipped with dog-centric features designed to maximize comfort and ensure a pleasant flight for all canine passengers. Traveling long distances with dogs, especially larger breeds that don’t fit in under-seat carriers, can be challenging. Traditional air travel often subjects dogs to cramped conditions or the stress of flying in cargo. BARK Air addresses these issues by offering a service that puts dogs first, allowing them to travel comfortably alongside their owners. The successful inaugural flight of BARK Air marks a significant step forward in pet-friendly air travel. By focusing on the needs of dogs and providing a stress-free, comfortable journey, BARK Air is set to change the way we think about flying with our furry friends. The airline’s innovative approach promises a “white paw” experience that both dogs and their owners can look forward to, paving the way for a new era in air travel.",

        "description": "An NBA Hall of Famer, broadcaster, and member of the NBA's 75th Anniversary Team, Bill Walton, has passed away from cancer at 71.",
        "content": "NBA Hall of Famer and UCLA legend Bill Walton has passed away of cancer. He was 71. The announced Walton's death Monday. NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a statement on the two-time NBA champion. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" Silver said. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear, and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was a beam of light and one of the biggest and brightest stars in sports. His college and professional career was unmatched. The College Basketball Hall of Famer is a two-time NCAA champion, three-time National College Player of the Year, and a three-time Consensus first-team All-American. Walton was the Portland Trail Blazers' No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft. He spent 10 seasons in the NBA and was named a two-time All-Star, two-time All-NBA, 1977-78 NBA MVP, two-time All-Defense, and the 1985-86 Sixth Man. Walton spent his NBA career with the Blazers from 1974-79, the San Diego Clippers from 1979-85, and the Boston Celtics from 1985-88. His No. 32 is retired by the Trail Blazers. While Walton had a great career, he suffered numerous injuries throughout his historic career, including chronic foot injuries, a sprained ankle, a twice-broken left wrist, two dislocated toes, two dislocated fingers, a broken toe. He also injured his leg in a accident. These injuries limited his career totals, and he decided to call it quits after 14 seasons in the NBA. Walton finished his career averaging 13.3 points per game, 10.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists. The California native possibly had an even better post-playing career. Walton pivoted to college basketball commentary on national telecasts for ESPN, Sports, and Sports, among other outlets. He earned an Emmy Award for his analysis in 1991. Walton was a larger-than-life figure whose transcended basketball. He is survived by his wife, Lori, and four sons: Adam, Nate, Luke, and Chris.

        "content": "England star Jack Grealish has been linked with a shock exit from Manchester City, just three seasons after joining the club for £100 million (R2.3 billion). In what was arguably his toughest campaign in Manchester since his arrival from Aston Villa in 2021, the winger has finished the season with just three goals in 36 appearances. Reports suggest Grealish is unhappy with his reduced role this term, and could be interested in leaving the Citizens in the coming transfer window. Bayern Munich have been linked with the England international, who was named in Gareth Southgate's provisional 2024 UEFA European Championship squad, with Vincent Kompany reportedly eyeing a move for the player. The Belgian is expected to succeed Thomas Tuchel at the Allianz Arena after recently informing Burnley of his wish to take the opportunity in Bavaria. claims City could accept a big offer for Grealish should they receive one ahead of next season, with the winger still having three years on his deal at the Etihad Stadium. The ex-Villa captain made only 10 starts in the Premier League this season after injuries and the arrival of Belgian wide man Jeremy Doku seemed to impact his role in the side. Grealish was also an unused substitute in City's FA Cup final loss to Manchester United on Saturday, while he also played no part in the team's final three league games of the season.

        "content": "RTE's Ray D'Arcy has opened up about his decision to give up alcohol and how it was his wife that \"inspired him\". The popular radio host has been honest about his childhood growing up and how his late father \"drank a lot\" . The Irish presenter has now explained how his own decision to give up alcohol for good was nothing to do with his familial experiences. Speaking to the RTE Guide, Ray revealed that he has never had an issue with alcohol , but admitted that he \"hasn't looked back\" since choosing to quit over four years ago. The 59-year-old told how he made the active decision to stop while out for a run one day. He said: \"One day I was on holidays down the country, I’d had a few glasses of wine and the next day, out on a run, I felt a bit fuzzy, and I just thought, I’m going to give this up. There was no big deal about it. \"I hadn’t discussed it with anybody, I just decided it was something I was going to do.\" The Den star confessed that he \"didn't drink that much\" to begin with and explained how his wife Jenny had quit six years before him. Ray highlighted how Jenny had \"inspired him\" to make the move with how much \"it changed her life\". The dad-of-two described how his kids would ask him, \"Daddy, why don’t you quit?\" to which he would tell them: \"I just have the odd glass of wine on a Friday evening, I don’t drink enough to give it up.\" And the Kildare man emphasised how he \"feels lucky\" that he doesn't drink now. He added: \"It’s the even keel and you get so much more out of the weekends . Some people might think that’s very boring, but I find it very attractive.\" The RTE One host recently signed a new megabucks deal with RTE. The Irish Sun has learned that Ray penned a new contract in January to present his afternoon show on RTE Radio One . While RTE would not say if Ray had taken a cut on his €250,000-a-year salary, a spokeswoman said the station was “committed to reducing the cost of its highest paid presenters to ensure no contractors or employees will earn more than the Director-General” (currently Kevin Bakhurst). That move appears to fly in the face of Bakhurst’s recent vows of a commitment to “transparency”. Ex-Today FM boss Willie O’Reilly, who turned Ray into a star said in terms of audience RTE has made the right move to tie him down. He told The Irish Sun: “Ray has a very good track record . If RTE put someone new and untested in there, they could lose 20 per cent of their audience in three months. “Ray has proven to constantly deliver big audiences. People have grown up with Ray and have an ingrained habit of listening to him in the afternoon.” Willie hailed the deal as a “clever move” by RTE bosses. Willie told us: “When you have a radio schedule, you don’t want to change too many things.\"",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal is set to miss Wimbledon next month and may never play at the All England Club again as retirement looms. The 37-year-old, who has won two Wimbledon titles amongst his collection of 22 grand slams, was beaten by Alexander Zverev in straight sets in the first round of the French Open. Nadal insists he will compete at Roland Garros again as he targets the Paris Olympics in two months and, as a result, put his presence on the grass at Wimbledon into serious doubt. Asked whether he thinks he will play on grass and at Wimbledon, he said: “[It] looks difficult, honestly. For me now, it looks difficult to make the transition to grass when we have the Olympics again on clay. “I cannot confirm anything, I need to analyse so many facts. I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happen to my body, to make a transition to a completely different surface, then come back to clay. “Today I don’t think that’s a good idea, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Nadal has won Wimbledon twice, in 2008 and 2010, and last competed in SW19 in 2022 when he reached the semi-finals before being forced to withdraw from his semi-final against Nick Kyrgios due to injury. The Spaniard was then absent from the rest of the 2022 season before the array of fitness issues which triggered his “farewell tour” announcement for this year. However, despite this, Nadal is unwilling to confirm his retirement date. Nadal’s first Wimbledon triumph in 2008 was an all-time five-set classic, as he beat Roger Federer in fading light for his first major outside of Paris. He had previously lost to Federer in two consecutive finals and the last time he lost a match he completed at Wimbledon was indeed to the now-retired Swiss legend, in 2019.",

        "content": "By RNZ Rodger Fox - who has been synonymous with big band jazz in New Zealand - has died aged 71. The jazz legend founded the Rodger Fox Big Band in 1973 and toured extensively here and overseas, playing at international jazz festivals including Montreaux, Monterey and New Orleans. He also taught at the New Zealand School of Music in Wellington . The trombonist was honoured in 2022 for his services to music. Fox was only 18 when he began playing with a dance band in the Wellington / Porirua area. He told RNZ in 2022 that two of the biggest highlights were playing at Europe’s legendary Montreaux Jazz Festival in 1980 - the first-ever NZ band invited to play at an international jazz festival - and hosting American jazz saxophonist Michael Brecker’s visit to New Zealand to celebrate the Rodger Fox Big Band’s 30th anniversary. -RNZ Share this article",

        "description": "The match of the 18th round of the Turkmenistan Football Championship between the local \"Nebitchi\" and \"Energetik\" from Mary ended sensationally in Balkanabat.",
        "content": "The match of the 18th round of the Turkmenistan Football Championship between the local \"Nebitchi\" and \"Energetik\" from Mary ended sensationally in Balkanabat. FC \"Energetik\" has been performing extremely poorly this season. Before this match, the team had suffered 13 defeats in 15 games played, without a single victory, firmly occupying the last place in the country's championship. Therefore, few doubted before the game that the outsider would be able to put up a real fight away against the bronze medalist of last year's national championship. Moreover, the first meeting of these opponents in Mary ended with a 3:2 victory for \"Nebitchi\". However, as events on the field of the \"Sport Toplumy\" stadium showed, the guests were resolutely determined for the game. Having scored a goal in the 40th minute thanks to the efforts of Abdyresul Abdyev, the players of Dovlet Bayramov kept their goal intact in the second half as well. Having won their first victory in the Turkmenistan-2024 championship with a score of 1:0, \"Energetik\" with 5 points is still at the bottom of the standings. And \"Nebitchi\", having suffered their second defeat in a row, missed the chance to overtake \"Ashgabat\" and remained in 7th place with 15 points. In the other three matches of the 18th round, as expected, the leaders won again. \"Arkadag\", reigning champion of Turkmenistan, was losing 0:1 in the match on their home field against \"Shagadam\" from Turkmenbashi during the course of the meeting – the score was opened in the 14th minute by Rovshen Begjanov. However, later Vladimir Bayramov's players scored three goals against the opponent and won a hard-fought victory – 3:1. The winners were marked by: Shanazar Tirkishov (20th minute), Abdy Byashimov (32nd) and Begench Akmamedov (88th). The Ashgabat \"Altyn Asyr\" also won a hard-fought home victory over \"Merv\" – 5:2, initially losing 0:1 after an accurate shot in the 10th minute by Shazada Byashimov. However, then Yazguly Hojageldiev's players seized the initiative and scored five goals against the opponent. The winners had a brace from Arslan Saparov (23rd and 52nd minutes) and one each from Zafar Babajanov (30th), Selim Nurmyradov (44th – from a penalty) and Rovshengeldi Halmamedov (68th). Ali Haydarov scored the second goal for \"Merv\" in the 77th minute. In another match of the round in Ashgabat at the \"Nisa\" stadium, the two-time participant of the AFC Champions League \"Akhal\" convincingly defeated \"Kopetdag\" – 4:0, taking revenge for the 2:3 defeat in the first round. In the team of the Main Department \"Turkmennebitonumleri\", Alibek Abdyrakhmanov scored a brace (44th and 45th minutes), while Elman Tagaev (12th) and Gurban Annaev (54th) each scored a goal. Thus, based on the results of these matches, which completed the second round of the Turkmenistan Football Championship 2024, the leading trio looks as follows: in first place – \"Arkadag\" (48 points), in second – \"Altyn Asyr\" (37 points) and in third – \"Akhal\" (34 points). After the 18th round, there was a break in the national football championship due to the preparation of the Turkmenistan national team for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers against the teams of Uzbekistan on June 6 in Tashkent and Hong Kong on June 11 in Ashgabat.",

        "description": "Study: GPT-4 can potentially make you more money on your trade investments by Paul Hill A new study freely published in the SSRN journal has found that large language models (LLMs) with large context windows, such as GPT-4 and Claude 3, can perform successful financial statement analyses to help determine the direction of future earnings. The study found that AI exhibited “a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle.” In addition, the researchers found that general LLMs were able to perform just as well as narrowly trained state-of-the-art machine learning models that had been trained to read financial statements. They also found that LLMs were able to make predictions that yield a higher Sharpe ratio which compared the return of an investment with its risk – the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better. Given these results, the researcher found that LLMs may be able to have a central role in decision-making when it comes to choosing investments. Interestingly, GPT-4 was able to outdo human investors just based on the financial statements alone, devoid of any context, which the human investors would have been aware of. The researchers also said that the LLM predictions do not come from its training memory but rather “generates useful narrative insights about a company’s future performance.” For investors out there who think this work sounds interesting, the researchers have created a ChatGPT bot which is available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers so they can submit financial statements and get an analysis. For anyone interested in analysing financial statements for free, Claude 3 allows you to upload documents and you can ask questions about the data too. While the researchers may be wondering if LLMs can replace human investors, another qualitative change with the availability of these tools is that hobby investors who may not know the ins and outs of financial documents, can get a better idea of what’s going on with various companies.

        "content": "Egypt is considering adjusting the price of subsidized bread to better reflect the soaring cost of production, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly announced on Monday. However, he reassured the public that bread subsidies “will continue.” Speaking during a tour of industrial projects in the Borg Al-Arab area of Alexandria Governorate, Madbouly emphasized the need for action. “There must be a move to make the selling price of bread commensurate with the tremendous increase in cost,” he said. “Egypt produces 100bn subsidized loaves annually, and we sell the loaf for only 5 piasters, meaning that we collect EGP 5bn from total sales.” This move comes as the Egyptian government grapples with a significant financial burden. Finance Minister Mohamed Maait revealed in March that Egypt has allocated over EGP 125bn to subsidize bread in the 2024-2025 budget. The current subsidy benefits approximately 70 million Egyptian citizens, constituting about 65% of the population. Addressing the Electricity Crisis In related news, Madbouly addressed the ongoing electricity outage crisis, stating, “We asked the Ministries of Petroleum and Electricity to stop load shedding by November or December at the latest.” Egypt experienced an electricity crisis last July, its first since 2014, which the government attributed to a heatwave. Officials promised to resolve the issue by increasing gas pressure and ensuring the availability of petroleum materials for electricity networks. However, these promises have not been fully realized. Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Tarek El-Molla, stated on Monday that strategies are being developed to close the gap between available resources and the actual cost of providing electricity. The goal is to achieve this by the end of the year, though a specific timeframe remains uncertain due to its dependence on broader economic reform measures. El Molla acknowledged the negative impact of this gap on both citizens and the state, noting that electricity was not cut off during Ramadan or Eid. He emphasized that the government is working towards complete and sustainable solutions. The minister also highlighted the financial strain on the petroleum sector, which provides fuel supplies worth $55bn annually at actual costs of $20-22bn. This figure includes extraction and production costs borne by international companies, as well as an annual import bill of $10-12bn, which fluctuates with exchange rates and global Brent crude oil prices.",

        "description": "Researchers have revealed that GPT-4 is pretty good at helping you pick stocks simply based on financial statements of companies without contextual information. They've released a bot for you too. Read more...",
        "content": "A new study freely published in the SSRN journal has found that large language models (LLMs) with large context windows, such as and , can perform successful financial statement analyses to help determine the direction of future earnings. The study found that AI exhibited “a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle.” In addition, the researchers found that general LLMs were able to perform just as well as narrowly trained state-of-the-art machine learning models that had been trained to read financial statements. They also found that LLMs were able to make predictions that yield a higher Sharpe ratio which compared the return of an investment with its risk – the higher the Sharpe ratio, the better. Given these results, the researcher found that LLMs may be able to have a central role in decision-making when it comes to choosing investments. Interestingly, GPT-4 was able to outdo human investors just based on the financial statements alone, devoid of any context, which the human investors would have been aware of. The researchers also said that the LLM predictions do not come from its training memory but rather “generates useful narrative insights about a company’s future performance.” For investors out there who think this work sounds interesting, the researchers have created a which is available to subscribers so they can submit financial statements and get an analysis. For anyone interested in analysing financial statements for free, Claude 3 allows you to upload documents and you can ask questions about the data too. While the researchers may be wondering if LLMs can replace human investors, another qualitative change with the availability of these tools is that hobby investors who may not know the ins and outs of financial documents, can get a better idea of what’s going on with various companies.

        "content": "Steve Blake, one of Calgary’s best golfers, had a tee-time booked on that mid-September day. Except he had promised his wife that if his nagging cough worsened, he would go the emergency room for further examination of what doctors initially suspected to be a case of pneumonia. Instead of teeing it up at his home club, he drove to the hospital instead. After a series of tests, Blake received devastating news. He was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer, a complete shock for an active family man and non-smoker in his mid-50s. It is, unfortunately, inoperable. “My oncologist, the day we met him and he sat down and went through everything with us as far as the diagnosis, he asked, ‘Would you like to know your prognosis?’ ” Blake said, choking up as he recounted this moment. “I looked at my family and said, ‘Yeah, I do.’ We knew it wasn’t going to be good. He said 12 to 24 months, and I really grabbed onto that. I said, ‘I just want this to be the starting point. I’ll see you in 24 months ... ’ ” In August, at roughly the 11-month mark, you will see Blake inside the ropes at the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic at Canyon Meadows Golf & Country Club. Tournament officials announced Monday, on his 56th birthday, that the Calgarian has been granted an exemption to compete alongside the legends on the PGA Tour Champions circuit. This will be his second appearance at the award-winning and record-setting tournament, set this summer for Aug. 16-18. “The opportunity, it kind of leaves you speechless,” said Blake, who works as a financial advisor and is a member at Hamptons Golf Club. “In 2018, it was, ‘Let’s just not embarrass myself while I’m out here.’ This time, it will be different. I’m maybe playing for something a little bigger than me. I hope people see the message and see that somebody with an illness like this can still get out there and still pursue their dreams. “You may be handed a death sentence, but it doesn’t mean life is over,” he added, fighting back tears as he credited his family — wife Kelly, son Connor and daughter Brooklyn — and friends for helping him to remain upbeat. “You still have a lot to give, so get out there and give it. The more you do that, the more I have something like this tournament to look forward to, the more alive I feel. I don’t feel like I’m sick. I feel like I’m just this normal guy who is going to practise for this tournament coming up and hopefully I will be around for the next one and so on and so on.” Blake, who has completed chemotherapy and is now receiving a weekly round of targeted treatments, is the first confirmed entrant for the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic. There will be bigger names added to the tee-sheet, dudes with major titles and World Golf Hall of Fame credentials, but you won’t likely find a more heartwarming and inspiring story. Regardless of his score or his spot on the leaderboard, you can bet Blake will be a fan favourite during the three-round senior shootout at Canyon Meadows. As he put it: “If I can make a positive difference, even to one person that is struggling with this terrible disease, then I would consider any result in the tournament a total success.” “The patron group and Rogers continue to bring this event to Calgary to showcase the stars of the PGA Tour Champions to Canadian golf fans and to make a positive impact on the people in our community,” said Sean Van Kesteren, the executive director for the Rogers Charity Classic, in Monday’s announcement. “Giving one of Calgary’s top senior golfers, who needs the support of our entire community right now, this opportunity to play in front of his friends and family is not only extremely rewarding but supports this mission.” Blake admittedly wrestled with whether to request an exemption, which allows him to skip a two-part qualifying process. As he wrote a letter to tournament officials, he was asking himself: “Do you want to put yourself out there, with the illness, in front of everybody?” So why take this shot? Because Blake, who recently switched to senior shafts in his clubs as he tries to generate some of the speed that he’s lost in his golf swing, is a big believer in the power of positivity. During the 2024 Rogers Charity Classic, he wants to be proof of it. “You really have to believe that you can get past this or at least live as long as you can with it,” Blake said. “Unfortunately, too many people have that meeting with their oncologist. Too many family members have sat in on meetings like that. The devastation that you feel for the first period — it might be a week, two weeks, a month, two months, whatever — it can bury you. You just can’t allow it to bury you. You can’t allow it to define you. “I’m fortunate to have very positive people around me, always pulling for me, so it was a little easier to dig out of that initial hole. You just can’t let it beat you down and keep you down. If you do, chances are that prognosis is going to come true.”",

        "content": "by: Cameron Kiszla Posted: May 27, 2024 / 11:01 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 11:01 AM PDT A new front in the legal war over Arrowhead bottled water’s access to natural springs in the San Bernardino Mountains has opened up, reports the Los Angeles Times. While previous legal wrangling has sought to answer the question of whether Arrowhead parent company BlueTriton Brands is legally allowed to use water from the springs — bottled water has been taken from the creek and sold since 1906 — environmental activists are now petitioning the state to say the company’s use of water is hurting wildlife. According to Rachel Doughty, lawyer for the environmental nonprofit Story of Stuff Project, BlueTriton has “dewatered” Strawberry Creek. Doughty explained to the Times that if the company weren’t siphoning water in its network of pipes, Strawberry Creek “would be habitat for endangered species, it would be providing a downstream water supply, it would support fish, and it can’t do any of those things without water.” In an email to the Times, BlueTriton Brands said the company will “partner with people in our communities, governments, policy makers, businesses, and consumers to sustainably protect and shape our shared future.” “Responsible and proactive water stewardship is central to everything we do,” the company said. “We’re proud of the work we’ve done and continue to do in Strawberry Canyon, studying, reporting, and managing our operations to help protect the land and natural resources. We will continue to operate in compliance with all state and federal laws.” The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is evaluating the activists’ petition.

        "description": "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and comedian and TV broadcaster Patrick Kielty are scheduled to receive honorary doctorates from Ulster University.",
        "content": "This year's cohort, which includes Samantha Barry from US Glamour and artist Oliver Jeffers, is honoured to serve as an inspiration to the university's graduates. It occurs amid a year of festivities honouring the university's 175-year history as the Belfast School of Art. Mr. Jeffers expressed his pride at having the opportunity to return to Belfast School of Art this summer. An institution that is “intrinsic to the city's artistic and cultural heritage” is the Belfast School of Art, where he formerly studied design for visual communication. “Now dividing my time between Belfast and New York, this award strengthens my connection with the place where I grew up and I am grateful to Ulster University for the honour,” he stated. “However, I do hope I'm never on a flight when they ask if there's a doctor on board,” he said. Ms. Barry, who is originally from County Cork and is currently residing in New York City as Glamour's global editorial director for the Americas, is being honoured for her accomplishments in journalism. She changed the publication's yearly Women of the Year awards to support diversity. “I am delighted to have been recognised by Ulster University for my work and so excited to be visiting this summer to join the occasion with thousands of graduates as they celebrate after years of hard work and prepare to embark on their careers,” she stated. Betty Carlisle will be honoured for her work advancing shared education and empowering women from underprivileged and deprived areas; Eamonn Mallie will be recognised for his significant contribution to journalism and broadcasting; and Sister Nuala Kelly will be honoured for her outstanding service to the community following her transformation of St. Louisa's College in west Belfast. Professor Paul Bartholomew, vice-chancellor of Ulster University, stated that the institution wants to honour remarkable locals who are having an international influence. “Graduation is a special time of year as we celebrate our outstanding graduates as they come together with friends and family to mark their wonderful achievements,” he stated. According to Professor Bartholomew, “We are dedicated to fostering the next generation of leaders who will, in the years that follow their time at Ulster University, go on to make a significant impact in their communities and respective professions.” “With that future in mind, it is a joy to celebrate the work of those inspirational and acclaimed local faces already making a global impact, and we are thrilled to bestow these honorary doctorates.” He went on to say, “these individuals are leaders in their fields and demonstrate great talent, creativity and integrity.” According to Professor Bartholomew, the institution is hoping that “they will be an inspiration to the whole Ulster University community.” The summer graduation ceremonies in Belfast, Coleraine, and Derry, which take place from July 1 to July 9, will award the honorary doctorates.",

        "content": "The fire broke out because of a short circuit and a probe into the fire incident is under way. The education department and district administration will submit a report regarding the blaze. New Delhi : It was a close shave for around 1,400 girl students who luckily escaped a blaze that swept through their school building in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Monday. According to rescue officials, the fire ripped through the Government Girls Higher Secondary School in Haripur district’s Sirikot village when students were studying inside the building. The fire brigades took some time to reach the site as they had to make their way through a treacherous mountainous terrain. Faraz Jalal, Haripur’s rescue 1122 spokesperson, said that all the students were safe after they were evacuated from the school building in time. Jalal added that there was massive damage to the entire school due to the blaze. The school building was built partially with wood. Fortunately, no loss of life was reported following the incident. Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry, Chief Secretary Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said that the fire broke out because of a short circuit. A probe into the fire incident is under way. Chaudhry said the school would be made functional soon. Timely evacuation Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur pointed out that timely action by rescue officials in evacuating the students averted a huge tragedy. He added that the education department and district administration will submit a report regarding the fire. Gandapur said a review of all educational institutions would be undertaken to prevent such fire incidents in the future. The provincial government will compensate for the losses caused by the blaze, he added. School buildings in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have often faced attacks by militants. On May 8 night, unidentified militants blew up a private girls’ school in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. The militants tortured the watchman and later blew up two rooms of the school, the police said. In May last year, two government schools for girls in Mirali had been destroyed by the militants. Luckily, there were no casualties in the incidents.",

        "description": "A fast-growing, resource-efficient, and versatile grass.",
        "content": "Surprisingly, bamboo is a grass, and there are many varieties that can be ‘clumpers ‘or ‘runners’ – all to do with their root growth and structure. Once fully grown, some of the larger species resemble trees with a thick trunk. Much more sustainable than hardwood trees, they are also one of the fastest-growing plants in the world, growing up to 90cm or more a day. Despite bamboo not being native to a lot of countries, Europe’s growing interest in bamboo has paved the way for a new generation of farmers, ecologists, and landscape designers who are introducing bamboo into their plans, and there are at least 5 European countries that are currently growing bamboo – starting with here in Portugal at Bambu Parque, plus La Bambouseraie en Cévennes, France - Labirinto della Masone - Italy, Oprins Nursery - Belgium, and lastly of all unlikely places, Scottish Bamboo in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. In less developed countries, unemployment has often resulted in conflicts and social unrest, but the production and manufacturing of bamboo products can contribute to a more socially and economically stable environment by creating job opportunities. Bamboo is an easy-to-grow crop that provides annual income to some of the poorest rural communities in tropical and subtropical regions, and its rapid establishment and growth allows for frequent harvesting that can be converted into an increasingly wide variety of products for sale, providing a year-round source of income. Strength It is incredibly strong, and an amazing number of things are made from bamboo, from flooring to furniture and worktops, kitchen equipment, and even sports equipment, plus reusable items such as coffee cups, drinking straws, plates, and bowels. Even clothing such as t-shirts, underwear, and socks can all be made with bamboo, and the companies who make them are proud to produce these sustainable products. Eco-friendly? Compared to wood from trees, bamboo wood is more stable, and because it is nearly always laminated or compressed, it has a higher density than most wood types, plus the bonus of being more fire resistant. Processing certainly creates work for those that need it, where the culms (the hollow part of the stem) are split lengthwise into strips and the outer bark is removed. The material is planed and treated (bleached or caramelised) before drying. The strips are then glued and stacked and pressed to form a laminated material. For manufacturing a bamboo fabric, leaves, and shoots are cooked in strong chemical solvents such as sodium hydroxide and carbon disulphide, both being highly toxic and risky for human health. Once cooked, the resulting liquid is pushed through tiny holes directly into a chemical bath of sulfuric acid (dangerous again) where it hardens into fine strands. But are any of the processing procedures so eco-friendly? Credits: envato elements; Bamboo Torture Less talked about is its more gruesome use during WW2. ‘Bamboo torture’ was apparently used on prisoners-of-war, where multiple sharpened shoots of this innocent ‘grass’ were placed beneath the back of a horizontal prisoner, like a bed of nails, and these would start piercing through the body and growing through, causing a slow and painful death. Despite this theory having never been confirmed, there is a huge possibility that it may have really been used. Panda Food I have always associated bamboo with pandas in an adorable way. I mean come on, look at them. Cuteness overload or what? Despite conservation projects, there are still less than 2,000 on our planet. A panda's daily diet consists almost entirely of the leaves, stems, and shoots of bamboo, and because it contains very little nutritional value, pandas must eat 12-38 kg every day to meet their energy needs. They lack the digestive enzymes necessary to break down other plants, thus making bamboo their only food source, and they have adapted bamboo into their diet over time due to its abundance in their mountain forest habitats. This adaptation has been aided by the evolution of specialized jaw muscles that allow them to easily chew through tough stalks of bamboo. They say they’re living proof that you can eat just vegetables and still be fat, so don’t start thinking being a vegetarian is all good!

        "description": "Suzi Walsh says using puppies in yoga classes raises concerns about consent, exploitation and animal welfare.",
        "content": "PUPPY YOGA CLASSES are increasingly popular around the world, enticing people with the allure of puppies as a unique attraction. Although new to Ireland, the experience around these classes and the welfare of puppies has in other jurisdictions. You can see why people might think it a good idea to go along, what’s not to love about a nice yoga class, complete with the cutest, softest and playful puppies? No harm, right? Well, maybe we should all stop here and ask ourselves: Are the puppies there because it’s good for them? What are they getting from it? Do they have a choice? What about their welfare? Am I satisfied they’ve made their way here today because this is ultimately for their good, or is this just for my entertainment? Let’s look at what exactly puppy yoga is and why it should be avoided... Puppy yoga is worryingly emerging as a new fitness trend where members of the public engage in yoga while interacting with puppies. Much of the time, in various locations around the world, organisers can be found claiming there are benefits to both the participants and the puppies. Some providers of this global craze contend that interaction with animals reduces stress and anxiety while helping with well-being (presumably for the yoga participants). While this holds true in theory, the reality is that all of this relies on the animals themselves being relaxed, calm and content. Additionally, the idea that there are benefits for the puppies here, that it allows them to strengthen their confidence and learn to behave out in the world really doesn’t stack up. My view is that socialising puppies in this manner is likely to have the opposite effect. Using puppies in yoga classes raises concerns about consent, exploitation and animal welfare. Exposing young, often untrained puppies to unfamiliar environments and handling by numerous strangers can be stressful and potentially harmful to their physical and emotional health. Puppy yoga has been designed to entice the public into booking expensive spots in what is essentially a standard yoga class. An investigation recently uncovered some disturbing truths about puppy yoga classes in the UK. The growing trend comes on the back of the rise of social media, where posts to Instagram and TikTok help raise the profile of many influencers. When the investigative reporter questioned if the puppies had access to water during classes, the response was that it would only cause the pups to urinate more. Dogs should never have restricted access to water, they have the inability to sweat or store water in the way that humans do and therefore they can overheat fast leading to potentially fatal consequences. During this investigation, it was discovered that some pups were as young as six and a half weeks old, barely weaned and unvaccinated. It found that some users would pay up to £40 British pounds for a session. In a commercial environment, dog yoga classes should adhere to the same standards as other enterprises involving animals. They should require a welfare officer or veterinary specialist to be on-site at all times. This is a standard practice in the TV & film industry, and yoga classes should be no different. The welfare of the pups should be a priority but that cannot be the case if the participants’ needs are prioritised over that of the puppies. In my opinion, such investigations demonstrate that yoga class is not an appropriate setting for young puppies. In my long experience as a dog behaviourist and trainer, socialisation is about introducing a young animal to something in a way which is gradual and calm, they must have the freedom to choose to move away. At such a young age, it is crucial for their confidence development to experience the world at their own pace without being overwhelmed. Negative experiences during the can impact their behavioural development. Introducing new experiences — such as meeting people, encountering other dogs, and exposure to various noises and objects — should be gradual, controlled and occur when the puppy is relaxed. While we often discuss the lack of socialisation for dogs, but I have learned in my many years of this work that overexposure or flooding a puppy with stimuli for their well-being. A poorly socialised puppy may become fearful of new people, animals, environments and experiences. This can result in chronic anxiety and stress. For example, some have criticised the practice of repeatedly handling a pup over the course of a yoga class, and having the puppy passed from one person to the next. This is likely to create an aversion to people as well as an avoidance of handling. There’s a significant distinction between a puppy genuinely enjoying being handled and one that is merely tolerating it. Fear and insecurity can manifest as aggression towards people, or unfamiliar situations. Without proper and gentle socialisation, a puppy may struggle to cope with changes or unexpected events, leading to overreaction or avoidance behaviours. Other criticisms include concerns that a yoga class is long for a puppy. They have short attention spans and need lots of rest. Puppies need plenty of food and lots of undisturbed sleep. This is very difficult to achieve if they are participating in several classes in addition to being transported to and from a venue. So where do the pups come from for this yoga? Certainly, the UK investigation that the craze can be ‘a sort of marketing tool for puppy sales’ and lead to ‘irresponsible puppy sales’. The obvious fear is that unscrupulous breeders will step in. Responsible and compassionate breeders should never subject their young puppies to these environments if they aim for them to grow into confident and content adult dogs. I should make it clear, however, that puppy yoga is new to Ireland and there is no evidence of the involvement of any puppy farm animals. Regrettably, there are always irresponsible breeders who prioritise profit over the welfare of dogs, leading to numerous victims of illegal puppy farming each year. Last year, there was a record number of surrender requests, highlighting the urgency to stop supporting the unnecessary breeding of dogs. Puppy yoga only makes the breeding of pups that bit more attractive to those looking to make a quick buck. The answer is, “we don’t.” Instead, I would encourage anyone seeking positive interactions with puppies and dogs to volunteer with their local rescue centre, where teams work tirelessly to help animals in Ireland. There, you can walk a dog, transport a puppy, or simply lend a hand, knowing you’re aiding dogs rather than supporting puppy farmers and backyard breeders. While puppy yoga may appear harmless and enjoyable on the surface, a closer examination, particularly of experiences abroad, reveals numerous ethical, environmental and societal concerns. Yoga is a massively beneficial class to take in its own right, and there are some terrific studios offering amazing classes all around Ireland. I encourage you to do it for yourself without the need for an additional gimmick.",

My boss, John Flynn, gave us his boat — it’s a brand new Sunseeker 90-footer with a crew — and we went to Little Palm Island [in Florida],” Sandy shared. “We don’t have a lot of time because we’re building a house and we’re moving and Leah’s daughter’s graduating so we had three days on his boat. It’s where you go where you don’t want to be bothered. [It] is the most exclusive island ever since the last hurricane that came through did a lot of damage.” You have successfully subscribed.

The strike took place in the Tal al-Sultan camp in western Rafah, where thousands of people were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground invasion of eastern Rafah three weeks ago. Residents say Israel told them they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas, although the IDF said the camp is outside the so-called humanitarian zone it declared earlier this month.

        "description": "Using some of the same technology found in America's Cup winning sailing vessels, marine tech company Vessev has launched a premium tourism electric hydrofoil ferry.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Vessev VS-9 electric hydrofoil. The 10-seater vessel is being tested and will go into commercial ... [+] service later this year through Fullers360 in New Zealand. Once an engineering program lead for the original Apple Watch, Eric Laakmann has morphed into a sort of ferry godfather, as CEO of marine tech company Vessev . With Laakman at the helm, The New Zealand-based company unveiled the VS-9, what it terms the “world’s first premium tourism electric hydrofoiling vessel,” on Monday. After an initial test period going on now out of Aukland, once certified later this year, Vessev expects the VS-9 to go into commercial service through Fullers360 , New Zealand’s largest ferry operator. “It’s our intention for Fullers360 to be 100% electric or hydrogen operated by 2040 and foiling is absolutely a part of that vision for us,” said Mike Horne, Fullers360 CEO, in a statement. The 29-foot long VS-9 can carry up to 10 passengers plus a skipper at a top speed of about 30 knots, or 34.5 miles per hour, with a cruising range of between 40-50 nautical miles, or 46-57 miles. Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time At Lower Price Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50 Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone Interior of Vessev VS-9 electric hydrofoiling ferry. Unlike a conventional vessel floating on the water’s surface, a hydrofoil hovers just above the surface, typically providing a more comfortable ride since it’s not affected as much by pounding waves. In the case of the VS-9, the company touts construction of the actual foils as a key differentiator enhancing control and passenger comfort even further while improving energy consumption. The VS-9 uses what Vessev describes as ultra-high authority hydrofoil systems, where the foils change shape using high precision flaps under the water to optimize efficiency, based in part, on technology used in America’s Cup sailing vessels. Vessev worked with Fullers360 and the ferry operator’s “decarbonization” partner NetZeroMaritime to develop the VS-9. Eric Laakmann, CEO, marine technology company Vessev. “The ability to remove the foils from the water completely is a design element we’re particularly proud of. We were told it would be impractical, but we’ve delivered a system which makes it easy for operators to maintain pristine foils for maximum efficiency. To our knowledge, the VS 9 will be the only certified passenger electric hydrofoil in the world capable of this,” said Laakmann in a statement. The Vessev VS-9 is not the first electric hydrofoil to be used as a ferry. Tech startup Navier launched a hydrofoil transit program with financial platform company Stripe in ... [+] the San Francisco Bay Area to transport Stripe employees from Marin County to company headquarters in South San Francisco. This past March, San Francisco, Calif.-based startup Navier began providing a water taxi service using one of its high-speed electric, six-passenger, N30 hydrofoil boats to ferry employees of financial infrastructure platform company Stripe to and from Larkspur in Marin County to Oyster Point near the company’s South San Franciso headquarters, about 22 miles each way. The N30, however, is largely being marketed as a recreational vessel for private use. Acknowledging the fact there are what he termed a “handful” of recreational hydrofoiling electric vessels in the marketplace, Laakmann maintains in email responses to our questions, “there are no vessels of this type which have passed survey for use in commercial passenger applications. Laakmann bases Vassev’s claim to be the “first hydrofoiling tourism vessel to operate in the world” on both the VS-9’s features and the arrangement with Fullers360, explaining, “We will be the first in the world to certify a vessel of this type for passenger use in commercial applications (tourism and point to point marine services). The VS—9 will be the first electric hydrofoiling vessel to be operated in commercial service by a private operator (Fullers360).” Laakmann points out the VS-9 contains additional attributes for commercial use that include: · Full battery structural fire protection and safety systems. · Designs reviewed and approved by regulators (load cases, structural design, electric system, etc) · DNV-GL design standards. “Far more significant safety systems.” Several VS-9 have already been sold with a starting price of $620,000, according to Laakmann, declaring, “We are calling it the \"Rivian of the Sea,” referring to the U.S. brand of electric pickup trucks and SUVs. Vessev is now developing the 100-passenger capacity VS-18. Indeed, just as the auto industry is moving more towards electric vehicles to improve the environment and reduce fossil fuel consumption, the marine sector is following suit for certain boating segments, in particular, electric hydrofoils. “There are 33 million vessels in the world today with sustainable vessels representing the smallest fraction,” said Laakmann. “Through significant enhancements in efficiency, hydrofoiling will play a key role in this once-in-a-generation shift.” Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "content": "Tom Brady is ready to kick off summer. On Monday, the retired NFL star shared a video on Instagram featuring him enjoying some splashy good times with two of his kids, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11 , whom he shares with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. “You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!☀️🇺🇸🏄‍♂️,” he captioned the clip, which was overlapped with Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s “I Had Some Help.” In it, the 46-year-old showed off his buff physique while driving a speedboat, jet-skiing and wakeboarding. His kids also joined in on the fun as they went tubing. The outing comes on the heels of Brady’s Netflix roast that poked fun at his personal life. The Super Bowl champ — who also has a son, Jack, 16 , with ex-Bridget Moynahan — admitted he “didn’t like” how his kids were “affected” by jokes made about his exes. “I loved when the jokes were about me,” he shared on “The Pivot” podcast. “I thought they were so fun. I didn’t like the way that affected my kids.” Brady shared that he initially signed up for the roast because he didn’t mind jokes being made at his expense but confessed he hadn’t thought the decision through. “It’s the hardest part about like, the bittersweet aspect of when you do something that you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize, ‘I wouldn’t do that again,’ because of the way that affected actually the people that I care about the most in the world,” he explained. “So it makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you’re naive you don’t know or you get a little like, ‘Oh s–t!’” During the roast, comedian Nikki Glaser made fun of Brady for breaking up with Moynihan while she was pregnant with their son. And Kevin Hart teased the Patriots player about his ex-wife, Bündchen, and her new romance with her jiu-jitsu trainer, Joaquim Valente. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Page Six exclusively reported that the Brazilian model, 43, felt hurt because Brady “once again put football before his family” during his comedy roast. And, Moynahan, 53, shared cryptic messages on social media about being “kind” and “loyal.” Glaser then clapped back at Brady’s comments , saying it’s “impossible” he didn’t know what would happen during the roast. “I also think Tom Brady does not do anything without doing his research and knowing exactly what he’s getting into,” Glaser, 39, claimed on the “Today” show. Following the drama, Brady paid tribute to the “Blue Bloods” actress, Bündchen and his mom in a sweet Mother’s Day post . “Happy Mothers Day to these kind, caring, compassionate and POWERFUL moms that I’m lucky to have in my life. None of this would be possible without your love ❤️❤️❤️,” he captioned the post.",

        "content": "LAGU Garuda Pancasila merupakan salah satu lagu yang dikumandangkan dalam perayaan Hari Lahir yang jatuh pada 1 Juni. Selain itu, lagu Garuda Pancasila sering kali dinyanyikan di upacara pengibaran bendera. Garuda Pancasila diciptakan oleh Prohar Sudharnoto yang saat itu merupakan kepala seksi musik di RRI pada 1956. Sebelumnya lagu itu diberi judul Mars Pancasila lalu diganti dengan Garuda Pancasila untuk menggambarkan lambang Pancasila, yaitu burung garuda. Lagu Garuda Pancasila diciptakan untuk menggambarkan Pancasila dalam bentuk seni dengan menumbuhkan rasa cinta Tanah Air dan semangat persatuan melalui lagu. Ini karena lagu merupakan bahasa universal, bahasa rakyat. Saat itu masyarakat tidak akan bisa menyatakan Pancasila dengan terang terangan pada saat upacara. Kehadiran lagu Garuda Pancasila bisa menanamkan dasar negara di hati rakyat dengan media yang disukai oleh seluruh orang. (OL-14)",

        "description": "Imperatriz could go for an estimated price of between A$4 million and A$7 million.",
        "content": "Champion New Zealand mare Imperatriz may not be allowed to go to her own public auction on the Gold Coast today but will be allowed to watch. The 10-time Group 1 winner will be offered for sale at the Magic Millions sale around 6.30pm (NZ time), with an estimated price expected of between A$4 million and A$7 million. Imperatriz was retired in April after a stunning 15-month burst in which she developed into one of the world’s best sprinters, dominating Victorian sprinting like no New Zealand speedster ever before her. Her post-campaign veterinary examination showed signs of wear and tear, and while she could race again, Te Akau racing boss David Ellis decided to call time on a career that needed no more embellishment. Being a syndicate-owned mare, Imperatriz was going to have to be sold at a public auction to establish the market price for her owners, but today’s offering comes with a twist, as Imperatriz won’t be on the Gold Coast. She will instead be in her home paddock in Waikato, where she has been visited by most prospective buyers in recent weeks, with the appropriate veterinary due diligence undertaken. “We’ve had a lot of people to the farm to look at her, so while we will be over here, she will be in her usual paddock back home,” said Ellis from the Gold Coast last night. But that doesn’t mean Imperatriz will miss out on the historic remote sale and the huge numbers being thrown around 2300km away. “We have a young lady who looks after her named Faith Pollock who is going to go down and give her a cuddle around the time she is being sold,” Ellis told the Herald. “She’s going to take her iPad, too, and let Imperatriz watch the sale so she can see what all the fuss is about,” said the Te Akau boss with a laugh. While Imperatriz may care more about the cuddles than the cash, many in the racing industry can’t wait to see who pays what to secure the superstar speedster. “I’m thinking somewhere between A$4m and A$6m,” Ellis said. “But as everybody who goes to horse sales knows, it only takes two people determined to buy the same horse and things can change quite quickly.” While any thoroughbred breeder who would love to buy Imperatriz to breed from, or even race again, the reality is there are only a handful thought to be in the market. The major Australian breeding operations such as Yulong and Coolmore are obvious potential buyers who have previously paid huge money for trophy mares. North American newbie John Stewart has been spending and tweeting up big in the past six months and has said he would consider paying A$6m for Imperatriz and then even putting her back in work if she was deemed sound and healthy enough. Japanese breeders led by the Shadai Group, who own the giant Northern Farms operation, have dabbled successfully at the top end of the Australasian broodmare market, so are another massive player who could buy Imperatriz without surprising. Yulong would be favourite in any potential buyer market but they already own Imperatriz’s dam Berimbau, as well as a weanling full brother to Imperatriz (I Am Invincible), paying A$1.8m for the pair in Sydney last year. Whether that increases their appetite to own the great mare, or they think they have that bloodline covered could be a key price driver. Those who want to join Imperatriz in watching her sale live can do so via the Magic Millions website. Selling the champ ●Champion New Zealand mare Imperatriz will be offered for sale at public auction on the Gold Coast today. ●She won’t be at the Magic Millions sale complex as she is stayed in New Zealand. ●Educated industry estimates range from A$4 million to A$7 million for Imperatriz, who is likely to be put on foal rather than race again. ●The sale should be around 6.30pm (NZ time).

        "description": "Nadal bid an emotional farewell to Roland Garros after a first-round defeat to fourth seed Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has all but ruled himself out of competing at Wimbledon next month. The 37-year-old Spaniard bid an emotional au revoir to the French Open on Monday after losing in the first round to Alexander Zverev. Nadal, a 14-time winner at Roland Garros, plans to be back in Paris for this summer’s Olympic Games and has not entirely ruled out a return next year. But he believes the quick turnaround from clay to grass and back again means he is almost certain not to return to the scene of his 2008 and 2010 Wimbledon triumphs. “It looks difficult, honestly,” he said. “For me now I can’t confirm what’s going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay. “So I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts. “But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. “Today I feel that’s not a good idea, but I can’t confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Unseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros. But Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd. The Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not “close the door” on a return to the Paris showpiece. 🫶🧡 — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) It seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players’ boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz – Nadal’s heir apparent – long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women’s number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Nadal added: “I didn’t see them, but I think in some way it’s normal, no? I think if that’s the last time that I’m gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it’s normal. “I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.” Also in attendance were Nadal’s wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni – his former coach – and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Vintage Rafa 👀 — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) They were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third. But a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight. So Nadal’s astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here. Zverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: “Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment.”",

        "description": "Nadal bid an emotional farewell to Roland Garros after a first-round defeat to fourth seed Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "The 37-year-old Spaniard bid an emotional au revoir to the French Open on Monday after losing in the first round to Alexander Zverev. Nadal, a 14-time winner at Roland Garros, plans to be back in Paris for this summer’s Olympic Games and has not entirely ruled out a return next year. But he believes the quick turnaround from clay to grass and back again means he is almost certain not to return to the scene of his 2008 and 2010 Wimbledon triumphs. “It looks difficult, honestly,” he said. “For me now I can’t confirm what’s going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay. “So I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts. “But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. “Today I feel that’s not a good idea, but I can’t confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Unseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros. But Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd. The Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not “close the door” on a return to the Paris showpiece. 🫶🧡 pic.twitter.com/7DApnv0rxD — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 It seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players’ boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz – Nadal’s heir apparent – long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women’s number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Nadal added: “I didn’t see them, but I think in some way it’s normal, no? I think if that’s the last time that I’m gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it’s normal. “I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.” Also in attendance were Nadal’s wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni – his former coach – and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Vintage Rafa 👀 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/PewWj1Dp9W — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 They were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third. But a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight. So Nadal’s astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here. Zverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: “Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment.”",

The rapper and singer, 41, had to be reschedule the gig after her arrest in the Netherlands on Saturday. “OK guys, I was JUST RE-ADVISED that we actually CAN NOT do any other date for the make up #gagcityMANCHESTER date besides JUNE 3rd,” she said on X. “So JUNE 3rd is the new official date for all ticket holders who originally had tickets to the MAY 25th #Manchester show.

I apologize for all the... — Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) “I apologise for all the inconvenience this has caused. I really hope you can make the #JUNE3rd show. It’ll be really special. Ticketmaster will contact you to advise officially.” Minaj said she spent around six hours in custody at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on Saturday before being able to fly to the UK. Fans were let into the newly-opened Manchester venue at around 7pm on Saturday for her show, before promoter Live Nation announced at around 9.40pm that it was to be postponed. Dutch police said a woman aged 41 was arrested on Saturday after allegedly trying to take what it described as “soft drugs” from Schiphol Airport to another country. A later update from the force said it had released the “suspect and she can now move on” after paying a fine. It marked the latest postponed gig at the Co-op Live arena which has been plagued with issues since trying to open in April. Minaj had praised fans for being a “class act” during the last-minute postponement, and invited them to her hotel in the centre of Manchester before speaking to the crowds outside. The music star, who is known for the songs Starships, Super Bass and Anaconda, livestreamed her arrest on social media and claimed drugs found in her luggage did not belong to her. She performed at Birmingham’s Resorts World Arena on Sunday.",

        "description": "Your first sexual experience can shape your emotions and attitudes around sex and self-image throughout your life.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Your first sexual experience can shape your emotions and attitudes around sex and self-image ... [+] throughout your life. A person’s first sexual experience is often regarded as a significant milestone in their lives. It is an event loaded with emotional, social and psychological weight. Research shows that it is highly common to have mixed or conflicting emotions about this experience, including happiness, fear and indifference. The reverberations of your first time can be felt for years after, influencing self-esteem, relationship dynamics and sexual and psychological well-being. Adding to this complexity are the various perceptions of “virginity”—as a gift, a rite of passage or even a burden— that deeply affect how people feel about their first time. Here are two primary ways your “first time” can affect you years later, according to research. 1. Feelings About The Event Impact Long-Term Well-Being A positive first sexual experience—characterized by mutual and enthusiastic consent, emotional intimacy, respect and emotional readiness—can foster positive emotions and a healthy sexual identity. In contrast, research shows that negative experiences, such as those involving regret, coercion, emotional unpreparedness, peer pressure and drug or alcohol use can lead to poorer psychological and physical health outcomes in adulthood and long-lasting feelings of guilt, shame, anxiety and sexual difficulties . Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time—At Lower Price, Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50 Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone Such experiences can also fuel beliefs that sex is inherently shameful or dangerous, which can impede healthy sexual development and future relationships. Additionally, a 2022 study published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior found that consenting but just “going along with it” in a first-time sexual experience, without feeling much desire for it, can become a life stressor and lead to greater psychological distress and poorer physical health outcomes in later life, even post-retirement. Importantly, the most positive first-time encounters involve having the agency to form your own definition and context of what pleasure means to you and engaging in sex only when it is something you completely desire throughout the process. Research also shows that women are less likely to have a highly satisfying first-time experience compared to men, as they are comparatively less likely to achieve orgasm . However, being in a committed relationship with one’s sexual partner enhances psychological satisfaction for both partners, highlighting the importance of feeling safe and connected to each other. Socio-cultural norms also play a crucial role in shaping an individual’s perception of their first time. In societies where virginity is heavily stigmatized or highly valued, there can be immense pressure surrounding this event. The fear of judgment or shame associated with losing virginity outside of culturally accepted contexts can also exacerbate long-term psychological distress. 2. Your First Time Influences Your Future Sexual Identity Research shows that the average American loses their virginity at about 17 years old. Researchers found that this initial experience influences one’s “sexual self-efficacy,” which in turn affects one’s current level of sexual adjustment. Sexual self-efficacy refers to an individual’s confidence in their ability to make their own decisions about their sexuality, practice safe sex, initiate sexual activity, communicate sexual needs, desires, boundaries and preferences with a partner as well as advance and navigate sexual relationships. Adolescence and early adulthood are critical periods for cognitive and identity development. One’s first sexual experience often coincides with these developmental stages and consequently shapes sexual identity and cognitive schemas about sex and relationships. A positive or negative first experience can influence how individuals perceive themselves as sexual beings and how they approach future sexual encounters. Research shows that positive first-time experiences can lead to greater levels of sexual satisfaction and lower sexual depression years later, in one’s current sexual interactions. Additionally, the disparity between societal or personal expectations and the reality of the first sexual experience can also have long-term psychological effects. Unrealistic expectations around sex, often fueled by media portrayals, can lead to disappointment, disillusionment and a sense of inadequacy, affecting sexual satisfaction and confidence in the years that follow. A 2021 study also found that if men believe they have not lost their virginity at an appropriate age, they tend to have more negative experiences and face sexual performance anxiety, lowering their sexual self-efficacy in the long run. Further, a 2016 study found that being a sexual “late bloomer” or engaging in sex for the first time after most of one’s similarly aged peers already have, can impact future romantic relationships. “We observed that sexually inexperienced adults perceived themselves to be stigmatized due to their inexperience and were not highly desired as relationship partners. Even sexually inexperienced adults themselves did not find other inexperienced adults to be attractive relationship partners,” the researchers explain. However, it is essential to remember that there is no “right time” to have this experience and it is best to follow what aligns with your own needs and values. Reflecting on your first sexual experience, regardless of when it happened, can provide important context for understanding how you feel about yourself and your relationships today. If it did not occur as you envisioned or desired, it is possible and essential to heal and redefine what sexual experiences mean to you on your own terms. The importance of safety, consent and readiness in any sexual experience cannot be overstated. Encouraging younger people to recognize the importance of positive initial sexual experiences is also crucial. Comprehensive sex education can enhance sexual self-efficacy by providing accurate information about sexual health, safe practices and communication strategies for the generations that follow, allowing us as a society to feel empowered in our sexual identities and establish more fulfilling relationships with ourselves and others. Understanding attitudes towards sex is an important aspect of self-awareness.

        "content": "Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday both have interesting summers ahead, with the Blades needing to overhaul their squad, while the Owls will want to strengthen to avoid any kind of relegation battle next season. With Danny Rohl signed up to a new contract, Wednesday fans will be excited about next season, but Blades fans will want to see some of those much-needed changes to their squad before they can look to next season with true excitement. In the meantime, we have rounded up all the latest news surrounding the Steel City clubs. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital Subscription to The Star, you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. Former Leeds United star Luke Ayling has completed his move to Middlesbrough after a successful loan spell. The full-back was loaned out by Leeds during the January transfer window, and with his contract at Elland Road this summer, that was always going to prove a goodbye as far as he and Leeds were concerned. He was a regular for Boro in the second half of the season, and he has now penned a permanent two-year deal to remain on Teesside. “We’re delighted that Luke is staying with us,” Boro manager Michael Carrick said of the deal. “After coming in on loan in January, he settled in very quickly and made a big impact, bringing his character and personality to the group. He knows what it takes to be a success in this league. The club has got under his skin and the supporters have really taken to him as well, so it’s great to have him on board permanently.” Finance expert Kieran Maguire has claimed Leeds will have to settle a historic transfer fee bill before they can spend money on new players. He wrote last April: “Leeds owe other clubs a Jesus, Mary, Joseph and the wee donkey £190m in transfer fee instalments on player purchases but only due to receive £2m on player sales. Outstanding transfer fee creditors of £190m mean that Leeds will have to pay for old player acquisitions before they can spend this summer.” Leeds have a number of players out on loan, most of which they will look to sell, and it will be a case of assessing the bill they have left after they sell the players they no longer want, and indeed can no longer afford to keep. Advertisement Advertisement Sheffield Wednesday have reignited their interest in highly-rated Arsenal youngster Mika Biereth as their summer plans begin to take shape, The Star understands . The London-born Danish youth international was a January target for the Owls, who ultimately lost out to Austrian outfit Sturm Graz - his planned season-long loan with Motherwell was cut short by the Gunners as they sought to offer the striker a different experience. It is understood that Wednesday had at one stage had confidence they would claim the January signing of Biereth. A very successful stint in Austria only appears to have strengthened the Owls’ interest in the Arsenal prospect, who scored nine times and claimed four assists in his 22 appearances for Sturm Graz. A run of three goals in four matches in the Europa Conference League proved a highlight alongside their post-season run to the Austrian Bundesliga Championship. Biereth also won the Austrian Cup in his time there. Biereth started every game for the Austrian side and with the prospect of Champions League football to contend with, it is understood they will once again seek to bring him back on loan for next season in competition with Wednesday and a host of other clubs in the UK and in Europe.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON ( ) — When a Purple Heart recipient named Pat reached out to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray in November to inform her that he couldn’t transfer his GI bill benefits to his children, he wasn’t expecting congressional action to solve the problem. He simply just wanted to let the Washington state Democrat know, he told States Newsroom in an exclusive interview. With a child about to head to college, Pat, who didn’t want his last name used, had recently been told by the Army that he couldn’t transfer his education benefits to them because he received the Purple Heart after he was medically discharged. This rule does not apply to those who receive the medal while still in service. Murray and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday aimed at closing that loophole. The legislation, titled the , would permit retroactive award recipients who served on or after Sept. 11, 2001, to transfer their education benefits to one or more dependents. It was unveiled just ahead of Memorial Day, when the nation honors its deceased service members. “As the daughter of a Purple Heart recipient, I’ve seen firsthand the enormous sacrifices Purple Heart veterans make to defend our freedoms, and I feel strongly that we should be doing absolutely everything we can to help all veterans and their families thrive,” Murray said in a statement Thursday. “It doesn’t make any sense that service members who are awarded a Purple Heart after their service can’t transfer their GI benefits to their dependents, while those who receive it during their service can — and I am grateful to Pat, my constituent in Washington state who brought this gap in the law to my attention,” continued Murray, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. “Our legislation will close this loophole and allow more children of Purple Heart veterans to further their education. I want to thank Sen. Tillis for joining me on this legislation, and I’ll be working hard to get it passed into law.” Pat was medically discharged from the U.S. Army and retroactively received a Purple Heart for his actions during Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage in January 2020 on an Iraq airbase, after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The Army later approved 39 Purple Hearts for service members who experienced the attack, to a December 2021 report by the Army Times. As his teenager looks to enroll at Central Washington University next year, Pat found out that by law his education benefits would only be available for transfer if he had received the award while still in service. “My thought was, ‘I doubt that legislators would have done that intentionally.’ I just thought, you know, people probably just didn’t think about how that happens — that some people are going to get retroactive Purple Hearts, or for whatever reason in evaluating them, they’re delayed. So it’s not like an unusual thing,” Pat said in a phone interview. “I wasn’t thinking much was going to happen, but I just wanted to write Sen. Murray, who is my local senator, and let her know the issue. They responded by saying, ‘That’s an oversight on our part, and we want to make good on that.’” Pat said he’s “grateful for Sen. Murray” and hopes his action is able to help other Purple Heart veterans. For now, his family is moving forward with the college enrollment process for his child, he said. Among the provisions in the legislation, Murray and Tillis’ bill would also allow veterans to split up 36 months worth of benefits to each of their dependents. For example, they could transfer 20 months to one and 16 months to another. The bill, if enacted, would also prohibit the benefits from being treated as marital property or a marital estate asset. And, the bill would permit dependents to access unused benefits if their veteran family member has died. “Purple Heart recipients are heroes who honorably served our country at great costs, and this oversight that prevents servicemembers who received this distinguished award after their service from transferring their GI bill benefits to their dependents needs to be corrected immediately,” Tillis said in a statement Thursday. “I am proud to co-introduce this commonsense legislation with Sen. Murray to close this loophole and ensure every Purple Heart recipient and dependents are able to further their education,” continued Tillis, who also sits on the Senate’s Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The number of veterans who retroactively received the Purple Heart after their post-9/11 service is unclear. The bill is estimated to cost $500,000 in mandatory spending over 10 years, according to an informal analysis provided to Murray’s office by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill has received praise from veterans groups, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “Unfortunately, not every veteran’s service and sacrifice on behalf of the United States of America is fully recognized while they’re still in uniform,” IAVA CEO and Iraq War veteran Allison Jaslow said in a statement Thursday. “The Purple Heart Veterans Education Act ensures that those veterans who’ve endured bodily harm on behalf of our nation, but weren’t recognized for it until their service concluded, are able to turn that recognition into an investment in the education of their loved ones.” The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have “greatly increased” the number of Purple Heart recipients as the Department of Defense has added some traumatic brain injuries as a recognized condition for the award, to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It wasn’t until a that Purple Heart recipients were able to receive full post-9/11 GI Bill benefits regardless of their length of service. Previously, the recipients had to have 36 months of active service. The Department of Defense does not maintain a record of the number of recipients, according to the CRS, but by law they do maintain a publicly accessible list with the permission of the veteran or next of kin. Military historians and the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor about 1.8 million Purple Hearts have been awarded since 1932. The Army Historical Foundation as of 2016 that 30,000 Purple Hearts had been awarded since 2001. The CRS this statistic. To remove this article -",

The two-day event, set for June 1-2 at the Napa Valley Expo in downtown Napa, features such popular acts as Grammy-winning pop-rock group Mana, corridos tumbados specialist Junior H, multimillion-selling vocalist Alejandro Fernandez and chart-topping San Bernardino band Fuerza Regida. The party is being thrown by the same people behind the massively popular BottleRock Napa Valley, which finished up its 2024 run over Memorial Weekend with Stevie Nicks, Pearl Jam, Ed Sheeran, Megan Thee Stallion and many others. Oh, and Mana — the Day 2 (June 1) headliner at La Onda — was also set to perform at BottleRock. Other acts worth catching at this first-ever Festival La Onda include Mexico City’s Los Ángeles Azules, Guadalajara’s Ximena Sariñana, Stanislaus County act Eslabon Armado and Dallas DJ/music producer RayBurger. In all, more than two dozen Latin music acts will perform across multiple stages during the two days. And, of course, there will be plenty to eat and drink over the weekend as well.

        "content": "Scottish football has seen its share of deadly attacking duos in the past where two players find themselves on the same wavelength more often than not and are able to contribute with goals. This season has been no different with many clubs having two players who combined more than any other in their team throughout the campaign. Celtic, Rangers, Hearts, Hibs, Aberdeen, Kilmarnock, Motherwell and Ross County all feature on this list of deadly duos. According to data from football statistics site WhoScored, these pairs all linked up on three occasions each last season and although it was a Celtic pair who clearly had the best connection there were plenty of link-ups elsewhere: The central midfielder and the striker combined for six Premiership goals with O'Riley assisting Kyogo three times The Japanese attacker returned the favour to his teammate and assisted the Dane for three of his own goals Miovski was Aberdeen's star man once again and although Duk didn't hit the heights of his first season at Pittodrie he still combined well with his attack partner when they played together Kilmarnock clearly wouldn't have reached the heights they did this season without these two and it was Armstrong who provided the most assist to the Welsh forward",

        "content": "BOISE— Memorial Day weekend is shaping up to be a busy travel time in the Gem State. Idaho is about to enter the 100 Deadliest Days on Idaho roads- the time between Memorial Day and Labor Day when there is a spike in fatal and serious injury crashes. Seventy* people have been killed in crashes on Idaho roads so far this year — including the recent crash on US 20 in Bonneville County that tragically killed six people in one vehicle. The Idaho Office of Highway Safety (OHS) is imploring drivers to be vigilant and drive engaged this Memorial Day weekend and all summer. “We call this period the 100 Deadliest Days, but it would be great to be proven wrong. Make it safer out there for yourself and others by slowing down, putting down distractions, buckling up, and planning a sober ride home,” said OHS program manager Josephine Middleton. While it would seem like winter is the most dangerous time to drive, driving is more dangerous in summer. This seems paradoxical. Why would roads be more dangerous in summer when weather conditions are better? During the summer more people are out of school or work, on vacation, and celebrating leading to higher rates of risky behavior behind the wheel like impaired driving, distracted driving, and speeding. This summer OHS and its partners across the state will work together to remind people to make safer choices whenever they are on the road. Some of these activities will include partnering with law enforcement agencies to get dangerous drivers off the road, public awareness campaigns, and community outreach events. “We have a lot of wonderful partners who help us make Idaho’s roads a safer place, but we can’t just rely on them,” Middleton said. “We can all do a better job of looking out for each other on our roads and make it safely through this summer.” 2024 Fatality information*: 70 people killed in traffic crashes to date 2024 Fatalities by county: District 1 District 2 District 3 District 4 District 5 District 6 *All 2024 data is preliminary and subject to change.

        "description": "‘Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily,’ the former NFL star writes",
        "content": "As an event consultant and mother-of-three, Kylie Kelce is much more than the keeper of the household, just ask her husband, NFL icon Jason Kelce . In response to recent criticisms aimed at his wife, the former Philadelphia Eagles took to X, formerly known as Twitter, defending her honor and their marriage with a firm message. “I don’t think of Kylie as a homemaker, I think of her as my wife. I think of her as a mother,” he stated in a 27 May post. “She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily,” he continued. “The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first. We both raise our kids, we both work, We both keep our home.” On 26 May, Kylie was the target of one internet sleuth’s crude comment, labeling her an inadequate “homemaker”. The blunt X user felt inclined to verbally attack Kylie after she publicly denounced Harrison Butker’s controversial Benedictine College commencement speech , arguing stay-at-home mothers should be celebrated more for their commitment and achievements rather than women in the workforce. “Your wife is a homemaker. But you can’t support Butker. And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. Sorry but it is dirty and messy on television. Seems you’re a bit hypocritical. Y’all are going to be left with nothing but swifties. You just ruined your gig. It’s a shame,” the online user wrote. Jason quickly shut down the judgment, adding that when their house is “messy” it’s not his wife’s fault. “It is both our faults it is messy, but such is life with 3 young children, busy schedules, and neither of us being neat freaks,” the professional athlete said. While the 36-year-old father doesn’t consider Kylie the “homemaker”, he acknowledged that some families prefer a dynamic where one person is responsible for the house upkeep. The now-retired NFL player addressed Butker’s 11 May comments with his brother Travis on their podcast, New Heights . “A lot of the things he said in his commencement speech are not things that I align myself with, but he was giving a commencement speech at a Catholic university and – shocker – it ended up being a very religious and Catholic speech,” Jason noted to Travis, one of Butker’s teammates on the Kansas City Chiefs. Meanwhile, Travis admitted he didn’t agree with “just about any” of Butker’s points. Fourteen days after Butker, 28, gave his graduation speech, the football kicker spoke out to support the message he delivered. During Nashville’s “Courage Under Fire” event, Butker said: “If it wasn’t clear that the timeless Catholic values are hated by many, it is now. “Over the past few days, my beliefs, or what people think I believe, have been the focus of countless discussions around the globe,” he added. “At the outset, many people expressed a shocking level of hate. But as the days went on, even those who disagreed with my viewpoints shared their support for my freedom of religion. “Our love for Jesus and thus our desire to speak out should never be outweighed by the longing of our fallen nature to be loved by the world.” Apart from Butker’s shared thoughts on a woman’s role in the household, the young competitor characterized Pride Month as a “deadly sin” to Benedictine’s graduating class of 2024 and their families.",

        "content": "Smoke Justis is hosting an event designed to honor those battling Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS. The event, Q4A Cure, will take place on Saturday, June 1—the same weekend as Major League Baseball’s ALS Awareness Game. The goal of Q4A Cure is to bring people together to raise money and awareness of the progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Currently, there is no cure. Smoke Justis’ founder, Richard Dickmann, has a personal connection with ALS. Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) “In 2005, after a seven-year-long battle with ALS, I lost a good friend to the disease and another close friend is battling it right now, so for me, this cause is near and dear to me,” Dickmann said in a press release. “Over the past 30 years, I have had countless friends, relatives and customers that have had loved ones also fight this horrible disease, so, this is why we decided to host Q4A Cure. We want to bring as many people together as we can to support the mission of The ALS Association.” Starting at 11 a.m., Ben Maile and the Zack Attack band take the stage, followed by the Marty Connor Band at 3 p.m., with the Derek Alan Band closing the evening at 7 p.m. Marking the 10th anniversary of the Ice Bucket Challenge, Q4A Cure will be honoring this challenge that meant so much to the ALS community. Meals will also be provided with a minimum donation of $25 for adults and $12 for children, and pork barbecue will be included with a collection of classic sides and desserts. “On behalf of The ALS Association, I would like to express sincere gratitude to the Northern Kentucky community and everyone at Smoke Justis who have made this event possible,” said Drew Keelin, development manager of The ALS Association Kentucky Chapter. “This groundbreaking event, the first of its kind, will not only elevate awareness but will generate substantial funds for individuals bravely battling ALS.” Proceeds from Q4A Cure will be presented to The ALS Association on Sunday, June 9 during the Cincinnati Reds’ ALS Awareness Game against the Chicago Cubs.

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — The Boston Celtics are on the brink of advancing to the NBA Finals as they face the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Monday night on ESPN. Holding a commanding 3-0 series lead, the Celtics have a chance to complete a sweep and secure their second Finals appearance in three years. You can watch the game for free on (free trial) or (free trial). (half off first month) also has promotional pricing for new customers. The Celtics’ resilience was on full display in Game 3, where despite trailing by 18 points at one stage, they clawed back to snatch a 114-111 victory. The hero of the night was Jrue Holiday, who despite battling a fever, played over 38 minutes and made a crucial steal in the final seconds to preserve the win. Holiday’s defensive play, stripping Andrew Nembhard of the ball with just 1.7 seconds left, was hailed as one of the biggest in franchise history. Now, the Celtics are one win away from the NBA Finals. Jayson Tatum had one of his best playoff performances with 36 points, 10 rebounds, and 8 assists, highlighting his capabilities as a star in the NBA. As they prepare for Game 4, the Celtics are aware of the potential pitfalls. Last season, they were on the opposite side of a 3-0 series, nearly allowing the Miami Heat to come back before winning in Game 7. Head coach Joe Mazzulla emphasized the importance of staying focused and not underestimating their opponents. “We know for one second we can’t relax,” Tatum said. “This is the playoffs, and anything can happen.” On the other side, the Pacers are fighting to keep their season alive. Despite missing their star point guard Tyrese Haliburton in Game 3 due to a hamstring injury, the Pacers showed remarkable tenacity. Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell stepped up, combining for 55 points, 15 assists, and 13 rebounds. Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner also delivered strong performances, each contributing 22 points. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle struck a defiant tone in his post-game press conference, urging his team and fans to believe in a comeback. “We have to look at what’s in front of us,” Carlisle said. “We have the best fans in the NBA here. We have the greatest basketball building on the planet and we have another game in front of them to go after these guys. And believe me when I tell you, we are going after them.” The Pacers have demonstrated resilience throughout the season, bouncing back from losses and fighting through adversity. They will be hoping for Haliburton’s return to bolster their chances, but regardless of his status, they are determined to extend the series and push it back to Boston for Game 5. “We have to give everything we have,” Siakam said. “Obviously, to this point, we’ve had an incredible season and nobody wants to see it end. We’re going to fight to the end. For us, it’s just, ‘Let’s get one game.’ We can’t look ahead. Whatever is in front of us doesn’t matter. We have to focus on the next game and give everything we have to win that game.” The Pacers’ ability to bounce back from adversity will be crucial. They have a strong track record of responding after losses, going 23-12 following defeats in the regular season. This resilience will be tested as they aim to avoid a series sweep and keep their playoff hopes alive. As the Celtics and Pacers prepare for what could be a decisive Game 4, the stage is set for another intense battle. The Celtics will look to close out the series and move on to the Finals, while the Pacers will fight to extend their season and defy the odds. Here’s more information on how you can watch the Indiana Pacers vs. Boston Celtics Here is some further background on Saturday night’s game, courtesy of the Associated Press. INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Coach Rick Carlisle expects the Indiana Pacers to punch back Monday night. Yes, he realizes no NBA team has ever rallied from a 3-0 deficit to win a best-of-seven series, and, of course, his players understand a Game 4 victory only assures them of one thing — another trip to Boston for another elimination game. And yet, Carlisle believes his players are ready to continue the fight. “We’re going to come at these guys harder on Monday,” Carlisle said Saturday after losing their first home playoff game this season. “Our fans need to come out and they need to get louder than they’ve ever been, and we’ve got to extend this series. We’ve got to get back on that plane for Game 5.” Clearly, that will be easier said than done. The Pacers have blown winnable chances in the final minute of Games 1 and 3 and hung close in Game 2 — until a left hamstring injury sent All-NBA guard Tyrese Haliburton to the locker room in the third quarter. He didn’t return that night and sat out Saturday, against his wishes. Carlisle did not say Sunday whether Haliburton might play in Game 4. Regardless, the Pacers season comes down to this — win or go home. “There’s no guy in this locker room that’s packed it in,” Pacers guard T.J. McConnell said. “We’re going to have to get one here and extend the series, then go back to Boston and try to make things difficult. But there’s no guy in this locker room that’s going to quit.” The Celtics know how this works, too. They’ve appeared in six of the last eight Eastern Conference finals and they’re now just a win away from advancing to the NBA Finals for the second time during that span. Five wins would give the franchise its first championship since 2008. But a year ago, Boston found itself facing an even trickier proposition after losing the first two games at home before getting blown out at Miami. The Celtics responded to the 3-0 deficit by winning the next three before enduring a rare Game 7 loss at home. It’s a lesson that could serve them well Monday night when they’ll try to improve to 6-0 on the road in these playoffs. “It’s huge,” All-NBA forward Jayson Tatum said after Boston’s sixth straight playoff win. “We’re in a great position right now, one win away from the finals. But we know we can’t relax for one second. A year ago, we were down 0-3 and figured out a way to force it to seven, so we’re not looking past Monday.” Tatum has been the Celtics catalyst in this series, scoring a playoff career-high 36 points twice in the first three games. The big lead also gives Boston the potential luxury of resting injured players a bit longer. Starting center Kristaps Porzingis has not played since April 29 because of a strained right calf. Backup center Luke Kornet sat out Saturday with a sprained left wrist, and coach Joe Mazzulla has no reason to rush either back now. Plus, if the Celtics pull off their first series sweep since beating Brooklyn 4-0 in the first round of the 2022 playoffs, they could get even more rest depending on the twists and turns in the Dallas-Minnesota series. The Mavericks took a 2-0 lead into Sunday night’s game at Dallas. First, though, Boston is focused on closing out the Pacers. “I believe these past few years we’ve had some battles and I feel like our group, we’ve been through it, we understand it, we’ve had some grueling, tough series and this one is no different,” said Celtics center Al Horford, who made seven 3-pointers in Game 3. “This team, it’s a very good team. They’re very dangerous, there’s a reason they’re here, and I know we’re up three, but it could easily be very different.” The Pacers know it, too, and that’s why they intend to show the basketball world just how much fight they still have left Monday night. “We’ve got to give everything that we have,” said Pacers forward Pascal Siakam, who won an NBA crown with Toronto in 2018. “Obviously, to this point we’ve had an incredible season and nobody wants to see it end. So we’re going to fight to the end, and I think it’s like let’s get one win and give everything we have to win that game.”",

The matchup is available on multiple streaming services. Tonight’s game will broadcast live on TNT and truTV with the puck dropping at 8:30 p.m. Eastern (6:30 p.m. Mountain). Fans who have parted ways with their local cable provider can catch the game by utilizing streaming alternatives like , which offers a free trial. is also offering promotional discounts for new customers. Dallas’ Mason Marchment broke a 1-1 stalemate at 3:41 of the third period when he deflected a shot attempt, which sent the puck through the legs of Vincent Desharnais before it bounced across the ice and snuck between the sights of Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner. A massive moment by mere inches. With Edmonton gambling without their goalie in the final minutes, The Stars tacked on insurance with an Esa Lindell empty-netter with 2:03 left. Jamie Benn added the assist on the dagger, his seventh dish of the playoffs. Benn nabbed the game’s first goal and his fourth of the postseason back in the opening frame. The Stars’ Wyatt Johnson notched two assists in the strong showing. He has tallied seven goals and six assists in the playoffs. Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger was sensational under duress, garnering 28 saves, including 16 in a dangerous first period where the Stars were outshot 17-4. He was tested to his limit on a reaching save to deny Mattias Ekholm’s shot with just under four minutes left. Oettinger has saved 63 of 67 shots in the series. He has also notched above a .920 save percentage in five of the last six playoff games. He has earned 28 or more saves in three straight games. Skinner recorded 22 saves in the loss. He has allowed seven goals on 89 shots in his four starts since returning in Game 6 from being briefly benched in the Vancouver Canucks semifinal series. Connor Brown tallied Edmonton’s equalizer in the opening period, which came just 44 seconds after Dallas’ first strike. Neither team has been able to convert on their power plays, but that might change back in Canada. The Oilers are 8 of 21 (38.1%) on the power play at home in the playoffs, which is the best mark for any remaining team. They went 0 of 3 in Dallas while the Stars went 0 of 6 at home. Edmonton star Leon Draisaitl came up empty on the night, ending his remarkable 13-game streak with at least one point. It fell one game short of matching Mark Messier’s franchise record set in 1988. Draisaitl has nine goals and 16 assists in the playoffs. It was the seventh consecutive time the Stars came into Game 2 of a playoff series coming off a loss, including all three this season. Dallas is 5-1 on the road this postseason. Their defense continues to reign. The Stars have limited the opposition to just a single goal four times in the past six playoff games. Dallas’ power play and penalty kill piece, Roope Hintz, who has missed the past four games with an upper-body injury, could return for the crucial road game. He has two goals and four assists in 11 postseason games. Hintz is being considered a gametime decision. Below is a highlight recap of Dallas’ big win to even the series.

        "content": "More than a year after her namesake took nearly everything away, Wairoa resident Gabrielle Mei’s house is almost ready for her to move back into. The heavy rain hitting northern Hawke’s Bay last week had been an unpleasant reminder of Cyclone Gabrielle for the 89-year-old as it pelted her temporary “pod” abode in the backyard of her property. Shortly after 8am on February 14, 2023, the banks of the Wairoa River broke and Mei’s home where Crarer St turns into Ruataniwha Rd was one of just over 100 properties in Wairoa hit by 1.5 metre flood waters. The mother of six had no whānau living in Wairoa and lived alone, but she was whisked away by a neighbour who came to warn her before the flood waters arrived. “I wasn’t sure what she was talking about when she came to get me, because the sun was shining,” Mei said. In the whirlwind aftermath of the following days, between 20 and 50 fellow residents waded in to help clean up her property. “I was really grateful for that. People I didn’t even know, I had seen a few around town but I didn’t know personally,” Mei said. Mei avoided saying Cyclone Gabrielle when answering questions about that time. It still feels strange to call the cyclone by her name. “I’m a bit frightened of what people might say when they hear what my name is,” she laughed. From her backyard which was once again under water 15 months later, Mei laughs again as she describes the only memento she still kept from before flood waters tore through her home - an old bath plug she found embedded in the mud. “When everything is washed away you’ve got no shoes, no gumboots, no raincoat. You struggle to get clothes and stuff,” Mei said. “I found the bath plug. I thought ‘Oh my goodness’.” Her home is finally in the last stages of the repairs and she said it will likely be ready for her to move back into next month. “I think the last stage is the painting, then they will do the flooring and the carpet and all that.” She has lived in Wairoa for most of her life, outside of a 20-year stint in Wellington during which she missed the impact of Cyclone Bola on the region. “I didn’t realise what a cyclone was really because I had never been in a flood like Bola,” Mei said. She did remember flooding in Wairoa during the North Island storm of 1948 when she was about 12 years old. The National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) NZ Historic Weather Events Catalogue noted “extensive flooding” on the Wairoa River from Frasertown downstream, silt and heavy stock losses at the time. Highways and country roads suffered damage and all parts of the Wairoa district, except the Wairoa borough, were without power anywhere from one evening to three days and Wairoa was without water for a week. “It was a lot of water, it came through the same way as it did for Bola and [Cyclone Gabrielle],” Mei said.

        "description": "Rafael Nadal is unsure if he will be back next year at Roland-Garros – the tournament he won 14 times – after bowing out in the first round.",
        "content": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal has cast serious doubt on whether he will play the French Open again after suffering his earliest exit ever at Roland-Garros. This year’s Olympic Games will be played at the home of the claycourt major, so Nadal will be back for that – assuming his battle-weary body lets him – but there is every chance he has contested his last match at his favourite tournament. Rafael Nadal remains unsure if he will return to Roland-Garros next year. Credit: Getty Images Nadal conceded as much after Alex Zverev played the party-pooper in a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 first-round triumph across three-plus hours under Roland-Garros’ new retractable roof as the German bids to win his maiden grand slam title. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know [if] it’s going to be the last time that I’m going to be here in front of all of you, honestly. I am not 100 per cent sure,” Nadal said. “But if it’s the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparation, and the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most. “It’s difficult to say what’s going on in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back playing here at Roland-Garros, but I can say 100 per cent I enjoy a lot playing here. “I am travelling with family, and I am having fun, and the body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago. I think maybe in two months, I [might] say it’s enough, I can’t give anything else, but it’s something that I don’t feel yet. I have some goals in front. “I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics – that motivates me, that’s going to be another chance. I really hope to be well-prepared [for that].” The Parisian crowd did everything they could to get Nadal across the line. Credit: Getty Images There was enough doubt for the likes of world No.1s Novak Djokovic and Iga Świątek, plus Nadal’s Spanish successor Carlos Alcaraz, to cram into a frenzied Court Philippe-Chatrier just in case this was it. The lion’s share of the crowd, from Nadal’s wife Maria Francisca Perello to his father Sebastian, long-time coach Carlos Moya and Spanish Tennis Federation boss Miguel Díaz Román, were left disappointed as he lost in the first round at Roland-Garros for the first time. Handed a painfully difficult draw against Rome champion and world No.4 Zverev in a rare visit to Paris as an unseeded competitor, Nadal produced some of his best tennis of the year. The 37-year-old legend played well enough to be up a break on Zverev – whose domestic violence trial in Germany will be held mid-tournament, without him needing to attend – in the second and third sets, but could not hang on. Zverev quickly reeled Nadal in each time he fell behind and looked every bit the title contender he is being billed as. The roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier, under which back-to-back women’s champion Świątek earlier breezed through to the second round for the loss of only three games on a rainy Paris day, was another reminder of the changing times. Even so, Nadal’s ability to still challenge one of the sport’s best players off an abbreviated preparation might be why he is finding it so hard to let go. There was mutual respect between Nadal and Alex Zverev. Credit: AP This was a much more pleasant experience for Zverev than their last meeting on this court. That epic, high-quality semi-final stoush two years ago ended prematurely when the German rolled his right ankle and tore three lateral ligaments before leaving in a wheelchair. “I have to congratulate Sasha [Zverev] for this great match and last week, [his] victory in Rome, and I really wish you all the best for the rest of the tournament,” Nadal said. “2022, I know was a super tough moment for you, so you deserve more, so many congratulations and all the best. “I have been going through a very tough two years, in terms of injuries. I went all through this process with the dream to be back here at Roland-Garros. It’s true that the first round [draw] hasn’t been the ideal one ... I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sasha.” Zverev spoke briefly, and graciously, before Nadal but quickly stepped aside to let the 22-time grand slam winner take centre stage. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It’s such a great honour [to share the court with you]. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court, and I don’t know what to say – today is not my moment, it’s Rafa’s moment.” Nadal took his time deciding whether to contest this year’s claycourt slam as he struggled to play anywhere near his imperious best on the red dirt, a surface he was nigh on invincible on for most of his hall-of-fame career. The former world No.1’s mind remains willing, but his ailing body stopped him making his much-anticipated return at this year’s Australian Open despite him playing in Brisbane and there were several other withdrawals after that, even throughout the clay season. Once Nadal finally did play, he was suddenly a mere mortal. Alex de Minaur became the first Australian to beat Nadal on clay in Barcelona, but conceded moments afterwards that the result would have been different in the Spaniard’s prime. Nadal recovered to exact revenge on Australia’s top player a week later in Madrid. However, he failed to reach even a quarter-final in any of the four clay tournaments he contested in 2024. Nadal fought hard but could not overcome title contender Zverev. Credit: AP He walked on court at Roland-Garros as a significant underdog – another new feeling – but gave his army of admirers plenty to cheer. Nadal picked at his shorts, pumped his fist with vigour after winning clutch points, oozed energy in general and fought as doggedly as ever. There were outrageously good low volley winners, screaming down-the-line forehands – including one brilliant one on the run off a Zverev overhead – and fearless shot-making in moments others shrink in. But Nadal mostly struggled to match Zverev’s big striking from the baseline, and reverted to serve-volleying where he could to shorten the rallies. As de Minaur effectively said after beating him in Barcelona: this is not the same Nadal who reigned over France for more than a decade. The end is nigh, but the Paris crowd revelled in the chance to watch the master one last time. Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .",

        "content": "Bobby Green has a big fight coming up at UFC 304 , but there’s another name he’s added to his hit list. Green meets Paddy Pimblett on the July 27 pay-per-view event in Manchester, England. Speaking on The MMA Hour , “King” previewed the Pimblett matchup, but said another fighter has also been relentlessly talking smack to him in his social media DMs. That fighter? Dillon Danis . “I don’t even want to give this guy the f*cking clout or the shine ...” Green said. “It’s the guy who sucks clout like no other. That guy is looking to suck up clout anywhere he can find it. “The Logan Paul fight [with Danis], that was f*cking horrible. It was such a terrible representation of what he should put as his work of art. That’s a terrible representation of that, and so he’s been hopping in my DMs and trying to talk sh*t to me, to promote to fight this guy. I’m like Dillon, Dilly, I don’t know where you think we’re even on the same level. I’m a full-fledged killer, you’re just a talker. You [haven’t] even fought nobody real.” Green said it all began after Danis’ back-and-forth with former UFC fighter Paige VanZant , which saw VanZant light up Danis as a “piece of sh*t” and not a real fighter. Danis’ approach to trash talk and promotion is behavior Green would like to use as an example for young fighters — specifically, how not to act. “I was talking to the young guys saying, ‘Don’t be like those guys.’ Because why? You’re going to hate it when [someone like VanZant] tells you [that] you ain’t sh*t,” Green said. “He jumped his ass in there, and now he’s begging for a fight with me. Man, before, these guys wouldn’t pay attention to me. I would post sh*t, I would talk sh*t to them, and they wouldn’t even pay attention to me. And now Dillon, he can’t stop messaging me. “And I’ve been kicking his ass every f*cking time. Kicking his ass.” In his most recent outing, Green earned a lopsided decision win over Jim Miller at UFC 300 in April. Green said he’s been hoping to get the chance to fight Pimblett for quite some time, and now he has it. It’s no coincidence that Green sees Danis and Pimblett as similar when it comes to trash talk and accolades. “In real life, [Danis is] getting beat up by a Logan [Paul], he’s getting beat up by a podcaster,” Green said. “He’s getting beat up by a fake wrestler. In real life, you’re not one of us. It’s the cool kids versus the brats. And Paddy’s another one of the brats. Look how he talks. “Look at him acting spoiled and sh*t like he did some sh*t. You ain’t done nothing in this motherf*cker yet to be talking about, and thinking you’ve earned something. You ain’t earned sh*t yet.”",

        "content": "Everyone knows is his practical effects. do actual stunts and capture them in-camera, and the results are masterful. But what maybe not everyone knows is that Miller’s films, in particular and the new , have a ton of visual effects. Like, . He just doesn’t use them only in obvious ways. “ , in [ ], there are hardly any shots that haven’t been manipulated digitally,” Miller told io9. “For instance, changing the sky. When , the sea was changing all the time. If you look at that film one moment it’s choppy, one moment it’s flat. You don’t need to do that anymore.” So basically every shot in both and has some kind of digital changes to it. But, for the most part, it’s subtle stuff. The scene Miller pointed to was “The Stowaway,” one of the film’s middle chapters and also its longest, most sprawling action sequence. In it, Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) tries to escape the Citadel but instead finds herself in an epic battle versus a group of Wasteland pirates. “When you’re doing extended sequences like ‘The Stowaway’ sequence, that was shot over 78 days. It’s a 15-minute sequence but the skies are consistent,” Miller said. “So we took what we thought was a good sky and we can reproduce that sky right through the story. So some shots have the real sky because the real sky looked really good. But in the next shot, it might have been where it was a completely different sky so we were able to match that. You can do that.” The film clearly has other digital effects too but Miller is mostly a fan of the ones that are invisible and keep everything smooth and cohesive. It’s a huge game-changer. “If you were shooting again today, the sea would be consistent,” He said. “Even meticulous filmmakers, guys like David Lean when they shot —obsessively, meticulous with their camera and lighting and so on—you can see where they shot different times of day and so on. You can avoid it now to some degree. It’s a much smoother experience Visually, might be a smooth experience but the experience overall is anything but, in the best possible way. It’s now in theaters.",

        "description": "Brings 140 years of manufacturing at the site to an end",
        "content": "Dulux is to shut its paint manufacturing business on Cork’s Commons Road by the end of this year with the loss of 45 jobs and ending a 140-year history of manufacturing on the site. The company, owned by Dutch multinational AkzoNobel, confirmed the manufacturing site and warehouse is to shut with operations moving to the UK as part of a rationalisation programme. When contacted by the Irish Examiner, Dulux said the Cork site requires significant renovations, upgrades and investment in order to futureproof it in the short term and that longer term, a new plant would have to be developed. As a result, it has decided to shut it in a move that would result in 45 redundancies. Most of the site’s current manufacturing volumes will be moved to the UK which will supply Dulux paint for the Irish market. “We understand the impact this will have on our colleagues and know that the coming weeks will be really difficult for everyone in our Cork plant, many of whom have worked at the site for more than 30 years,” said Seamus O’Donoghue, managing director, Dulux Paints Ireland. “We have an outstanding team in Ireland. But, as a global business we have an obligation to continually look at ways in which we can improve our processes, ensuring our products are produced more efficiently while maintaining the highest standards of quality not just now but into the future,” he said. The company said it will concentrate its efforts on supporting workers impacted by the decision and arrangements are being made to meet and consult with employee and union representatives. It said the only operation to cease in Ireland would be paint production with the company planning further investment in its non-manufacturing operations in Dublin. Sales, marketing, warehousing and logistics as well as AkzoNobel’s Dublin location are not impacted. The company will also expand warehouse capacity in Dublin to supply the Irish market. Under the same rationalisation programme, AkzoNobel said it is also closing plants in Groot-Ammers in The Netherlands and Lusaka in Zambia as part of a multi-year efficiency plan. When the Cprk plant finally closes at the end of this year, it will bring to an end more than 140 years of continuous manufacturing operations on the site. The plant on the city’s Commons Road which straddles the River Bride, has been at the forefront of the Irish paint industry for over 14 decades, dating back to when it originally opened its doors in 1885 when it was established for the manufacture of chemicals. By the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922, it was the largest paint and varnish manufacturer in the country. In the 1930s HGW Paints, as it was then known, partnered with British chemical firm ICI in the production of special paints for the Henry Ford assembly plant in Cork. In the 1960s the facility took responsibility for the manufacturing and marketing of ICI’s Dulux brand in Ireland. ICI was acquired by AkzoNobel in 2008 and more than €2m was invested in the plant in 2010 to upgrade the facility. A collection of the latest business articles and business analysis from Cork.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal is unsure if he will be back next year at Roland-Garros – the tournament he won 14 times – after bowing out in the first round.",
        "content": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal has cast serious doubt on whether he will play the French Open again after suffering his earliest exit ever at Roland-Garros. This year’s Olympic Games will be played at the home of the claycourt major, so Nadal will be back for that – assuming his battle-weary body lets him – but there is every chance he has contested his last match at his favourite tournament. Rafael Nadal remains unsure if he will return to Roland-Garros next year. Credit: Getty Images Nadal conceded as much after Alex Zverev played the party-pooper in a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 first-round triumph across three-plus hours under Roland-Garros’ new retractable roof as the German bids to win his maiden grand slam title. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know [if] it’s going to be the last time that I’m going to be here in front of all of you, honestly. I am not 100 per cent sure,” Nadal said. Loading “But if it’s the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparation, and the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most. “It’s difficult to say what’s going on in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back playing here at Roland-Garros, but I can say 100 per cent I enjoy a lot playing here. “I am travelling with family, and I am having fun, and the body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago. I think maybe in two months, I [might] say it’s enough, I can’t give anything else, but it’s something that I don’t feel yet. I have some goals in front. “I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics – that motivates me, that’s going to be another chance. I really hope to be well-prepared [for that].” The Parisian crowd did everything they could to get Nadal across the line. Credit: Getty Images There was enough doubt for the likes of world No.1s Novak Djokovic and Iga Świątek, plus Nadal’s Spanish successor Carlos Alcaraz, to cram into a frenzied Court Philippe-Chatrier just in case this was it. The lion’s share of the crowd, from Nadal’s wife Maria Francisca Perello to his father Sebastian, long-time coach Carlos Moya and Spanish Tennis Federation boss Miguel Díaz Román, were left disappointed as he lost in the first round at Roland-Garros for the first time. Handed a painfully difficult draw against Rome champion and world No.4 Zverev in a rare visit to Paris as an unseeded competitor, Nadal produced some of his best tennis of the year. The 37-year-old legend played well enough to be up a break on Zverev – whose domestic violence trial in Germany will be held mid-tournament, without him needing to attend – in the second and third sets, but could not hang on. Zverev quickly reeled Nadal in each time he fell behind and looked every bit the title contender he is being billed as. The roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier, under which back-to-back women’s champion Świątek earlier breezed through to the second round for the loss of only three games on a rainy Paris day, was another reminder of the changing times. Even so, Nadal’s ability to still challenge one of the sport’s best players off an abbreviated preparation might be why he is finding it so hard to let go. There was mutual respect between Nadal and Alex Zverev. Credit: AP This was a much more pleasant experience for Zverev than their last meeting on this court. That epic, high-quality semi-final stoush two years ago ended prematurely when the German rolled his right ankle and tore three lateral ligaments before leaving in a wheelchair. “I have to congratulate Sasha [Zverev] for this great match and last week, [his] victory in Rome, and I really wish you all the best for the rest of the tournament,” Nadal said. “2022, I know was a super tough moment for you, so you deserve more, so many congratulations and all the best. “I have been going through a very tough two years, in terms of injuries. I went all through this process with the dream to be back here at Roland-Garros. It’s true that the first round [draw] hasn’t been the ideal one ... I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sasha.” Zverev spoke briefly, and graciously, before Nadal but quickly stepped aside to let the 22-time grand slam winner take centre stage. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. Loading “It’s such a great honour [to share the court with you]. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court, and I don’t know what to say – today is not my moment, it’s Rafa’s moment.” Nadal took his time deciding whether to contest this year’s claycourt slam as he struggled to play anywhere near his imperious best on the red dirt, a surface he was nigh on invincible on for most of his hall-of-fame career. The former world No.1’s mind remains willing, but his ailing body stopped him making his much-anticipated return at this year’s Australian Open despite him playing in Brisbane and there were several other withdrawals after that, even throughout the clay season. Once Nadal finally did play, he was suddenly a mere mortal. Alex de Minaur became the first Australian to beat Nadal on clay in Barcelona, but conceded moments afterwards that the result would have been different in the Spaniard’s prime. Nadal recovered to exact revenge on Australia’s top player a week later in Madrid. However, he failed to reach even a quarter-final in any of the four clay tournaments he contested in 2024. Nadal fought hard but could not overcome title contender Zverev. Credit: AP He walked on court at Roland-Garros as a significant underdog – another new feeling – but gave his army of admirers plenty to cheer. Nadal picked at his shorts, pumped his fist with vigour after winning clutch points, oozed energy in general and fought as doggedly as ever. There were outrageously good low volley winners, screaming down-the-line forehands – including one brilliant one on the run off a Zverev overhead – and fearless shot-making in moments others shrink in. But Nadal mostly struggled to match Zverev’s big striking from the baseline, and reverted to serve-volleying where he could to shorten the rallies. As de Minaur effectively said after beating him in Barcelona: this is not the same Nadal who reigned over France for more than a decade. The end is nigh, but the Paris crowd revelled in the chance to watch the master one last time. Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .

        "description": "At least 28 of the 153 people released after indefinite detention was declared unlawful have allegedly gone on to commit fresh crimes.",
        "content": "Nearly a fifth of former immigration detainees freed following the High Court’s landmark decision in November have since been charged with state offences, compounding pressure on the Albanese government to use new laws to lock up those at high risk of committing new crimes. According to March figures recently shown to the Senate by Home Affairs, at least 28 of the 153 people released into the community on strict visa conditions after the court declared indefinite detention unlawful have been charged with offences under state laws. Immigration Minister Andrew Giles is facing a deepening crisis over the High Court detention fallout. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen The revelation raises even more questions about Labor’s handling of the crisis after the government conceded last month it was powerless to intervene in state justice systems following a former detainee’s alleged involvement in a violent home invasion in Perth. Coalition home affairs spokesman James Paterson said the government had still not applied to a judge for an order to re-detain anyone who posed an unacceptable community risk more than six months after passing the tough new legislation with the help of the opposition. “At least 28 members of the NZYQ cohort have reoffended after being released into the community,” Paterson said. “How bad does the detainee crime spree need to get before they act?” This masthead revealed former detainee Majid Jamshidi Doukoshkan, 43, wasn’t wearing an ankle monitor at the time he was allegedly involved in the violent Perth home robbery on April 16. Coalition home affairs spokesman James Paterson has questioned when the government will make an application for preventative detention. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen It is not known how many of the 28 have been subject to electronic surveillance, but government figures released on May 10 said only 76 of the 153 former detainees were wearing the devices as part of their visa conditions. The March 24 figure was supplied by the department in answer to a question on notice from Senate estimates on March 27, and is a marked increase from the 18 former detainees who had been charged by state and territory police as of February 1. During the committee hearing, Australian Border Force commissioner Michael Outram, who is leading authorities’ supervision of former detainees alongside the Australian Federal Police, said the agency did not keep a “running tally” of people who had been charged with state offences. “What we need to know is whether there is somebody in the community who requires the visa conditions to be applied or not,” he said. “What they’re charged with, when they’re charged, when the state prosecutors change charges, which they do frequently, or drop cases or amend cases – we do not need to keep a running tally on all of that, and we don’t.” Asylum Seeker Resource Centre principal solicitor Hannah Dickinson said people released following the High Court decision were subject to minimal support “subjected to invasive and distressing conditions and to alarming vilification by politicians and the media, a maelstrom which prevented many from accessing employment, housing and other vital supports”. A spokesman for Immigration Minister Andrew Giles said the community protection board makes visa condition recommendations based on individual circumstances but “beyond this, the management of state crimes is a matter for state jurisdictions”. Giles is currently reeling from yet another detainee scandal after it emerged last week that a tribunal, acting partly in accordance with a ministerial direction he issued last year, had released a former detainee, Emmanuel Saki, who went on to allegedly commit murder. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal reinstated Saki’s visa on March 27, partly due to new rules introduced by Giles last year requiring the tribunal to consider the length of time spent in Australia when deciding if they would cancel a visa. Known as ministerial direction 99, it was issued on January 23, 2023, to assuage long-held concerns from the New Zealand government that its citizens were being deported in high numbers even when they had stronger ties to Australia than NZ. Home Affairs’ latest visa cancellation statistics show that, as of December 31, there was a significant reduction of visa cancellations on character grounds – particularly for New Zealanders – in the first six months of the 2023-24 financial year. Home Affairs is yet to clarify the role of direction 99 in those statistics. Former top immigration official Abul Rizvi said the direction would have influenced the drop in numbers, adding he viewed it as a correction to the policy under the Coalition, which cancelled 1015 visas on character grounds in 2019-20, of which 50 per cent were New Zealanders. That number dropped to 244 in the six months to December. Loading “I think what had happened under the Morrison government was a pretty extreme position,” he said. “If a person has grown up in Australia as a young child, it’s much harder to argue someone else should take them.” Official figures also show the number of people in immigration detention on character grounds has fallen steadily since early 2022. Following reporting by The Australian that the direction was used in determining a New Zealand child rapist should stay in Australia, opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan told reporters in Canberra on Monday the Coalition would scrap direction 99 if returned to government. “I don’t think that you could get a worse example that ministerial direction is clearly failing and that is why it needs to be rescinded,” he said. with AAP Cut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

        "description": "The new midwifery role at Dr Gray’s Hospital knits together in-person care and digital skills.",
        "content": "NHS Grampian has welcomed a new midwife to Dr Gray’s Hospital as part of the plans to return maternity services to Moray. Debbie McWilliam begun a new joint role at Dr Gray’s Hospital in Elgin in April, which will see her having time dedicated to digital projects as well as working on the ward. Debbie is passionate about putting women and families’ experiences at the heart of improving service delivery. She has led several quality improvement projects already and plans to use data collection and analysis to inform the way services, as well as midwifery education, are improved across Grampian. She said: “We’re streamlining digital services for women, for staff and for quality improvement and risk management purposes. This will help us provide seamless, multi-disciplinary and collaborative care, not only between our sites within NHS Grampian but also with our NHS Highland colleagues as well. “My post came about as part of the Maternity Collaborative between NHS Grampian and NHS Highland, and I’m part of a data and digital workstream alongside colleagues who work in both areas. I also teach knitting and crocheting locally and it’s not too different to that – as we pull together different threads, build up a picture and learn from each other. Teamwork is a valuable aspect of midwifery as we all work collaboratively to provide the very best care we can to families.” Debbie qualified as a midwife in 2010, worked in Australia for a year and gained her neonatal nursing qualification in 2015, after 17 years in banking. She was inspired to join the profession by the midwifery team in Elgin. “The team in Ward 3 and in the community made me want to be a midwife as they supported me so much when I was having my own kids. I am delighted to be part of that amazing team with some great colleagues and friends,” she explained. Debbie was “born and bred” in the North of Scotland, settled in Elgin in 1993 and now has two grown up children. She says she loves living in Elgin, which is “perfectly placed” for exploring the hills, coast and forest trails. She added: “One of my favourite things is discovering new walking trails and I’m currently on a mission to find all the Ordnance Survey Trig points in Moray and Nairn. I’m also grateful for the community spirit we have here and I enjoy teaching knitting and crocheting. I really love watching women make time for themselves and learn a new skill.”",

        "content": "“Bob Marley: One Love” was one of eight films nominated in the “Best Picture” category for the 2024 BET Awards. The biographical Marley film was released in theaters on February 14, 2024, and took in $51 million in its opening. Award winners will be announced on BET in a live presentation ceremony on June 30, 2024. The film’s story and reception The film follows Marley and his band, The Wailers, during the period in which they recorded their 1977 album, “Exodus” and performed at the One Love Concert. Directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green, the film stars Kingsley Ben Adir as Marley and Lashawna Lynch as his wife, Rita. According to Billboard magazine, the movie ranks as the fifth highest-grossing cinema music biography in history, and BoxOfficeMojo, a US website that measures box-office revenue, determined it had grossed nearly $97 million in the United States and just over $177 million globally as of May 2024. The film also attained a 92-percent audience approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes, a film and television review website. BET and the awards program Black Entertainment Television (BET), the first television network targeting Black audiences in the US, launched in 1980 under the leadership of Robert L. Johnson, who previously served as a lobbyist for the cable industry. The network is currently owned by Paramount Global via the CBS Entertainment Group and by 2015 was received in almost 76 percent of households that have television. The BET Awards, tagged as “Culture’s Biggest Night,” were established in 2001 to celebrate Black and other minority entertainers in film, music, sports, and philanthropy. BET has stated that in 2024 the awards will include more international and emerging performers. Voting for the Viewer’s Choice Award is slated to start in June 6, 2024. The other films nominated for “Best Picture” include “American Fiction,” “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” The Book of Clarence,” The Color Purple,” “The Equalizer 3,” and “The Little Mermaid.” Photos – Paramount Pictures",

        "content": "Organisers of this year’s Inverness Loch Ness Classic and Vintage Car Tour say the door is still open for late entries ahead of its return this Saturday. The non-competitive event, held by the Rotary Club of Inverness Loch Ness, is set to welcome owners of classic cars and vintage sports vehicles for a 160-mile tour of roads across the north. Co-organiser Ormond Smith said: “We’ve lost about three of four entries thanks to a certain concert in Edinburgh held by one Taylor Swift. A few are dragging their kids off to see the concert, but having said that we have three or four new entries, so one compensates the other. “We had set a deadline for our entry list, but we’re happy to extend the date for late entries. We are hoping that we may attract a few more as it’s all money to charities at the end of the day.” Classic Car Tours in the north and organisers from the Rotary Club of Inverness Loch Ness are looking forward to greeting entries from many parts of Scotland for this one day event. The tour is being held to raise funds for two local charities as its principal recipients this year — CHAS (Children’s Hospices Across Scotland) and Highlands and Islands Blood Bikes. Mr Smith added: “What we decided back in 2017 was to concentrate on local, or local branches of charities who will benefit directly from funds raised. We have supported CHAS in the past, but this year we are also supporting Highland and Islands Blood Bikes, who do a very worthwhile job in the region.” The route for the 2024 event takes in Nairnshire, Speyside and Glenlivet, returning to the Inverness Ice Centre base via Strathnairn and Loch Ness side, covering around 160 miles on A and B class roads. Among the cars already entered are a 1950’s Austin A105 Vanden Plas, a Morris 1000 Van — also from the ‘50’s — and evocative sports cars of the 1960’s like the Lotus Elan and the mighty Austin Healey 3000, and a rare Bristol 412 model of which only 97 were ever built. Full information including and entry form can be obtained from the Tour website or from event organiser Nicol Manson on 07774 695640 (before 8pm) or by email to nicol.manson@btinternet.com. Cars can be viewed prior to the start at Inverness Ice Centre before the 10am start and again in the afternoon as the entries arrive back at the Tour finish around 4pm.",

        "description": "All councils have to review representation every six years. Now it's Wairoa's turn.",
        "content": "The Wairoa District Council, which was the first council in Hawke’s Bay to include a Māori ward , has begun its obligatory representation review which will decide how the currently six-member council will look at the next two local elections. The reviews are required to be carried out by all councils every six years, and will decided whether the 2025 and 2028 elections will see any change from the current structure of a mayor and two wards – a general ward and a Māori ward each with three councillors at the table. Councillors can be elected from wards (including district-wide), “at large” (by all electors in the district, irrespective of whether they are on the general or Māori roll), or by a mixture, and a key consideration is whether the number of councillors should increase, or whether there should be any community boards for specific areas of the district or council operation. The options are retaining the current structure, or expanding to eight councillors with one district-wide Maori ward (four councillors) and one district-wide general ward (four councillors), or one district-wide Maori ward (three councillors), one district-wide general ward (three councillors) and two councillors elected at-large by all voters. Ultimately sanctioned by the Local Government Commission, representation arrangements need to be fair, effective, and representative. Geographic wards should be divided so that each councillor represents roughly the same number of people while ensuring communities of interest, such as urban, rural, isolated, or centralised, are represented. The council is seeking early feedback on how many councillors there should be, whether they are elected from wards or return to the previous district-wide election or a combination of both, whether the district should have any community boards, and how general and Māori wards would be framed. It will help the council determine a preferred option which will go to public consultation in the district in July-August. There are currently no community boards in a district which at the last election in 2022 had seven candidates in the general ward and six in the Māori ward, and when 51.5 per cent of the 5563 on the rolls voted. In a referendum at the 2016 local elections, there was 45 per cent voter support for the establishment of Māori wards for the elections in 2019 and 2022. Of other councils in Hawke’s Bay, the Hawke’s Bay Regional Council and the Hastings and Tararua district councils introduced Māori wards in 2022, after the need for a referendum was withdrawn by a 2021 change of legislation. Napier and Central Hawke’s Bay have decided on incorporation of Māori wards at the next elections and are currently going through of how they will appear in their representation, but a bill now before Parliament could bring back referenda if required.

        "content": "The (ASX: XJO) share ( ) is a stalwart in my portfolio, and I expect to own it for the rest of my life. Soul Patts is an investment house that has been listed since 1903, making it one of the oldest companies on the ASX. It started as a chemist with 21 pharmacy stores, but it's now a very different business. Incredibly, Soul Patts has been managed by the same family from the start – Robert Millner is the fourth generation of the family to chair the company. Being old doesn't automatically make it a compelling investment, though longevity is a useful characteristic for a long-term investment. It means I can confidently hold the ASX 200 share for a long time. Three factors really matter to me about this business. is appealing because it lowers the risk to the Soul Patts portfolio if a particular investment goes wrong. The portfolio is invested in multiple industries and asset classes, including ASX shares, ASX shares, private businesses, property, and credit/ . In terms of individual ASX companies, some of its main investments include ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ), ( ) and ( ). Other areas it's invested in include agriculture, resources, financial services, retirement living, swimming schools, electrification and more. I like that the business has the flexibility to invest almost anywhere, opening up lots of opportunities for the company to find the best investment. One of the most substantial financial moves that can help an ASX 200 share deliver long-term returns is the re-investment of profit back into itself for more growth. With Soul Patts, there's a double layer of re-investment occuring. The investment house's portfolio of companies are re-investing inside their own businesses. Soul Patts doesn't need to do anything for Wesfarmers, Goodman and Brickworks to invest in and grow their operations. On top of that, Soul Patts receives dividends and distributions from its portfolio of assets. After paying for its costs and sending a majority of the net to shareholders as a dividend, Soul Patts re-invests some of that cash flow into more opportunities, adding more financial power to the snowballing effect of growth. The ASX 200 share has grown its annual ordinary every year since 2000, the longest streak of consecutive dividend increases on the ASX. Dividend hikes aren't guaranteed, but it's nice to know that there's a good chance next year's dividend payment will be larger than this year's. In the , Soul Patts increased its interim payout by 11.1% after its net cash flow from investments increased by 6.9%. It currently has a grossed-up dividend yield of around 4%. I like that I can own Soul Patts shares and receive dividends, meaning I don't need to sell shares to capitalise on the growth it's generating.",

        "content": "POP queen Madonna has grown close to a young Brit boxer after her break-up from another fighter. Madge, 65, is said to get on “very well” with Richard Riakporhe, 34. It comes days after we told how Madonna had thrown in the towel on her relationship with boxer boyfriend Josh Popper. The Justify My Love singer is believed to have met Richard , nicknamed The Midnight Train, last year as he modelled for Burberry. A source said: “Richard met Madonna through the fashion world — they have mutual friends. They get on really well and have a lot of fun in each other’s company. “But at the moment they are just good friends.” In October, Madonna shared a picture online of her straddling Richard with the caption: “I had to sit somewhere.” Cruiserweight Richard has teased that Madge may come to watch his world title fight with Chris Billam-Smith at Crystal Palace’s Selhurst Park stadium next month. He told talkSPORT: “Madonna says she’s going to come down if she’s in London, she’s going to keep me updated. She said she wants to come to the fight.” Richard, whose parents are Nigerian, is 6ft 5in and has won all 17 of his fights — 13 of them by knockout. He was raised in Walworth, South London, and nearly died aged 15 after being stabbed in the chest when a robber tried to take his phone. On Saturday we revealed Madonna and Popper, 30, split after a year. They struggling to spend time together as Madonna has spent the past seven months touring.",

        "content": "In Fort Thomas where North Fort Thomas Avenue, Waterworks Road and Burnet Ridge come together, you may notice a bronze statue of a little girl reading a book. While it’s a pretty addition to a small garden created on the median by the Fort Thomas Garden Club, there is more to the story. The bronze statue honors Amy Head Fennell, a longtime Fort Thomas resident and past president of the garden club who passed away in 2021. Fennell grew up in the city and raised her family there. She attended Fort Thomas schools and graduated from Highlands High before earning a degree from the University of Kentucky College of Design. After establishing a career at design agencies in the region, she opened her own business, Ahead Design, in the city. Fennell’s husband, Bill “Frell” Fennell, said he and Amy grew up very near each other in Fort Thomas. Their parents were friends and had a tight and active social circle. The children grew up playing together and spending summers together, including trips to Florida for spring break. Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) The families spent those summers in what Fennell calls “old Florida” before the building boom of condos and businesses in the 1980s and ‘90s. “We had a really cool place. It was 1,500 feet of beach. It was kind of like the old Dirty Dancing type of resort. It was one large cabin and four or five small cabins. They chopped it all up between parents and kids. It was under the Florida pines, so you could get out of the sun. You could have a fire on the beach every night...We just had the time of our lives.” said Fennell. Fennell said he went to college at UK as well, and love blossomed between the two longtime friends. The pair married and established their own home in Fort Thomas and raised their sons there. Although she stayed in her hometown, Frell Fennell said his wife had a creative mindset and talent that sometimes took her far from home. She worked on projects throughout the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky region, but her work also took her to Tennessee, Florida, New York and North Carolina. She designed homes, condos, restaurants and boutique hotels. She was always up for a challenge, he said. “She always did things that everybody said, ‘You can’t do that.’ She once accessorized an entire condominium in Ashville in one day including driving down and back. It was an empty industrial building with exposed brick and drywall...She installed all the furniture, window treatments, pictures on the wall, made the beds with sheets, lamps, books, everything, so it was ready to live in. It was just crazy,” said Fennell. Amy Fennell was an active community volunteer throughout her life, often drawing on her design and business skills in support of area schools and other projects in the city, said her husband. “She was always giving back, doing something for someone else,” he said. When their sons were in school, she volunteered to chair fundraising events. At Johnson, she volunteered for the school’s annual Hullabaloo fundraiser and later served as chair. While the record for earnings for the event had been around $25,000, as chair Fennell more than doubled the proceeds. “She was very talented and creative...and she always accepted a challenge by going the extra mile,” Fennell said. When their sons reached high school, Amy Fennell turned her attention to supporting her alma mater, where she served on and chaired committees to raise funds for sports teams and other school needs. It was this spirit of giving back, especially to the area schools, that the garden club wanted to celebrate with the little statue, said current club president Lori Wendling, a close friend of Fennell. “Amy was a lifelong member and a generational member of the garden club of Fort Thomas. After she passed, many friends donated to the garden club in her honor. It was decided that a permanent statue of the young girl reading a book would be the perfect memorial,” Wendling said. She said the location, near Johnson School, seemed fitting since Fennell supported the school in many ways for many years. “We chose that because Amy had a very strong connection to Johnson. She went there as a child. She’s always lived right in that community area. It was her home school. It was the elementary school for her kids. And she volunteered there a ton. And we thought, you know, that’d be a good memory,” said Wendling. Wendling and another club member Alison Murphy, owner of Branch Out Design, worked on the project and oversaw the purchase and installation of the statue. They planted rose bushes and a variety of pink flowers around it. Fennell’s friends and family wanted something permanent and something that would reflect her lifelong connection to the community.

        "content": "“Xavi will leave the club at the end of the season.” This is a sentence that would’ve made no sense last year, perfect sense three months ago, no sense again three weeks ago and three days ago would’ve felt inevitable. Feels like some sort of twisted riddle? Ask any Barcelona fan how this season has gone. The die has now been officially cast, and after the most tumultuous, topsy-turvy campaign in recent memory, culminating in arguably the craziest managerial saga of all time, the footballing legend that is Xavi Hernandez has been sacked. He will be replaced by Hansi Flick, whose CV includes becoming the second manager ever (we know the first) to win six trophies in a single season with Bayern. As far as the result, it must be said that this story did not end poorly for either party. Xavi performed a very commendable (and often under-appreciated) job in taking a beleaguered, dysfunctional Barca side languishing in ninth and rediscovering its identity. But at the same time, this past season has made it fairly clear that as much as he bleeds Blaugrana, he is probably not the man to take us to the next level, and while Flick is certainly a risk, we can be cautiously optimistic that he is an upgrade. Photo by Joan Valls/Urbanandsport /NurPhoto via Getty Images And for Xavi, he made it clear when announcing his departure in January that he is tired; he used phrases like “cruel and unpleasant” and cited mental health concerns, so he now gets some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Further down the line, maybe he finds his way home again. So all in all, Xavi’s departure and Flick’s impending arrival weren’t the worst case scenario by any means. With that said, the circumstances behind Xavi’s departure, the decision-making from top to bottom, and most importantly, the direction from the head of the snake, club president Joan Laporta, absolutely were. When Xavi first announced his departure in January following a shocking 5-3 defeat to Villareal, Laporta trusted Xavi’s decision was for the best because “he is an honest person, and he is a person who loves Barca”. And yet, Barca’s form took a turn for the better. Ten wins and 13 games unbeaten followed Xavi’s announcement, including an impressive quarter-final victory against PSG, as Laporta began working both publicly and privately to convince his manager to stay. Ultimately, though, this season was defined by a few key games where Barcelona capitulated under pressure, none worse than Ronald Araujo’s red card in the second leg against PSG. Nonetheless, recognizing strong improvement in 2024, Xavi announced shortly after that he’d be staying on for another year. Laporta was seemingly over the moon with what he called great news, expressing that Barca had no other talks with other managers, rather just “waiting for Xavi to change his mind”. But then came trouble. Photo by PIERRE-PHILIPPE MARCOU/AFP via Getty Images The infamous press conference occurred following an uneventful win against Almeria in May. Xavi said: “We are going to try to compete [with Madrid]. The fans understand that the economic situation is very difficult. We are not in the same conditions as other clubs that have far more favorable Financial Fair Play conditions. The fans must understand that we need time, but this does not mean that we are not looking to compete and fight for titles, we will do our best to try and compete.” And Laporta exploded. Reports came out immediately after that Laporta was furious, that he felt personally betrayed by Xavi, and that his continuation at Barca was no longer assured. Laporta began to negotiate with other managers, Flick included, without telling Xavi a word. In other words, Xavi was receiving information about his future the same way as everybody else: from Gerard Romero, Toni Juanmarti, and journalists like us. For all the talk of what a legend Xavi is, how he has always acted honestly and put the club first, etc. Laporta didn’t even do him the courtesy of a phone call asking him to explain his words. Xavi didn’t say anything incendiary, he clearly didn’t blame Laporta for anything, and most importantly, he didn’t say anything that even the least involved of Barca fans don’t already know: the economic situation is messed up. Maybe one could argue his comments were slightly pessimistic and not motivational. Did they need to be said? No. But were they bad enough to elicit a complete reversal from the man that publicly petitioned for him to stay? In the words of the great Jordan Belfort, absolutely f****** not. Laporta’s response is truly baffling: to ultimately sack him over these comments defies all logic and reason. About two weeks, and only three matches, passed between when Xavi announced he was staying and when the rumors came out that Laporta wanted him gone, but the season was basically over at that point anyway so a footballistic decision wouldn’t make sense in this timeframe. The Vitor Roque drama could have been a factor, but again, it’s hard to believe Xavi would be sacked over one player: there has to be more to the story. We arrive at a more challenging supposition, because what else defies all logic and reason? Ego. Laporta has always been as charismatic as he is enigmatic, and in his first stint with the club, history mainly saw the best of him: presiding over arguably the greatest team of all time (with Xavi as a staple) made results speak for themselves. Photo credit should read LLUIS GENE/AFP via Getty Images But what is often glossed over is that just before he made the life-changing decision to promote the Barca B manager in 2008, he had faced a vote of no confidence where over 60% of socios called for his dismissal (just below the two-thirds majority needed), and following the vote, eight members of his board resigned in protest. In 2005 he had also seen five board members, including his eventual successor Sandro Rosell, leave their post, reportedly calling Laporta a megalomaniac. While we should of course take anything Rosell says with a pinch of salt (his two years in jail on corruption charges dictate that), it remains true that Barcelona’s success in the latter half of his presidency papered over the cracks of some pretty heavy criticism leveled at Laporta. His second stint the club has been different; after being financially and morally bankrupted in large part by former president Josep Maria Bartomeu, Laporta inherited a Barcelona that was in shambles, and to his credit has taken it quite far. He is a successful lawyer, businessman, and politician, but every so often, the ego rears its ugly head. The way that Xavi, a true legend of the game and faithful servant of our club, has been treated these past few weeks has been nothing short of disgraceful. As a player, he left when he could no longer give his best to Barca, and as a manager he promised to do the same, hence why he announced his departure initially. Photo by Eric Alonso/Getty Images It’s no secret that Xavi should’ve done better with the squad at his disposal this season, but he was the first to take responsibility: he resigned, so Mr. Laporta, accept it and move on. Flick was available then, too. The million-dollar question remains, why would he beg Xavi to stay just to fire him? This is where the ego comes into play again. For Laporta, it is not the same look whether Xavi resigns or gets fired. One is a situation of control, while the other may feel like his employees are making decisions without his involvement. As far-fetched as this troubling theory may initially sound, there are more examples that support it. Starting with the most famous case, Messi wanted to leave Barca in 2020, but Bartomeu slammed the door in his face, and eventually he agreed to stay for one more season. When Laporta took over in early 2021, he pushed for months for Messi to reconsider, and once the Argentine finally did, Laporta independently announced that Messi had to leave. Sound familiar? Photo by PAU BARRENA/AFP via Getty Images After the various economic levers he pulled to sign a 35-year-old Robert Lewandowski on a high salary, among others, Laporta cannot hide behind the financial situation for the Messi saga. Gerard Pique left on bad terms with Laporta in the middle of the following season, too: how many club legends, especially Masia products, leave their teams in January? And while his sacking was deserved, what about Ronald Koeman, another legend that Laporta dragged through the mud? The last and most curious example is that of former sporting director Mateu Alemany, who is very highly regarded by all for his stellar work amid the financial crisis. He announced in May 2023 that he would leave at the end of the season, and he, too, was convinced by Laporta to stay. However, in August Laporta gave his friend and Raphinha’s agent Deco (with zero experience as a director, having simply facilitated this one transfer) full control of the sporting department, Alemany’s area of expertise, without negotiating at all or even informing him beforehand. Again, sound familiar? In every single one of these cases, Laporta faced the voluntary departure of important people within Barca and convinced them to stay, only to then unilaterally decide not to keep them. It could be to boost his image for the fans, to exemplify his role as an authority figure or any number of possible reasons, but the pattern is clear. It’s obviously not proof of anything, but it’s certainly not negligible either and not small enough to ignore. Equally striking is that he replaced Messi as the figurehead and major attraction at the club with Lewandowski, the client of super agent and close friend Pini Zahavi. He replaced Alemany with Deco, a friend and former player from his first stint as president. He then used his friendship with another super agent, Jorge Mendes, to sign Joao Felix and Joao Cancelo on loan, and despite neither of them doing anywhere near enough to justify a permanent transfer, there are concerns he will attempt to negotiate out of goodwill to Mendes, who also represents Alejandro Balde and Lamine Yamal. And now, he has replaced Xavi with Flick, client of who? Pini Zahavi. His backup option? Rafa Marquez, friend of both Deco and him, manager of the B team and a clear downgrade from Xavi. Photo by Alex Caparros/Getty Images Laporta has manipulated the exits of several notable club members to give himself the decision-making power, and each time has replaced them with friends or like-minded associates. These are two separate ideas, but they are interconnected: they both reek of an authoritarian leader, and with Laporta’s past, the accusation is not unjustified. The Barca president has managed to surround himself with an inner circle that largely consists of people he has pre-existing relationships with, which diminishes his sense of accountability and provides significant free reign in his direction of Barcelona, which has always prided itself on its democratic values. On top of that, he has shown no remorse, regard, or loyalty towards even the most important members of the club. He has been successful in many ways as president, but there are very worrying signs that key decisions of his are driven by his ego and desire for control, which could well come back to bite Barca one day. Xavi is just the latest example, but Laporta has burned a lot of bridges at the club, from players to managers and even directors, and all the stories seemingly come back to one simple, critical note: he can’t be trusted.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThese three hidden tech gems could turn into money-printing machines by 2026 as they capitalize on key mega trends.The post 3 Tech Stocks You Haven’t Heard of That Can Quadruple by 2026 appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been the needle-mover of the economy for the last two decades. Most can’t argue that the stock market has been supercharged by the sheer dominance of tech companies over this time frame. Calls for a bubble are proliferating, but I do not think we are in a tech bubble right now. The average person spends a significant amount of their time online, and that’s not going to change. So, it’s likely going to be a smart idea to continue buying tech stocks over time. These companies are simply much more likely to increase in value over the long-run, as key catalysts such as AI become ubiquitous. Funnily enough, you could search up almost any company right now in any sector (even agriculture), and more likely than not, you’ll hear their management team tout how they use AI. In my opinion, the tech revolution is far from over, as this is one of the mega trends I think can take the entire tech sector higher over time. This article isn’t going to be an AI pure-play article, though. I will focus more on tech startups with solid growth and a clear path to profits. Here are three tech stocks to consider that you likely haven’t heard of before. M-Tron Industries (MPTI) M-Tron Industries (NYSEMKT: MPTI ) is a drone technology company operating in the aerospace and defense sectors. This is a company that I’ve long believed has strong potential for significant growth in the coming years. In Q4 2023, M-Tron posted impressive 29% year-over-year revenue growth to $41.2 million . That’s outstanding, and is the kind of growth many tech investors are looking for. However, what really stood out to me is the company’s increasingly profitable business model. M-Tron’s gross profit margin jumped from 35.6% to 40.7% as the company benefited from higher sales volumes and an improved mix of products. And if you exclude a one-time stock compensation expense, their operating profit margin would have reached 14.6% compared to just 9.1% the prior year. That level of improved operational efficiency can really accelerate earnings growth over the long-term. Notably, M-Tron also has a solid order backlog of $47.8 million on its books, up 3.6% from 2022, and an order filling rate above 1-times. In my view, this shows the company has both near-term revenue visibility and ample potential for continued business expansion. The cash flow growth here is also solid. With M-Tron making smart financial investments in research and development, talent recruitment, and equipment upgrades, I expect its profitability to keep increasing over time. I believe MPTI stock is a hidden gem that is well-positioned to significantly increase in value. Turtle Beach (HEAR) Turtle Beach (NASDAQ: HEAR ) is a company in the gaming accessory industry that seems to be flying under the radar currently. However, this is also a company that appears poised for tremendous growth over time. Even though the stock is up nearly 133% from its trough in 2022, I think this smaller company has the opportunity to potentially see its stock price quadruple over the next two years alone. That’s partly due to Turtle Beach’s very impressive financial performance in Q1. The company reported an 8.6% increase in revenue to $55.9 million . The company also moved into the green, providing $1.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. That’s a stark reversal from the $2.8 million loss in EBITDA they experienced in the same period last year. However, perhaps even more notable is that the overall gaming headsets and controllers markets saw double-digit growth during this time. Accordingly, this company seems well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum, as they are launching a whole new lineup of products in the very near future. The company’s Stealth Ultra controller and VelocityOne simulation gear appear to be fueling gains in HEAR’s market share. For example, their portion of the flight simulation market increased from 20% to 25% over the past year alone. Analysts expect nearly 30% annual earnings per share growth over the next two years. In my view, HEAR stock is definitely one of the top tech plays in the market right now. Intellicheck (IDN) Intellicheck (NASDAQ: IDN ) is an identity verification company that I believe has great growth potential over the next few years. In Q1, the company was able to deliver solid results for adjusted EBITDA (though it was still slightly in the red), and Intellicheck’s management team continued to increase recurring software revenue over the previous 12-month period. Given the company’s current growth trajectory and profitability targets, management expects that by the end of 2024, Intellicheck will achieve positive net income and adjusted EBITDA. The size of the market opportunity Intellicheck addresses is huge. According to a report from Javelin Research , losses from identity theft increased 13% to $23 billion in 2023. Intellicheck’s innovative identity authentication solutions are perfectly suited to help businesses protect their customers without adding unnecessary hassles. Despite the company’s massive growth opportunity (especially in their finance segment), IDN stock currently trades around $3 per share. That translates into only 2.7-times forward sales, as of writing. In my view, that’s dirt cheap for a company that has the potential to surpass the $12 level by 2026. This is one company worth watching closely. On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "After a night of heavy precipitation, rain clouds cleared out of the area just in time for the annual Memorial Day parade in Royal Oak Monday. Veterans, politicians and student musicians made the march up Main Street from Lincoln Avenue to Third Street and east to the Royal Oak Farmer’s Market at 9 a.m. Among them was Gladys Waters, 100, who served in the Women’s Army Corps (WAC) during World War II. She was driven in an open-roof, vintage Ford Model T. Royal Oak’s high school and middle school bands performed as they were joined along the route by groups including members of the Willow Run Rosie’s Drill Team. Plans were altered Sunday night when officials announced the parade would go forward but that a ceremony to follow it was being moved from Centennial Commons to the Royal Oak Farmers Market where the 338th Army Band performed. The area was under a flood warning early Monday due to heavy overnight rains but precipitation dissipated in time for the 9 a.m. march. — Royal Oak Tribune staff",

        "content": "MIKE TYSON'S medical emergency on board a flight is the latest health scare suffered by the former boxer. Iron Mike required medical assistance from paramedics on board a plane bound for LA from Miami after suffering an ulcer flare up. Tyson, 57, became nauseous and dizzy but was later said to be \"doing great\", according to one of his representatives. It comes just weeks before he is due to face Jake Paul in his first boxing fight for almost four years. He previously took on Roy Jones Jr in an exhibition bout in November 2020 but has since struggled with various health issues. Tyson suffers from sciatica and a flare-up 18 months ago left the former world champion requiring a wheel chair. He has also used a wooden cane to aid himself while walking on occasion, and has previously stated he believes his \"expiration date is coming close, really soon\". Tyson has even been warned by a doctor that he is at risk of suffering a subdural haematoma, which is the tearing of veins in the brain, in his fight against Paul, because of his age and former alcoholism. UFC commentator Joe Rogan has also raised fears about Tyson being at risk of dying , though did not rule out the former champion causing problems for Paul inside the ring. Tyson's health issues have not held him back from getting into top shape for the clash, and he warned his opponent he will have to \"fight like his life is depending on it\". Sciatica is a condition that causes nerve irritation. It usually affects one side, starting from the lower back or bottom and spreading down one leg. Symptoms of sciatica include shooting pain that starts in your lower back or bottom and runs down the back of your leg, often to your foot and toes. Common treatments for sciatica include exercises and stretches. Other treatments like injections or surgery may help if it does not get better. Sciatica can occur when something presses or rubs on the sciatic nerve. The most common cause is a slipped disc in your spine. Tyson retired from boxing in 2005 due to a back issue, while he also struggled with a knee injury late in his career. He revealed sciatica, which is a condition that causes nerve irritation, is the only health issue he suffers with. Despite that, he still thinks about his own mortality, saying on his podcast: \"We’re all gonna die one day of course. Then, when I look in the mirror, I see those little spots on my face. \"I say, 'Wow. That means my expiration date is coming close, really soon.'\"",

        "content": "Bill Walton , two-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer who went on to become an Emmy-winning broadcaster for ESPN and other networks, died Monday following a lengthy battle with cancer, the league announced. He was 71. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Related Stories News Hollywood & Media Deaths In 2024: Photo Gallery & Obituaries News Johnny Wactor Dies: ‘General Hospital’ & ‘Siberia’ Actor Was 37 “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton famously played for coach John Wooden and the UCLA Bruins, leading UCLA to NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973, along with an 88-game winning streak. In the 1973 NCAA title game between UCLA and Memphis, Walton shot a remarkable 21 for 22 from the field. He also won three consecutive national college player of the year awards from 1972-1974. As the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft, Walton was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers, leading the team to an NBA championship in 1977, and earning the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award that same season. He went on to win another NBC title in 1986 with the Boston Celtics. He also played for the San Diego and eventually LA Clippers. After retiring from the NBA, Walton moved on to a second career as a sportscaster, working both as a studio analyst and color commentator at several networks and teams. He earned an Emmy Award for his work in 1991. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. Walton joined ESPN in 2002 after 12 years at NBC as a lead analyst for NBA games, later shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:",

        "description": "TORONTO - Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action...",
        "content": "TORONTO — Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United. Coach John Herdman said Laryea will travel with the MLS team for Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia but won’t take the field until Saturday. With two away games this week, Toronto plans to stay south of the border after the mid-week game. Laryea, one of Toronto’s designated players along with Italian stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, underwent surgery March 23 in London, England. At the time, his recovery time was said to be three months. Herdman said Laryea won’t be on the active roster for the Philadelphia game. “The expectation is Richie will play minutes against D.C. United,” Herdman said after training Monday. “That’s been the plan, so this week he’s ramping up. He’ll hit all his sort of final check boxes and put a real intense training week in but will travel with the team so he’s ready to go against D.C.” The 29-year-old Laryea and TFC captain Jonathan Osorio were included Monday in Jesse Marsch’s first roster selection as Canada coach for friendlies June 6 and 9 against the Netherlands and France. “I’m proud for those lads,” said Herdman, who stepped down in August as Canada coach to take over Toronto. “I know what it means to them to represent their country. “Richie’s had a tough run so I’m pleased Jesse put the trust in him, because he’s a guy who loves playing for Canada. He gives his everything and I’ve seen him reach special levels in that Canadian jersey. While he plays in MLS, when he plays for Canada he’s able to show he’s got world-class ability. And I’d say the same for Osorio.” While Toronto does not have any games scheduled while Laryea and Osorio are away for the friendlies, Herdman will feel the pain during Copa America, which runs June 20 to July 24. “(Copa America) comes at time for us in June where you’d love to have had that full squad available,” he said. “But having been the guy that took players away from MLS clubs and not worry too much about it, being on the other end you’ve just got to pat these boys on the back and wish them all the best.” Laryea, who has 48 caps, last played for Canada in November’s CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal series against Jamaica. Osorio has 71 caps. Rookie wingback Tyrese Spicer, who came off in the 58th minute of Saturday’s 4-3 loss to visiting FC Cincinnati, is questionable for Wednesday’s game with a gastrointestinal issue. “We’re just learning whether it’s muscular or something different,” Herdman said. Forward Prince Owusu is being monitored for a tight calf. Midfielder Brandon Servania (knee) and defender Shane O’Neil (thigh) remain on the injured list. Bernardeschi returns this week after missing the Cincinnati game due to yellow card accumulation. Toronto (7-7-1) goes into mid-week play in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, two places and four points ahead of Philadelphia (4-4-6). TFC has won just one of its last four league matches (1-0-3). But it has won seven of its last 10 (7-3-0) in all competitions. — Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 Neil Davidson, The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Boston Celtics legend and two-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer Bill Walton died of cancer at the age of 71, the NBA announced Monday. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton had a prolonged fight with cancer. Walton was a beloved member of the Celtics from the moment he was traded to the team from the Los Angeles Clippers in 1985. In his first time in a Celtics uniform in the Boston Garden, Walton received a one-minute standing ovation from the Boston home crowd walking onto the court for his first exhibition game in 1985. Walton won an NBA title in 1986 as a member of the Celtics. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, San Diego and eventually the Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Walton may best be remembered by younger fans for his broadcasting work during NBA games. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans,\" Silver said in a statement.

        "content": "On Monday at 1:46 p.m. a severe thunderstorm watch was issued by the National Weather Service in effect until 9 p.m. for Adams, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lycoming, Montour, Northumberland, Perry, Snyder, Sullivan, Union and York counties. Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To guarantee your safety in the midst of a thunderstorm, take into account the following recommendations: 1. Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. 2. Indoors safety measures: Once you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors. These precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways. 3. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. Heavy rainfall may lead to flooding if prolonged or if there is excessive runoff. Excessive runoff can be a result of saturated ground and/or rainfall intensity. Follow these recommendations from the weather service to stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of swollen waterways: In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger. Maintain safe driving distances: Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness. Reduce speed and drive cautiously: On wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water. Prioritize visibility Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them. Watch out for slippery roads: The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Don't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots. If the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

        "description": "The International Organization for Migration on Sunday increased its estimate of the death toll from a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea to more than 670 as emergency responders and traumatised relatives gave up hope that any survivors will now be found.The post PNG landslide death toll expected to be over 670 appeared first on Khmer Times.",
        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia – The International Organization for Migration on Sunday increased its estimate of the death toll from a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea to more than 670 as emergency responders and traumatised relatives gave up hope that any survivors will now be found. Serhan Aktoprak, Chief of the UN migration agency’s mission in the South Pacific island nation, said the revised death toll was based on calculations by Yambali village and Enga provincial officials that more than 150 homes had been buried by Friday’s landslide. The previous estimate had been 60 homes. “They are estimating that more than 670 people (are) under the soil at the moment,” Aktoprak told The Associated Press. Local officials had initially put the death toll on Friday at 100 or more. Only five bodies and a leg of a sixth victim had been recovered by Sunday. Around 250 additional houses have been condemned since the landslide because of still-shifting ground, leaving an estimated 1,250 people homeless, officials said. Crews have given up hope of finding survivors under earth and rubble 6 to 8 metres deep. “People are coming to terms with this so there is a serious level of grieving and mourning,” Aktoprak said. He said the new estimated death toll was “not solid” because it was based on the average size of the region’s families per household. He would not speculate on the possibility that the actual toll could be higher. Relief crews were moving survivors to safer ground on Sunday as tons of unstable earth and tribal warfare, which is rife in the Papua New Guinea Highlands, threatened the rescue effort. Convoys that have transported food, water, and other essential supplies since Saturday to the devastated village 60 kilometres from the provincial capital, Wabag, have faced risks related to tribal fighting in Tambitanis village, about halfway along the route. Papua New Guinea soldiers were providing security for the convoys. Eight locals were killed in a clash between two rival clans on Saturday in a longstanding dispute unrelated to the landslide. Around 30 homes and five retail businesses were burned down in the fighting, local officials said. Aktoprak said he did not expect tribal combatants would target the convoys but noted that opportunistic criminals might take advantage of the mayhem to do so. “This could basically end up in carjacking or robbery,” Aktoprak said. “There is not only concern for the safety and security of the personnel, but also the goods because they may use this chaos as a means to steal.” Australia, a near neighbour and Papua New Guinea’s most generous provider of foreign aid, along with the United States are among governments that have publicly stated their readiness to do more to help responders. Papua New Guinea is a diverse, developing nation with 800 languages and 10 million people who are mostly subsistence farmers.",

        "content": "Naked News anchor and fitness buff Eila Adams is set to take part in this year’s World Naked Bike Ride in Toronto. The Toronto-based model, who hosts Naked News ’ fitness segment “Flex Appeal,” will join other nude riders in the annual international event as they bare all for the environment. This year’s protest calls for the reduction of the use of oil, and the unclothed event is designed to put a spotlight on alternative transportation options. “I’m excited to be participating in Toronto’s World Naked Bike Ride to highlight the over-usage of oil and urban pollution while endorsing cycling safety on our streets,” Adams said in a statement. “There’s something incredibly liberating about cruising through the city on a bike, feeling the wind against my skin, and making great memories as we pedal through the heart of this incredible city.” Adams, an adult content creator who also co-hosts the show’s sex and relationship segment, The Bare Naked Truth , has been tied to the series for 15 years, making her the longest Naked News presenter since the series launched in 1999. https://www.instagram.com/p/Cz84rrUuEmF/ “Being a part of the Naked News team for 15 of its 25 years has been an incredible experience. When I started back in 2009, I never imagined that this role would become such a defining part of my life,” she recently told the Daily Star . “Here’s to 15 amazing years, and hopefully many more to come,” she added. The dress code for the World Naked Bike Ride is, as always, “as bare as you dare,” but protesting riders are welcome to wear clothing. It kicks off on June 8 at 1 p.m. at Toronto’s Coronation Park.",

The former President's hand barely left his head during Sunday's NASCAR Cup Series Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina. Trump Force One sent the crowds wild by flying over the track, then Trump got a warm reception as he waved to the fans in the stands. Trump snaps back at booing crowd as he's branded 'worst president in history' Republican governor faces backlash after pushing to get Biden on state ballot Wearing his famosu red MAGA cap, Trump walked down the pit lane as NASCAR fans shouted \"make America great again\" and \"you're our man, Trump.\" However, he was slammed for actually showing a lack of respect by saluting during the National Anthem and a rendition of Saving Grace. Taking to X, one person wrote: \"Serious question. Why is he saluting? He is not the President anymore--so not the Commander in Chief, and he was never in the military. He looks silly saluting.\" \"It should be hand over heart and that is one of the worst salutes I have seen,\" added another. A third said: \"He is saluting whom during the National Anthem? Most hold their hand over their heart.\" Technically, civilians should avoid saluting as a service member would and should place their hand or hat over their heart.

Trump was also seen saluting to a military fly-over that happened before the race. He managed to make his way round a lot of the race course, taking in views from the suite, a special box at pit road and on the rooftop. At one stage he was seen waring noise-canceling headphones as the cars zoomed past. The former President also got the chance to meet 'king of NASCAR' Richard Petty, who has supported Trump since 2016 and gave him a hug. Trump was also the guest of car owner Richard Childress atop the pit box for the No. 3 Chevrolet driven by Austin Dillon. Sadly, the race was shortened due to the rain and was won by Christopher Bell.",

        "content": "The Simpsons , one of the most iconic TV shows in history, has had its fair share of shocking storylines. One such storyline was so controversial that creator Matt Groening has disowned the episode entirely. Simpsons script writer calls out Jeopardy host over huge error on show The Simpsons kill off major character as Lisa unleashes into a murderous rampage The episode in question, The Principal and the Pauper, is widely regarded as one of the show's worst. It was so poorly received that Groening has vowed never to discuss it again. The plot revolves around Seymour Skinner, the principal of Springfield Elementary , preparing to celebrate his 20th anniversary at the school. A surprise party is planned by the school staff, and everything seems to be going smoothly until a mysterious man arrives claiming to be the real Seymour Skinner. In a shocking twist, it turns out he is telling the truth. The backstory reveals that the two men met in the Army, and the person everyone knew as Seymour Skinner was actually Armin Tamzarian.

Simpsons makes eerie prediction come true again almost 30 years on from episode [INSIGHT] Reason Matt Groening made The Simpsons characters yellow [COMMENT] The Simpsons mock their own ability to predict the future in new clip [NEWS] Armin assumed Seymour's identity when the real Skinner was presumed dead. Armin went to deliver the tragic news to Seymour's mother, who mistook him for her real son. When the truth comes out, Armin leaves Springfield and the real Seymour takes over as principal. However, the townsfolk shun the real Seymour, preferring the imposter. By the end of the episode, Judge Snyder declares that Armin will once again become Seymour Skinner, and the real Seymour is banished from the town. The Simpsons episode, The Principal and the Pauper, has long been a subject of criticism for its outlandish plotline. It seems fans aren't alone in their disdain. In a 2002 interview with Rolling Stone, Matt Groening confessed that the episode was a \"mistake\". He stated: \"We make some missteps, but we acknowledge it on the show. We had an episode where it was revealed that Principal Skinner was an impostor. By the time we finished the episode, we realized it was a mistake, and we had a judge say, 'We'll never speak of this matter again.' And we never did.\" The Principal and the Pauper is often seen as a pivotal moment in The Simpsons' history, frequently labeled as one of the worst episodes ever by fans. References to the episode have appeared in other Simpsons episodes, serving as a reminder of the show's increasingly eccentric storylines.",

        "content": "Basketball Hall of Fame legend Bill Walton laughs during a practice session for the NBA All-Star basketball game in Cleveland, Feb. 19, 2022. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "content": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded their evacuation orders at 8 a.m. Monday, lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. \"(The) alert will remain in effect until such time as the risk has been eliminated,\" the statement says. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelson on May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at Fort Nelson General Hospital are resuming. \"The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,\" the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality's mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what's expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online Sunday, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a \"tremendous amount of fire\" in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. \"The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It's had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,\" he said. \"And it's not just lightning that's going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that's giving us a lot of challenges.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "When it comes to a George Miller directed Mad Max saga movie, actors are committed 1000% to the stunts, but composers are there too for the long haul. So much so, that Furiosa composer Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL moved to Sydney, Australia to pen the score, his third with Miller after Mad Max: Fury Road and Three Thousand Years of Longing. In fact, there’s a fine line between the metallic bang of motorcycles and trucks, and bass, and one of the arbitrator of that is Holkenborg who had a hand in sound mixing Furiosa. You can listen to our conversation with Holkenborg out of Deadline’s Cannes Studio below: Related Stories News 'Furiosa' Inches Out 'Garfield' With $32M But No. 1 Race Still Close In Dullest Memorial Day Weekend - Monday AM Update News 'Simon Of The Mountain' Review: Federico Luis' Critics' Week Winner Is A Wholly Original Debut - Cannes Film Festival Holkenborg points out that when it came to the music in Furiosa, it’s character-driven given how it centers around the protagonist’s life from 8 to 18 years of age, versus Fury Road, which took place in a desert race of 48 hours. “Musically, everything was being told from a first-person perspective, which is being her, how she, watches the world around her, The Wasteland, its cruelties,” the composer elaborates. A key set piece in Furiosa are the 197 shots devoted to a big rig heist, a bulk of which doesn’t have music. The chords commence when we first learn of Furiosa’s role in the action sequence. “Where there is absolutely silence, (it’s) one of the most powerful tools that you can have as a composer,” says Holkenborg, “The earlier composers and the earlier directors understood this really well.” “George and I talked so much about certain classics like Bullitt with Steve McQueen or The French Connection with Gene Hackman, where there are chases in there where no score is being done for the majority of the scene, and then when it really, really counts, when something becomes really emotional or something gets really, really tense, that is when music is brought in to give that extra layer to an action sequence.” “Restraint was the way forward,” explains Holkenborg. Furiosa opened this weekend to $65.3M at the global box office. The movie received a near eight-minute standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival premiere. The movie has high grades from Rotten Tomatoes critics at 90% certified fresh and audiences who gave it the same marks. Deadline’s Cannes Studio Is Sponsored by NEOM.",

        "content": "Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United. Coach John Herdman said Laryea will travel with the MLS team for Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia but won’t take the field until Saturday. With two away games this week, Toronto plans to stay south of the border after the mid-week game. Laryea, one of Toronto’s designated players along with Italian stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, underwent surgery March 23 in London, England. At the time, his recovery time was said to be three months. Herdman said Laryea won’t be on the active roster for the Philadelphia game. “The expectation is Richie will play minutes against D.C. United,” Herdman said after training Monday. “That’s been the plan, so this week he’s ramping up. He’ll hit all his sort of final check boxes and put a real intense training week in but will travel with the team so he’s ready to go against D.C.” The 29-year-old Laryea and TFC captain Jonathan Osorio were included Monday in Jesse Marsch’s first roster selection as Canada coach for friendlies June 6 and 9 against the Netherlands and France. “I’m proud for those lads,” said Herdman, who stepped down in August as Canada coach to take over Toronto. “I know what it means to them to represent their country. “Richie’s had a tough run so I’m pleased Jesse put the trust in him, because he’s a guy who loves playing for Canada. He gives his everything and I’ve seen him reach special levels in that Canadian jersey. While he plays in MLS, when he plays for Canada he’s able to show he’s got world-class ability. And I’d say the same for Osorio.” While Toronto does not have any games scheduled while Laryea and Osorio are away for the friendlies, Herdman will feel the pain during Copa America, which runs June 20 to July 24. ”(Copa America) comes at time for us in June where you’d love to have had that full squad available,” he said. “But having been the guy that took players away from MLS clubs and not worry too much about it, being on the other end you’ve just got to pat these boys on the back and wish them all the best.” Laryea, who has 48 caps, last played for Canada in November’s CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal series against Jamaica. Osorio has 71 caps. Rookie wingback Tyrese Spicer, who came off in the 58th minute of Saturday’s 4-3 loss to visiting FC Cincinnati, is questionable for Wednesday’s game with a gastrointestinal issue. “We’re just learning whether it’s muscular or something different,” Herdman said. Forward Prince Owusu is being monitored for a tight calf. Midfielder Brandon Servania (knee) and defender Shane O’Neil (thigh) remain on the injured list. Bernardeschi returns this week after missing the Cincinnati game due to yellow card accumulation. Toronto (7-7-1) goes into mid-week play in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, two places and four points ahead of Philadelphia (4-4-6). TFC has won just one of its last four league matches (1-0-3). But it has won seven of its last 10 (7-3-0) in all competitions. —- Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024",

        "description": "\"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, the dominant college big man who won a pair of NBA championships and later enjoyed a successful broadcasting career, has died, the NBA announced on Monday. He was 71. Walton died after a prolonged battle with cancer, the league said. He was surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, and he led the team to their only NBA title in 1977. Named the league MVP in 1978, the 6-foot-11 Walton won another title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he earned the Sixth Man of the Year award. But that season proved to be his last hurrah. Walton, who battled injuries throughout his career, would play just 22 more games between the regular season and playoffs before retiring in 1988. Before his pro career, Walton was a two-time champion at UCLA, leading the Bruins to titles in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. His 44 points in the national championship game in 1973 remain a record. Walton was also a three-time national player of the year at UCLA while playing for legendary coach John Wooden. \"On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men's basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton's passing,\" UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said in a statement , adding: \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\" After his playing career, Walton overcame a stutter to become a successful sportscaster known for his colorful commentary, which often included catchphrases and hyperbole. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" A self-professed \"Deadhead,\" Walston sometimes appeared on TV wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts. He was also known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts while delivering his unique commentary, which could be equal parts entertaining and bewildering. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993.

Promotions and products are subject to availability and retailer terms. As we get ready for shorts and bathing suit season , saying goodbye to unwanted hair is a top priority for many (including me). I first dabbled in laser hair removal pre-pandemic when I got professional IPL laser treatment on my face at a med spa. At the time, I was nervous about the procedure and didn’t want to take any chances with my face. But after hundreds of dollars and a few years, I needed a touch-up. As I was leaving my last appointment a couple of weeks ago, having spent $60 for about 30 seconds of treatment, I started to research at-home laser options. I knew I wasn’t looking for any budget-friendly tools—laser hair removal is not where I want to skimp when it comes to devices! I also messaged The Curator’s Beauty Editor Adriana Monachino to see if she had any insight into devices. She was quick to send me a link to the Ulike . Story continues below advertisement It’s all the rage on TikTok , she quickly texted back, and reviewers claim it’s safe, it works and it’s pain-free. I slept on it and then decided to go all in. It takes about four weeks to see the full effects, but as the warm weather is quickly approaching, I wanted to share my results week by week. The Ulike is also on sale right now (don’t forget to add the coupon code!), so if you’ve been on the fence, now is a great time to give it a try. Ulike Laser Hair Removal The Air 3 is an IPL laser hair removal device that you can use at home. You’ll start to see a noticeable reduction of hair in about three weeks. There’s a ‘soft mode’ for your face and bikini area, a ‘body mode’ for legs and arms and a ‘power mode’ for chest and armpits. The kit comes with the device, a charger, protector glasses and a bag to store everything in. $359 on Amazon (was $459) How it works Intense Pulse Light Therapy (IPL) is where the light from the device passes through the skin’s surface and is absorbed by the melanin of the hair follicle. This process essentially kills the hair follicle, so it doesn’t grow back. Story continues below advertisement Now, in order for the light to be able to target the hair follicle, there needs to be contrast between the colour of your hair and your skin tone. The more contrast, the better IPL works. Ulike has this chart which will help you figure out if it’s the right hair removal method for you. (Ulike) Week 1 More Recommendations 20 Father’s Day gifts to show dad you care This Dyson Cool Fan is $100 off right now (hurry!) My target areas: Armpits, bikini and legs. Curator tip : Always do a skin test before you do a full treatment. I did a small area on my leg to see how my skin reacted. I had no issues, so the next day, I started. Step 1 : Make sure you shave the area before treatment. The kit comes with a handy travel razor which I used. Step 2: Plug in the device and hold down the power button. For the first week, I started with ‘soft mode’ just to see how I would react to the treatment. Step 3 : Place the device on your skin and press the flashing button to activate the light pulse. Slowly move the device along the treatment area, pressing the button. For larger areas like my legs, you can hold the button down so the light continuously flashes as you glide the device over your skin. How often? For the first four weeks, I will treat three times a week. Results so far : This device is cool to the touch, so even though intense heat is penetrating your skin, the device feels cool on your skin. After I treat my armpit, I can feel a bit of a stinging sensation for a few minutes—but it’s nothing that would deter me. No marks of any kind were left on my skin, so even though I don’t need a touch-up on my face right now, I wouldn’t hesitate to use it in the future. Use lots of sunscreen after! Slathering on your favorite SPF will be key this entire time. Story continues below advertisement Ulike Air 10 Ulike Air 10 Laser Hair Removal Want to kick things up a notch? Ulike has just released the Air 10. It has the latest technology and promises results in just two weeks. This device has dual lights which means it’s more powerful. Now, it also comes with a bigger price tag, but if you have a lot of unwanted hair and it tends to be dark and coarse, then this device is a great option for you. $559 on Amazon More from The Curator Miracle Balm: Is it worth the hype?",

        "description": "Mexico is on course to elect its first woman president this weekend, with two front-runners competing to break the highest political glass ceiling in a country with a history of gender violence and inequality.The post Mexico expected to elect first woman president appeared first on Khmer Times.",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY – Mexico is on course to elect its first woman president this weekend, with two front-runners competing to break the highest political glass ceiling in a country with a history of gender violence and inequality. Ruling-party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum and opposition hopeful Xochitl Galvez, both 61, have dominated the presidential race in the world’s most populous Spanish-speaking country, home to 129 million people. The only man running, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, is trailing far behind with just days left before the vote. “It’s a huge change,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University, in the United States. “A woman president will be an inspiration for women in every single sector of the economy, politics, society, and culture,” she told AFP. Sheinbaum owes much of her popularity to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a close ally who has an approval rating of more than 60% but is only allowed to serve one term. A former Mexico City mayor and a scientist by training, Sheinbaum has 55% of voter support, according to a poll average compiled by research firm Oraculus. Galvez, an outspoken senator and businesswoman with Indigenous roots who represents a broad coalition of opposition parties, has 33%. Maynez, 38, of the small Citizens’ Movement party, has just 12%. Mexico’s next president will face an array of challenges, including managing migration, delicate relations with the neighbouring US, and criminal violence that has left more than 450,000 people dead and tens of thousands missing since 2006. Around 30 candidates for local office have been murdered in a wave of electoral violence since last September, in a country where politics, corruption, and crime are closely intertwined. Whoever wins, it will likely be business as usual for the cartels that control swaths of the country and smuggle vast amounts of cocaine, fentanyl, and other drugs into the US, experts predict. “They’re not going to change their attitude just because Mexico has a female president,” Correa-Cabrera said. Another major challenge will be Mexico’s complex relationship with the US, particularly if former president Donald Trump is reelected in November, Shifter said. “If he returns to the White House, Trump is expected to double down on his hardline stance on immigration, trade, and drugs – very sensitive issues crucial to the bilateral relationship,” he said. As well as voting for a new president, Mexicans will choose members of Congress, several state governors, and myriad local officials. In total, more than 20,000 positions are being contested, with nearly 100 million people registered to vote.",

        "content": "A&E’s new docuseries “Houses of Horror: Secrets of College Greek Life” exposes the dark side of Greek Row and its impact on some of those involved and will premiere Monday, May 27 at 10 p.m. Each episode will feature first-hand accounts of how the power, control, and secrecy of fraternities and sororities can create a cult-like dynamic leading to an environment where nefarious activity is able to thrive. For those how have cut the traditional cable cord and are opting for streaming services, you can still view the new series on Philo (free trial) or Sling TV (free trial). About the Show According to the show’s official synopsis, “Through exclusive sit-down interviews with those involved including former fraternity and sorority members, family, law enforcement and experts, the series details how these organizations that seemingly offer acceptance and community for young people have far-reaching consequences that can turn dangerous, and even deadly. Over the course of six episodes, the series details a variety of first-hand accounts of the dark side of fraternity and sorority life at universities across the country. From a pledge at the University of Missouri hazed into drinking excessive quantities of alcohol that left him close to death, and a junior at the University of Minnesota who fought back against the Greek system after she was brutally raped by a fraternity brother, to a shocking set of overdose deaths at San Diego State University, and the infamous Machine, steeped in racist traditions of the Old South, at the University of Alabama, the series offers a far-reaching examination of how the seemingly fun and frivolous world of Greek life could hide a much darker underbelly.” Where to find A&E channel You can find which channel A&E is on by using the channel finders here: Verizon Fios, AT&T U-verse, Comcast Xfinity , Spectrum/Charter , Optimum/Altice , DIRECTV and Dish .

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

It was a good run here over the years.\" Before the match, the 2016 finalist had stated that he had not yet decided on his retirement this summer, saying: \"When the time is right, I will stop. I don't know if I will play past the summer.\" His retirement seemed one step closer last night. Despite playing with a new Yonex racquet, the outcome remained unchanged. He hasn't advanced past the third round in 14 Grand Slams since his title defense at Wimbledon in 2017 ended in the quarter-finals. Murray will still participate in the doubles with Dan Evans in preparation for the Olympics later in the summer. After a final Wimbledon, it could be his last appearance. Follow us on X for the best and latest in sports news World No. 1 Novak Djokovic candid about his struggles and modest hopes for French Open Tennis power couple Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas reunite ahead of French Open Wawrinka, dressed in bright yellow shorts and trainers, dazzled the main court with his brilliant winners, and the one-sided victory was never really in doubt. He swiftly dismantled Murray, breaking him four times and surging to a 4-0 lead in just 15 minutes during the third set. The Swiss maestro clinched victory on his first match point with a 35th winner signature backhand down the line. Post-match, the two legends shared an embrace and exchanged words at the net before Murray paused to acknowledge the crowd with applause as he exited the court, reminiscent of his departure in Melbourne this past January, hinting at a possible farewell. Wawrinka expressed his feelings post-match: \"It was an emotional, for sure. My first words were respect for a great champion.\" Murray reflected on the match: \"Obviously disappointed. It was always going to be a tough, tough match. Stan has played brilliant tennis on that court.\" Murray continued, \"I was expecting him to play very well tonight. I think he did that. He gave me very few opportunities. I wish I could have done a little bit better.\" Despite the loss, Murray remained pragmatic: \"Disappointed but, I didn't have extremely high expectations with the way, you know, the preparation had been coming in. But obviously would have liked to have done better tonight.\" Earlier, Jack Draper's defeat to world No. 176 Jesper De Jong dashed hopes of a high-profile showdown with Carlos Alcaraz. The British No. 2 mounted a comeback from two sets and 0-3 behind to push the match to a fifth set against the Dutch qualifier. However, a visibly frustrated Draper let slip expletives and his serve at 3-4 after a disastrous ninth double fault on break point. The world No. 39 faced a crushing blow, suffering his worst Tour-level defeat by ranking in the longest match of his career. After an intense four hours and six minutes, he was defeated 7-5, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 3-6, 6-3. Visibly disappointed, he expressed his feelings post-match: \"Obviously very frustrated,\" and added, \"This loss hurts a lot. I know I'm so much better than how I played today, and that's what hurts.\"",

        "description": "Fans of Mad Max: Fury Road – Black and Chrome will be excited to learn George Miller has already made his alternate cut of Furiosa.",
        "content": "Furiosa is currently the talk of the box office- for better or for worse- but fans hoping for an alternate cut akin to Fury Road’s Black and Chrome release have reason to get excited. franchise creator George Miller sat down for a chat with Josh Horowitz on the Happy Sad Confused podcast to discuss the release of , as well as the past and future of the franchise. During the chat, Miller surprised Horowitz by confirming that an alternate cut of Furiosa was already completed. “We’ve done it already,” Miller revealed. “It’s the last thing I did on this film. I call it tinted black and chrome.” The potential for a black-and-white cut of Furiosa is undoubtedly exciting news for fans of the saga. Mad Max: Fury Road received a critically acclaimed black-and-white cut called Mad Max: Fury Road—The Black and Chrome Edition. Black & Chrome was arguably received better than the original, with many saying the film’s bombastic visuals work even better in stark black-and-white. This makes the second black-and-white cut of a film Miller has done, though the Australian filmmaker isn’t quite sure himself why he’s so fascinated with the desaturated art style. “I’m still trying to demystify why the black and white, for me, has something more elemental to it.” Miller tells Horowitz. “I still can’t quite put my finger on it. It’s not because they look like old black-and-white movies. If we took a picture of ourselves right now, it might be a little more dramatic if it was black and white.” Miller doesn’t offer an update on when or if Furiosa’s alternate cut will be released, but it may not be long. Fury Road’s Black & Chrome cut was released in 2016, a year after the original theatrical run. Given the success of Fury Road’s re-release, Furiosa’s may get a quicker release. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is currently in theaters, but it’s not all positive news. The film has had a shockingly soft opening weekend, charting the in three decades. You can see Furiosa now, or go read about what meant, as well as learn more about one of the film’s many twisted characters, . Or, read about all the this month. Related:",

        "description": "The Parliamentary Assembly of NATO has passed a new declaration urging the alliance's members to lift some restrictions on Ukraine's use of their weapons on Russian soil as the Kiev regime continues to lose ground on the battlefield.",
        "content": "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told The Economist on May 24 that Western countries should lift their respective bans on Ukraine using their weapons inside Russia. The newspaper alleged that Stoltenberg's target was US President Joe Biden's policy of limiting Ukraine's use of ATACMS long-range missiles and other weapons inside Russia except for Crimea and the nation's new territories admitted in September 2022. On May 27, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (PA) - the consultative interparliamentary entity – passed Declaration 489 which urges the bloc's members to \"lift some restrictions\" on the use of their weapons by the Kiev regime against Russia's \"legitimate targets.\" NATO PA representatives from nine countries have reportedly not supported the initiative. Earlier, Italy and Germany spoke against the proposal that could lead to the outbreak of a major war between Russia and NATO. The Biden administration has not granted Ukraine a free hand in using its arms against Russia, either. \"The United States has made it clear that it too does not support the lifting of restrictions using American weapons,\" Scott Ritter, a military analyst and former US Marine Corps intelligence officer, told Sputnik. \"There is some debate , discussion and dialog inside the United States to reverse this policy. But, at the present moment, the United States continues to impose restrictions.\" { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_640x0_80_0_0_b398c48a0a435b16a4f550c347198885.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_640x0_80_0_0_3ef894f30d6e57ac4f6a7c525ebfdef5.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_640x0_80_0_0_3ef894f30d6e57ac4f6a7c525ebfdef5.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_640x0_80_0_0_2710efda21760b7f4caa76483fcd50de.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_640x0_80_0_0_2710efda21760b7f4caa76483fcd50de.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_640x0_80_0_0_a2fc6a27eee1ade4a02139a84123943c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_640x0_80_0_0_a2fc6a27eee1ade4a02139a84123943c.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_1280x0_80_0_0_c53abbb04288631f15f5da134df089d8.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1280x0_80_0_0_ef9e8ebd60ade9dbbe1ac89870581467.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1280x0_80_0_0_ef9e8ebd60ade9dbbe1ac89870581467.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_f0cb4d94957c89137f9c8ea3ab2111ca.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_f0cb4d94957c89137f9c8ea3ab2111ca.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_be5a5ae01fe3bb85102a56a9cfbdb484.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_be5a5ae01fe3bb85102a56a9cfbdb484.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_1920x0_80_0_0_ebc84af52c9c897f207aa761ed0c2837.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1920x0_80_0_0_174bb3300113f3eef9df11c29b94a0f7.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1920x0_80_0_0_174bb3300113f3eef9df11c29b94a0f7.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e688d94c42112b500ac5df58bed314c9.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e688d94c42112b500ac5df58bed314c9.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e6c811be7885c26349c3fde542c90f01.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e6c811be7885c26349c3fde542c90f01.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } World Ukraine Might Not Become NATO Member Within Next 30 Years - Scholz 01:55 GMT However, it's up to NATO member states to decide whether to authorize the use of their weapons by Ukraine against Russia, despite Stoltenberg's calls or NATO PA's non-binding declarations. Ritter pointed out that \"NATO as an institution is not preparing for a larger war with Russia.\" He referred to the fact that so far NATO has conducted a policy to avoid escalation of the Ukraine conflict and prevent a full-fledged confrontation with Russia. The crux of the matter is that NATO member states are unprepared for a war with Russia, according to Michael Maloof, former senior security policy analyst in the US Office of the Secretary of Defense. \"All the [NATO] countries would have to switch their economies over from a service economy to a full production wartime economy. And they're not capable of it. They can't sustain it.

The pundits believe that support for the use of NATO-grade weapons by Ukraine stems from the transatlantic alliance's desperation over the Kiev regime's continuous military failures. In early May, French President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist that Paris could put boots on the ground in Ukraine if frontlines are broken and Kiev officially requests such assistance. Almost at the same time, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron told Reuters that Britain had given the Kiev regime permission to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons it provided. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_640x0_80_0_0_98668d6ec119bd21e56c5e19f647e264.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_640x0_80_0_0_c6bd0e0e9babc006efd21667dbaf3854.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_640x0_80_0_0_c6bd0e0e9babc006efd21667dbaf3854.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_640x0_80_0_0_062a2def597bb0824bfe7084950eac7e.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_640x0_80_0_0_062a2def597bb0824bfe7084950eac7e.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_640x0_80_0_0_a4f15f02ce1f09ed46a0ab50c68263f5.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_640x0_80_0_0_a4f15f02ce1f09ed46a0ab50c68263f5.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_1280x0_80_0_0_18a80bca2ddb7f05822f56aec2dfd4c5.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1280x0_80_0_0_ba8f82d4fd7cbebaca1dd6c53d934039.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1280x0_80_0_0_ba8f82d4fd7cbebaca1dd6c53d934039.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_00a88d6260afa964757247fda474388d.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_00a88d6260afa964757247fda474388d.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_cbed335c0e1061c35366e15404467261.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_cbed335c0e1061c35366e15404467261.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_1920x0_80_0_0_dce7ed155436721459223360ff7853e0.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1920x0_80_0_0_f1cf1969a36f4f3837f24984481d05fe.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1920x0_80_0_0_f1cf1969a36f4f3837f24984481d05fe.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_66a31c45b5ebc6acd1e753157248b9ac.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_66a31c45b5ebc6acd1e753157248b9ac.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_b52e2962100406d291cdde4fd6d2a683.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_b52e2962100406d291cdde4fd6d2a683.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } World Macron and Cameron's Threats to Flood Ukraine With 'Men and Arms': Signs of Weakness? 3 May, 19:10 GMT Moscow has repeatedly warned the collective West against deeper involvement in Ukraine's conflict. Russia condemned Macron's statements as provocative and fraught with a risk of further escalation. Commenting on Cameron's words, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted that the British foreign minister de facto confirmed that the West is waging a war against Russia using Ukrainians as proxies. Reflecting on Stoltenberg's remarks last week for The Economist, Zakharova drew attention to the fact that the NATO chief's warmongering rhetoric came ahead of the so-called \"peace\" conference on Ukraine in Switzerland that is advocating the unworkable Zelensky \"formula\" while ignoring Russia's position. \"Objectively, the reality is that NATO is in no position to escalate the war and sustain it,\" Larry Johnson, retired CIA intelligence officer and State Department official, told Sputnik, reiterating his forecast about the Kiev regime's imminent defeat. \"Yes, they could put troops in. They could provide some temporary assistance to Ukraine. But really, there is nothing that's going to change the outcome or the trajectory of the war,\" the CIA veteran concluded. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_640x0_80_0_0_267c53f372d6881fb3292c6c817ae546.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_bd9cd68750a61ede19a32f97bc23f9f0.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_bd9cd68750a61ede19a32f97bc23f9f0.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_3da2ab1472eb4408631199356d9daac3.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_3da2ab1472eb4408631199356d9daac3.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_6039a67919a79e0c572548ad86087756.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_6039a67919a79e0c572548ad86087756.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_1280x0_80_0_0_b2c2d2cf5f896546a0c56058bacfba6e.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_aac87ab74d43c48d5352316537f032d1.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_aac87ab74d43c48d5352316537f032d1.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_b6a0c095dc1b437355ca7ffd5a5a0f4f.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_b6a0c095dc1b437355ca7ffd5a5a0f4f.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_27952844c909092804ab9fd741bf023f.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_27952844c909092804ab9fd741bf023f.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_1920x0_80_0_0_1caf154c7e20fa3f315bf160dd33a884.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_7fb22c5d865fad753acdff0727461f22.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_7fb22c5d865fad753acdff0727461f22.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c8939d59bd296baaa625f32e9cd5ee4b.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c8939d59bd296baaa625f32e9cd5ee4b.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_532370fc9e1570ee92c6f83643423e96.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_532370fc9e1570ee92c6f83643423e96.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } Analysis Stoltenberg’s Call to Untie Ukraine's Hands to Strike Russia Shows NATO is Desperate 25 May, 17:26 GMT",

        "content": "The Detroit Tigers had an extra day to savor their biggest offensive output of the season. After getting Memorial Day off, they'll open a two-game home series against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday. Detroit extended its winning streak to three games on Sunday afternoon with a wild 14-11 win over Toronto. The Tigers blew 5-0 and 8-3 leads, then rallied to score the game's last five runs. Matt Vierling capped it off with a two-out, three-run homer in the ninth off Blue Jays closer Jordan Romano. \"There was a lot in that game to love and a few things not to love so much,\" manager A.J. Hinch said. \"But what an ending.\" Vierling, who had four hits, also homered earlier in the game. He was waiting on a slider and got it on a 3-2 count for his first career walkoff homer. \"My brother and I in the backyard, we'd always be doing situations like that,\" he said. \"It's kind of cool when it actually happens.\" The Tigers can reach the .500 level again with a win on Tuesday. The three-game win streak was preceded by a five-game slide. They'll have their best arm on the mound. Tarik Skubal (6-1, 2.25 ERA) will carry a little extra motivation into the contest after taking his first loss of the season in his last start. Skubal gave up four runs in five innings to Kansas City on Wednesday, requiring 96 pitches to get 15 outs. \"It was partly command and they had some really good at-bats,\" said Skubal, who had not given up more than two earned runs in his previous seven starts. \"They fouled off some really good pitches and there were too many pitcher's counts that went to 3-2 counts. And that's a credit, I guess, to their hitters. I've got to do a better job at finishing those at-bats.\" Skubal is 1-0 with a 3.46 ERA in three career appearances against Pittsburgh. The Pirates took two of three games during a weekend series against Atlanta but lost Sunday's finale, 8-1. Starting pitcher Martin Perez and catcher Joey Bart both departed the game early with injuries. Pittsburgh has listed its dynamic young duo of Jared Jones and Paul Skenes as its starting pitchers in the Detroit series. Jones (3-4, 3.05 ERA), a 22-year-old rookie, has gone at least six innings in all four of his May starts. In his last outing, he gave up three runs and six hits in six innings against San Francisco. He allowed a two-run homer to Matt Chapman in the sixth and the Pirates wound up losing in extra innings. \"I threw the pitches I needed to throw when I needed to throw them,\" Jones said. \"Obviously, I need to get better at throwing certain pitches in tight spots where that could end up costing us the ballgame. I think that's what happened. I don't give up that home run to Chapman if I throw a better pitch, (and) we probably walk away with a win.\" Jones will be facing the Tigers for the first time.

        "description": "The incoming comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS might become as brilliant as Venus during its close approach to Earth this fall, potentially making it visible to the naked eye.",
        "content": "In a year in which we have already been treated to the \" \" in April and one of the in the past 500 years in May, what other amazing celestial attractions might 2024 have in store for us? How about a bright naked-eye comet? Over the last couple of years, two comets have made headlines in the mainstream media. In early February 2023, Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF), informally called the \" \", passed near Earth and then during the past month, drew attention because of its propensity for experiencing sudden flare-up in brightness and appearing to spout gaseous appendages resembling horns, thus giving rise to the moniker \"Devil's Comet.\" The only problem so far as the person-on-the-street was concerned was that both comets were difficult to see unless you were located under a dark, non-light polluted sky. And even through or a , both were rather unimpressive, appearing as nothing more than faint, fuzzy blobs of light. The only problem so far as the person-on-the-street was concerned was that both comets were difficult to see unless you were located under a dark, non-light polluted sky. And even through good binoculars or a small telescope, both were rather unimpressive, appearing as nothing more than faint, fuzzy blobs of light. But by the end of this summer, we may have a good idea as to whether we'll have a bright and easy-to-see naked-eye comet gracing our early autumn evening sky. The comet in question is C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS), discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in South Africa on Feb. 22, 2023. ATLAS is a robotic early warning system developed specifically for detecting near-Earth asteroids a few weeks to just days before they might impact . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Originally thought to be an , it was later determined that this same object was photographed six weeks earlier by the Purple Mountain Observatory (Tsuchinshan) in the east of Nanjing, . It has since been determined to actually be an incoming comet. When the comet was first sighted, it was far out beyond the orbit of Jupiter, some 680 million miles (1.09 billion km) from the sun. But on Sept. 27 of this year, Tsuchinshan–ATLAS will be making its closest approach to the sun, coming to within 36 million miles (58 million km). That also happens to be the average distance of the planet that is closest to the sun, . And just over two weeks later, on Oct. 12, the comet will pass just 44 million miles (71 million km) from Earth. These figures suggest that the comet might brighten to second or possibly even first magnitude and could develop a notable tail that could make for an eye-catching sight in the western evening sky during mid-October 2024. Unfortunately, there is a caveat: calculations show that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS has an orbital eccentricity of 1.0001081, meaning that it is a \"first-timer,\" coming directly from the , a spherical shell of icy space debris scientists theorize to be situated far beyond the and thought to contain billions or even trillions of comets. Comets originating from the Oort cloud have never passed near to before and their nuclei are coated with very volatile materials that vaporize far from the sun, creating short-lived surges in brightness. But as these comets get nearer to the sun, their brightening slows or even stops completely. Most — though admittedly not all — comets originating from the Oort cloud usually end up being duds. Typically, as these comets cross the orbit of , their steady brightening trend starts to falter, similar to a marathon runner at the 20-mile mark; \"hitting the wall\" so to speak. In the case of a comet having emerged from the Oort cloud, a sudden decline in brightening may be signaling that it ultimately will end up underperforming. Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS will not get to that point in its orbit until late July. If it then continues to steadily brighten beyond that time, then there's a good chance it will evolve into an eye-catching sight. But, more likely, if its brightening trend suddenly slows, or even comes to halt, all bets for a good show are off. Until then, all we can do is wait and watch. Unfortunately, we here in the Northern Hemisphere will not be able to check on the status of Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS during this summer because it will be situated much too far south to be accessible with telescopes. Those living in far-southerly locations, such as Australia, New Zealand and South America, however, will be able to track it in the morning sky before sunrise. We'll need to rely on reports from these parts of the globe to tell us whether the comet is on track to possibly becoming a bright object. Another thing that could work in our favor is that the geometry of the comet relative to the sun and Earth, places it almost in-between the sun and Earth around Oct. 8, creating a phenomenon known as \"forward scattering of sunlight.\" If the comet is particularly dusty, dust particles ejected from the comet nucleus would preferentially scatter sunlight in a forward direction and could cause a dramatic upsurge in the comet's brightness. To this end, there are two comets that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS might be compared to, which suddenly brightened-up thanks to forward scattering. The first was Comet Skjellerup–Maristany (C/1927 X1), which briefly became very bright in December 1927. Forward scattering of light on Dec. 18, 1927 allowed the comet to be seen during daylight by virtue of blocking the light of the sun with one's hand; it has since been ranked as among The other comet was , also known as the Great Comet of 2007 and given the designation C/2006 P1, and was the brightest comet in over 40 years; easily visible to the naked eye for observers in the Southern Hemisphere in January and February 2007. At its brightest on Jan. 12, 2007, this comet appeared at least twice as bright as Venus and, like Skjellerup–Maristany, was visible worldwide in broad daylight next to the sun. This extreme brightness was also attributable to forward-scattering. Some calculations suggest that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS might become as brilliant as Venus around Oct. 8, 2024 — although in the sky — like the comets of 1927 and 2007 — it will also be very near to the position of the sun. In the days that follow, however, Tsuchinshan–ATLAS should sweep rapidly northward and become well-placed for viewing in the western sky by mid-October. Although it will now be fading as it recedes from both the sun and Earth, it hopefully will be bright enough to be well-seen with the naked-eye, perhaps accompanied by a notable tail as well. But there are no guarantees. In the past, there have been comets that seemingly promised a great show that failed to live up to expectations. of 1973-74 is a good example. Conversely, there have been comets that did not look like they would perform well, that ended up unexpectedly becoming celestial showpieces. surprised everyone during the summer of 2020 by putting on a good show. — — — The legendary comet expert Dr. Fred Whipple perhaps said it best when he said: \"If you must bet, bet on a horse, not a comet!\" In the meantime, fingers crossed for Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS!

        "content": "The first step to realising your dream of studying in Canada is getting a Canada Student Visa, officially known as a study permit. This permit is essential—it’s your ticket to study at any of Canada’s designated learning institutions (DLIs). In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know, from eligibility requirements and application steps to what to do once you arrive. Whether you’re curious about working while studying or aiming for permanent residency, we’ve got you covered. Simply put, a Canada Student Visa allows international students to attend schools, colleges, and universities in Canada. The main purpose? To give you legal permission to stay and study. Without it, you can’t enrol in any designated learning institution (DLI). If you’re wondering about the difference between a student visa and a study permit, it’s not a big deal. So, you need both to make your study plans in Canada a reality. I know you’re curious, but studying in Canada is fantastic. Beyond the stunning environment and friendly people, there are some seriously compelling reasons to pack your bags and make the country your next stop. Canada is home to some of the world’s best universities and colleges. Think University of Toronto, McGill University, and the University of British Columbia, just to name a few. These institutions consistently rank high globally for their academic excellence and research opportunities. When you study in Canada, you get a top-notch education that is recognised worldwide. One of the coolest things about studying in Canada is its vibrant multicultural environment. You’ll meet people from all over the globe, making friends and connections that will last a lifetime. Whether in busy Toronto or calm Halifax, you’ll find a mix of cultures, languages, and cuisines. It’s like travelling the world without leaving campus! Studying in Canada doesn’t just mean being glued to the books. Thanks to the Canada Student Visa, you can work part-time during your studies (up to 20 hours a week) and full-time during breaks. This is a great way to gain valuable work experience, earn extra cash, and get deep into Canadian culture. Aside from this, you can apply for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) after you graduate. This allows you to work in Canada for up to three years. It is a fantastic opportunity to kickstart your career and secure a permanent job. Many international students fall in love with Canada and decide to stay. Thankfully, Canada makes this transition smoother than you might expect. There are several pathways to permanent residency for students: In short, Canada values the contributions of international students and actively encourages them to stay and build their futures in the country. Before you seize this opportunity, let’s make sure you tick all the boxes for eligibility. Here’s a rundown of what you need to qualify for a Canada Student Visa. ALSO READ: Canada removes requirement for language testing in non-express entry applications First, you need an acceptance letter from a designated learning institution (DLI). DLIs are schools approved by a provincial or territorial government to host international students. You can only start the visa application process with this acceptance letter. So, apply to your chosen schools, get accepted, and keep that letter handy. Next, you must prove you can afford to live and study in Canada. This means showing you have enough money to cover: Typically, you need to demonstrate you have at least CAD 20,635 for each year of your stay (in addition to tuition). This amount might be higher if you’re studying in a more expensive city or bringing family members. Canada takes safety seriously, so you must provide a police clearance certificate to show you don’t have a criminal record. This step ensures you won’t pose a risk to Canadian society. If you’ve had any issues with the law, be upfront about it and provide the necessary documentation. You might need to undergo a medical exam depending on where you’re coming from and how long you plan to stay. This assures the authority that you’re in good health and won’t pose a health risk to Canadians. The exam needs to be done by a panel of physicians approved by the Canadian government. The medical exam cost will vary depending on the clinic you visit. It typically ranges from CAD 150 to CAD 300. You can find a list of Panel Physicians authorised to conduct Immigration Medical Examinations on the website of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Lastly, you must convince the visa officer that you’ll return home after your studies. This means showing strong ties to your home country, like a job offer, family, or property. The aim is to prove that you won’t overstay your visa and that you’re genuinely planning to return after graduation. If you’ve decided to study in Canada, we’ve got you covered. We’ll explain the application process step-by-step to help you move from dreaming to doing. The application process for a Canada Student Visa might seem difficult, but breaking it down into manageable steps can make it a whole lot easier. Here’s what you need to do: Here’s a checklist of the documents you’ll need: Biometrics—your fingerprints and a photo—are an essential part of the application process for most applicants. Here’s how it works: Getting a Canada Student Visa requires careful attention to detail, but with the right preparation, you’ll be well on your way to starting an exciting new chapter in Canada. We know this is everyone’s favourite topic. Maybe yours, too. Because, let’s face it, nobody likes waiting around or breaking the bank. Here’s what you need to know to plan your Canada Student Visa journey. How long does it take to get your visa sorted? Well, it varies. The processing time for a Canada Student Visa can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on where you’re applying and the time of year. Generally, applying well in advance is a good idea to avoid any last-minute stress. The application fees for a Canada Student Visa can change, so it’s essential to check the latest updates on the IRCC website. As of now, here’s a rough estimate: Remember that these fees are subject to change, so always double-check before submitting your application. Okay, so we’ve covered the basics, but what about these little additional costs that can catch you off guard? Here is one to keep in mind: It’s essential to budget for both the application fees and these potential extra expenses to ensure you’re financially prepared for your Canada Student Visa journey. Staying updated on the latest changes to the Canada Student Visa program is crucial for prospective students. Here are the key updates for 2024: Starting January 22nd, 2024, most students will need a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL) from the province or territory where they plan to study. This new requirement means that your study permit application will likely be returned without a PAL. For more details, check the official IRCC page on PAL . The Canadian government has introduced a two-year cap on the number of study permits issued in response to the high volume of student visa applications. For 2024, approximately 35% fewer permits will be issued compared to 2023. This temporary cap might impact application processing times, so it’s important to apply as early as possible. The minimum proof of funds requirement has been increased. To study in most provinces, you must now show access to at least $20,635 per year, excluding tuition fees. This is a significant increase from the previous requirement of $10,000. Ensure you have the necessary financial documentation to meet this new threshold. These updates aim to manage the influx of student visa applications and ensure that international students are well-prepared to study in Canada. Stay informed and plan accordingly to navigate these changes smoothly. By now, you must have been in Canada. Yes, this is the time to put yourself together and get settled in for a new chapter. Here’s a helpful guide on what to do once you touch down in Canada. First, you’ll need to go through immigration clearance when arriving at the entry port. Have your Port of Entry (POE) Letter of Introduction, acceptance letter, proof of funds, and other necessary documents ready. The immigration officer will ask a few questions, stamp your passport, and welcome you to the country. Now that you’re officially in Canada, setting up a local bank account is essential. Having a Canadian bank account makes it easier to manage your finances, pay bills, and receive wages if you plan on working part-time. Research different banks and their student account options to find one that suits your needs. Finding a place to call home is next on the agenda. Whether you’re looking for a dorm room, an apartment, or a homestay, plenty of options are available to international students. Websites like PadMapper and Kijiji can help you search for rental listings in your desired city. When deciding, consider factors like location, budget, and amenities. Your Social Insurance Number (SIN) is your ticket to accessing government services and working in Canada. You’ll need it to get paid, file taxes, and access certain benefits. To apply for a SIN, visit a Service Canada centre with your passport, study permit, and proof of address. It’s a straightforward process that shouldn’t take too long. Lastly, you must arrange health insurance and familiarise yourself with the Canadian healthcare system. Most provinces and territories have their health insurance plans for residents, known as provincial health insurance. As a student, you may be eligible for coverage under your school’s health plan or through a private insurance provider. Be sure to enrol in a plan as soon as possible to ensure you’re covered for any medical emergencies. Let’s talk about putting some extra cash in your pocket while looking at the books in Canada. Working while studying can be a great way to gain experience, meet new people, and offset some expenses. Here’s what you need to know about working as an international student. As an international student with a valid Canada Student Visa, you can work part-time during your studies. Here’s the lowdown: These are fantastic opportunities to gain hands-on work experience in your field of study while earning academic credit. Many Canadian universities and colleges offer co-op and internship programs integrated into your academic curriculum. These programs typically require a co-op work permit, which you can apply for through your institution. I’m here imagining your graduation day. You’ve tossed your cap and celebrated with friends and family. Now, you’re wondering what’s next. Enter the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). This permit allows you to stay and work in Canada for up to three years after completing your studies. To be eligible for a PGWP, you must have completed a program of study at a designated learning institution (DLI) that lasted at least eight months. The length of your PGWP will depend on the duration of your program, with a maximum validity of three years. During your PGWP validity period, you can work for any employer in Canada, gain valuable work experience, and potentially transition to permanent residency through programs like the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) or Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). You’ve read enough to guide you on settling into your Canadian student life like a pro, but what if you need more time to finish your studies? Don’t worry; extending your study permit is doable. Before we get into the application process details, let’s talk about the conditions for extending your study permit. To be eligible for an extension, you must: You should be good to go as long as you meet these criteria! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you explore the process: While you’re waiting for your study permit extension to be processed, it’s crucial to maintain your legal status in Canada. This means continuing to attend classes, refraining from working off-campus without authorisation and complying with any other conditions outlined on your study permit. Suppose your study permit expires before you receive a decision on your extension application. In that case, you may be eligible for implied status, which allows you to remain in Canada under the same conditions as your previous permit until a decision is made on your extension application. This part ensures you have all the resources and support needed to explore the Canada Student Visa process easily. Here’s an important list of official government websites, educational consultants, and support groups to help you. It’s normal if you still have some burning questions you want to ask about the Canada Student Visa. And this is why we decided to provide detailed answers to the top five common questions to help clear up any confusion. Facing a visa refusal can be disheartening, but all hope is not lost. If your Canada Student Visa application is refused, you’ll receive a letter explaining why. You may have the option to appeal the decision or reapply with additional supporting documentation addressing the concerns raised by the immigration officer. If you encounter common issues, such as visa delays or technical difficulties with the application process, don’t panic! Contact the nearest Visa Application Center (VAC) or the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) helpline for assistance. They’re there to help you figure out any bumps in the road and ensure a smooth application process. The processing time for a Canada Student Visa can vary depending on your country of origin, the volume of applications, and the time of year. Generally, the process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. Applying well in advance is always a good idea to avoid any last-minute stress. Yes, under certain circumstances, a Canada Student Visa (study permit) can allow you to bring your family with you to Canada. Absolutely! As an international student with a valid Canada Student Visa, you can work part-time during your studies. You can work on-campus without needing a separate work permit, and you can also work off-campus for up to 20 hours per week during regular academic sessions and full-time during scheduled breaks with the appropriate work permit.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email As an emerging cycling brand, RANDRIDE always puts quality as the focus of its products. It insists on focusing on affordable prices and excellent performance, and produces various styles and models of ebikes. RANDRIDE ebike uses extremely durable material – Aluminum Alloy, it has won the favor of many riders through its sturdy and sturdy frame. What we tried riding was the RANDRIDE Forerunner electric mountain bike. This electric mtb adopts a stylish full suspension frame design, mainly equipped with a 1000W brushless motor, a 48V 23AH removable lithium battery, Shimano 27-speed gear shift system and Shimano front and rear hydraulic brakes. RANDRIDE Forerunner emtb ’ s Specs Weight: 64 lbs(29 kg) Rider height range: 5’2′′ ~ 6’8′′ (158 – 203 cm) Total Payload Capacity: 410 lbs (186 kg) Battery: 48V 23Ah lithium battery(removable) Motor: 1000W Brushless motor Motor sensor: Torque Sensor Torque: ≥90 NM Number of Pedal Assist Levels: 5 Display: Colorful LCD display(with USB charging port); Display the information of speed, mileage, power, gear etc. Wheel Size: 27.5′′X2.4′′ CST Puncture-resistant Tire Gear Shift System:Shimano 27-speed Brake Type: Shimano Hydraulic Brakes Shipping and Assembly First of all, the packaging of RANDRIDE is very strong. The Forerunner electric mtb arrived without any damage, and the gifts are also included. During the assembly process, I was able to assemble the product easily, and all the accessories were assembled. I have assembled many bicycles, so this off road ebike was not a problem for me. I assembled it in about 30 minutes. Of course, there are corresponding instructions in the box for assembly, and there are also assembly videos on the website for reference. How the RANDRIDE Forerunner Ebike Performed Since we need to conduct professional tests to test the performance of Forerunner, we chose some different terrains for field testing. Performance: Urban Overview I set the pedal assist to first gear, and I can drive on city roads smoothly, and the driving is very smooth and the speed is very gentle. Different settings can be made according to different riding conditions, but for me personally, using one It’s perfectly adequate for riding in high gear. The Forerunner is specially designed for off road riding, but its performance on flat terrain is not inferior, and it is even more suitable for city riding than some bikes specifically designed for city ebikes. Performance: Off-Road Overview On rugged roads, I drove the Forerunner for many challenges. It can adapt well to various terrain changes, including winding roads, uphill roads, and downhill curves. We have tested them in some places. There are gravel, some places are smooth and covered with moss, but these cannot hinder the progress of this e bike mtb. It conquers these terrains well and completes the challenge. Performance: Pedal Assist Modes and the Motor RANDRIDE’s motor has been set to the highest wattage before leaving the factory, so it travels very fast. Top speed reaches over 30 mph(48 kph0. What I like about this emtb is that its maximum speed can be set freely to suit the speed limit policies of different roads. The torque of the Forerunner is 90 NM. Most of the time I will not use 90 NM. I will only use the highest torque when climbing hills to conquer the terrain. The motor does not make any noise when driving. The entire driving process is very quiet and no excessive noise can be heard. Performance: Hill Climb Test When I use the Forerunner to climb hills, the entire process is very easy. The pedal assist is very effective and gives a lot of support during the entire climbing process. Assistance makes the entire climbing process relatively easy. The ebike is very light, so its own weight will basically not affect the speed of climbing. Performance: Brake Test Forerunner off road ebike uses Shimano Hydraulic Brakes, which do not make any sound during the braking process, and the operation is not very complicated. It can be triggered by gently pinching with your fingers. Throughout our testing, we found the brakes to hold up well and provide good feedback. On my way home, the brakes felt secure and sure-footed, working quickly even on steep terrain. Used with the 27.5′′X2.4′′ CST Puncture-resistant Tire, there is no need to worry about braking problems on various gravel roads. Performance: Range and Battery Test The Forerunner’s details page claims that in pure electric mode, its battery life is 57+ miles (92+ km). We have conducted tests and the battery life reached 52+ miles (84+ km), we are very satisfied. How to get this RANDRIDE emtb? You can buy this cost-effective full suspension electric mountain bike from their official website. There are 21 speed gear shift system and 27 speed gear shift system configurations to choose from. No matter which one you choose, you will get six free gifts, and you can also use their Off Code: “LT100” to get $100 USD Off. The minimum price is only US$1,849, and you don’t need to pay any extra shipping and taxes. You just need to wait for the ebike to be delivered to your door at home.

At about 9:30 p.m. Sunday, May 26, Michigan State Police troopers responded to a reported shooting in the 1000 block of Cathay Street in Saginaw, police said in a post on X . Shortly after police arrived, the suspect attempted to flee the scene in a vehicle along with a 47-year-old woman - identified by police as the victim of the shooting - but was stopped by troopers a short time later near Holland Avenue and Outer Drive, police said. The 47 year-old woman had been shot by the suspect at the Cathay Street residence, MSP Lt. Kim Vetter told MLive. The suspect - a 63-year-old man - then rammed the trooper’s patrol car, leading to gunfire being exchanged, police said. The suspect was ultimately taken into custody. The woman was taken to a local hospital where she died from injuries suffered from the shooting at the residence, police said. Vetter said police did not shoot the victim during the exchange of gunfire. The 63-year-old man was not injured and has been lodged at the Saginaw County Jail. The responding trooper was not injured. An investigation into this incident is ongoing, police said. Troopers from the MSP First District Incident Response Team, MSP Accident Reconstruction Unit and MSP Bridgeport Lab all responded to assist in the investigation.",

        "content": "Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has condemned the Federal High Court’s refusal to grant bail to its employee, Tigran Gambaryan. In a statement, the crypto exchange labelled the decision unjustified and requested that the charges against Gambaryan be dropped. Justice Emeka Nwite, delivering the ruling in Abuja on Friday, held that the bail application was refused as he had carefully reviewed the application and determined that Gambaryan would likely jump bail if granted. The court ruled that Binance could be served with the Federal Inland Revenue Service tax evasion charge through Gambaryan. Gambaryan’s lawyers objected, stating they needed to review the amended charge to advise him on taking his plea. The court agreed to adjourn the matter to May 22. Binance asserted that Gambaryan, who had no decision-making power in the company, was innocent and had dedicated his life to public service and fighting crime. “We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained. Tigran has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. “These charges against him are completely meritless. He should be freed while discussions continue between Binance and Nigerian government officials,” the exchange stated. Gambaryan, who has been detained since February, faces charges of money laundering and terrorism financing alongside his company and fellow executive Nadeem Anjarwalla, who is currently on the run. The charges were brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. In another separate statement, Gambaryan’s wife, Yuki Gambaryan, lamented, “I truly cannot believe that my innocent husband is now, on his 40th birthday, having to face a trial for charges that he has nothing to do with. “The whole world is watching what he is being put through, and I just pray that commonsense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.” A few weeks ago, the Chief Executive Officer of Binance, Richard Teng, described the detention of Gambaryan by the Nigerian government as ‘unjust’ and that it was a “dangerous precedent” for international businesses. Teng also said that despite Binance’s repeated efforts at constructive engagement and cooperation with Nigerian authorities, Gambaryan remained in detention for ‘spurious’ reasons. The Binance CEO declared that inviting a company’s mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, had set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide. “The message from the Nigerian government is clear: we must detain an innocent, mid-level employee, a former U.S. federal agent, and place him in a dangerous prison to control Binance. “This regrettable turn of events contradicts the spirit of cooperation and transparency that Binance has consistently demonstrated in its interactions with the regulatory authorities,” Teng added.",

        "content": "Investors seeking to build sustainable wealth over the long term regard buy-and-hold stocks as one of the most reliable investment strategies. By focusing on fundamentally strong companies and holding their stocks for extended periods, investors can typically enjoy substantial returns. Meanwhile, they can better mitigate the risks associated with short-term market volatility. The principle behind buy-and-hold investing is simple. First, identify quality stocks with strong growth prospects, solid financials and competitive advantages. Then, hold onto these investments through market ups and downs. Historically, this approach has been proven to generate impressive returns. Research suggests that the S&P 500 index has delivered an average annual return of approximately 10% over the past 90 years. Such an impressive performance underscores the power of long-term investing. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, is a staunch advocate of the buy-and-hold strategy. His investment philosophy centers on purchasing stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and holding them indefinitely. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) has consistently outperformed the market, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. With that information, let’s delve into three stocks that are well-positioned to deliver long-term growth and stability. Celsius Holdings (CELH) Beverage company Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH ) has emerged as a standout player in the energy drink market. It captures the attention of health-conscious consumers with its unique beverages. Management’s innovative product line has resonated well with a growing demographic focused on fitness and wellness. In early May, the energy drink company reported robust first quarter fiscal 2024 results, highlighting its ability to scale its operations and grow market share. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $356 million. Gross margin surged to a record high of 51%, benefiting from economies of scale in sourcing. First quarter diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) of 27 cents jumped 108% YOY. In fact, CELH’s strong sales momentum is primarily attributed to its success in expanding its global distribution channels. It has a long-term distribution agreement with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP ) for the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the beverage company has recently announced expansions into the U.K., Ireland, France, Australia and New Zealand. Currently, international markets account for just 5% of revenues. This suggests robust growth opportunities outside the U.S. Consensus analyst estimates call for 40% earnings growth through the next two years. Year-to-date ( YTD ), CELH stock has surged by close to 75%. As a result, the stock currently trades at an expensive forward price-to-earnings ( P/E ) ratio of 94x. And, its trailing sales ratio of 15.8x indicates high growth expectations. Investors may want to wait for a pullback toward the $90 level. Diebold Nixdorf ( DBD) Financial and retail technology company Diebold Nixdorf (NYSE: DBD ) is a company known for its ATM managed services. DBD offers a variety of security solutions and self-service technologies. This makes it a potential pick for investors looking for buy-and-hold technology stocks in the financial transformation space. First quarter metrics showed mixed results for Diebold Nixdorf. Revenue grew 5.1% YOY to $897.1 million, falling short of analyst expectations. Nonetheless, the company delivered positive net income of $45.2 million, suggesting a strategic focus on profitability. Recently, Diebold Nixdorf has unveiled Vynamic® Connection Points 7 (VCP 7), its latest self-service software, at the Intersect Conference. Investors are hopeful that VCP 7 could streamline digital transformation for financial institutions, potentially increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction. Since January, DBD stock has advanced 54%, trading favorably at 10.5x earnings and almost 1x sales. At present, the 12-month median price forecast for DBD stock stands at $44.60. Micron Technology (MU) Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) specializes in high-performance memory and storage solutions that are essential for artificial intelligence ( AI ) applications. In its Q2 of fiscal year 2024 report, Micron revealed strong momentum across all of its four segments, driven by strong AI server demand. Revenue jumped 58% YOY to $5.82 billion. Adjusted EPS improved to 42 cents, compared to a loss of $1.91 per share in the previous year. The ramp-up of investments in data centers, cloud and AI is boosting demand for Micron’s offerings. With high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ) widely regarded as a bottleneck technology for AI, Micron’s flagship HMB3E chip for AI servers is already sold out for 2025. The chipmaker is ramping up its HBM offering with 30% less power than the competition. Amid growing concerns about AI’s power consumption, HBM3E is expected to boost Micron’s market share and lead to sustained pricing strength due to tight supply. Also, the company’s diverse segments and products are demonstrating robust growth momentum, which helps minimize revenue concentration risks for Micron. In Q3, management anticipates YOY revenue growth to accelerate to 76%. Record revenue expectations for fiscal 2025 indicate management’s confidence in its current growth momentum over the next several quarters. Since January, MU stock has increased by 49%. Shares are changing hands at 7.7 times trailing sales. Wall Street remains optimistic for Micron stock with a potential upside of 10% from current levels.

Three key ECB members — chief economist Philip Lane , Finland Central Bank governor Olli Rehn and France Central Bank governor François Villeroy de Galhau — made reassuring statements indicating a rate cut is imminent. “A June rate cut is appropriate if the inflation outlook holds,” Lane said. “Inflation is converging to our 2% target in a sustained way, making it the right time in June to ease the monetary policy stance and start cutting rates,” Rehn said. “Barring a surprise, a June rate cut is a done deal,” Villeroy said. Traders now almost fully price in a June rate cut and expect a total of 65 basis points in cuts (more than two cuts but less than three) by the end of the year.

She is currently a freelance Writer at Driving.ca since 2016 Summary · Professional writer for more than 35 years, appearing in some of the top publications in Canada and the U.S. · Specialties include new-vehicle reviews, old cars and automotive history, automotive news, and “How It Works” columns that explain vehicle features and technology · Member of the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC) since 2003; voting member for AJAC Canadian Car of the Year Awards; juror on the Women’s World Car of the Year Awards Education Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features. Experience Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written. An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999.

        "description": "Upgrade your home security hardware with these Memorial Day deals.",
        "content": "Home security devices can give you peace of mind while you're away from home, but they can be a large investment at full price. With tons of Memorial Day sales going on today, now is the perfect time to finally take the plunge and upgrade your home security. We found the best deals on smart locks, cameras, doorbells and more so you can feel reassured knowing you have some control of the safety of your home. We keep our list current with the latest sales for Memorial Day, where you can save 30% to 50% off excellent home security technology from our top-recommended brands. Before you buy, make sure the discounted product is compatible with your current smart home setup (such as a preference for Google Home or Apple's HomeKit) and your overall privacy goals . You'll also want a strong home router for connecting any outdoor cams. For more, check out our tested lists of the best home security systems for renters , best value video doorbells and best smart locks in 2024. Best Memorial Day home security cam deals This Arlo Pro cam is currently one of our favorite picks for wireless and outdoor security cameras, a complete package with high resolution, a spotlight, great smart home compatibility, and plenty of other bells and whistles. But it's very expensive... until this deal, which drops the price by nearly 30%. If you're interested in only one cam and want it to be one of the best available, think about taking advantage of this discount. The Blink Outdoor 4 is one of our favorite all-purpose outdoor cameras . It offers an easy app for controls, AA lithium batteries rated for two years of work and a hub for local storage is included. Blink subscription fees for advanced object detection and storage are lower than most at around $3 per month, too. Keep in mind that, like Ring, this is an Alexa-only cam. The affordable Blink Mini 2 is even more affordable with this deal, and the little cam comes packed with features like a mini spotlight, two-way audio, night vision and motion detection. It's an ideal cam for a more limited space, and with an outdoor cable you can mount it outside as well. Ring's Stick Up Cam Battery version is one of our favorite picks for a versatile shelf cam that you can pick up to watch the kids or pets wherever they are, inside or out (it also has a mounting option). Ring offers highly customizable motion detection along with two-way audio and night vision. As an Amazon brand, it's an excellent fit for Alexa, too. While it's a little more expensive than budget cams, this EufyCam is 40% off with an unprecedented opportunity to get rare features like Apple Home compatibility and object recognition with no additional fee. It also offers a 2K resolution and IP67 weatherproof rating, as well as night vision. You don't usually see a high-end outdoor cam at this price, but keep in mind, if you want video storage, you'll need to buy a Eufy hub and microSD card. Or you could choose this two-cam Eufy package that comes with a hub and is $110 off thanks to a similar deal. Lorex is currently our go-to choice for local storage-only cameras that stay off the cloud ( and can even stay off the internet altogether ). This spotlight camera can do a little bit of everything, including object detection, and thanks to Lorex's sitewide Memorial Day sale, it's one of the many cameras available with a discount. Ring's HD video doorbell may not be quite as advanced as its latest Pro model , but this battery doorbell still does a great job of surveying the porch -- without quite as many settings to muddle through. At this hefty discount it's one of the most affordable, quality doorbells currently available for those who prefer to save. Important extras like two-way audio and night vision are included, but video storage will cost extra. Blink's doorbell was already one of the most affordable models. With this deal it's one of the best cheap video doorbells you'll find -- at least for now. Even at this discount, it still has key features like two-way audio, custom alerts, wireless installation and more. You can add a Sync Module 2 for local storage if you prefer to stay off subscriptions. Read our Blink Video Doorbell preview . Pet cameras can watch out for intruders, but their primary focus is the Fidos and Felixes in our homes. They can be expensive purchases, but this sale cuts the price by nearly a third. This HD camera has Alexa built in and can provide motion and audio alerts, along with night vision. It even has one of those little treat dispensers to interact with your pet -- just don't overfeed them when you're away. Did you know ? We have an Amazon Storefront with some of the best Memorial Day deals available. Best Memorial Day home security bundle deals TP-Link's affordable Tapo system includes two 2K-resolution cams and a connection hub, ideal for a front-and-back camera setup at your home. The cameras are weatherproofed, come with 49-foot night vision, and allow you to set activity zones for identifying people, pets and vehicles. They're all-purpose outdoor security cams that can fill many roles, although you may want to grab a microSD card if you don't plan on using the Tapo subscription service. Ring is one of our top picks for easy DIY installation if you want a speedy system equipped with door and window sensors. The five-piece model is a perfect starting point, and this bundle throws in the Ring video doorbell for front door protection as well. A Ring subscription (starting at $5) is a very good idea, but it's still an excellent choice for a discounted starter kit. If you're a fan of Ecobee (its products work reliable with Apple HomeKit, Alexa and more) you can deck your home out in Ecobee security and a smart thermostat with this deal. Save on a start sensor pack, an Ecobee video doorbell and the Thermostat Premium. That's a good combo if you've experimented with Ecobee products before and are ready to jump into a whole smart home setup. Note that the doorbell is wired in this pack. Finding a large home security system can feel frustrating if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars and risk getting locked into a contract. Using this hefty discount, this SimpliSafe system is available for less than $300 -- and while a monitoring subscription is available, you can choose to self-monitor and waive the monthly fees. Included in this kit is a base station, keypad, pack of entry sensors, motion sensor, key fob, siren and smoke detector. That makes it an effective DIY way to outfit a new home or apartment that's never had security tech before. Eufy is doing a sitewide sale to celebrate both its anniversary and Memorial Day, with major deals off its camera bundles, all the way up to several hundred dollars off a camera three- or four-pack. We Eufy cameras fori ts free object recognition and on-board storage so you can skip the subscription if you want. Eufy cams tend to be compact with high resolutions, too -- but you'll need to act fast before these sell out. This solar powered set incudes four eufyCam 3 and a 1 TB harddrive. Note that the $370 discount is available with code WS24T88731TBSP , which will be automatically applied when you add it to your cart. Best Memorial Day smart lock deals Aqara's U100 smart lock is one of the best locks we've reviewed , and you can find it on sale with this discount that drops it below $200. Considering the lock offers every type of control from fingerprints and codes to digital passes (and a hefty deadbolt replacement), that's a good deal. It's even better if you're an Apple user, since Aqara works natively with Apple HomeKit. Add a hub and you can get Matter support along with Google Assistant and Alexa. August's durable smart construction often comes with a price to match, but this deal lets you get a fourth-generation August smart lock on more affordable terms. The Wi-Fi smart lock fits onto your existing deadbolt, providing it with app management including the ability to share digital keys. You can also set schedules or make sure the door automatically locks after a certain period of time. The lock also has excellent compatibility, working with platforms including Alexa, HomeKit, Google Home and Samsung SmartThings. Best Memorial Day deals on smart home tech An Echo Show pairs well with any compatible security camera or video doorbell (Blink, Ring, Arlo, Google Nest, etc.), showing you a live view via a quick Alexa voice command, and letting you talk through devices without using the app. This is the most affordable we've seen the excellent Echo Show 8 with a 33% discount. You can also use that screen for video chats, YouTube videos, Amazon Prime shows, looking up recipes, catching the news and much more. With Google's Nest Hub, second-generation, you can pair it with Nest cameras and doorbells and view them from your hub. If you buy the Nest Aware subscription (starts at $8/month) it will also alert you on your phone when you aren't home if it hears breaking glass, a smoke alarm or other unusual sounds that may mean a safety risk is occurring at your home. In addition to the safety features, it also works as a smart assistant for your home, allowing you to voice activate music, lights and other smart devices as well as display videos and more. Check out our full review of the Google Nest Hub, 2nd Gen to see more of its capabilities. Read our Google Nest Hub (2nd gen) review . If you're looking for simpler security tech, these little doorstops sound an alarm when they're activated. That's it -- they just help you know when a door has been opened. Sometimes that's all you need, and at under $15 this pair is currently a very good deal. Best Memorial Day sale security platform pick Cove's offers DIY security systems with an onsite kit builder to quickly customize your home security sensors, leak detectors, cameras and other important add-ons. Cove is a good pick for those who want a hybrid of traditional home security (subscriptions and professional monitoring are generally required with Cove) with the ease of DIY setup and no contracts. Sign up to get 70% off qualifying systems and Cove will throw in a free camera, too. What is the best time to buy home security devices? While prices fluctuate year round, the best prices on home security devices including cameras and smart locks, is often during Amazon's Prime Day , held each year in early July, when Amazon slashes prices and its competitors step up to match those. Black Friday and holiday sales also bring some great prices, but Memorial Day sales remain competitive, which means if you're shopping for a home security device, now is the best time to snag a deal before midsummer.

        "description": "A woman could be Mexico’s next leader. Millions of others continue in shadows as domestic workers.",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Concepción Alejo is used to being invisible. Alejo, 43, touches her face up with makeup on a Tuesday morning, and steps out of her tiny apartment on the fringes of Mexico City. She walks until the cracked gravel outside her home turns into cobblestones, and the campaign posters coating small concrete buildings are replaced with the spotless walls of gated communities of the city’s upper class. It’s here where Alejo has quietly worked cleaning the homes and raising the children of wealthier Mexicans for 26 years. Alejo is among approximately 2.5 million Mexicans — largely women — who serve as domestic workers in the Latin American nation, a profession that has come to encapsulate gender and class divisions long permeating . Women like her play a fundamental role in Mexican society, picking up the burden of domestic labor as a growing number of women professionals enter the workforce. Despite reforms under the current government, many domestic workers continue to face low pay, abuse by employers and long hours. It is an institution dating back to colonial times, and some researchers equate the unstable working conditions to “modern slavery.\" Now, with Mexico on its way to possibly electing its first female president June 2, domestic workers hope either or former might shift the balance in their favor. “I’ve never voted all these years, because it’s always the same for us whoever wins. ... When have they ever listened to us, why would I give them my vote?\" Alejo said. “At least by having a woman, maybe things will be different.\" Born to a poor family in the central Mexican state of Puebla, Alejo dropped out of school at age 14, moving to Mexico City as a live-in nanny with two sisters. “It’s like you’re a mother. The kids would call me ‘mama’,\" she said. “I would bathe them, care for them, do everything from the moment I awoke to the moment they slept.\" While some domestic workers live separately from families, many more live with families and work weeks, if not months, without breaks and isolated from family and friends. Alejo said the demands and low pay of domestic work led her not to have children herself. Others told The Associated Press they were fired from their positions after they fell ill and asked for help from their employers. “When you work in someone else’s house, your life isn’t your own,\" said Carolina Solana de Dios, a 47-year-old live-in nanny. Their help is essential for working women like 49-year-old single mother Claudia Rodríguez, as they continue to fight to enter professional spaces historically dominated by men. In Mexico and much of Latin America, a gap has long divided men and women in the workplace. In 2005, 80% of men were employed or looking for jobs, compared to 40% of women, Mexican government data shows. That gap has narrowed over time, though large disparities in salary and leadership roles still exist. Born in a town two hours outside Mexico City, Rodríguez fled an abusive father with her mother and siblings, taking refuge in the capital. Instead of pursuing her dream of professionally dancing, she began to work and study not to “make the same sacrifice\" as her mother toiling away in different informal jobs. She spent years clawing her way up in the IT industry, but took over all the housework when she had kids with her husband. When her husband left her for another woman six years ago, hiring a live-in domestic worker was the only thing she could do to stay afloat. Today, she and her nanny, Irma, both wake up at 5 a.m., one making lunch for her two daughters while the other drops them off at school. “In the case of women in business, we couldn’t take it all on alone simply because it’s far too much that society expects of you,\" she said. Yet a historic number of Mexican women are taking up leadership roles, in part due gender quota laws set on political parties. Since 2018, Mexico’s Congress has had a 50-50 gender split, and the number of female governors has shot up. While neither presidential candidate has spoken explicitly about domestic workers, both Sheinbaum and Gálvez proposed addressing violence against women and closing the country’s gender pay gap. In 2019, the government of passed landmark legislation granting domestic workers basic rights like paid leave, limits on working hours and access to health insurance paid by employers. But failures by the government to enforce those rules left domestic workers unprotected and locked in a “dynamic of power inequality,\" said Norma Palacios, head of the country’s domestic workers union, SINACTRAHO. “Nothing has changed ... even if on paper we should have more labor rights,\" Palacios said. Neither Alejo, the domestic worker, nor Rodríguez, the single mother, say they particularly identify with either candidate on the ballot. Both plan to vote. Even if they see the leaders as more of the same, they echoed Palacios in saying that a woman leader would be an important step. “It’s still a woman who is going to be at the head of a country — a sexist country, a country of inequality, a country of violence against women, a country of femicides,\" Palacios said. Meanwhile, workers like Alejo continue down a shaky path. Alejo is among the 98% of domestic workers yet to enroll in health insurance, according to SINACTRAHO data. She finally works with a kind family that pays her a fair wage, but she’s summoning up the courage to ask the family to pay for her health insurance, worrying that she’ll be replaced if she asks for her rights to be respected. “They don’t like that you ask for things,\" she said. “It’s not easy finding work, and if you need to work, you end up accepting whatever they give you.\" ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world to know more.

        "content": "NATO won’t defend Ukraine from missiles KYIV – NATO does not intend to use its air defences to provide cover for Ukraine, the military bloc’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has insisted. His comment comes days after Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky urged the US and its allies to shoot down Russian missiles. Speaking to the New York Times on Monday, Zelensky stated that he sees no problem with such NATO involvement, arguing that it would not be tantamount to an “attack on Russia”. “NATO will not become part of the conflict,” the military bloc’s chief insisted. RT Yemen’s Houthis release 113 detainees SANAA – Yemen’s Houthi group unilaterally released 113 detainees in the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sanaa on Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. “We are pleased to see that humanitarian considerations are being prioritised ... for the families eagerly awaiting the return of their loved ones. We hope this paves the way for further releases,” said Daphnee Maret, head of ICRC’s delegation in Yemen. The UN has been making efforts to release all detainees, mostly political opponents, human rights activists, and journalists, and reach a political settlement between the Yemeni warring parties. Xinhua Twelve injured on Qatar Airways Dublin flight DUBLIN – Twelve people have been injured, including eight taken to hospital, after a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Ireland hit turbulence on Sunday, Dublin Airport said in a statement.

        "content": "THE new series of Love Island is almost upon us, with a host of new stars ready to look for love. Ayo Odukoya has been confirmed as an islander for series 11 . Here's what we know about him. Ayo Odukoya is 25 years old and hails from Canning Town. He said he wanted to take part in the show as it was a good opportunity to find someone. I think I’d bring excitement and joy. I think people would have someone to come to and talk to and feel comfortable being around or to have a laugh with. He said: \"It seems like something to have a go at. Of course, you can’t go wrong trying to find that love again - that is something that would be amazing to find if possible. \"I don’t really like being outside too much, I’ve been outside recently and it’s not fun outside! I do prefer to be indoors chilling with that person I can do stuff with. \"It would be nice to have that with somebody again.\" Ayo went onto describe what he thinks he can being to the villa during the series. He said: \"I think I’d bring excitement and joy. I think people would have someone to come to and talk to and feel comfortable being around or to have a laugh with. \"I think I’m somebody everyone would take to.\" Ayo went onto describe what would make him someone worth coupling up with. He said: \"I feel like the way I carry myself is very respectful and I think people take to that and once you show who you are to somebody you get it back tenfold. \"The way I am gives off a good enough energy for people to feel comfortable around me.\" Ayo works as a model, appearing in shoots for Kult Models. He also plays football, appearing as a striker for Isthimian league North side Redbridge FC. Ayo scored eight goals in 38 appearances for the Barkingside-based team in the 2023/24 season, helping them win the Essex Senior cup. The new series of Love Island will start on June 3, 2024 at 9pm. Ayo will be one of the first Islanders to enter the villa for the 2024 series He will be joined by ten other singletons hoping to find romance on the show. As the weeks go by, they will be joined by a number of other bombshells that in previous years has stirred up tension in the villa. The Sun revealed how the Majorca-based villa has undergone a makeover in preparation for the brand new series. For launch night, The Sun revealed that ITV bosses are planning a huge shake-up . The first episode of the new series will air on ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX simultaneously, with the rest of the series being shown on ITV2 and ITVX. The show will air at 9pm, Sunday to Friday. A highlights programme will be shown on Saturday instead of the regular show. A source said: “ITV want to throw their weight behind Love Island and make sure it has a big, glitzy moment when the 11th series kicks off next month. “Showing it across every channel means creating what they hope will be a big TV moment. It shows there is still a real commitment to the format even nine years on.\" Every year Love Island opens its doors to more sexy Islanders who are hoping for a holiday romance that could turn into more. Here we take you though all of the Love Island winners so far and what their relationship statuses are now: 2024 - The first ever All stars spin off show was won by Molly Smith and Tom Clare. STATUS: Still together. 2023 - Jess Harding and Sammy Root took home the 50K, and won the summer 2023 Love Island .

        "content": "Rapper and singer Sean Kingston and his mother committed more than a million dollars in fraud in recent months, stealing money, jewelry, a Cadillac Escalade and furniture, documents released Friday allege. Kingston, 34, and his 61-year-old mother, Janice Turner, have been charged with conducting an organized scheme to defraud, grand theft, identity theft and related crimes, according to arrest warrants released by the Broward County Sheriff's Office. The two were arrested Thursday after a . Turner was arrested in the raid, while Kingston was arrested in Fort Irwin, an Army training base in the Mojave Desert where he was performing. Kingston, who had a No. 1 hit with \"Beautiful Girls\" in 2007 and performed with Justin Bieber on the song \"Eenie Meenie,\" is being held at the High Desert Detention Center in Adelanto, awaiting his return to Florida. Robert Rosenblatt, the attorney for the Jamaican-American performer and his mother, appeared before a judge Friday morning along with Turner. He said that Kingston would return voluntarily if allowed, \"which would save the state the expense of extradition and the costs of travel for the detectives and Sean.\" His mother was being held Friday at the Broward County jail on $160,000 bond. \"We look forward to addressing these (charges) in court and are confident of a successful resolution for Shawn and his mother,\" Rosenblatt said. Specific details of Kingston's and Turner's alleged crimes are not included in the warrants, but the documents say that from October to March they stole almost $500,000 in jewelry, more than $200,000 from Bank of America, $160,000 from the Escalade dealer, more than $100,000 from First Republic Bank, $86,000 from the maker of customized beds and other smaller amounts. Kingston, whose legal name is Kisean Anderson, was already on two years' probation for trafficking stolen property. Further information on that conviction could not be found. According to federal court records, his mother pleaded guilty in 2006 to bank fraud for stealing over $160,000 and served nearly 1.5 years in prison. The two have also been sued. In 2015, a seller of customized watches successfully sued Kingston and his mother in a New York City federal court for $356,000 after they failed to pay. In 2018, a New York jeweler successfully sued the two for $301,000 after they scammed the store out of nine items. More recently, a Florida entertainment systems company sued Kingston in February, saying he failed to pay $120,000 of a $150,000 bill for a 232-inch television it installed in his home. The TV is approximately 17 feet by 9.5 feet and covers a wall. He allegedly told the owners that if they gave him a low down payment and credit, he and Bieber would make commercials for them. That never happened, and Kingston never paid, the lawsuit says. The company's attorney says Bieber had no involvement - Kingston was falsely using his name. \"He has basically a sales pitch that he goes through to defraud people,\" said Dennis Card, the attorney for Ver Ver Entertainment who was at the scene during Thursday's raid in Florida. \"He induces them into giving him really expensive things. We know that our property is inside this house right here.\"",

        "content": "An automated driving testing system (ADTS) was started today by the Transport Department in Rourkela of Sundargarh district. This is the first of its kind DTS in Odisha. According to an official source, at least 112 applicants for the Driving License (DL) appeared for the test. CCTV cameras were pressed into service for flawless and accurate driving testing. The automated DTS and video analytics system (VAS) will be of immense help to bring about transparency in the process. The driving testing of applicants was conducted based on existing norms of the Department. A six-step method was followed and successful applicants will be issued DLs soon, the source added. When contacted, Rourkela regional transport officer (RTO) Bibhanjan Samantasinghar said, “ADTS is a fully computerised process of driving testing. Twenty-six cameras have been installed for effective testing. The steps that an applicant has to qualify are overtaking, zebra crossing, ‘S’ track, parallel parking, gradient, and ‘8’ track etc. Visual analysis of driving is being done during the testing.”",

        "content": "Due to an iffy weather forecast in New York City, the Mets announced that they have postponed today’s scheduled series opener against the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers . The game will be made up as a single-admission doubleheader tomorrow afternoon beginning at 4:10 PM. Tylor Megill and Gavin Stone had originally been scheduled to face off against each other on the mound today. Presumably, both pitchers will start one of the two scheduled games tomorrow, with José Quintana and Tyler Glasnow suiting up for their respective teams in the other matchup. On the bright side for the Mets, between today’s day off and Adrian Houser’s four-inning relief outing in yesterday’s game against the Giants, the bullpen should be fully rested for tomorrow’s doubleheader (and the team will also likely be calling up an additional pitcher to serve as the 27th man for the day). Enjoy your Mets-free Memorial Day, everyone.",

The memorable spaces include the “unforgettable entry staircase,” which actor Macaulay Culkin sleds down in the Home Alone movie, as well as the formal living and dining room spaces that hosted a fake holiday party complete with a Michael Jordan cut-out rigged onto a toy train.

The film has since spawned a number of holiday sequels.

        "description": "Nadal refused to rule out a return to the French Open next year but it feels like the end is very close now after straight-sets defeat to fourth seed Alexander Zverev",
        "content": "The prolonged closing chapter of greats, particularly in an arena as inconsistent and undependable as professional sport, is a true tribulation of the mind. It’s like the blowing of a long-standing bulb: you flick the switch – more than once, as many as thrice – in a subconscious instruction to your brain that it cannot be time to recycle and replace. But sometimes there can be no denying the undeniable, no matter how unpalatable. Power is not possible any more. Yet over the past two decades, nothing has been as consistent and dependable as Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros. Eighteen appearances, 14 titles, one king of clay. Domination unparalleled not just in tennis but in the history of sport . His legacy is indisputable, illustrated best by his silver statue on the east side of the complex. Yet ultimately, nobody fools Father Time. And so it came to pass that, after 116 matches, Nadal lost in week one at the French Open for the first time. Handed the toughest first-round draw possible – against the tour’s most in-form, injury-free player – Alexander Zverev packed a punch to brutally dismiss any notion of a glorious swansong, triumphing 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 . Two years on from rupturing ankle ligaments under the Philippe Chatrier roof, as Nadal progressed to what surely will be his final title in Paris, the German earned his stripes in the same setting and put his name in the history books. For Novak Djokovic (2015, 2021) and Robin Soderling (2009), see Alexander Zverev (2024): men to defeat Rafa on Chatrier . Come the finale, as modern greats Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek watched on like simple punters, Nadal took centre stage and waved goodbye. Briefly, the sun glinted through the open-plan roof, glistening onto this venue’s omnipresent champion. On a gloomy day in western Paris, it was an apt conclusion. What now? We know, fitness permitting, it won’t be his final appearance on these courts. Nadal, gold medallist in Beijing 16 years ago, plans to play the Olympic Games this summer and post-match again refused to rule out returning to his favourite grand slam next year. Yet, in all honesty, and in a similar vein to Andy Murray’s defeat last night , it felt like the fire – and the fumes – had finally been put out. He also later confirmed in his press conference that he doesn’t think he will play Wimbledon in a month’s time. Nadal, seven days shy of 38, entered his home from home to the most explosive of collective cheers. If we didn’t know better, with the beat of the drum, the tune of the horn and the unashamedly partisan Parisian crowd on this Monday afternoon in May, it could have been an old-school Davis Cup tie in Spain. But of course, we do know better. This is Court Philippe Chatrier: a tennis colosseum of crushed brick surface dominated by one left-handed man from Mallorca for two decades. Nadal had only lost three of his previous 115 matches in this tournament yet the 14-time champion came into this first-round clash ranked 272 places below the fourth-seeded Zverev. In Nadal’s theatre, with the public paying to see one of the greats, the 27-year-old was the favourite. And the first point of this three-hour-plus match, under the roof where the pair had vied so gallantly two years ago, summed up the first set. A routine rally: Nadal’s forehand cross-court to Zverev’s backhand cross-court. In years gone by, Nadal’s heavy weight of shot would overpower all that came before it but here, a limp drop shot into the net almost seemed like an early wave of the white flag. In a flash, Zverev broke Nadal to love. The first set ended with a similar surrender. With Zverev serving for the set, another Nadal drop shot was brilliantly chased down by the younger, fresher player. Nadal applauded his opponent – sportsman first, athlete second – before clapping again prior to a pivotal first serve. Was it still on his mind? The Spaniard quickly missed on his forehand wing and the first set was gone. What was clear from the start here, and has been evident since his return in Barcelona last month, is that Nadal’s powers of yesteryear are waning. He knows it, we all know it. Shots off both the forehand and backhand side regularly failed to pass the service line, triggering Zverev to gleefully gobble up any fresh meat with some booming winners. It took until 68 minutes for Nadal to hit his first ace; an ace which looked like a turning point, as he held serve early in the second and then broke for the first time, celebrating with that iconic leap and pump into the air. But when it mattered most, Nadal, serving for the set, was again broken to love. It was crunch time and, for a moment, we were treated to Nadal’s most authoritative attribute: his extraordinary levels of fight. Sheer grit, scraping and screeching his way across the court, adrenaline pumping as the cacophony of noise reached ear-piercing levels. To a tiebreak they went. A tiebreak Nadal – in his first best-of-five-set match in 16 months – simply had to claim. And again, it’s time to talk about the drop shot. A tactic regularly, naively, persevered with arguably cost Nadal this breaker. One poorly executed on the backhand wing gifted Zverev two set points. The frustration was palpable and at 6-5, a backhand return into the net from Nadal gave Zverev a lead he would not relinquish. Of course, Nadal continued to fight. He won a ridiculous, topsy-turvy fifth game on serve. But he was then broken and despite spirited encouragement from the crowd, the light was fading fast. With that famous forehand inside-out flying long, Zverev was victorious in straight sets. He moves on, in search of major No 1. For Nadal, as per request, there was no heart-wrenching video montage. Instead, just an interview of paradoxes: it felt like the final time, even though he insisted it may not be the final time. Desperate to squeeze every last drop out of a career which has given him, and his fans, the journey of a lifetime, he wants to come back in 2025. Fundamentally, he loves the game, the competition, the battle. The lightbulb has not quite burnt out but it’s flickering, sporadically, and on the verge of a blackout.",

        "content": "....Protesters Notify Party Leaders Of Abure’s Suspension Anti-Julius Abure protesters, who were at Labour Party’s headquarters in Abuja to notifying the party leadership of the confirmation of Abure’s suspension from the party, were on Monday attacked. The attack against the protesters were carried out by an angry mob suspected to be thugs loyal to the National Chairman of the Labour Party (LP), Abure. The protesters, it was gathered were Labour Party supporters from the Edo State chapter, who were at the party secretariat to demand Abure’s removal. Commotion broke out when the anti- Abure protesters stormed the party headquarters in several vehicles holding placards and chanting solidarity songs. As soon as the protesters stepped out of the vehicles, the suspected thugs loyal to Abure swooped on the vehicles with sticks and other objects forcing the drivers to zoom off. A detachment of armed policemen and operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS), however, intervened when the thugs started throwing stones into the nearby Secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, in pursuit of reporters who were convering the fracas. The intervention of the security officials prevented the situation from further degenerating. A police vehicle is currently stationed in between the warring factions. Earlier, leaders of the group of protesters, distributed copies of a letter written to the National Executive Committee (NEC), of the Labour Party by the Edo State Chairman, Com. Ogbaloi K.S.E State Chairman and Secretary, Com. Akhere Frederick, notifying the national body of the confirmation of Abure’s suspension from the party. The letter dated: 24 May, 2024, with reference number: LP/ESO/LP.NEC/2024-351, titled: Ratification of Suspension from the membership of Ward 3, Arue, Uromi, Esan North East LGA, Edo State, reads, “here forwarded to you and for your notification, the ratification of the suspension of Comr Barr. Julius Abure from the membership of Ward 3, Arue, Uromi, Esan North East LGA. Edo State. “The State Executive Council, Labour Party, Edo State, comprising of the State Working Committee, the 18 Local Government Chairmen and the 18 Local Government Secretaries met on the 24′′ of May, 2024, at about 11:00pm, to consider the matters presented on the suspension of Comr. Barr. Julius Abure by his Ward in Arue, Uromi, Esan North East LGA, and the upholding of the suspension by the LGA Excos. “After clinical analysis of the accusation, the Council found them weighty and further ratified and upheld the suspension.”",

        "description": "Kiev has charged 28 officers with desertion and dereliction of duty after their units allegedly fled before the Russian advance Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "The State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) in Kiev has confirmed that dozens of Ukrainian officers in Kharkov Region are under investigation for desertion and dereliction of duty. As Russian forces advanced from the border with Ukraine, Kiev rushed reserves to the newly opened front and accused the local units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine of failing to hold the line. “Given the importance of the proceedings, the best investigators and the leadership of the Main Investigative Department of the SBI are involved in the investigation, and there is a close interaction with the operative units of the SBU,” the agency said in a statement on Monday, referring to the State Security Service of Ukraine. The investigation has the full support of the AFU General Staff as well as regional commands, the SBI added. While the SBI has not offered any further details, the Ukrainian outlet Glavkom noted last Thursday that 28 officers are facing charges of desertion or dereliction of duty. Citing court documents, the outlet identified the suspected unit as the 125th Separate Territorial Defense Brigade. Commanders of that unit brigade, as well as the 415th and 172nd separate rifle battalions and the 23rd mechanized brigade subordinate to it, “allegedly failed to properly organize the defense of positions along the border,” Glavkom reported. During the Russian advance, elements of the named AFU units “abandoned combat positions” in five villages along the border, leaving the second-line units to fight. As part of the investigation, the regional SBI office in Poltava reportedly seized a number of classified military documents, including the communications of the commanders involved and reports on fortifications, manpower, weapons and supplies of their units on May 10, when the Russian operation began. If convicted, the officers involved face up to ten years in prison. The 125th brigade has rejected the accusations, insisting that all of its defenses were ready and that no one fled from their frontline position. Lieutenant-General Arthur Gorbenko, the brigade commander, blamed “individuals on social networks” for spreading misinformation about the AFU preparedness, “or even worse, about the retreat of individual units from the defense lines entrusted to them,” according to a Facebook post . As Ukrainian reserves rushed to the northern front, the Russians advanced in a dozen places elsewhere along the line, capturing the strategically important village of Klescheevka near Chasov Yar.",

        "content": "Google has started adding a new “Account deletion available” to some apps on the Play Store. Last year, Google introduced a new Play Store policy where developers of any app that allows users to create an account also need to provide the option to delete it (both in-app and online). The company announced that these data deletion practices would appear in Play Store listings early this year. According to a report by Android Authority, this new badge has already started showing the Data Safety section of some app listings for a few testers. Apps that will include this new badge will allow users to submit a request to the developer to delete the account and the data associated with the same. Google has been asking developers to include information about app account deletion in their Play Store listings since December 2023. The company has also announced that developers need to comply with the new policy by May 31 or face penalties like app removal. The company’s data deletion policy mandates that developers offer data and account deletion options both within their apps and online. This will ensure that users don’t have to reinstall an app to delete their data or account. Developers also need to disclose if they need to retain certain data for legitimate reasons, such as regulatory compliance. As the enforcement deadline approaches and data deletion badges start showing for some apps, developers should not expect any further extensions. Meanwhile, for the first time in over eight years, Google has increased the maximum price of an app in the Play Store. Announced at Google I/O 2024, developers can now price their apps up to $999.99. However, it is unlikely that many apps will reach this new price ceiling.",

The program will include expert-led workshops, panel discussions, and interactive sessions that will delve into networking opportunities, showcase successful case studies, and focus on skill enhancement. Key learning outcomes of the course include: Associations hold a vital role on the global stage, and adopting strategies focused on impact helps them better support their member communities and actively contribute to broader social, economic, and environmental advancements.",

Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Ash Rose Published: 18:53, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:16, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments A young Manchester United fan got the surprise of his life, when he came face-to-face with his favourite player's family at Saturday's FA Cup Final. The Red Devils put a disappointing season behind them at Wembley by impressively dispatching of Premier League champions and rivals Manchester City and winning the FA Cup. First half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo were enough to see United lift their thirteenth FA Cup and secure European football for next season. Yet, United's victory may not have been the best part of one young fan's FA Cup Final day, after a heartwarming meeting with the match winner's family on the Wembley escalator. In a video shared on social media, it shows the fan wearing the shirt of Mainoo, only to be standing in front of both the Man United midfielder's father and brother. Dad and son are shocked to learn that they are standing with Kobbie Mainoo's family The little fan proceeds to stop eating his crisps to shake the hand of Mainoo's father The Man United midfielder was the club's FA Cup match winner in their 2-1 win over Man City The moment occurred as father and son were travelling down one of Wembley's escalators, and the boy was asked if the player on the back of his shirt was his favourite player. Once the child turns round, the voice behind the camera reveals that Mainoo is his son, much to the total amazement of the father and his son. They are the introduced to the England star's big brother, who can be heard laughing at the response after revealing they are Mainoo's family. The interaction immediately sees the dad ask his lad to 'say hello', at which point he stops eating his crisps, wipes his hands on his jeans and shakes the hand of Mainoo's father. Mainoo rounded off a well-worked Man United mood to put United on their way to victory i It would have been a proud day for Mainoo's father and brother, as they witnessed a sublime performance from the teenage sensation. The midfielder was on hand to finish off a sweeping United move in the first half, putting the finishing touch to Bruno Fernandes' no-look pass to put the Red Devils 2-0 up. The goal proved to be the difference after Jeremy Doku's last consolation, and Mainoo was rewarded by being named man of the match.

        "content": "In 2024, , Big Hit, and The , are creating one of the most rock-solid one-off rap trios. While they do not have a group name, what they have been up to as a unit has been pretty impressive. The California trifecta has been dropping single after single over the month of May. All of them have been released to build anticipation for their forthcoming record As we have stated multiple times now at this point, the album was first teased on May 6. Big Hit, Hit-Boy, and The Alchemist did so by dropping a short trailer on social media. It recreated the obliteration of printers from the film . They then proceeded to pump out , with the most recent one, featuring Hit-Boy's younger sister HitgirlLENA. However, it is not the latest offering now, as that title belongs to the Big Hit-dominated \"Drug Tzar\" (a Russian emperor). On this cut, Hit-Boy's meticulously picks apart a dirty boom-bap beat from Uncle Al. He raps about being the boss and essentially being a drug-dealing kingpin. The tracklist is sadly a third of the way released already, as it will be just 12 songs. However, at least there has not been a miss yet. That is a great indication that May 30 will not be a disappointing day for anyone who decides to check the tape out. What are your thoughts on \"Drug Tzar\" by Hit-Boy, Big Hit, and The Alchemist? Is this the best single from , why or why not? What is your favorite aspect of it? Is this Big Hit's best rapping performance out of all of the promos?

        "content": "Shocking moment Leeds United fans brawl with Southampton supporters after their team's 1-0 loss at Wembley in the Championship play-off final By Arthur Parashar Published: 13:53 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:28 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments This is the shocking moment Leeds United and Southampton fans clashed in ugly scenes at Wembley Stadium after the Championship play-off final on Sunday. Just moments after Southampton secured their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory, a mass brawl broke out between the two sets of fans as they spilled out on to Wembley Way. The riled up supporters were filmed fighting as they exited the iconic stadium and walked towards Wembley Park Tube Station at about 7pm. It was clear tensions were running high in the aftermath of what is regarded as football's most lucrative fixture. Adam Armstrong's strike secured a tense victory for Southampton and crucially earned them an unparalleled £180million payday. In the video, a pair of fans are seen coming to blows as others watch on in shock. One of the men tries to throw a punch but does not make a connection as the rival fan ducks out of the way. The video starts with one fan trying to land a massive punch on a rival but the supporter is able to evade contact In ugly scenes, a football fan was kicked to the floor and left cowering as supporters closed in on him The fan in white was seen trying to calm things down but another tussle broke out beside him The pair then run towards another tussle which has broken out beside them. This time, another fan is dragged to the ground and struck while trapped on the floor. Another group of lads then come over to intervene by dragging the attacker away and punching him in the stomach. Other witnesses - including women - attempted to stop the brawls between the fans seen wearing club colours. One said: 'Stop, stop, stop. Don't do it.' But moments later, another fan strolls up to a rival supporter and punches him in the back of the head. He then sets his sights on another fan and kicks them to the ground. As he is falling to the ground, a second attacker kicks him again, leaving him sprawled out on the floor covering his head for protection. The man filming the 39-second video said: 'This is Wembley for you man? 'F***ing hell mate.' Southampton's Adam Armstrong (right) celebrates after scoring the all-important goal at Wembley Southampton fans, some with their tops off, go wild at Wembley after the Saints were promoted to the Premier League Southampton's captain Jack Stephens holds the trophy aloft after the play-off final on Sunday One onlooker shouts: 'Grow up.' The mood between the two sets of fans could not have been more different after the game. Southampton fans were celebrating after returning to the Premier League following their relegation from the top flight last season. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, a Southampton fan, congratulated the Saints after they secured promotion. Following the victory, Mr Sunak wrote on X: 'We're back' before adding three 'clapping hands' emojis. Leeds United will now remain in the Championship next season after narrowly missing out on a lucrative promotion. The ugly brawl came just 24 hours after Manchester United and Manchester City fans clashed in the streets of London ahead of the FA Cup final on Saturday.

The seven-time Super Bowl winner played the role of doting dad Monday as he took his two youngest children, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11, for a spin out on the water. The former quarterback, 46, shared a video on Instagram of the trio's activities as they made a splash, while Post Malone and Morgan Wallen 's summer hit, 'I had some help,' plays in the background.

The New England Patriots legend also shares an older son, Jack, 16, with ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan, 53, but the budding high school football player didn't appear to be in the clip. The Memorial Day bonding session comes two weeks after Brady admitted that he had some regrets over participating in his Netflix roast. Brady was roasted by a number of high-profile figures - including stand-up comedians, celebrities and ex-teammates - in a live Netflix show earlier this month. A lot of the ruthless material contained jokes about his divorce from Bundchen after 13 years of marriage, which he has admitted didn't go down too well back at home. He revealed that some of the quips 'affected' his kids during an episode of 'The Pivot' with Fred Taylor, Ryan Clark and Channing Crowder. 'I loved when the jokes were about me. I thought they were so fun,' he said. 'I didn't like the way they affected my kids.

'It makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you're naïve.' The former quarterback's children weren't the only ones upset with the roast with Bundchen said to be furious about being the source of the relentless taunting. According to People , B undchen was left fuming at the jokes about her and Brady's former marriage during the special, saying she 'was deeply disappointed by the disrespectful portrayal of her family on Sunday evening's roast show'. 'As always, [Bundchen's] priority is to support her children who were affected by the irresponsible content that was broadcasted,' the insider went on.

        "content": "It’s been several years since the finale of The Big Bang Theory, but fans still can’t get over how the series decided to end Penny’s storyline compared to the series. Throughout the sitcom, , free-spirited, and knew what she wanted. It was no surprise that she fell in love with Leonard and their relationship continued up until the final season. But the finale flipped the script with Penny’s overall stance on not having kids. In “The Procreation Calculation,” Penny tells Leonard she has no desire to have kids, which upsets . She also doesn’t have a problem with him being a sperm donor for Zack. But as the finale approaches, her mindset changes, and she ends up pregnant. Yet, after all of these years, fans still don’t take to this storyline very well. On Reddit, a fan on how the sitcom built up Penny’s strong stance on not having kids, only to chuck it away in the finale. “Anyone else find it odd that they spent a good amount of time establishing Penny simply didn’t want to have children, and then in the finale, she becomes pregnant and all we get for her motivation is Leonard saying ‘yeh well now she does’ – kind of a missed opportunity there to even explore penny’s decision making,” they explained. “Seems weird they did devote a lot of time to Penny not wanting children to then just have Leonard speak for her. Literally, she says nothing about why she decided on having a child.” Another fan was angered by the fact that Penny’s pregnancy storyline wasn’t the first instance in The Big Bang Theory. Bernadette also didn’t want kids but then changed her mind. The same thing happened to Penny. It wasn’t only fans who felt the use of the storyline wasn’t well done. Kaley Cuoco, the actress who played the character, once expressed that . A fan on Reddit explained that the sitcom creators did recognize the rushed storyline. Related: “The writers acknowledge this in the tell-all book. Ultimately what happened was they were trying to fulfill Leonard’s line from episode 1 about them having beautiful and smart babies. But they acknowledged they rushed it and her being pregnant was an ‘unearned’ moment in the show,” they chimed in. In the finale, Sheldon is giving his Nobel Peace Prize speech. He recounts how Leonard said he and Penny would have beautiful and smart children the first day they met. Sheldon’s change of heart causes Penny to shed a tear.

        "content": "AMBALA: Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) Ambala seat candidate Advocate Gurpreet Singh violated the secrecy of the election process by posting a video while voting at EVM compartment on his Facebook. Haryana voted on May 25 in the sixth phase of 18th Lok Sabha elections . The video was posted on Election Day on May 25 at 15:31 pm. The video was posted from a Facebook account named Advocate Sardar Gurpreet Singh Sahota, with display photo of INLD Ambala candidate. In his video post, Gurpreet Singh wrote, “ .” (Ambala is going to make history! With their son Gupreet) It is seen in the video of 17 seconds that a person approaches EVM machine keeping the mobile camera on video recording mode and records the video while vote is being polled to INLD candidate Gupreet Singh at second number on the list on machine. The person who recorded the video shows pressing the EVM button to cast vote in front of Gurpreet Singh’s photo, INLD election symbol spectacles and the display of the same on the VVPAT machine. As per the time of the posting the video, Gurpreet Singh committed the violation of the fair and transparent elections, while the election process was ongoing (7 am to 6 pm). However, during the round of several polling booths in Ambala, it was observed that the district police administration had made tight security arrangements and the voters were asked to deposit their phones at the entrance. However, in the case of an INLD candidate, it seems, a voter managed to enter the polling booth with a mobile and recorded the video of the election process. The bar code number visible on the VVPAT machine recorded in the video is “BVTEQ30053”, which can probably help the administration to identify the polling booth. The video was shared with Ambala returning officer-cum-deputy commissioner (DC) Shaleen, however, the response is yet awaited. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in similar cases of violation of election secrecy, Ambala police had booked Vikram Singh and Vivek Chaudhary of Lalana village, spokesperson of Jannayak Janata Party, under Section 136 of the Representation of the People Act and Section 171-F (punishment for undue influence or impersonation at an election), and Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code at Ambala Sadar police station.",

        "description": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Nine Egyptian men cleared by a Greek court of involvement in a migrant shipwreck disaster remain unfairly held in administrative detention days after they were freed from jail, their lawyers said Monday.",
        "content": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Nine Egyptian men cleared by a Greek court of involvement in a migrant shipwreck disaster remain unfairly held in administrative detention days after they were freed from jail, their lawyers said Monday. A judge in the southern town of Nafplio on Tuesday is expected to hear a legal appeal for their release, the lawyers told a press conference in Athens. “The decision for their detention is not legal, and has no justification,” said Effie Dousi, one of the lawyers. The nine men were among the 104 survivors of an overcrowded fishing trawler that sank in international waters off southwestern Greece on June 14, 2023, en route from Libya to Italy. A total 82 bodies were recovered, but hundreds more people are feared lost in migrant shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea. Greek authorities of being among the trawler’s crew — something the defense denied — and brought criminal charges against them including for people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck. But last week a judge in the southern city of Kalamata after a prosecutor argued that Greece lacked jurisdiction as the trawler sank outside its waters. Greece’s coast guard was widely criticized for failing to prevent the sinking, despite having a vessel close by, and some survivors claimed the trawler foundered after the coast guard tried to tow it. The coast guard strongly denied that. A separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the coast guard’s actions is still underway. Dousi said the nine, who have applied for asylum in Greece, had already spent 11 months in pre-trial detention and should now be at liberty. “These are survivors of a shipwreck,” she said, adding that if the Nafplio court rules against their release, the nine will take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Lawyers said the Egyptians are being held in police cells in Nafplio and Athens, and in a migrant detention center in Corinth, southern Greece. They said police ordered their administrative detention because they have no given address in Greece, lack identity papers and allegedly pose a flight risk. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at",

        "content": "Russia's most modern tank suffers 'disco head' glitch that sees its turret spinning out of control while under fire By Taryn Pedler Published: 18:52, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:08, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Russia 's most modern tank has been seen suffering a 'disco head' glitch that sends its turrets spinning out of control while on the battlefield under fire. The bizarre fault has struck the T-90 tank - a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world.' But the impressive machine has been hit with an embarrassing bug, 'spinning turret syndrome', where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat. The worst example of the flaw came during a battle in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region when Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s. The Bradley's hit the Russian tank with rapid 25mm cannon fire which was expected to cause little damage to the T-90s due to their heavy frontal armour. The Russian T-90 tank was seen spinning out of control due to a bug dubbed 'spinning turret syndrome' Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s (pictured) before it malfunctioned Another piece of footage captured the moment another T-90 began spinning out of control The machine crashed into a tree which stopped the rotating However, after a few hots the tank's turret started rapidly spinning in a clockwise direction meaning the Russian's had no chance of accurately returning fire. In footage of the humiliating incident, the turret was seen rotating in a frenzy without any end in sight until the gun barrel ultimately slammed into a tree which stopped the spinning. Unable to return any fire to the Ukrainian's, the tank's crew fled on foot before the tank was demolished by a Ukrainian first-person view attack drone. The 'spinning turret syndrome' was also seen on another occasion on May 10 after a T-90 came under attack by a series of FPV kamikazes. When the second one hits, the turret begins spinning clockwise before pausing briefly as the crew attempt to get it under control. But to no avail, the rotating starts again and continues until the tank halts and the engine appears to be switched off. In recent weeks, several abandoned T-90Ms have been destroyed by grenades dropped from Ukrainian drones. One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls. This theory says the position of the levers to control the turret mean that someone pitching on to them always causes clockwise rotation. A second theory shared online is that the issue is related to the first control system. The impressive T-90 has been hit with an embarrassing bug where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls The T-90 tank is a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world' Similar to other modern tanks, the T-90's gun has automated aiming which rotates the turret to keep the gun locked on to a target. The theory suggests that the damage to the optics sends a false signal to the fire control system, causing the turret to spin uncontrollably. A third explanation revolves around the tank's defensive suite as the tank has a laser warning receiver which sounds an alarm when the tank is illuminated by a laser on the battlefield. As well as the alarm, the system automatically twists the turret around so the gun is facing the threat and shoots off special flares to confuse laser guidance. But as the sensors are external, any incoming damage may cause a false signal leading to the turrets spinning. A former British Army tank commander, Hamish de Bretton-Gordan told The Telegraph , however, that the problem likely lies with inexperienced crews and poor electronics. He added: 'It's very easy for inexperienced people to become very disoriented in a tank because a tank's hull can move in one direction, the turret could be in another direction and the commander's sight could be in a completely other direction, which is why we get the term 'disco head' because people can easily become disoriented and the tank spins out of control. 'It could also be an electronics failure. Western tanks have a quite sophisticated fire control system, and the Russians don't appear to have got it right'.

        "content": "Kaduna State Governor Uba Sani has flagged off the distribution of farm inputs to 40,000 smallholder farmers under his ‘A Koma Gona’, across the 23 local government areas of the state. Addressing the farming community at the event today (Monday), the governor who expressed delight to be with the farmers said, “agriculture remains the backbone of our economy, providing employment and sustaining livelihoods. Kaduna State is blessed with huge agricultural potential. “Consequently, our administration has come up with programmes and policies to further boost the sector and attract the needed investment for its growth and development. We are taking steps to address key challenges in the sector in order to restore the glory of farming and the joy of rural living. “Smallholder farmers and small-scale agro-processors have been facing difficulties due to the current economic challenges in the country. This category of farmers are very critical in our quest to ensure food security. “It is for this reason that our administration has come up with an innovative programnes “Tallafin Noma – A Koma Noma” as part of our “Sustainable Livelihoods Through Social Interventions and Economic Empowerment” initiative. Under this “A Koma Gona” (Get Back to Farm) component, the Ministry of Agriculture is mandated to target a minimum of 40,000 smallholder farmers and farmers’ cooperatives across the 23 LGAs. “The Tallafin Noma programme includes the distribution of inputs for crop and livestock production. For crop production, improved Maize Seed, Agrochemicals, NPK and Urea Fertilizers are distributed. “Meanwhile, for livestock production (poultry), 30-day-old chicks (broilers) with 4 bags of feeds and drugs are distributed, while 50 jumbo juveniles (catfish) with 2 bags of feeds and drugs are distributed for fisheries. “To boost micro-mechanization of the agriculture sector in the state, power tillers with all the necessary equipment and accessories are distributed to farmer cooperative groups. This is a crucial step towards increasing production and productivity in our farms “Knapsack sprayers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) are also shared with individuals for agrochemical and liquid fertilizer application in their farms. For the agro-processors, vegetable grinders are distributed to individuals, while hammer mills, hauliers and threshers are distributed to cooperative groups as group assets. “These processing machines will add value to our agricultural produce and improve the livelihoods of individuals and groups involved in agro-processing activities,” he said. The Governor therefore called on the benefiting smallholder farmers and small-scale agro-processors to make effective use of the equipment and inputs, saying that the efforts were parts of the administration’s commitment to revitalizing the agricultural sector. Earlier in his welcome address, Commissioner of Agriculture, Murtala Dabo said the Governor’s initiative will not only boost food security in Kaduna and Nigeria, it will also contribute greatly to the Governor’s desire to revitalise the rural economy. Chairman Ikara local government area, Sadiq Ibrahim Salihu expressed profound gratitude to the Governor, saying that, his unwavering commitment to the welfare and prosperity of farmers and agro-entrepreneurs has been a beacon of hope and progress for the people of Ikara and other local governments in the zone. “Under your visionary leadership, initiatives like the Tallafin Noma (A Koma Gona) are making a tangible difference in the lives of our people. Today, as you flag off the distribution of farm inputs, farm implements and agro-processing equipment for the entire Zone 1, the entire nation bears witness once again to your dedication to enhancing agricultural productivity, rural economic resilience and the transformation of the rural communities in the state.” ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

Appreciating his movie stars, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, he continued, \"I was like, 'All these women put in these great performances,' and it's like, the legacy of these women. I was like, 'I literally ruined this movie.'\" Glen Powell how the rough cut took a toll, saying, \"It does get in your own head. People forget that when you're watching the rough cut of a movie, it's probably like watching the footage of yourself that you're having to edit, right? So you sit there and you're like, 'I hate myself.'\"",

        "description": "William Ruto was the first African leader to make an official state visit to the US in 15 years (Picture via State House Kenya)\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nehandaradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/william-ruto-private-jet.webp?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/nehandaradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/william-ruto-private-jet.webp?fit=976%2C549&ssl=1\" />Kenya's President William Ruto has come in for widespread criticism after saying the private jet he used to fly to the US last week was cheaper than using the national airline. He did not, however, say how much the jet had cost, or how much it would have cost on Kenya Airways.The post Kenyan President William Ruto claims private jet to US was cheaper option appeared first on Nehanda Radio.",
        "content": "He did not, however, say how much the jet had cost, or how much it would have cost on Kenya Airways. “The facts that are out in the public do not seem to bear him out,” political analyst Prof Herman Manyora told the BBC. Senior opposition figure Eugene Wamalwa told local media that the president’s remarks were “unpatriotic”. He said the president should instead have used the opportunity to market Kenya Airways. Mr Ruto went to the US on a three-day official state visit – the first such trip by an African leader in more than 15 years. While he was there, Kenya secured a number of investment deals worth billions of dollars. The country was also designated by the US as a major non-North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) ally, cementing its position as one of the US’s closest security partners in Africa. But the use of a luxury jet for the US trip has continued to spark criticism, prompting the president to respond. On Sunday, a day after returning to the country, Mr Ruto defended himself as a “steward of public resources”. “In keeping with my determination for us to live within our means and that I should lead from the front in so doing, the cost was less than travelling on [Kenya Airways],” he said on X (formerly Twitter). Kenya Airways has not commented regarding the cost. But it has dismissed as fake a widely circulated statement that purports to show that using the airline would have been cheaper for the president. Despite his explanation, many Kenyans have criticised the president. Mr Manyora says the president should have explained himself better, to persuade people that it was right to use a private jet. He said the president should have “considered people’s perceptions” and explained the benefits of using a chartered plane, including flexibility, class and security. “I would have expected that kind of explanation, not one that leaves people wondering,” he said. On social media some criticised the president for using an airline owned by another country. “It is a shame as a country if the president can’t use our national airlines, Kenya Airways, because it is expensive,” said Alinur Mohamed., external Calculating the total cost of business class tickets for the president and his delegation, local media report this would have been far cheaper than hiring a jet. The president used a Dubai-owned RoyalJet company to travel to the US, along with an entourage of about 30 people. Hiring such a jet is reported to cost $1.5m (£1.2m) versus the $300,000 estimated cost for business-class tickets on Kenya Airways for the entire delegation. But Mr Ruto told US broadcaster Voice Of America (VOA) over the weekend that the estimated cost of his trip was “completely exaggerated”. He did not respond to a direct question about how much it cost, but said the amounts being “bandied around are ridiculous”. “I’m careful about the resources that I spend,” he added. Last week, government spokesman Isaac Mwaura told the BBC that the “benefits from this visit far outweigh” the costs, without confirming the sums involved. The row comes amid concerns by critics that taxpayers’ money has been used to fund extravagance in government while taxes have been raised on the basis that the state needs extra funding. Mr Ruto has made more than 50 visits abroad since he became president in 2022 – averaging more than three a month. The government has defended the trips as necessary – while pointing to recent directives to cut spending.",

        "content": "Swerve Strickland explains why Floyd Mayweather appeared at AEW Double or Nothing 2024 last night. The AEW Champion defended his title against Christian Cage in one of the main events of the show. Despite interference from The Patriarchy , he fought off attacks from Nick Wayne and Killswtch to retain his title. After the match, Swerve Strickland celebrated in the crowd. One of the people there was Floyd Mayweather. The undefeated boxing legend has previously wrestled at WrestleMania 24 against The Big Show. Speaking at the Double or Nothing 2024 post-show scrum , Swerve Strickland explained how Mayweather’s appearance came about. He revealed that the boxer is a friend of Flash Garments, the company that Swerve recently collaborated with on his signature shoe . Because of this, Mayweather gets free tickets for AEW shows. Swerve has been trying to get him involved for the past two years, and he finally appeared at last night’s show. “Floyd has been a friend of ours, my man Flash Garments over here. He gets a free pass every time he comes to All Elite Wrestling because once again, we’re here to grow to this company and we’re here to bring something to All Elite Wrestling, not just take. We want to give, like if we have opportunities and connections, we’re going to bring them here every single time. And we want to blow this place up, and we want to be the catalysts of it.” “So that’s how Floyd came here. We’ve actually been talking to Floyd for like two years now, like his whole family trying to have him come every time we’re in Vegas. So finally, he was like, ‘Alright. This is the day we’re pulling up.’ So he pulled up and made it to the match. We pulled out a banger in front of him, he’s like, ‘I’m in.’” Two Champs! @FloydMayweather and @swerveconfident ! pic.twitter.com/o5qrnhWpbe This article first appeared on Wrestlezone and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal has lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The capacity crowd...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday. When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him on this afternoon-into-evening match against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. “It’s difficult for me to talk,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"I don’t know (if) it’s going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure.” While Nadal said it's doubtful that he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics' tennis competition will be held at the French Open's site. When Monday's match ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the shouts of his two-syllable nickname echoed. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; indeed, he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances going back to his days as a teenager. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty beige chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player, one coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, he faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with a trademark on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain that level, and soon it was 2-all. Zverev later broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. “The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court during my entire tennis career is amazing. But now I’m 28,” Nadal said, then paused and corrected himself with a chuckle: “Well, no, 38. I would love to be 28!” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around and applaud right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

Kennedy Jr. and nominated activist Chase Oliver for their presidential nominee, according to a party announcement. The nomination comes after the former president and each gave speeches before the crowd at the national convention, making their cases for Libertarian support. Oliver secured the nomination in the seventh round of voting, received nearly 60 percent of the vote, according to . The delegates have selected Chase Oliver as the Libertarian Party’s presidential candidate. — Libertarian Party (@LPNational) “I will continue to bring a hopeful and positive message of liberty to both those who consider themselves libertarian and those who don’t know they are libertarian yet,” Oliver said in his victory address, Fox News reported. Oliver told the Daily Caller that he is “proud to be the voice for liberty as the Libertarian Party’s candidate for president.” He said he and his running mate, Mike ter Maat, “will bring a unifying message of true freedom and liberty to all 50 states, especially to the Gen Z and millennial generations who are exceedingly dissatisfied with the broken two-party system.” The newly-minted presidential contender previously supported Democrats and President campaign, The Guardian . However, he soured on the party due to its support of the wars in the Middle East. In a 2022 post on X, he explained that Obama was the reason he “left the Democrats to find an antiwar party.” Barack Obama, the guy who ran of ending wars (who didn’t and got a peace prize anyway) is coming to campaign for the dems.

He’s why I left the Democrats to find an antiwar party. — Chase Oliver (@ChaseForLiberty) Oliver has been criticized for his stance on issues. He explained his approach to the issue to the Daily Caller. “As with any medical issue, I support autonomy from the government in making personal decisions. I prefer individuals decide the healthcare that is right for them in consultation with a doctor if they so choose, and not leave those decisions to boards of bureaucrats or the politicians who enable them,” he said. The candidate’s platform includes ending involvement in and funding of wars, an Ellis Island approach to in which people without a criminal record would be allowed entry into the country, repealing gun control laws, abolishing the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 and lessening government in the economy to promote a robust free market, according to his .",

Hodgson serves as the general manager of the NFL’s UK office, one of the departments playing a key role in evaluating new venues and hosts for NFL games. France had previously been named as a potential host country in the near future, but the same was not true of Ireland. “There’s a feasibility study, as we would call it, in a number of different European cities and Dublin is one of those,” Hodgson said ( via Laura Colgan of The Irish Times ). “Looking at the stadiums, taking local meetings... we’ll take away all of that information, digest it and determine what the next steps are.” The league has followed a similar process in the past , and that led to agreements with Sao Paulo and Madrid to host regular season games. Croke Park and Aviva Stadium are the venues under consideration in Dublin at this time. The former was the venue for a preseason contest between the Steelers and Bears in 1997, and it has a capacity of over 82,000. The Steelers, a team that has a formal partnership in place with the Gaelic Athletic Association, are among those in the NFL with international marketing rights in Ireland and Northern Ireland. That is also the case for the Jaguars, while the Jets added Ireland this offseason. At least one of those teams would likely take part in a game held there in the future. As of now, the Saints are the only team with marketing rights in France. They would represent a logical candidate to play a game in Paris, one of several sites being considered in some capacity. Sweden and Australia have also been floated as possibilities, although logistics in the latter country in particular are a notable challenge that would need to be overcome relative to those of playing in South America or Europe. “We continue to look at and have interest in all the major cities across Europe,” Hodgson added. “For now, Paris, Dublin – obviously we’re heading into Madrid in 2025 – those are the ones we’re most focused on in Europe.” This article first appeared on Pro Football Rumors and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDollarama (DOL.TO), Emcor Group (EME), and Comfort Systems USA (FIX) are the top three growth stocks for patient investors to buy in 2024.The post Hidden Gems: 3 Growth Stocks That Will Reward Patient Investors Handsomely appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Identifying the best growth stocks for patient investors is a worthy cause. These stocks are typically characterized by their potential to grow at an above-average rate compared to the broader market. While growth stocks can offer enticing long-term growth prospects, it’s crucial to remember that true growth takes time and patience. Moreover, it’s essential to evaluate factors such as revenue growth, profit margins, and cash flows to position these companies for future success. For investors willing to adopt a long-term perspective, growth stocks can be a rewarding addition to a diversified portfolio. Let’s discover the three best growth stocks for patient investors to snap up in May! Dollarama (DOL) Dollarama (TSE: DOL.TO ), a Canadian discount retailer, has carved a niche by offering a wide range of products at competitive prices. The company has thrived since the pandemic as consumers battle inflation and higher interest rates. One of the key factors contributing to Dollarama’s success is its sufficient supply chain management and low prices. The company’s direct sourcing model allows it to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers, ensuring competitive prices for its consumers. Furthermore, over the last decade, the company has offered a more comprehensive range of products, allowing it to compete with big box retailers and grocery stores. In FY24 , Dollarama saw record revenue of $5.86 billion. Comparable sales grew 12.6%, driven by strong operations execution. Additionally, EPS increased 29% YOY to $3.56 per share, with FCF and net income surpassing $1 billion for the first time. Their business model and the compelling, valuable proposition are resonating with customers. This makes DOL stock one of the top growth stocks for patient investors in 2024. Emcor Group (EME) Emcor Group (NYSE: EME ) is a leading provider of mechanical and electrical construction services in a market with significant growth potential. Its expertise in these vital services makes it one of the most compelling growth stocks for patient investors to buy now. Emcor Group has been on an absolute tear over the last five years. The stock has significantly outperformed the broader market, rising 394% as compared to the S&P 500’s 101%. Investors anticipate growth to continue, driven by strong demand for infrastructure projects in the healthcare and technology sectors. Moreover, the company’s growing revenue, earnings, and cash flows are another positive sign for the future. In FY23 , revenue increased 13.6% YOY to $12.58 billion. EPS skyrocketed 64.7% YOY to a record $13.3 per share while generating $711 million in FCF. Management has also initiated strong forward guidance for the 2024 fiscal year. Emcor’s acquisition strategy is working, expanding its geographical reach and enhancing its long-term growth prospects. Comfort Systems USA (FIX) Comfort Systems USA (NYSE: FIX ) is revving up for another strong year in 2024. Their expertise in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) services makes them well-positioned to benefit from the rise in global infrastructure spending. Comfort Systems started off as an extremely small company that only started to hit its stride during the pandemic. The company has seen an acceleration in revenue growth and profitability as demand for HVAC services has increased substantially. Thankfully, their expertise in the fragmented HVAC market and strong brand reputation have led to repeat business. This is something that the company prides itself on, and its focus on energy-efficient HVAC solutions gives it a competitive advantage. In the 2023 fiscal year , revenue increased 26% YOY to $5.2 billion. EPS swelled 32% YOY to $9.02 per share as strong operational execution drove profitability. As demand for sustainable HVAC services continues to increase, FIX stock remains one of the best growth stocks for patient investors to buy in May.

        "content": "Listen to Story Bhavani Revanna, wife of Karnataka MLA HD Revanna, on Monday applied for anticipatory bail fearing arrest in connection with a kidnapping case linked to her husband and son, Prajwal. Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former minister HD Revanna, along with six others, was arrested for allegedly kidnapping of a woman. The case is linked to allegations of sexual abuse against his son and Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna. HD Revanna is currently out on bail in this case. Bhavani approached the court after the Special Investigation Team (SIT) issued a notice for her to join the inquiry. The notice was based on statements from an already arrested accused. Bhavani submitted the anticipatory bail application to a sessions court in Bengaluru, and the hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday. The court has instructed the SIT to file its objections by then. The case was registered following a complaint by the woman's son, who alleged that his mother was sexually abused by Prajwal . After the sexual harassment allegations against Prajwal stirred a massive row in April, the woman was allegedly abducted to prevent her from testifying against the JD(S) MP, according to police. Bhavani's name was mentioned in the complaint. The Karnataka government formed an SIT on April 29 after multiple videos of Prajwal sexually abusing women emerged . On May 3, the SIT arrested HD Revanna's confidant, Sathish Babanna, and subsequently rescued the woman allegedly from a farmhouse in Mysuru on May 4. Hours later, HD Revanna was arrested from his father and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda's residence in Bengaluru. Notably, this development comes as Prajwal Revanna, who left the country after the allegations emerged, said he will be joining the probe on May 31 and will cooperate with the police.",

        "content": "CUSTOMERS are reacting to self-checkout being removed in busy locations, leaving many to wait in long lines for exorbitant times. Target , which recently put in place a strict 10 items or less policy for self-checkout , has recently decided to pull the plug on that experience in one of its most populated locations in the country . Target in Emeryville, California - which serves a majority of the East Bay area , announced early this week that they were removing access to self-checkout altogether, citing a massive increase over the past few years in shoplifting . This is the only nearby Target, for many shoppers in the Oakland area, with the nearest locations being in Albany, Alameda, and Berkeley. Some shoppers, as expected, were not happy with the change and are worried that this will further impact their experience in the store. \"Target be like: we want the checkout experience to be 4 times longer,\" commented one user under the news on X, formerly Twitter. \"Still only gonna have 2 registers open at peak times,\" wrote another. \"We all know damn well there’s still gonna only be one single register open anyway,\" someone else complained . Although there are no official numbers available for this specific Target, the chain did report an overall increase of theft by 120% in the first half of 2023, compared to the same time a year prior. One customer commented that \"the honor system doesn’t work in Emeryville.\" But another user responded that he believes \"the honor system doesn't work in America, period.\" Another suggested that corporations like Target \"have lost their honor.\" \"Why should we be expected to maintain ours?,\" he asks in the post. One person joked that maybe if people keep stealing, it would actually create more available jobs in retail. But others disagreed. \"Nah,\" one replied , \"they’ll still have 2 people running registers while 30 people wait in line.\" Over the last two years, Target cut over 35,000 jobs , or almost 8% of its total national workforce, according to company records. This cut has resulted in a major downsizing in the number of available cashiers in any location Since this change, customers have been complaining all over social media about being forced to wait in long lines with even longer wait times, frustrating those who may only have a few items in the absence of self-checkout. The chain also announced this month that prices of over 5,000 everyday items would be lowered in the store. This decision has led many customers to speculate on social media that Target has been actively price gouging. \"Alternative headline: Target confesses to blatantly price gouging millions of consumers, no penalties expected,\" one viral post said . \"Target was price gouging you to hell while claiming inflation pressure and lost a s**t ton of customers,\" another post read. \"So they’ll return prices to normal and pretend they’re giving you a deal.\" Target has not responded to the U.S. Sun's request for comment.",

        "content": "THANE: Following the announcement of Abhijit Panse as the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) candidate for the Konkan Graduate Constituency , Panse launched a scathing critique of the BJP, accusing the party of failing to deliver constructive projects for graduates. The MNS's decision to field Panse against the BJP is expected to escalate the political contest in the region. The BJP is preparing to field Niranjan Davkhare, the current Member of Legislative Council (MLC), for the same seat. This move by MNS leader Raj Thackeray is seen as a strategic effort to bolster the party's presence in the region and challenge the BJP's dominance. Panse alleged that no significant projects benefiting graduates have been undertaken in the last 12 years. He criticised the BJP for the constituency's lack of development and announced that, rather than a traditional manifesto, the MNS would present a detailed, job-oriented manifesto tailored to the specific needs of the constituency. When asked about the potential for supporting the BJP in this election, Panse stressed that the MNS follows Raj Thackeray's directives. He noted that any decisions regarding alliances would be made by Thackeray himself.

        "content": "Former Dallas Cowboys' second round pick Kelvin Joseph will be remembered as one of the biggest draft busts the front office has recently had after he was considered a second-round steal when the team made the pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. At the time, Joseph was considered one of the best athletes of his class but discipline concerns led to him falling into Day 2, where the Cowboys used their usual approach of making high-upside gambles on players with discipline or injury concerns. Fast forward to 2023, Joseph was traded from the team after he failed to level up amid injuries and off-the-field issues, including being a passenger on a car from which fatal shots were fired during the spring of 2022. After being moved to the Miami Dolphins, Joseph was released in November and eventually landed with the Seattle Seahawks as a practice squad member. These days, Joseph is a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, having signed a futures/reserve deal with the team in January. Fortunately for him, it seems like things are going well and he might just resurrect his playing career with the league's top contender. Below is an excerpt from a recent story from our very own Charles Goldman, which details how Joseph has been turning heads at practice for the reigning NFL champions: On Wednesday's first play of 7-on-7 during practice, Joseph caught Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes pushing the limits. The play resulted in an interception for Joseph, who has worked almost exclusively with the second-team defense to this point of the offseason. However, it's important to remember that workouts are voluntary at this point and players often jump around based on who is in attendance. Still, there was a lot of positive buzz about Joseph coming out of the lone day of practice media have been able to attend thus far. Chiefs team reporter Matt McMullen mentioned his interception in his post-practice observations. KSHB-TV's Nick Jacobs and Chiefs Digest's Matt Derrick also discussed Joseph as a standout during practice on their \"41 Is The Mic\" podcast. \"A very sneaky-good player was Kelvin Joseph,\" Jacobs said. \"Like the guy was all over all over 7-on-7 and team, and he had a lot of deflections and was in good position a lot of the times. And he made that interception on Mahomes.\" Joseph could find his way into the 53-man roster of the team to beat in the NFL. One of his biggest calling cards is the value he provides on special teams and that'll surely go a long way as he competes for a spot on the AFC contender. Watching him play for defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo would be quite interesting as he doesn't shy away from man coverage, which Joseph is built for thanks to his length and physicality.

The 37-year-old Spaniard lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev at the French Open and afterwards said his priority was the Olympics back in Paris. Asked if he would play Wimbledon, an event he has won twice, he replied: 'Looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but for me now looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having Olympics again on clay. 'I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with my team. I need to analyze so many facts. 'But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay, no? Rafael Nadal has admitted he may skip Wimbledon this year to avoid transitioning to grass Nadal, 37, was knocked out of the French Open after losing to Alex Zverev in the first round The all-time great says he is being wary of overexertion after suffering numerous injuries 'Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feelings is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.' Nadal has won two Wimbledon titles among his tally of 22 Grand Slams, having triumphed in 2008 and 2010. He last competed in SW19 in 2022. After reaching the semi-finals, Nadal was forced to withdraw from his match against Nick Kyrgios due to an untimely injury and has not returned since. His latest announcement may mean that Nadal's storied career at Wimbledon is over - with the all-time legend admitting he may be in the midst of his final year on tour. Speaking after his defeat by Zverev, Nadal told the crowd: 'I don't know if it'll be the last time I'm going to be here in front of you. If it is, I have enjoyed it. 'The crowd have been amazing the whole week. 'For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.'

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread by Radboud University Certain invasive exotic species, such as the red swamp crayfish, are harmful to our environment because they nibble on aquatic plants, dig burrows in banks, and transmit crayfish plague to native species. \"But there are also non-native fish and crayfish that are not harmful and do not need to be controlled,\" ecologist Pim Lemmers argues in his Ph.D. thesis, which he will defend at Radboud University on 30 May. The red swamp crayfish has a bad reputation, and not without good reason. \"It really is the worst,\" says Lemmers. \"It walks on land, destroys aquatic plants , and digs into banks, to the detriment of water quality. It is a real problem.\" The spinycheek crayfish, on the other hand, is currently causing far fewer problems in the Netherlands. It does not burrow in banks, although it did in the past transmit crayfish plague, thus contributing to the drastic decline of European crayfish in the Netherlands. For his Ph.D. research, Lemmers studied various exotic species—animal species that do not naturally occur in the Netherlands—and their ecological and socio- economic impact . To do so, he carried out a lot of lab and field work. Armed with a special fishing net and waders, he went into the Meuse, the Rhine, and several of their tributaries. \"We used electro-fishing: an electrified fishing net that allows you to pull fish towards you. As soon as you switch off the current, the fish immediately swim away,\" says Lemmers. He counted, measured and determined the fish he caught in the rivers, and took some specimens to the lab to examine the ratio of stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon in their muscle tissue. \"This data allowed me to deduce exactly what the fish were eating. If an exotic species eats totally different food from a native species , it is probably not causing harm,\" he adds. This method allowed him to carry out a risk analysis and determine which exotic species were dangerous and which not. The bullhead, for example, is not doing so well because of an invasive exotic species. Lemmers explains, \"The bullhead occurs naturally in the Meuse, but it has almost completely disappeared due to competition from the invasive round goby. That is a very nasty exotic fish that can find food very quickly and displaces other fish from their hiding places.\" A very similar fish is the Cottus rhenanus, which has actually been doing well since the 1990s—when the water quality of some streams improved. \"The round goby has not yet invaded the natural habitat of the Cottus rhenanus. This shows that an invasive exotic species can really make a difference.\" The vimba bream is an example of an exotic species that causes little trouble. The ecologist says, \"It used to only occur in the Danube, but has now reached the Netherlands through various canals. It can thrive here, and other fish are unlikely to be inconvenienced by it.\" Lemmers argues that not all exotic species have a negative impact, and we therefore do not need to fight them all. We can even benefit from their presence. Lemmers says, \"The zander was also originally an exotic species that has now completely found its home here. It even plays an important role in commercial fishery.\" Proper consideration of all the positive and negative effects of an exotic species helps the government make decisions on exotic species management. Lemmers' research makes a substantial contribution to this process. Provided by Radboud University",

        "content": "LONDON – Southampton clinched promotion back to the Premier League after a one-year exile as Adam Armstrong sealed a 1-0 win against Leeds in the Championship play-off final on Sunday. Armstrong’s first-half strike at Wembley ensured Southampton erased the bitter taste of last year’s relegation from the top-flight with an immediate return. Victory in football’s single richest match will give Southampton an estimated $178 million windfall due to the increases in matchday, broadcast and commercial revenue for clubs who reach the Premier League. Financial experts Deloitte say Southampton could eventually bank £305 million if they avoid relegation next season. While the cash prize is a huge bonus, it is the prestige of competing with Manchester City and Arsenal, rather than second-tier minnows like Plymouth and Oxford, that fuelled Southampton’s hunger to regain their Premier League status after a year in purgatory. Southampton, whose only major honour is the 1976 FA Cup, had spent 11 years in the Premier League prior to their relegation. In their first ever play-off final, Southampton made it three wins over Leeds this term despite finishing three points behind the Elland Road club in the regular season. Saints boss Russell Martin has become widely admired for his purist passing principles and this was the 38-year-old’s crowning glory. Martin was managing in League One with Milton Keynes Dons just three years ago, but he has transformed Southampton in his first season in charge, to such an extent that they boasted more possession than any team in Europe’s top five leagues this season. “I’m so pleased for the board because I was not an exciting appointment for them. I finished 10th at Swansea, but we had a really clear way of doing things at MK (Dons) and here, so for them to take me on was really brave,” Martin said. “The team have been so brave. I’m really grateful and proud of them. They deserve it.” Securing promotion at Leeds boss Daniel Farke’s expense was a sweet moment for Martin after his Norwich contract was terminated by the German during their time together at Carrow Road in 2018. Defeat was a bitter blow for Farke and Leeds, who were relegated alongside Southampton last season. On the 35th anniversary of the death of their legendary manager Don Revie, Leeds were well below their best in the club’s fourth play-off final loss. After losing their grip on an automatic promotion place that went instead to Ipswich, the three-time English champions remain without a win at Wembley since 1992. Leeds made a fast start but Southampton weathered the storm and snatched the lead in the 24th minute. Armstrong had scored twice in the play-off semi-final win over West Brom and the striker showcased his predatory instincts again with his 24th goal this season. Cleverly eluding the Leeds offside trap with a well-timed run, Armstrong met Will Smallbone’s pass with a superb strike into the far corner from 12 yards. Leeds were rocked and Armstrong nearly struck again from another instinctive shot from Smallbone’s quick free-kick, but this time Illan Meslier was able to parry his close-range effort. Early in the second half, Leeds defender Joe Rodon embarked on a rampaging run that looked certain to end in a goal until Taylor Harwood-Bellis threw himself into a last-ditch block. Leeds pushed hard for an equaliser, but Daniel James’ blast cannoned back off the bar before the winger was denied by Alex McCarthy’s stoppage-time save as Southampton celebrated their return to the promised land.",

        "description": "Lawyers for nine Egyptian men cleared by a Greek court of involvement in a migrant shipwreck disaster say they remain unfairly held in administrative detention days after being freed from jail",
        "content": "Nine Egyptian men cleared by a Greek court of involvement in a migrant shipwreck disaster remain unfairly held in administrative detention days after they were freed from jail, their lawyers said Monday. A judge in the southern town of Nafplio on Tuesday is expected to hear a legal appeal for their release, the lawyers told a press conference in Athens . “The decision for their detention is not legal, and has no justification,” said Effie Dousi, one of the lawyers. The nine men were among the 104 survivors of an overcrowded fishing trawler that sank in international waters off southwestern Greece on June 14, 2023, en route from Libya to Italy. A total 82 bodies were recovered, but hundreds more people are feared lost in one of the worst migrant shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea. Greek authorities accused the nine of being among the trawler’s crew — something the defense denied — and brought criminal charges against them including for people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck. But last week a judge in the southern city of Kalamata dismissed the case after a prosecutor argued that Greece lacked jurisdiction as the trawler sank outside its waters. Greece's coast guard was widely criticized for failing to prevent the sinking, despite having a vessel close by, and some survivors claimed the trawler foundered after the coast guard tried to tow it. The coast guard strongly denied that. A separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the coast guard’s actions is still underway. Dousi said the nine, who have applied for asylum in Greece, had already spent 11 months in pre-trial detention and should now be at liberty. “These are survivors of a shipwreck,” she said, adding that if the Nafplio court rules against their release, the nine will take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Lawyers said the Egyptians are being held in police cells in Nafplio and Athens, and in a migrant detention center in Corinth, southern Greece. They said police ordered their administrative detention because they have no given address in Greece, lack identity papers and allegedly pose a flight risk. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

        "content": "The BCCI had set a May 27 6pm deadline while inviting applications for the post of the head coach to replace Rahul Dravid, who has decided to depart after three and half years in the job. New Delhi: Gautam Gambhir remained the top choice to be India’s next head coach even though neither he nor the Board of Control for Cricket in India spoke about it even as deadline for applying ended on Monday. The BCCI had set a May 27 6pm deadline while inviting applications for the post of the head coach to replace Rahul Dravid, who has decided to depart after three and half years in the job. Reports suggest the BCCI had sent feelers to Ricky Ponting, Justin Langer and Stephen Fleming over the possibility of taking over. But the idea of regular touring with the national team that plays for about 10 months a year hasn’t been appealing to them. It was also the reason forwarded for BCCI primary target VVS Laxman, the National Cricket Academy head, to not show interest. Though BCCI secretary Jay Shah has denied that the Board had contacted anyone or identified a possible successor to Dravid but Gambhir emerged as a suitable candidate after moulding Kolkata Knight Riders to a formidable unit. He took over as mentor before the 2024 edition of the tournament and guided them to their third title, having led them as a player to their earlier two titles in 2012 and 2014. His credentials have only been bolstered after KKR produced a dominating performance to thump Sunrisers Hyderabad by eight wickets in the final. ‘No hurry’ It is believed that there is a shortage of quality options and reports suggest that no overseas coach applied once Shah said preference would be given to someone who is well aware of the domestic structure. “The deadline is fine, but the BCCI brass wouldn’t mind taking some more time before reaching a decision. Right now, the team will be busy with World T20 for the better part of the month of June. “After that seniors will be rested from tours of Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe where any of the NCA-based senior coaches can accompany the team. So what’s the hurry,” a BCCI source was quoted as saying by PTI . Gambhir is currently contracted with KKR and it remains to be seen if he decides to leave the new IPL champions. IPL 2024 coverage",

        "content": "A female American soldier was found murdered inside a locked bedroom in her apartment off the Army base where she served. The body of Private First Class Katia Duenas-Aguilar, 23, was discovered in her residence in Clarksville, Tennessee, by her friend, WTVF reported. Clarkesville detectives who responded to the residence near the border with Kentucky on May 18 ruled her death a homicide. Duenas-Aguilar was stationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade. ‘We are stunned by the death of Pfc Duenas-Aguilar,’ 101st Airborne Division spokesman Lt Col Tony Hoefler told Military.com . ‘In the meantime, we will continue to cooperate with Army and local investigative authorities on this matter.’ Duenas-Aguilar, of Mesquite, Texas, was the single mother of a four-year-old boy. She shared the apartment with another person and was the only victim, police said. ‘We want to know what happened, who did it and we want to make sure that person or people are brought to justice,’ stated her family, according to CBS News . On Saturday, Duenas-Aguilar’s family begged for the public’s help and along with the League of United Latin American Citizens announced a doubling of the reward amount to $55,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Soldier 'beat his 8-month-old daughter dead because she wouldn't stop screaming' US lawmaker’s daughter and son-in-law killed in Haiti serving as missionaries Priest bites woman 'to protect wafer' after denying her Communion Mum mauled to death by pack of dogs while trying to protect her children ‘She would already tell me that she’s not happy over there and I wanted her to come back so we could make more memories,’ said her sister, Cecilia Ruiz-Aguilar. Duenas-Aguilar joined the US Army in 2018 and received her training at Fort Eisenhower. She was awarded two Army Achievement Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Army Service Ribbon. ‘We want to believe that it’s a nightmare that we can wake up and she will still be there,’ Ruiz-Aguilar said. Duenas-Aguilar’ death comes after after three US Marines were found dead inside a parked car at a gas station near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina where they were stationed.

Walton, survived by his wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris, was a two-time NBA champion, winning one title with the Portland Trail Blazers and another with the Boston Celtics . He is also one of the greatest college basketball players of all time, winning three consecutive national college player of the year awards between 1972 and 1974 and two NCAA titles with the UCLA Bruins. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, both on the court and off. After retiring, Walton overcame a stutter to thrive on the microphone, winning a Sports Emmy in 1991 and being named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time in 2009. NBA hall of fame center Bill Walton has died at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer Walton is survived by his wife Lori (above) and his four sons Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris Walton was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers and won his first NBA championship in Oregon Walton (far right) with Celtics teammates Danny Ainge, Rick Carlisle and Larry Bird in 1986 Walton (left) overcame a stutter to thrive on the microphone, winning a Sports Emmy in 1991 'Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. 'As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. 'Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. 'But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. 'I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. 'As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.' His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. Walton's NBA career lasted only 468 games because he struggled with chronic foot injuries NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Walton 'was truly one of a kind' in an emotional statement Walton was selected with the No. 1 pic in the 1974 NBA draft, and won his first NBA Championship with the Trail Blazers three years later. After struggling with those foot problems, Walton's career took off again when he signed with the Celtics in 1985 for two seasons. Alongside Larry Bird, Walton collected his second NBA Championship in 1986. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. 'Bill Walton,' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, 'was truly one of a kind.' 'It ́s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA ́s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,' UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. 'Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it ́s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. 'As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. 'For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It ́s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.' More to follow.

        "content": "The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, has urged members of the National Assembly not pass the Bill mandating the country to revert to the old National Anthem through legislative fiat. LEADERSHIP reports both chambers of the National Assembly had last week expeditiously pass a Bill for an Act to revert to the old Nigeria’s National Anthem – ‘Nigeria, We Hail Thee..’ But, Fagbemi warned that such an important Bill on the national anthem should not be done by legislative fiat. Speaking at the public hearing on the Bill organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters in Abuja on Monday, AGF Fagbemi warned that the issue of National Anthem should not be treated with legislative fiat without giving Nigerians a say. He said as commendable as the move by both chambers of the National Assembly may be, on enacting law on the National Anthem or replacing the current one with the old one, Nigerians must be carried along for their required “buy-in”. The AGF said: “In some cases, the national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration. “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions. “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone. “Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.” In his submission at the public hearing, the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, recommended that the scope should be expanded to include a robust issue on national identity rather than limiting it to mere change of national anthem. The Minister, who was represented by the Director-General of National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem being advocated by the lawmakers, do not make a complete meaning. “The issue of the national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not value national identity, of which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning it and imbibing it,” he said. Also cautioning the National Assembly on the expeditious passage of the Bill into law, renowned lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever National Anthem is proposed and buy into it. According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an Act for general acceptability. He, however, supported the move to replace the current “Arise O Compatriots” anthem with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee” version, which the country started with at independence in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current National Anthem adopted in 1978, does not have the required gravitas and is not inspirational to fire the passion and zeal for nationhood among Nigerians. Nigeria, according to him, will not be the first country in the world to replace its National Anthem with the old one as over 20 countries like Russia, Austria, Chile, France, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq etc, have done so at different times in the past. Other stakeholders in their submissions spoke in preference for the old National Anthem against the current one.",

        "content": "The 2-1 victory at Wembley Stadium secured Manchester United’s place in the Europa League alongside Tottenham Hotspur under the helm of manager Erik ten Hag. However, a potential ownership clash with INEOS, the conglomerate that holds a significant stake in both Manchester United and French club Nice, threatens their participation. UEFA’s stringent multi-club ownership regulations prohibit entities with ownership stakes in multiple teams from competing in the same tournament. With INEOS poised to bolster its investment in Manchester United by an additional £245 million, pushing its ownership stake beyond the 30% threshold, regulatory hurdles emerge. INEOS, led by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, currently holds a 27% stake in Manchester United while maintaining sole ownership of Ligue 1 side Nice. The stakes are high as Nice clinched a fifth-place finish in the French league, securing their Europa League berth for the upcoming season. Should INEOS fail to navigate the ownership conflict satisfactorily, dire consequences await. According to UEFA guidelines, one of the clubs under their ownership could face relegation to the UEFA Conference League, the third-tier European competition. In this scenario, Nice would retain their Europa League status, benefiting from their superior league finish compared to Manchester United’s eighth-placed standing in the Premier League. The intricacies of club ownership and regulatory compliance now cast a shadow over Manchester United’s European campaign, leaving supporters and stakeholders anxiously awaiting resolution.",

        "content": "KC Navarro recently wrestled for TNA Wrestling at Under Siege, as he was a last minute replacement for Rich Swann. The lineup for the show had been changed due to an injury to Alex Hammerstone, who was set to face Jake Something. Swann was put against Something in his place, with Navarro taking Swann’s place against Laredo Kid. In an interview with Fightful ), Navarro spoke about his last minute appearance on the show. He said: “ Oh man, it was great. I mean, originally, you know, I wasn’t even supposed to be a part of that man. I wasn’t going to go. I wrestled Ali. Ali kind of was like, oh, maybe you should come. I was like, oh, maybe, you know, I wrestle like a lot that weekend too. Like I have like a show that following Saturday and the Sunday as well. So I was like, oh, you know, maybe, you know, I’m tired. Cause I’ve been on the go since the last week of February. So like my body, you know, it’s catching up. I’m feeling it. I wanted to be, I want to be a hundred percent for Super Strong Style. You know, I knew it was the pay-per-view that day. So I was like, ah, you know, most of the time it’s pay-per-view. There’s a high chance you’re not doing anything. You know what I mean? Unless you’re doing like a backstage thing. But I know it kind of at this point, it’s kind of hard to make me do a backstage thing with my hair. We showed up late. We showed up late, you know, because we were just going to watch and see everybody. We left to get food for two hours. I walked back in and they’re telling me, get your stuff. You’re wrestling Laredo in the main event of the countdown. I’m like, I just ain’t doing it. I wish somebody told me.
