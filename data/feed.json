        "content": "The Nigerian Senate, on Monday cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. The Senate Committee on Capital Market, chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of all three Executive Commissioners namely: Frana Chukwuogor, Legal and Enforcement; Bola Ajomale, Operations; and Mrs. Samiya Usman, Corporate Services. Agama’s appointment has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1 trillion economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, he was appointed to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth, stressing that “we are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointment by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market,” he added The new DG noted that the commission would implement innovative policies and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Continuing, Agama said: “you must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that,” he stressed.",

        "content": "Cross River State Governor, Senator Bassey Edet Otu, has assured children in the state of his administration’s commitment to develop and drive policies and programs that will nurture and guide them. In a statement to mark the 2024 children’s day celebration made available to newsmen by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Nsa Gill, he quoted the Governor saying, “You are the future of our state and the pillars of our society. Your innocence, creativity, and boundless energy bring joy and hope to our lives. Our responsibility is to nurture and guide you so you can reach your full potential and contribute positively to our state’s growth and development.” Governor Otu maintained that he wants the Children to know that as the Governor, he is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for all to thrive. “My administration’s continuous investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure is to ensure children can access the best opportunities and resources. “Our State is richly endowed in agriculture, and this administration has already taken steps to make agriculture the mainstay of our economy.” The Governor, in his statement, urged the children to continue to dream big and work hard towards achieving their goals. In his words, he said, “Remember that there is no limit to what you can achieve with determination, resilience, and a positive attitude. “I also want to express my gratitude to all parents, teachers, and caregivers who play crucial roles in shaping the lives of our children. Your dedication and love are instrumental in their growth and success. “As we celebrate this year’s Children’s Day, I charge you to remember the less fortunate children in our society and strive to impact their lives positively. “Once again, I wish you all a happy Children’s Day. May you continue to be a source of joy and inspiration to us all. Keep shining bright and making us proud,” Governor Otu concluded.",

        "content": "Some concerned natives of Amichi in Nnewi South Local Government Area (LGA), Anambra State have sought intervention of governor Chukwuma Soludo to end an alleged intimidation and harassment of the community’s traditional ruler, Igwe Dr. Ofobuike Ezeoke by land grabbers. According to them, a certain land the monarch inherited from his father, Igwe Alphonsus, is being dragged by some prominent indigenes of the town who were allegedly bent on using the law enforcement agents and thugs to intimidate him and his supporters, especially his Personal Assistant, Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke. They spoke in a statement signed by their leader, Chief Ogbonna Ogbonna, adding that a High Court in Nnewi had on 14th of May 2024 issued an order restraining some persons from entering the land which the Igwe claims to had inherited from his late father through a Supreme Court judgment believed to have been delivered in November 1961 under Suit No. FSC 27/61. “Unfortunately, the prominent persons had even gone ahead to start selling parts of the land for building an estate. A transporter from the community in connivance with political appointee and others had also contracted a Catholic Bishop to build on the disputed land despite court orders. On Saturday, 18th May 2024, they arrested Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke on trumped up charges and had been dragging him around. “They tried installing another Igwe just to humiliate and oust Igwe Ofobuike but Anambra State government turned them down. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi. “Our Igwe is a peaceful man. He told us that he does not want to waste the blood of any individual in Amichi because of the land regardless of the temptation to do so. He had called on the court to ward off trespass from the land since the Supreme Court adjudged and decreed that it rightly belonged to his father,” the statement alleged. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down because of land. The town has been torn apart because the rich men feel that Igwe Ofobuike should not inherit such massive 6,000 plots of land. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi.",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

More than 300 exhibitors representing brands and businesses from more than 50 countries will be on show from June 11 to 13 at the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Nine countries will have exhibitor pavilions and they include Turkey, Dubai, China, India, USA, Indonesia, Italy, Egypt and Tunisia. In addition, sizeable delegations from UAE, UK, Thailand, Ukraine, Ghana, Algeria, Malaysia, Netherlands and many more will use the show to launch new products into Nigeria and West Africa as well as to meet new business partners. Now in its fifth edition, Food & Beverage West Africa is the continent’s largest food and beverage trade show. More than 6,000 visitors are expected to attend over the three days. The exhibition is organised by BtoB Events. Brad Smith, Exhibition Manager, said: “This year’s exhibition is featuring more exhibitors, more countries and more products than ever. If you are seeking new and exciting products that have yet to be seen in the West African market, then FAB is simply unmissable. “FAB 2024 is bringing even more countries and exhibitors than ever before. Our brand-new USA, China and Italy pavilions are joining our regular pavilions from Turkey, Dubai, India, Indonesia and Egypt. “We are also welcoming exhibitors for the first time from countries such as Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Turkmenistan and Nepal.” The event is recognised for the number and range of overseas exhibitors which attract visitors from the West African region and beyond. “We pride ourselves on the international standard quality that our exhibition represents. It is a unique exhibition where we are bringing the global food and beverage industry to Nigeria, with both exhibitors and visitors attending and all looking to do business within the West African region,” said Smith. One of the international exhibitors, Xena’s Food Group, is a Platinum Sponsor of FAB West Africa. Based in London, Xena’s is a wholesale food distributor specialising in premium-grade fresh condiments, oils and ingredients. The company sees huge potential with the Nigerian market, noting the growing demand here for high-quality ingredients. “FAB West Africa offers a unique opportunity to connect with key players in the food industry specifically within the West African region,” says Mr Kochhar, Head of International Trade. “We believe that this targeted approach aligns perfectly with our goal of expanding our presence in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. We see this event as a strategic platform to showcase our offerings. “Our primary objective is to establish Xena’s Food Group as a trusted supplier of premium food products in the African market. We aim to forge partnerships with distributors, wholesalers, hotels, and restaurants, showcasing our extensive range of high-quality mayonnaises, ketchups, flours, cooking oils, poultry, eggs, and grains.” Another of the international exhibitors is Linc Drinks, also from London, and a manufacturer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Zoryana Slater, Linc Drinks’ Export Manager, is delighted to be coming to Food & Beverage West Africa. “We recognize the immense potential of the African market, particularly Nigeria, and view FAB West Africa as a strategic platform to showcase our premium beverages.

        "content": "Henkel Nigeria, a leading German multinational renowned for its WAW and Nittol detergents in the country, has reaffirmed its dedicated commitment to supporting Nigeria’s industrial development. This commitment comes amidst growing awareness of the potential of Nigeria’s non-oil industry to diversify the economy. This was the focus of discussion during the courtesy visit on Honourable Minister, Dr. Doris Nkiruka Uzoka-Anite, Minister of Industry, Trade, and Investment in Abuja, by the Henkel Nigeria management team, led by Rajat Kapur, Managing Director, Henkel Nigeria, along with Kadir Demirtas, Head of Finance, and other key members of the management team. They met with the minister with the aim of strengthening collaboration and identifying strategies to overcome challenges hindering mutual growth and development within Nigeria’s industrial sector. During the visit, Rajat Kapur informed the Minister of the company’s efforts in driving safety and innovation, promoting Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG), and contributing to the nation’s industrial advancement. Acknowledging the ministry’s crucial role in Nigeria’s industrial promotion, Rajat Kapur highlighted Henkel Nigeria’s eagerness to work closely with the government in overcoming challenges to industrial advancement. He also emphasized the critical need to cultivate an enabling business environment in the country, with a particular focus on facilitating access to forex and ensuring stable energy supply. Kapur highlighted the necessity for policy regulations that would provide relief to manufacturers in the nation, emphasizing this as a prerequisite for bolstering economic growth and sustainability. Rajat expressed gratitude, stating, “We commend your unwavering commitment to upholding standards in manufacturing processes that meet global benchmarks. We are working closely with the government to maintain compliance with regulations and align with government initiatives to propel the economy forward.” He added: “We recognize the private sector’s vital role in national development, aligning perfectly with the Federal Government’s vision for economic prosperity.

        "content": "Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner start French Open with straight-set victories PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek has started her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean. Monday's win stretched Swiatek's winning streak to 13 matches. She put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Jannik Sinner also won in straight sets Monday. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Acuña is placed on IL after suffering a 2nd season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn ACL in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña’s second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris was scheduled to play Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09. Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months.",

        "content": "CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s quest was to complete — if not win — the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson's team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane , and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That's when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. “So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,” Larson said. “I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.” Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson's focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can't participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn't been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting “The Double” was one of the best experiences of his life — right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. “I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream,” Larson said. “I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try ‘The Double’ but if it is I guess it was memorable.” AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to get economic sanctions imposed over it's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing it down. This is all under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader and likely won’t change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. According to the IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further to weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Grossi has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The latest IAEA report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. Iran and the IAEA are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The latest report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. The report said that the IAEA’s request needed to be resolved otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February.

In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.

Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Former soccer player Christian Karembeu, a 1998 World Cup winner with France, says two of his relatives have been killed during the unrest in the French Pacific territory of New Caledonia that has left seven people dead. Speaking during an interview with Europe 1 radio on Monday, the former Real Madrid midfielder said his two relatives were shot in the head by snipers. “I’ve lost family members, that’s why I’ve kept quiet,\" Karembeu said. “Because I’m in mourning.” Asked if these were assassinations, Karembeu replied: “I didn’t want to, because the word is strong, but ... it’s true that, yes, it’s an assassination and we hope that there will be inquiries and investigations into these murders.” French President Emmanuel Macron decided on Monday to lift the state of emergency that was imposed earlier this month. Deadly violence erupted in the French Pacific territory after protests kicked off against the French government’s attempts to amend the French Constitution and change voting lists in New Caledonia. Opponents fear the measure will benefit pro-France politicians in New Caledonia, where pro-independence Indigenous Kanaks have long pushed to be free of France, amid sharp economic disparities. Karembeu, who is Kanak, grew up on the island of Lifou in New Caledonia. After moving to France as a teenager, he went on to win two Champions League titles with Madrid as a midfielder. He started for France in the 1998 World Cup final and was also part of the team that won the 2000 European Championship. New Caledonia became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, Napoleon’s nephew and heir. It became an overseas territory after World War II, with French citizenship granted to all Kanaks in 1957. Karembeu's great-grandparents were shipped to Paris in 1931 from the French Pacific territory and exhibited as “cannibals.” AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "content": "Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "content": "Tornado-spawning thunderstorms that swept the US Southern Plains and Ozarks have killed at least 21 people as of Monday morning across four states and wrecked hundreds of buildings, with forecasters warning of more severe weather. The death toll over the Memorial Day weekend includes at least eight fatalities in Arkansas, seven in Texas, four in Kentucky and two in Oklahoma, according to tallies by state emergency authorities. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early on Monday while the National Weather Service said a severe thunderstorm watch was issued for parts of Georgia and South Carolina until at least Monday afternoon. \"It was a tough night for our people,\" the Kentucky governor said on social media platform X on Monday. He later said in a press briefing that \"devastating storms\" had hit almost the entire state. Officials said 100 state highways and roads were damaged by the storms. At least seven people perished - including two children aged 2 and 5 from a single family - and nearly 100 were injured on Saturday night when a powerful tornado struck communities in north Texas near the Oklahoma border, Governor Greg Abbott said at a Sunday news conference. Late on Sunday, Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the state had at least eight deaths after the storms. A resident in Arkansas suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease died due to lack of oxygen when the power went out. Hundreds of thousands of Americans faced power outages on Monday due to the weather, according to the PowerOutage.US tracking website, with Kentucky alone having over 180,000 outages. In some areas, restoring power could take days, Beshear, the Kentucky governor said in a news briefing on Monday. The National Weather Service warned of additional storms moving through the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, bringing damaging winds, large hail and more tornadoes, as well as heavy downpours capable of triggering flash floods. The latest extreme weather came just days after a powerful tornado ripped through an Iowa town, killing four people, and more twisters touched down in Texas last week. Meanwhile, the US was preparing for what government forecasters have called a potentially \"extraordinary\" 2024 Atlantic hurricane season beginning June 1. Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike. Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, a confidential report by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said Monday. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6201.3 kilograms (13671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1489.8 pounds) since the last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In its current report, the IAEA also said Tehran has not reconsidered the agency's September 2023 decision of barring the most experienced nuclear inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program but added that it expected Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the Agency and Iran.” The IAEA also said that the deaths of Iran’s President and Foreign Minister in a helicopter crash have caused a pause in the UN nuclear watchdog’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. In its current report, the IAEA said that Iran suggested in a letter dated May 21 that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’.” Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Iran and the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog are still negotiating over how to implement a deal struck last year to expand inspections of Tehran’s rapidly advancing atomic program. The IAEA's acknowledgment shows the challenges his inspectors face, years after the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers and the wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Saeed Jalili, the representative of the Iranian leader in the Supreme National Security Council, confirmed his intention to run in the presidential elections scheduled for June 28, to choose a successor to late President Ebrahim Raisi. The Fars new agency reported that Jalili told four deputies from the city of Mashhad that he seriously intends to join the electoral race. The politician was a candidate in the previous elections, but withdrew in favor of Raisi. The Iranian hardliner will be the first candidate in the early elections, following the death of Raisi in a helicopter crash, on his way back from a trip to the Azerbaijan border. Jalili was responsible for the nuclear negotiations when he was Secretary-General of the Supreme National Security Council under the rule of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The powers of the negotiations were then held by the Council before they were transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after former President Hassan Rouhani came to office in 2013. Confirmations of Jalili running in the elections came the day after statements made by his ally, Ahmadinejad, whose candidacy was rejected by the Guardian Council in 2021, and before that in 2017. Ahmadinejad told a group of supporters on Saturday that he was mulling whether to run for president or not. The Nournews agency, the platform of the Supreme National Security Council, expected that Ahmadinejad would submit a request to run for the presidency, “even though he is sure that the Guardian Council will reject his eligibility to run again.” The conservatives are also discussing the possibility of nominating two generals in the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), Mohsen Rezaei and Saeed Mohammad, in addition to the Speaker of Parliament, Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, as well as the Mayor of Tehran, Ali Reza Zakani. The Tasnim news agency pointed to the potential candidacy of Parviz Fattah, who heads the Imam’s Implementation Committee, which reports to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s office, as well as the Minister of Roads and Urban Development, hardliner Mehrdad Badrbash, who has close ties to the IRGC. Other media reports stated that the supporters of former reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, are pushing towards the nomination of one of the following political figures: former diplomat Mohammad Sadr; Majeed Ansari, Rouhani’s Vice President; Reza Ardakanian, Minister of Energy in Rouhani’s government; and Ali Akbar Salehi, former head of the Iranian Atomic Organization and former Foreign Minister. A passenger bus crashed into vehicles on a highway in southern Türkiye, killing at least 10 people and leaving 39 others injured, officials said Monday. The accident occurred in the province of Mersin late on Sunday, when the bus veered into the opposite lane in heavy rain and crashed into two cars. A truck later slammed into all three vehicles, Gov. Ali Hamza Pehlivan told reporters. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and at least eight of them were in serious condition, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported. There were 28 passengers on board the intercity bus, which was traveling from the southeastern city of Diyarbakir to Adana, in the south of the country, Anadolu reported. Protesters demanding the resignation of Armenia's prime minister on Monday blocked main streets in the capital city and other parts of the country, sporadically clashing with police. Police said 196 people have been detained in Yerevan. Protests have roiled the country for weeks, sparked by the government's return of four border villages to Azerbaijan. The demonstrations are spearheaded by Bagrat Galstanyan, a high-ranking cleric in the Armenian Apostolic Church and archbishop of the Tavush diocese in Armenia’s northeast, where the returned villages are located. Although the villages were the protests' rallying point, they have expanded to express a wide array of complaints against Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government. Top figures in Gastanyan's Tavush for the Homeland movement told a huge rally in Yerevan on Sunday that they support Galstanyan becoming the next prime minister. The decision to turn over the villages in Tavush followed a lightning military campaign in September, in which Azerbaijan’s military forced ethnic Armenian separatists in the Karabakh region to capitulate. After Azerbaijan took full control of Karabakh, about 120,000 people fled the region, almost all from its ethnic Armenian population. Ethnic Armenian fighters backed by the Armenian military had taken control of Karabakh in 1994 after a six-year war. Azerbaijan regained some of the territory after fighting in 2020 ended an armistice brought on by a Russian peacekeeping force, which began withdrawing this year. Pashinyan has said Armenia needs to quickly define the border with Azerbaijan to avoid a new round of hostilities. Italy said on Monday Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians in Gaza were no longer justifiable in one of the strongest criticisms Rome has made so far against Israel's campaign. \"There is an increasingly difficult situation, in which the Palestinian people are being squeezed without regard for the rights of innocent men, women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas and this can no longer be justified,\" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto told SkyTG24 TV. \"We are watching the situation with despair.\" Latest Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens. Israel said the attack was aimed at a Hamas compound, though its top military prosecutor called it \"very grave\" and said the army regretted any harm to non-combatants. Crosetto said Italy agreed in principle with the Israeli response to the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas gunmen on southern Israeli communities, but he added that a difference had to be made between the group and the Palestinian people. On Saturday, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani met Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa in Rome, reiterating their support for a ceasefire and urging Hamas to release Israeli hostages. Italy has repeatedly said that Israel had a right to defend itself from Hamas. Last week, Rome said an International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to seek an arrest warrant for Israeli leaders was \"unacceptable\". Iran's acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country's new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week's helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran's new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi's time in office, noting that Iran's crude oil production— a key source of hard currency for the country — climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the US' unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen's Houthis as Israel's war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Leaders from South Korea, China and Japan reaffirmed their goal of a denuclearized Korean peninsula Monday, during a rare summit at which they also agreed to deepen trade ties. The summit brought together South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Seoul for the countries' first trilateral talks in nearly five years, partly due to the pandemic, but also once-sour ties. While North Korea was not officially on the agenda, hours before the leaders met Pyongyang announced that it would soon put another spy satellite into orbit -- a move that violates rafts of UN sanctions barring it from tests using ballistic technology. At a joint press conference, Yoon and Kishida urged Pyongyang to call off the launch, with the South Korean leader saying it would \"undermine regional and global peace and stability.” Yoon also called for a \"decisive\" international response if Kim went ahead with his fourth such launch -- aided by what Seoul claims is Russian technical assistance in exchange for Kim sending Moscow arms for use in Ukraine. But China, North Korea's most important ally and economic benefactor, remained notably silent on the issue, with Premier Li not mentioning it during the briefing. In a joint statement issued after the talks, the countries used language that has been deployed many times before to reaffirm their commitment to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", adding that peace \"serves our common interest and is our common responsibility\". - Differences - As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear tests and supported sanctions aimed at curbing its weapons development. In recent years, as China's relations with the United States have deteriorated, it has increasingly obstructed Washington-led efforts to impose stricter sanctions on the North. China has consistently supported calls for the denuclearization of the entire Korean peninsula. South Korea does not have nuclear weapons, but is protected under the US nuclear umbrella, and Washington has deployed nuclear-armed submarines to the South in a show of force against the North. In recent years, Beijing has pointed the finger at US-South Korea joint military drills, saying that they escalate regional tensions. The press briefing in Seoul and the joint statement \"clearly showed the difference of opinions\" between the three countries, said Asan Institute research fellow Lee Dong-gyu. Reaching a quick consensus on how to handle Kim Jong Un's regime was always going to be difficult \"because there have been differences in diplomatic and security positions in each country\", Lee told AFP, while also noting rising geopolitical tension between the United States and China. Even so, the fact that Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are seeking to ramp up trilateral cooperation and boost economic ties is good sign for future agreements on more difficult topics like Kim's nukes. \"If the three countries do well in (economic cooperation), they can cooperate on security issues based on that foundation,\" he added. - Trade ties - The three countries announced Monday that they would arrange \"discussions for speeding up negotiations for a Trilateral FTA\", and boost three-way cooperation, including holding summits on a regular basis. China's Li also said they had agreed on not turning \"economic and trade issues into political games or security matters, and rejecting protectionism as well as decoupling or the severing of supply chains\", Xinhua reported. Li serves as premier under China's top leader, President Xi Jinping. After their talks, Yoon, Li and Kishida joined a business summit aimed at boosting trade between the countries, which was also attended by top industry leaders. Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully launched its first reconnaissance satellite last November in a move that drew international condemnation, with the United States calling it a \"brazen violation\" of UN sanctions. Seoul said on Friday that South Korean and US intelligence authorities were \"closely monitoring and tracking\" presumed preparations for the launch of another military reconnaissance satellite -- which could come as early as Monday, according to the launch window Pyongyang gave to Tokyo. A group of Russian engineers has entered North Korea to help with the launch preparations, Yonhap reported Sunday, citing a government official. \"North Korea might feel compelled to launch this satellite this week rather than next week, followed by missile launches into the sea off the east coast to garner outside attention,\" said Choi Gi-il, professor of military studies at Sangji University. \"One key factor will be the weather conditions for the launch.\" North Korea has notified Japan it plans to launch a rocket carrying a satellite between May 27 and June 4, the Japan Coast Guard said on Monday, drawing a swift warning from Seoul and Tokyo not to go ahead with what they called an illegal move. The South Korean government said later the North had issued a notice of a military reconnaissance satellite launch. If successful, it would be Pyongyang's second spy satellite in orbit, Reuters reported. The notice came ahead of a trilateral summit between Japan, South Korea and China in Seoul, where the South Korean and Japanese leaders demanded that the launch plan be scrapped, saying it violates UN Security Council resolutions. Officials from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held phone talks in response to the notice and agreed that a North Korean satellite launch using ballistic missile technology would violate UN resolutions, Japan's Foreign Ministry said. The officials agreed to demand that North Korea cancel the planned launch, the ministry said in an email. South Korea said separately that the \"so-called military reconnaissance satellite launch\" would be a provocative act and a serious threat to regional security. \"Our military will be taking measures that show our strong capabilities and will,\" South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Lee Sung-jun said at a news briefing, without elaborating. Later, the Joint Chiefs said about 20 aircraft, including F-35 stealth fighter jets, conducted attack drills in airspace south of the no-fly zone along the inter-Korean border. The North Korean notice included navigational warnings for areas in the Yellow Sea and east of Luzon Island in the Philippines, the Japanese coast guard said, where stages of the rocket are planned to drop. North Korea launched its first military spy satellite in November, putting it in orbit after two earlier failed attempts in 2023. The country claimed the satellite had taken surveillance photographs of the US White House, the Pentagon and South Korean military installations, but it has not published any pictures. North Korea has vowed to launch three more spy satellites this year. It rejects the UN Security Council resolutions banning its satellite launch as infringing on its sovereign right to self defense and space exploration. The successful launch in November came after the leaders of North Korea and Russia met at a space launch facility in the Russian Far East, where President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would help Pyongyang build satellites. While Arab and Muslim American voters supported President Joe Biden in five key battleground states in 2020, a New York Times-Siena College poll released last week shows that Donald Trump led Biden 57-25. However, these results are unlikely to provide a definitive picture of the decisive voting trends in the November election campaign. Surprises might emerge in the coming months, especially on the Gaza war, the most controversial issue among Muslim and Arab voters. Officials in Biden's Democratic campaign have welcomed the decline of the “uncommitted” protesting the President in the primary election votes. Last February, an exit poll of 527 Muslim voters who participated in Michigan’s presidential primary election showed that 94 percent voted “uncommitted” in protest to Biden’s support for the Israeli government’s war in Gaza. However, this percentage dropped dramatically in Nebraska, Maryland and West Virginia. Biden won 90 percent of the votes facing his challenger Dean Phillips in the Nebraska congressman’s home state, while Trump beat Nikki Haley with slightly over 80 percent in the state’s Republican primary. In Maryland, 10 percent of voters statewide checked the “uncommitted” box and Biden won the majority of the 90 percent. The exception was in West Virginia where the former president captured 88 percent of the vote there. Amid indications of a decline in the “uncommitted” campaign protesting Biden, press reports said Trump is making a strategic pitch to Arab Americans who feel betrayed by Democrats in the war between Israel and Gaza and the Middle East in general. Now, as the election nears, some Arab American donors and activists are considering not just sitting out the race, but working outright to elect Trump. The Washington Post said that in a private meeting last week in Michigan, Trump’s surrogates did their best to bring them into the fold. On Tuesday, a group of Arab American donors and activists from around the country convened in Oakland Hills, Mich., for a private dinner initiated by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell. Grenell, who declined comment, is not a formal member of the Trump campaign. But Trump has recently referred to him as “my envoy” and he is seen as a contender for a top national security position if Trump prevails in November. Tiffany Trump’s husband, Michael Boulos, and his father, Massad Boulos — a Lebanese business tycoon — also attended. The dinner is one of many being organized by Trump’s associates with Arab American leaders in several battleground states. It’s not at all clear Trump would be better for Arab Americans. During his first term, he implemented multiple policies the community disliked, including arbitrary immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cutting funding for humanitarian aid for Palestinians. There’s good reason to think Trump would be even more supportive of the Israeli government than Biden. Meanwhile, Democrats are betting on a decline of the “uncommitted” campaign against Biden between now and November, in case his administration exerts efforts to stop the war in Gaza, release hostages and prisoners from both sides, and offer a concrete path to resolving the conflict. But the fact that this opening even exists for a pro-Trump Arab American movement should be a wake-up call for the Biden team particularly that the entire presidential race has been decided by a few votes in five swing states, some of which are home to a large number of Arab and Muslim communities.",

        "content": "TINY home enthusiasts Kathlyn and Lincoln took a break from their small Los Angeles space after 10 years. Soon enough, they found themselves missing the tiny space and sought to find a smaller Idaho home that suited their simple needs. Kathlyn and Lincoln hunkered down for ten years in a 400-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles . Putting together the money they saved, the couple built their dream home at 1,600 square feet. Though the vintage bungalow in Boise, Idaho was beautiful, it didn't quite suit the couple like the tiny space they once knew and loved. Setting out to find another dainty dwelling of their dreams, they prepared to make a move with the help of the Home Made Nation show, Tiny House Nation . In a YouTube video of a season three episode, they sought to reclaim their old lifestyle back with a budget of $125,000. Kathlyn and Lincoln visited three tiny homes in the Boise area before settling on a 200-square-foot space made entirely out of bales of hay. The rustic cottage is adorned with stained-glass windows and ceilings made of barn siding, complete with a secluded brick patio. While storage was sparse in the bedroom with only a wardrobe and shelving on either side of the bed, the couple figured out a seamless hack for the kitchen. What Kathlyn described as a \"basically perfect\" addition to the kitchen, the pot rack allows the couple to save loads of space. Pots and pans hang above appliances on a metal and wire oval rack, in a streamlined fashion. \"I love the kitchen,\" said Kathlyn. \"For 200 square feet, this is really big.\" But they weren't exactly both on board with the tiny home from the start. \"200 square feet is teeny tiny,\" said Lincoln. \"It's not just tiny . . . we're on top of each other. For me, I don't know if that's going to work. Beyond size, the two were most shocked by the bathroom which separates from the bedroom via a single curtain and is just mere feet away from the bed. The tiny dining room turned out to be a bother for both of them as well. Tiny homes have skyrocketed in popularity, but there is still a lot of confusion surrounding them. Technically speaking, tiny homes are between 100 and 400 square feet, according to Realtor . Legalities surrounding tiny homes vary from based on location. It's important to check local ordinances to ensure that tiny homes are legal and built to code. A family of four was told they had to leave their tiny home after four years after the city found them violating housing laws . But they eventually agreed to make do with the space on the grounds that it \"had character to it\" and that workarounds could be made, especially concerning the small bathroom and sleeping quarters. A 550 square foot grass lawn gives the couple room to potentially plant a garden and host guests. By the end of the episode, the two even planned to invite Lincoln's mother over for Thanksgiving to cook in their tiny home. In time, Lincoln plans to upgrade the kitchen's appliances and opt for a larger sink. One homeowner built a tiny home for his mom in his backyard for just $10,000 despite having no experience . Plus, it only costs $1 per year to build tiny homes on this San Jose land.",

        "content": "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — A North Korean rocket carrying its second spy satellite exploded midair on Monday, state media reported, after its neighbors strongly rebuked its planned launch. The North's official Korean Central News Agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket,” with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff later said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said. Japanese Prime Minister’s Office earlier issued a missile alert for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch. The alert was lifted soon after. Japan’s NHK public television earlier reported that an image captured by a camera in northeastern China showed an orange light in the sky and then an apparent explosion a moment later. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia. Monday's launch came hours after the leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative military action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region.

But while over 20 potential suspects at both the Post Office and Fujitsu have already been identified, decisions on whether charges will be brought are unlikely before 2026, The Guardian first reported . And while the police have already asked for extra funding from government to the tune of £6.75m to fund the huge operation, investigators are yet to be recruited to staff the probe, it added. Scotland Yard's Commander Stephen Clayman said in a statement: ' We understand the widespread and devastating impact the Post Office IT Horizon scandal has had on hundreds of sub-postmasters across the country. Ex Post Office boss Paula Vennells broke down in tears while giving evidence to the inquiry Ms Vennells struggled through a press pack on her way into the hearing for a three-day grilling Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance founder Alan Bates talks to the media outside the inquiry 'The Met began a criminal investigation in January 2020 focused on offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice. 'A team of detectives has been painstakingly working through millions of documents manually and with the help of specialist software, in parallel with the Public Inquiry. 'This is very time consuming and we cannot cut corners and risk missing evidence. 'Given the significant scale of the investigation, it has been agreed by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) that the next phase of the investigation will be a national policing effort, coordinated by the Met, with the pursuit of justice at its heart. 'We do not underestimate the seriousness of the task at hand and we are determined to carry out a full investigation with independence, precision and integrity.' Perjury and perverting the course of justice have been been identified as possible offences in a scandal which resulted in more than 900 Post Office operators being prosecuted for theft, fraud and false accounting between 1999 and 2015 due to the faulty Horizon software wrongly making it look as though money was missing from their branches. And while many had to wait decades to clear their name - or even died before they could see it happen - the further wait for any potential criminal trials is due to police having to take into account the full conclusions of the inquiry before finally handing over their files of evidence to prosecutors. The inquiry says it plans to issue its report in 2025, and the police will need until the following year to complete their work, they say. Even if the CPS do bring charges, there will then be a further wait for any charges to reach trial. Last week, form er Post Office boss Paula Vennells wept while giving evidence at the Horizon inquiry after insisting that she 'loved' the company. Read More JAN MOIR: Paula Vennells' tears (for herself ) provoked about as much sympathy as acid rain... The shamed 65-year-old also told the hearing in London that there are 'no words' that will make the 'sorrow and what people have gone through any better'. Ms Vennells - who insisted she 'worked as hard as I possibly could' - broke down in tears today, after doing the same on the first day of her evidence on Wednesday . She became emotional as she told the inquiry: 'I loved the Post Office, I gave it... I worked as hard as I possibly could to deliver the best Post Office for the UK. 'What I failed to do was I failed to recognise ... the imbalance of power between the institution and the individual. I let these people down - I am very aware of that.' But Ms Vennells was accused of being in 'la-la land' and responsible for her own downfall during questioning by Edward Henry KC. Also last week, MPs finally approved a Bill to quash the convictions of theft, fraud, false accounting and other offences against sub-postmasters, and scrub cautions frmo their records. The Bill will apply in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, affecting those who were prosecuted by the Post Office, Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) or Northern Ireland authorities in the years 1996 to 2018. The Scottish Parliament will pass its own law to a similar effect north of the border, because of Scotland's distinct legal system.

        "description": "More than 30 members of the British parliament want the UK to recognize Morocco’s sovereignty claim over Western Sahara Read Full Article at RT.com",
        "content": "A group of lawmakers from the UK Parliament, including the House of Lords, has written to British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, demanding immediate recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over North Africa’s coastal Western Sahara region. In a letter dated May 23, more than 30 MPs declared that a plan put forward by Rabat deserves Britain’s “unequivocal” support because it is the “only solution” to the ongoing conflict over the sparsely populated former Spanish colony, which Morocco annexed nearly five decades ago. “Such support aligns with our principles and international commitments. It would not compromise our position in the British Overseas Territories, and it can contribute ultimately to peace in this vital region,” the group of parliamentarians stated. The North African country has been locked in a decades-long conflict with the Sahrawi people, led by the Polisario Front movement, which fought a 15-year war for independence before agreeing to a fragile, UN-brokered ceasefire in 1991. The annexation of Western Sahara also strained relations between Morocco and its neighbor Algeria, which has for long backed the autonomy of Western Sahara. Rabat has, however, insisted that limited autonomy is the best political solution it can offer the territory, where just over 550,000 people live. In April 2007, Morocco submitted its Autonomy Plan for Western Sahara to the UN Security Council. According to the proposal, Rabat intends to delegate administrative, legislative, and judicial powers to local residents while retaining the Moroccan flag and currency. Morocco would also be in charge of the phosphate-rich region’s foreign policy, security, and defense. Rabat has been engaging many countries, including African neighbors, to gain support for the plan, which US Secretary of State Antony Blinken hailed at the time as “serious, credible, and realistic,” despite the Polisario Front rejecting it. To date, only Israel and its ally the US officially recognize Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara. Last month, Western Sahara’s Information Ministry accused France of being in “flagrant violation” of international law over an alleged plan by Paris to finance projects in the disputed Sahrawi regions through the French Development Agency (AFD). The ministry denounced the move as a provocative step. On Thursday, the group of British lawmakers described Rabat’s proposal as a “realistic and pragmatic approach,” asking the UK’s leadership to recognize that following “the example set by our main allies,” including the US and France, in backing Morocco is “indeed the right course of action.” “This would also be consistent with our trade agreement with Morocco, which covers the Western Sahara,” according to the group’s letter. “Remaining neutral or attempting alternative resolutions can only perpetuate a harmful status quo that jeopardizes the security of the region,” it added.",

        "description": "Attorney Trudy-Ann Russell has won her appeal against a ruling by the General Legal Council that she was guilty of professional misconduct over retainer fees charged to process the sale of a property in Kingston.",
        "content": "Attorney Trudy-Ann Russell has won her appeal against a ruling by the General Legal Council that she was guilty of professional misconduct over retainer fees charged to process the sale of a property in Kingston. The Court of Appeal ruled that the disciplinary committee of the GLC erred in its April 2022 conclusion that Russell violated the canons of professional ethics by charging fees that were not fair and reasonable and departed from the retainer agreement with the complainant. \"On the termination of the agreement by the complainant, the appellant was entitled as a matter of contract law and under the termination clause, to depart from the fixed fee provision and to charge fees on hourly basis,\" noted the unanimous judgment handed down on May 17. \"...It is difficult to see on what basis her conduct in this regard could be reasonably deemed, beyond a reasonable doubt, to rise to the level of conduct which would bring dishonour to the dignity of the profession,” it added. The court, comprising Justices Frank Williams, David Fraser and Kissock Laing, who wrote the judgment, set aside the fines that were imposed by the committee and ordered the GLC, which was the respondent, to pay Russell's legal costs. The disciplinary committee had fined Russell $200,000 and ordered her to pay costs of $50,000 to the GLC and costs of $50,000 to the complainant. She was represented by attorney Hadrian Christie, instructed by HRC Law. King's Counsel Sandra Minott-Phillips and attorney-at-law Jamaiq Charles, instructed by Myers Fletcher & Gordon, represented the GLC. The GLC is the regulatory body for the legal profession in Jamaica. A complaint was made to it by Sheldon Richards who owned a property with his sister as tenants in common. He wanted the property sold and the proceeds shared equally with his sibling. Richards reported that on September 22, 2020, Richards and Russell signed a retainer agreement for her to pursue the sale. On his instructions, she filed a claim in the Supreme Court on October 27, 2022, to get an order for the sale of the Kingston property. But Richards became dissatisfied with Russell's service and sent a letter in November 6, 2020, indicating that he was terminating her legal services. He requested a detailed invoice of the work done and a refund of unused monies. Russell responded with a letter dated November 9, 2020, attaching an invoice in the amount of $935,000, of which $600,000 was stated to be due and owing. The services were calculated at the billable rate of $25,000 per hour based on the termination clause of the contract. Richards reported the matter to the GLC. The disciplinary committee had a hearing and later found that the arrangement between the attorney and the complainant was that she should charge a flat or fixed fee of $300,000, plus disbursements. If the effort to get an order for sale of the property went to trial, there would be an additional fee of $250,000. The committee ruled that Russell was not entitled to use the termination clause to charge for time spent from the inception of the retainer agreement, even though the complainant had terminated the retainer suddenly. Russell filed several grounds of appeal, one of which was that the committee erred in finding that the termination clause of the retainer agreement for charging an hourly rate was inapplicable. The GLC's attorney conceded that there is no clear legal authority that there is anything in principle prohibiting the inclusion of a provision in the terms of the termination clause allowing for an hourly rate to be charged. But she argued that the inclusion of the clause created an inconsistency with the fixed-term provision of the agreement and that where there is a conflict, the court should prefer the word of the complainant over that of the lawyer's. But Court of Appeal said that \"with the greatest of respect\", the disciplinary committee erred in finding that because the fixed fee was earned by the time of the termination, the termination clause which allowed for a reassessment of the fees on a hourly basis could not be triggered. \"In effect, the committee has implied a term, in the form of a proviso, that the termination clause shall not take effect and the appellant shall not be at liberty to charge on a time spent basis if the appellant has already earned the fixed fee at the time of the termination of the retainer agreement,\" Justice Laing wrote. Laing further noted that with the retainer agreement terminated before the order for the property sale was obtained, the full amount of the fixed fees had not yet been earned and the lawyer was entitled to use the termination clause to calculate her billable hours. Justice Laing said the conduct of the lawyer should be assessed in the context of the purpose of the termination clause, from the perspective of the appellant. “Even if, for the sake of argument, the committee was correct that the termination clause did not permit the appellant to charge on an hourly basis, such a construction would not necessarily have been patently obvious to the appellant. Therefore, if she arrived at an alternative conclusion, she would have acted based on her flawed interpretation of the termination clause, in respect of which there is room for reasonable disagreement between legal minds, as the result of this appeal has patently demonstrated,\" the appeal court said. “In such circumstances, her (Russell) departure from the terms of the agreement would not be egregious or negligent...” the court ruled. The court said it was of the view that Russell acted based on the termination clause of the retainer agreement and concluded that \"there is no basis to find that she engaged in conduct unbecoming of the profession\". The appeal was heard on November 14, 2023. - Barbara Gayle Follow The Gleaner on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

        "description": "Philip Chancey — who stands accused of swindling two investors out of more than $350,000 in fraudulent deals involving electric vehicles and used cars — won't see a courtroom until April 2025.",
        "content": "Philip Chancey, a Mount Pearl man who stands accused of swindling investors out of more than $350,000 on fraudulent business deals, won't see the inside of a courtroom until April 2025. Chancey's trial on two fraud charges was set to begin next Monday but it has been delayed due to the health of his lawyer, Don Powell. Citing \"new evidence\" coming to light, Chancey had filed an application to delay his trial that Crown prosecutor Deidre Badcock had planned to oppose during a hearing Monday morning. After learning of Powell's health issues, however, she consented to the delay as long as Chancey promised to waive his right to a speedy trial. Chancey, on speaker phone in the courtroom, said, \"Yes, your honour\" when asked if he was OK with the deal. The next available dates were not until next April. Chancey is accused of taking money from two investors in 2015 and 2016. In one case, tradesman Jerome Groves says Chancey took more than $50,000 from him for the rights to open an electric vehicle dealership. Jerome Groves said he thought he stumbled across the deal of a lifetime when he met Philip Chancey. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC) In the other, a terminally ill Clarenville man named Tom Drodge gave Chancey his entire life savings — about $300,000, according to his wife — for a similar promise involving an electric vehicle dealership. No actual business materialized in either case. He was charged in 2021 over the allegations involving Groves and in 2023 over the allegations involving Drodge. Both cases were combined into one trial. Court freezes assets of Mount Pearl businessman accused of fraud Mount Pearl man accused of swindling $300K from family over vehicle business In a statement to CBC News in 2019, Chancey said he was just a businessman who had suffered some bad breaks. \"I have over the years tried to work and establish various business opportunities. Yes, some failed, I admit this,\" he wrote. \"Throughout the country, numerous people have tried and failed. I am one of them. The key is to never give up.\" CBC Investigates profiled Groves's claims in 2019 and discovered a list of other complaints that did not result in criminal charges. Chancey was accused of taking $1 million from global leasing giant Cox Automotive, $600,000 from auctioneering firm Lyon & Sons, and $400,000 from Hickman Automotive. Court records also showed Chancey had been been taken to small claims court at least a dozen times, for amounts between $375 and $7,752. He's incorporated businesses in Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia going back to the 1980s. The most recent one — Twenty Twenty Capital Corporation — was incorporated in St. John's in 2020. While it was listed as not being in good standing in 2023, public records show Chancey filed annual returns for the past three years in January to get the company back in good standing.

        "content": "Charles Leclerc's stunning win at the Monaco Grand Prix could be seen as a big moment in the season and the race where an F1 title race ignited. Leclerc was dominant on home soil as he converted pole position into a sixth career F1 win, his first since the Austrian Grand Prix in July 2022. With Max Verstappen finishing down in sixth, Leclerc reduced his deficit to the Red Bull driver to 31 points after eight events, which raises the question of whether a title race will emerge. Ferrari took 32 points out of Red Bull in Monaco after Carlos Sainz took third and Sergio Perez crashed out, so they trail the reigning world champions by 24 points in the constructors' championship. Leclerc says he's not thinking about the championship yet and was keen to celebrate Ferrari's second win of the season, paying tribute to his father who died in 2017. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"It's an amazing feeling. I've always said Monaco would have an added value emotionally but I did not expect it to be that much,\" he told Sky Sports F1 . \"Two to three laps from the end I got out of the tunnel and I was struggling to see because my eyes were starting to cry a little bit! F1 in 2024: The full race schedule Get Sky Sports F1 Stream Sky Sports on NOW Listen to the Sky F1 podcast \"I was like 'come on Charles, you cannot afford to do that now. You have two or three laps to do'. Then I was fine again. Then crossing the line, I was so incredibly happy. It means so much to me. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"It's the race I have dreamt of winning since being a child. I got the passion for racing from this race, together with my father, who did everything for me to get there. \"My mum was there under the podium, along with my brother, girlfriend and friends. Everyone is here which makes it so special.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Leclerc was outperformed in the early part of the season by Sainz but he's started and finished ahead of his Ferrari team-mate in the last four events. The 26-year-old is seen by many in the paddock as the fastest driver over one lap and he showed that in Monaco in qualifying on a track where the driver can make a big difference. Team principal Frederic Vasseur says Leclerc has a \"weight lifted off his shoulders\" now he's won his home race. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"I think one of the characteristics of the winners is also that they are used to win at one stage and they have the confidence to manage the situation,\" Vasseur added. \"Even when something happens they have the self-confidence, 'it's okay, that I will manage it next time'. When you are in doubt, it's a big difference and I think from this one, you will do a step forward for sure. \"I think this one will help him a lot, for sure, in terms of confidence.\" Ferrari challenged Red Bull for the title in the first half of 2022 before their championship hopes faded away as they were outdeveloped and made mistakes. Leclerc and Verstappen have gone head-to-head throughout their careers, first in karting, then in F1, with many memorable battles. Vasseur suggests Red Bull will make errors if Ferrari and McLaren continue to push them hard in the coming races. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"I don't want to draw any conclusions on this weekend, but if you have a look on the last two or three weekends, I think Max made more mistakes in Imola or went out more in Imola than over the last three seasons,\" said Vasseur. \"I think that as soon as they have to push more, if you stay in your comfort zone for the strategy, you don't do mistakes and I think they were in this situation. \"Now we don't have to draw any conclusion that I think they will be back, they will be back soon and they will be strong,\" he continued. \"I'm not considering at all that everything will be easy until the end.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sainz, who missed the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix due to appendix surgery in March, sits in fourth place in the drivers' championship and is 62 points adrift of Verstappen. Sainz thinks Ferrari are on par with McLaren but still \"one or two tenths\" off Red Bull on permanent circuits that are not street tracks. Stream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW. \"I think Ferrari we will have our opportunities in these sort of tracks (street circuits). I think McLaren will have their opportunities, but when I talk about a normal track we can talk about maybe a Barcelona,\" said Sainz. \"Canada, I think is quite specific but a Barcelona or any European truck, where I consider it to be a normal track, I still think Red Bull will be favourites, but I don't think they'll dominate like they used to do. \"And I think that's good news for the championship. It's just worth being within a tenth or two in qualy, that even if they're favourites, they cannot afford to do any mistakes. And that's where both Ferrari and McLaren, we can capitalise, which is a position that in Bahrain, no one was there to be there.\" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player At the start of 2023, Vasseur took over Mattia Binotto as Ferrari team principal and has made a positive impact on F1's most famous outfit. Vasseur made changes to the Ferrari strategy team and most recently decided to change Leclerc's race engineer from Xavier 'Xavi' Marcos Padros to Bryan Bozzi. Leclerc, who worked with Vasseur in his debut F1 campaign in Sauber in 2018, lauded his team boss and the confidence he's given Ferrari. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player \"I think since the first day he joined, he's got everything to bring back the team to where it belongs and that means to a world championship,\" said Leclerc. \"He's got such a clear vision of what he wants to achieve and how to achieve it. He doesn't lose time and that is definitely his strength and I think his vision is really good. \"We share it very often, on how he wants to achieve those targets. I've always been completely aligned with the way he wants to change things to get to where we want to get. I have no doubt that he's the right person and that he's helping the team to get there.\" Formula 1 leaves Europe for the final time before the summer break as the championship moves on to Montreal for the Canadian Grand Prix.

        "content": "Early voting got under way in South Africa on Monday, kick-starting what could be a historic election week, with the ruling African National Congress’ majority on the line for the first time. More than 600 000 of the elderly and infirm, along with essential workers, police and prisoners, deemed unable to come to the polls on Wednesday were allowed to vote first. Bookmark The South African website’s Elections 2024 hub for the latest news you need to know In the Yeoville Recreation Centre in Johannesburg, early voting proceeded slowly but smoothly, according to Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) presiding officer Pamela Nkosi. Only four of the 200 people registered to vote at the station had been processed by 11:00, two hours after polls opened, but half a dozen more were waiting. Nkosi said: “We are expecting the turnout to build as the day goes by.” Philemon Makweng, a 62-year-old retiree wrapped up in a hat and sweater against the cool winter morning, has voted in every election since 1994, but was pleased for the chance to turn out early this year. “I am avoiding the queues of those youngsters who are coming on Wednesday, they push us,” he told AFP. Winning streak The rest of South Africa’s 27-million-strong registered electorate will be called on Wednesday, and opinion polls point to the ANC falling under 50 percent for the first time in 30 years of democracy. If left with no absolute majority in the 400-seat National Assembly, President Cyril Ramaphosa will have to negotiate support from other parties to return to power and maintain the ANC’s winning streak. Full results are not expected before the weekend. Steven Gruzd, a political analyst at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), said it was “an extremely important election for South Africa”. “It is the seventh one since the democracy came in 1994, and... the ANC is under enormous pressure,” he told AFP. “It achieved 57 percent in the last national elections but all the opinion polls say that it will drop considerably – and most of them say below 50 percent.” Under South Africa’s post-apartheid constitution, MPs are elected on a party list system, and the executive president is chosen from among their number in a vote by the Cape Town-based parliament. If the ANC has fewer than 201 seats out of 400, Ramaphosa would have to negotiate with opposition parties and independent MPs to secure a majority and return to government headquarters in Pretoria. After three decades in power as the lead party of the anti-apartheid struggle, the ANC finds its record under attack. Criticised for soaring crime and unemployment, accused of overseeing corruption and rolling power cuts, Ramaphosa’s government is beset by both the liberal right and the radical left. The centre-right Democratic Alliance (DA) has vowed to “Rescue South Africa” by rolling back the ANC’s race-based economic empowerment programmes and to boost growth through privatisation and deregulation. From the left, he faces two groups that split from the ruling party, former president Jacob Zuma’s uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) and former ANC youth leader Julius Malema’s Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF). Crime and poverty Some analysts predict that the ANC will shore up its numbers through patching up its differences with one or both of the MK party and EFF, while others – like Gruzd – expect an alliance with a group of smaller parties. There are 52 political groups in total on the national ballot that could in theory contribute seats to a new narrow majority. This would be a historic evolution in the country’s democratic journey, and many South Africans turning out for Monday’s advance voting seemed hungry for change. Lulama Mayeki, 59, will work as an impartial election clerk on Wednesday, so she came out on Monday to perform her own civic duty, telling AFP that it was the first time she had changed party. “Hopefully they will bring a big change,” she said. “I trust that they will fight crime, poverty, overcrowding.” By Garrin Lambley © Agence France-Presse",

        "content": "Bhubaneswar: BJD supremo and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik today campaigned for the ruling party in Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur ahead of the last phase Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in Odisha. The Chief Minister launched scathing attack on BJP nominee Baijayant Panda while addressing a public meeting under Kendrapara Lok Sabha constituency. Panda had been elected to the Lok Sabha from Kendrapara seat twice on BJD tickets in 2009 and 2014. He, however, left the BJD and joined the BJP ahead of the 2019 Parliamentary elections in the country. “I had made Panda an MP but he betrayed me and the people of Kendrapara. He had served his own interests and that of his company during his tenure as a Parliamentarian,” said the Chief Minister. The BJD supremo also lambasted the Opposition parties for spreading ‘lies and misinformation’ among the voters. Patnaik highlighted various schemes of the BJD government including Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana (BSKY), Mission Shakti, Mamata, LAccMI, KALIA, Madhu Babu Pension Yojana and scholarship for students while urging people to vote for the ruling party in the twin polls. He talked about the Jagannath temple heritage corridor project in Puri while seeking people’s support. Patnaik also highlighted the free electricity promise made by the BJD in its poll manifesto. “There will be no electricity tariff from this July. The BJD government will provide free electricity to people in its sixth term,” he said. Speaking at the meeting, 5T chairman and Patnaik’s trusted aide, VK Pandian, too criticized the BJP nominee for Kendrapara Lok Sabha seat. “Panda had spread lies about the Chief Minister’s health in the past. Panda, as an MP, was working for the benefit of his company,” Pandian said. The 5T chairman claimed that the Chief Minister is committed to the overall development of Kendrapara. “Patnaik was instrumental in bringing big investment projects to Kendrapara,” he said. Speaking at public meetings in Jagatsinghpur, Pandian urged the voters to vote for the BJD and make Patnaik as the Chief Minister of Odisha for the sixth time in a row. “The BJP leaders are using distasteful languages towards our Chief Minister. You all should give befitting reply to them by casting your votes in support of the BJD candidates in the polls,” Pandian said.",

        "content": "KOTTAYAM: Another death due to lack of treatment. An elderly tribal man named Chellan of Mele Bhoothathan Ooru is the one who died. He died at Thrissur Medical College. Two days ago Chellan was found unconscious in the forest. After first being taken to Kottathara Hospital, he was later shifted to Thrissur Medical College. Chellan was shifted to the medical college from the Kottathara hospital after four hours. His transfer to the medical college was delayed due to the non-availability of an ICU ambulance in Attapadi. Last day, a man who was injured because a tree fell on top of an auto-rickshaw that was running in Attapadi, had died after the treatment was delayed for three hours. Faisal (25), a native of Ommala, died when he was brought to the Tribal Taluk Specialty Hospital in Attappadi Kottathara. The explanation is that his transfer to another hospital for specialist treatment was delayed due to the lack of an ambulance with ventilator facilities. Both ventilator-equipped ambulances in Kottathara have been out of order for months. An ambulance was brought from Ottapalam and Faisal was taken to Vattambalam Hospital in Mannarkkad but could not be saved. Relatives of the injured patient and the hospital authorities had waited for the ambulance for more than three hours. The incident today was followed by this.",

        "content": "Conor Daly’s month of May had everything a veteran driver doing a one-off race didn’t want, with a persistent absence of speed from his No. 24 Dreyer & Reinbold Racing/Cusick Motorsports Chevy and, on occasion, mechanical issues that added to his mounting frustration. Taking the start from a distant 29th on the grid – well behind teammate Ryan Hunter-Reay in 12th – Daly and the DRR/Cusick team took an aggressive approach to the 200-lap contest and committed to an alternate pit strategy that would, if the caution periods fell their way, propel the No. 23 Chevy towards the front of the field. More IndyCar! Team Chevy conquers all at Indy McLaughlin drained after giving it his all at Indy Foiled double ‘one of the most disappointing’ days for Larson Fortune smiled on this son of Indiana who charged hard throughout the 500-mile race and led 22 laps along the way for the lone Indy-only team in the field. Daly’s run to 10th wasn’t his best finish at the Speedway; he took sixth in 2022 for Ed Carpenter Racing, but considering the circumstances at Dennis Reinbold’s part-time program, the result was a big deal as he outran his former boss Carpenter, his replacement at ECR, and entire teams like Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, among others. “I’m super pumped,” Daly said after picking up 19 positions in the race. “So thankful to Polkadot and Chevrolet for working with us. We’ve had some trials and tribulations over the last week and a half, and we knew we were faster than where we started and we proved it. We got up front thanks to great strategy from Dennis and the crew. “I love running at the front of this race. For what we had and the time we’ve spent together in this car, we have to be super proud.”",

        "content": "Coldplay saved their best surprise for last when the band brought out Sabrina Carpenter during their closing show at Radio 1’s Big Weekend Festival on Sunday. Carpenter joined the band for a performance of the Ghost Stories track “Magic.” “We’ve been playing this, one Big Weekend since we were basically children,” Martin told the crowd before introducing Carpenter. “And the reason we play one Big Weekend is because without Radio 1, we would never have kept our jobs.” Martin continued: “What we’d like to do, to say thank you to you for being so wonderful for the whole three days is bring on a singer who’s much younger, more beautiful, more successful, better in every way, and sing a song of ours that is okay but make it really good.” Sabrina took the stage to a massive round of applause before harmonizing with Martin on the chorus. While the crowd was surprised by the unexpected duet, Martin did subtly tease the collaboration earlier in the show. While performing “Fix You,” the singer closed out the song with a nod at Carpenter’s “Espresso” by singing the viral hook “That’s that me espresso.” Along with “Magic,” the band — composed of Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, and drummer Will Champion — played familiar tracks for a chorus of singing fans on Sunday, including “Viva La Vida,” “Higher Power,” and “Paradise.” Trending The Boos Have It.

During her “Nonsense” outro, which she usually saves for a three-line sexual innuendo, the singer alluded to BBC’s censorship of an earlier live session in February 2023. “BBC said I should keep it PG/ BBC I wish I had it in me/ There’s a double meaning if you dig deep,” she said.",

Louis, who is from Houston, said he is always seeking out new creative ideas and draws his inspiration from the world around him. “Me and my friends we like to go out and look at just anything that inspires us. So, we’re walking around, we’re looking at the structures of buildings and we’re looking at the fashion,” Louis said. “We try to pull from a lot of different things.” The 29-year-old, who goes by “B-boy Jeffro” in the breaking world, said he is excited for people to see breaking in the spotlight. “I think it’s going to be a mind-blowing moment to see breaking on the stage,” Louis said. Louis most recently took home a silver medal at the 2023 Pan American Games. The first qualifying event for breaking took place in Shanghai earlier this month. The final qualifying event will take place from June 20-23 in Budapest.",

        "content": "Former President Trump and Manhattan prosecutors are gearing up to make their final pitch to a jury before beginning deliberations over whether to convict Trump for a hush money scheme that led to charges of falsifying business records in New York. Both sides will deliver their closing arguments on Tuesday, attempting to weave together testimony from 22 witnesses into a narrative they each believe will persuade the 12 New Yorkers in their favor. Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees the trial, has warned jurors that closings could extend into a second day. “In a case like this, which is a rather long case, summations will not be quick,” Merchan told them. The jurors will return to the courtroom a full week after witness testimony concluded . Merchan reluctantly excused jurors early last week until after the Memorial Day holiday, lamenting to the lawyers he had never given such a long break. “Unfortunately, the calendar is what it is,” the judge remarked. When the trial does reconvene Tuesday morning, New York state law prescribes that Trump’s lawyers will deliver their closing argument first. Trump attorney Todd Blanche previously told the jury that they would be left with “plenty” of reasonable doubt at the end of the trial and swiftly acquit the former president on all charges. “He’s cloaked in innocence,” Blanche told the jury. “And that cloak of innocence does not leave President Trump today. It doesn’t leave him at any day during this trial. And it won’t leave him when you all deliberate. You will find that he is not guilty.” Many legal experts doubt all 12 New Yorkers would unanimously agree to acquit Trump, suggesting the defense will instead be inclined to hope for a lone holdout who could create a hung jury, which would end with Merchan declaring a mistrial. “If I were advising defense counsel, I would say don’t go for an acquittal,” said John Coffee, a Columbia Law School professor who closely follows the case. “You can talk about it, but really emphasize on getting a hung jury, making a speech to each juror that it is your duty, regardless of what others tell you, to decide for yourself,” he continued. To do so, much of the defense’s strategy has relied on attacking Michael Cohen , prosecutors’ star witness who made the hush money payment at the center of the case, portraying Trump’s then-fixer as a serial liar. Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records that accuse him of covering up Cohen’s $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels by disguising reimbursements to Cohen as a monthly retainer fee. Trump pleaded not guilty and denies any wrongdoing. Cohen arguably provided the most damning testimony against Trump of any witness, saying the former president was informed about the hush money arrangement and the repayment scheme at every turn. The defense did knock a few punches, highlighting his past admission to lying under oath, insinuating Cohen had lied about a key phone call with Trump and having Cohen acknowledge he stole from the Trump Organization. Catherine Christian, a former Manhattan special assistant district attorney now in private practice, called those blows “minor hiccups” for the prosecution but said she expects the defense will return to them. “Whoever is going to give the summation is going to call Michael Cohen a liar, a thief, you can’t trust him, vindictive, hates him, wrote a book called ‘Revenge,’” said Christian. The defense could also return to their primary witness, Robert Costello, a former legal adviser to Cohen who contested Trump’s involvement in the hush money deals and an alleged pressure campaign on Cohen to not flip when federal investigators closed in on him in 2018. But Costello’s appearance quickly turned chaotic, leading the judge to clear the courtroom as he lambasted the witness for improper decorum. The jury was removed before that admonishment, but they did observe some of the witness’s audible reactions. “It’s going to be heavy, heavy, heavy on horrible, horrible Michael Cohen — that will be the defense, and it’ll be interesting if they even mention Costello,” said Christian. The defense has previewed several other strategies they may also raise: the hush money payment was intended to prevent embarrassment to Melania Trump, not the campaign; the 34 allegedly falsified records were truthful; and prosecutors didn’t prove Trump had an intent to defraud. After they finish on Tuesday, the Manhattan district attorney’s office will get one last chance to rehabilitate Cohen, who they called as their 20th and final witness. Coffee, the Columbia Law School professor, said the strategy lessens Cohen’s role by having earlier witnesses carry the load of explaining the purpose of the alleged conspiracy. “The prosecution will be emphasizing that Mr. Cohen’s testimony overlaps with most other witnesses ... It’s like a jigsaw puzzle, he is the one piece that fits and makes everything else consistent,” said Coffee. It’s a theme prosecutors have regularly emphasized to jurors as they watched the roughly four weeks of testimony and examined dozens of emails, text messages, phone records and other documents. “After all of that evidence is in, we’ll have a chance to speak to you again during closing arguments,” prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors at the start of the trial. “My colleague, Joshua Steinglass, will go through all of that evidence and explain that it, inescapably, leads to only one conclusion: Donald Trump is guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree.”",

        "content": "Former President Trump and Manhattan prosecutors are gearing up to make their final pitch to a jury before beginning deliberations over whether to convict Trump for a hush money scheme that led to charges of falsifying business records in New York. Both sides will deliver their closing arguments on Tuesday, attempting to weave together testimony from 22 witnesses into a narrative they each believe will persuade the 12 New Yorkers in their favor. Judge Juan Merchan, who oversees the trial, has warned jurors that closings could extend into a second day. “In a case like this, which is a rather long case, summations will not be quick,” Merchan told them.

        "content": "Elevator pitch IHG’s InterContinental Bangkok Sukhumvit might not be Bangkok ’s first InterContinental property, but its stellar location—in the heart of Thonglor, one of the city’s most vibrant neighbourhoods—sets it apart instantly. Enter the hotel and you’ll be greeted by lavish furniture and upscale design, while a quiet sense of place is introduced through the use of Tor-mue , an intricate hand weaving technique traditional to Thailand . This new property reflects IHG’s recent brand evolution, which sees the hospitality group moving towards more guest-centric features tailored to the modern luxury traveller. This begins in common spaces—such as a dedicated concierge gallery where you’ll get to tap on the staff’s cultural knowledge to plan a customised itinerary—but also extends into every aspect of your stay. The stay The hotel offers a total of 241 rooms, the most comfortable of which are the suites—with their spacious living rooms, cosy bedrooms and the comfort of a bath with a walk-in rain shower. Luxurious amenities from Byredo complete the experience, setting you up for utmost comfort after spending a day out in Bangkok’s brutal summer. Here is where you are first introduced to IHG’s Sleep Well programme, designed to help travellers adopt healthy night-time rituals. Each guest receives access to Timeshifter, a jet lag app which uses the latest circadian science to help users adjust quickly to new time zones. But even if you’re flying in from closer by, good sleep is priceless in making the most of your holiday. To that end, an in-room sleep kit includes a pillow and pillow spray menu, calming ambient lighting and a bedtime tea set. An iHome PowerClock Glow in each room uses light and sound therapy to further enhance your shut-eye. Waking up to breathtaking city views through the floor to ceiling windows in your suite gets you ready for the day ahead. The itinerary As a frequent traveller to Bangkok, what I look for in a hotel here can be summed up in one word: location. I want easy access to the city centre while still having the freedom to explore my neighbourhood, and InterContinental Bangkok Sukhumvit strikes this balance perfectly. Chic cafes (we recommend Cos Café, which serves up refreshing fruit-infused espresso concoctions) and upscale restaurants dot the streets of Thonglor, while the nearby BTS station (a five-minute walk away) puts you three stops from the Em District, a cluster of chic malls filled with concept stores from the hottest brands in fashion , beauty and lifestyle. EmSphere, the latest addition to the shopping district, is a megamall where you could easily spend your entire getaway. From a myriad of local Thai fashion label pop-ups to a Club 21 flagship, this mall is a fashion-lover’s playground that will make it hard to leave. For something more educational, Bangkok Planetarium is five minutes away, and offers interactive exhibits and captivating shows on the mysteries of space. Closer to home, the The Spa by Harnn is a gorgeous sanctuary of rejuvenation , located right next to the infinity pool and well-stocked gym. Indulge in a full body massage after a full day of exploring Sukhumvit’s vibrant streets, and your feet will thank you. The dining It’s Bangkok, so you are certainly spoilt for choice when it comes to food. You might be tempted to order in a deliciously spicy bowl of wagyu krapow from Phed Mark (the double-yolked duck egg is mandatory) or head to EmSphere to try Thong Smith’s flagship hotpot restaurant, but the hotel itself offers plenty of options for the days when you just want comfort and exemplary service. Enjoy a continental dinner at Ava Brasserie, a well-appointed European restaurant inspired by Pan Am’s key destinations including London, New York, Tokyo, Miami, Frankfurt and Bangkok. The Lobby, meanwhile, is a stylish all-day lounge that offers divine brews, ranging from authentic Thai blends to a traditional Japanese green tea ceremony. A hidden highlight is the executive lounge, reserved only for guests staying in the suites. In this sun-filled enclave, tuck into a sumptuous breakfast of Asian and international delights, as you take in the view of the city—building anticipation for the day of exploration to come.

Biden was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at Arlington National Cemetery for the annual ceremony before delivering remarks to an audience of current and former service members. Austin took part in the the annual tradition just three days after he had to temporarily pass on his duties to have a medical procedure at Walter Reed Medical Center. It came as millions across the country paid tribute to the men and women who have served and were filled fighting for their country. Donald Trump marked Memorial Day with a Truth Social post tearing into 'human scum' that's 'working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country'. President Joe Biden paid his respects to fallen service members on Memorial Day by laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier He wrote: 'Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country, & to the Radical Left, Trump Hating Federal Judge in New York that presided over, get this, TWO separate trials, that awarded a woman, who I never met before (a quick handshake at a celebrity event, 25 years ago, doesn’t count!), 91 MILLION DOLLARS for “DEFAMATION.” 'She didn’t know when the so-called event took place - sometime in the 1990’s - never filed a police report, didn’t have to produce the “dress” that she threatened me with (it showed negative!), & sung my praises in the first half of her CNN Interview with Alison Cooper, but changed her tune in the second half - Gee, I wonder why (UNDER APPEAL!)?

Biden reflected on the loss of his own son Beau as he delivered remarks honoring military members at the auditorium at Arlington. 'I know how hard it can be. It brings you back to the exact moment you got that phone call, heard that knock on the door, or held the hand when the last breath was taken. 'I know, it hurts. 'This week marks nine years since I lost my son, beau. Our losses are not the same. He didn't perish in the battlefield. He was a cancer victim next to being a burn pit.

'Others who stood against communism in Korea and Vietnam.' 'They made the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan and Iraq. Who signed up to defeat terrorists, protect our homeland after 9/11. 'Decade after decade, tour after tour these warriors fought for our freedom and the freedom of others. 'Because freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in battle. 'Between the greed of a few and the rights of many. It matters. 'Our democracy is more than just a system of government. It is the very soul of America. This week marks nine years since Biden's son Beau died of brain cancer. He was an Army Captain exposed to toxic burn pits 'It is how we've been able to constantly adapt through the centuries and why we've always emerged from every challenge stronger than when we went in and how we come together as one nation united. 'And just as our fallen heroes have kept the ultimate faith with our country and democracy we must keep faith with them.' Trump be back in Manhattan court on Tuesday for the start of closing arguments in the hush money trial. He spent the weekend campaigning with a speech at the Libertarian Party Convention and then an appearance at a NASCAR race at the Charlotte Motor Speedway.

The rocket launch came just hours after the country's announcement of a plan to put a satellite into orbit drew strong rebukes from its neighbors. South Korea 's Joint Chiefs of Staff said it detected a launch trajectory believed to be a spy satellite fired from the North's main space center at 10:44pm on Monday. The Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that a North Korean rocket was launched in a southern direction off the Korean Peninsula's west coast. It said four minutes after the launch, many fragments were spotted in the waters. It said South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities were analyzing whether the launch was successful.

Japanese Prime Minister’s Office lifted a missile alert issued for the island of Okinawa following North Korea’s launch, saying that the missile was believed not to be headed for its region. North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats. Kim Jong-Un later told a ruling party meeting that the country would launch three additional military spy satellites in 2024. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs.

North Korea sent its first military reconnaissance satellite into orbit in November last year as part of efforts to build a space-based surveillance network to cope with what it calls increasing U.S.-led military threats In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. North Korean authorities said the rocket lost thrust after the separation of its first and second stages. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. The U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any satellite launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Kim has said spy satellites will allow his military to better monitor U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat posed by its nuclear-capable missiles. North Korea provides Japan with its launch information because Japan’s coast guard coordinates and distributes maritime safety information in East Asia.

It was done as a courtesy and out of respect for how highly they rated him. McKenna was lauded for how he had led Ipswich from League One to the Premier League , and the 38-year-old was gracious throughout the conversation, but Chelsea had someone else in mind from their shortlist containing Enzo Maresca, Thomas Frank and Roberto De Zerbi . On Monday morning, their preference was revealed. Maresca – or ‘Diet Pep’ as the Leicester boss has been described because of his history assisting Pep Guardiola at Manchester City – is their chosen one. The top target landed on after hours upon hours of discussions held in their blue bunker, with it hoped that the search for Mauricio Pochettino 's successor can now reach a swift conclusion. Co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart have led the search, each said to have been working day and night while wading through the pros and cons of every candidate alongside the club’s analytics department and Behdad Eghbali, the hands-on co-controlling owner. Chelsea have moved a step closer to appointing Leicester's Enzo Maresca as their new boss The Italian has emerged as the top target to replace Mauricio Pochettino, who left last week Co-sporting directors Paul Winstanley (L) and Laurence Stewart (R) have led the search, each said to have been working all hours while wading through the pros and cons of each candidate Ipswich boss Kieran McKenna was linked with the role, but was told he would be missing out Podcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola?

EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify Chelsea were struck by Maresca’s knowledge of their squad when talks were held with his representatives, as well as his enthusiasm for the vacancy and vision for how he could get this young group of players performing. Chelsea went into this search with an idea for how they want to win – by controlling possession and playing on the front foot. Succeeding in style, essentially, with Maresca usually favouring a 4-3-3 formation which involves building up play from the back. As one of the game's astute tactical thinkers, he even previously wrote a thesis while studying at the legendary Italian coaching centre, Coverciano, entitled ‘Football and Chess’ because he sees so many strategic similarities between the two games. Other disciplines of Guardiola have worked well – none more so than Mikel Arteta at Arsenal – and if finalised, Chelsea will be hiring a 44-year-old Italian who is consumed by football. You will not find a picture of Maresca on his WhatsApp. Instead, you will find a screenshot of a quote by Johan Cruyff which reads: ‘When you play a match, it is statistically proven that players actually have the ball three minutes on average. So, the most important thing is: what do you do during those 87 minutes when you do not have the ball? That is what determines whether you’re a good player or not.’ He has switched up the quote, previously using another Cruyff line which read: ‘Teams don’t learn. Individuals within the team learn. Development is a personal process even when conducted in a team environment.’ Speak to anyone in football about Maresca’s skillset as a coach and you will struggle to find a negative response. He walked into Leicester last June and managed to bring a dejected squad on board within weeks, overhauling their playing style so quickly that when they faced Coventry in the opening game of last season, they looked a passable imitation of Guardiola’s City. Six players who had started the summer determined to leave Leicester were soon knocking on Maresca’s door asking if they could stay. Twelve-hour days beginning at 7am quickly became the norm for Maresca, even though training sessions would last a maximum of one hour, followed by a practice match, sometimes 11-a-side. Maresca (right) is another disciple of Pep Guardiola and worked alongside him at Man City He helped to transform Leicester and ensured they made an instant return to the top flight Maresca realises that his ultra-intense management style is not for everyone and the Italian (right) also believes it is important to have a light-hearted rapport with his players When a player was left out, he would often have the decision explained in detail – usually with reference to the opposition’s tactical plan – and informed when he was likely to be brought on from the substitutes’ bench. Yet Maresca realises that his ultra-intense management style is not for everyone. He believes it is important to have a light-hearted rapport with his players. It is not enough simply to do the work. The players should enjoy it, too. Cruyff, after all, was once quoted as saying: 'Football is not about suffering. It's about enjoyment.' And enjoy it they did at Leicester. Despite a wobble in the second half of the Championship campaign, Maresca delivered the instant return to the Premier League that was demanded. Though they threw away a big lead and eventually had to rely on their main rivals losing form to get over the line, it is hard to argue with a final tally of 97 points – even with perhaps the strongest squad in the history of the Championship. Chelsea have studied how Arteta eventually thrived at Arsenal after leaving Guardiola’s staff and hope Maresca can flourish in the same way. Based purely on his ability on the training ground, Maresca stands every chance. Yet more than managing his players, Maresca’s greatest challenge at Chelsea will be to manage his own manner. The Stamford Bridge job is perhaps like no other in English football, with the long era of success under Roman Abramovich still influencing perceptions and expectations, and the current ownership prone to erratic behaviour. Ask Maresca about his players and he is impressive. Every Leicester manager needs to handle Jamie Vardy effectively and in his first senior job in English football, Maresca did so. Vardy, who turned 37 during the season, scored 20 goals. Yet ask Maresca about his club’s plans, or dare to question his tactical approach, and he can become surly, dare we say slightly petulant. Even though Leicester were winning, fans were starting to tire of a formulaic passing game that left little room for individual flair, and after a 3-1 win over Swansea on January 30, Maresca said: ‘I came to this club to play with this idea. The moment there is some doubt about the idea, the day after, I will leave.’ Now imagine him saying that after a Chelsea match and think of the frenzy within traditional and social media that would follow. His new employers would have some fairly strong views on it, too. Speak to anyone about Maresca’s skillset and you will struggle to find a negative response But his occasionally spiky comments in the media could risk a blow-up with Chelsea's owners Or how about this one following a 3-1 defeat at Coventry on January 13 – Maresca claimed referee Darren England’s decisions had penalised his team and seemed to wonder aloud whether there was a reason. ‘When you keep winning you start to annoy people,’ he said. ‘Today I struggled to understand what happened on the pitch. I’m not saying we are annoying anyone in particular but maybe that’s what is starting to happen.’ Consider those remarks if they had been made after Liverpool-Chelsea rather than Coventry-Leicester. Luckily for Maresca, he has clever people in his corner and he will do well to listen to them. The owners should know what they are getting, too. Maresca is talented, diligent and having worked with Marcello Lippi, Carlo Ancelotti and Guardiola, he knows what success looks like.

        "content": "NADINE DORRIES: My teenage crush Eddie's mission to find out if I wore a bra - and the utter folly of giving 16-year-olds the vote By Nadine Dorries, Daily Mail Published: 12:00 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 12:29 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 19 View comments Labour need to be honest about why they want to reduce the voting age to 16: it is because they want to remain in power for life. It’s vote-bagging pure and simple - if 16-year-olds had been able to vote in 2017, ‘Oh Jeremy Corbyn ’ would almost certainly have become prime minister. Conservatives should be straight too, and admit they are strongly opposed to the plan because they know it would work and we would be faced with either Labour or a socialist coalition government without end - as long as these new young voters actually got out of bed in time to vote. Votes at 16 are a bad idea not just because, at that age, people don’t know their own mind from one day to the next - and they very obviously don’t. Votes at 16 are a bad idea not just because, at that age, people don’t know their own mind from one day to the next, writes Nadine Dorries I shall never forget the call I received one day from a daughter asking me whether we had any Angel Delight (remember that?) in the house. And informing me that she was bringing a friend home from school to stay the night. I arrived home to find a hugely remorseful 16-year-old sobbing in my kitchen with a newly pierced tongue, so swollen she couldn’t swallow solid food, and begging me not to call her parents to tell them. The piercing lasted less than a week. At 16, you do some very stupid things. You are also highly emotional. I remember the day my 16-year-old world ended, when Billy Kinsella didn’t sit next to me on the coach on a school trip to Chester Zoo. I had packed a wagon wheel in my lunch box to give to him and I’d applied multiple layers of Outdoor Girl mascara to my fluttering eyelashes. But he walked straight past me and sat next to Kimberley Pellow. My tears ran faster than the rain outside and I swore to the gaggle of friends who immediately gathered around me offering hankies and hugs that I would never laugh again. By Monday, I was madly in love with Eddie Cosgrove who, I soon discovered, was really only interested in whether or not I wore a bra. (More of that to follow!) No, the far more concerning reason votes at 16 is such a bad idea is that the policy would prove appallingly toxic and divisive, and would open up a new front in the political and culture wars to people in Britain who are at a much more vulnerable age. And this, at a time when society desperately needs to heal. In recent years, our country has become deeply divided on so many levels - and much of this division has undoubtedly been driven by the wide-spread use of social media. There was a time when Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram were the home for advertisers who wanted to micro-target specific consumer groups to sell their products using algorithms. Social media use has caused division in our society, and politics in Westminster has been fundamentally altered as a result They were so successful that it wasn’t long before political operators recognised the potential of these methods and harnessed the platforms to repeatedly target potential voters in key campaigns. Then, as night follows day, those with highly questionable political motives followed suit, using the echo-chamber of social media to sow hatred and division and to undermine democracy. We saw the process evolve during the divisions over Brexit in 2016, we saw it through the bitterness and anger over Covid and the war in Ukraine, and in the way horrendous videos during the Hamas invasion of Israel were live-screened across the world as a call to arms to Islamic extremists across the world. And as a result of these targeting methods - achieved through the fine-tuning of algorithms and the harvesting of our data, our preferences and interests - politics has fundamentally altered. We have all been tribalized, not only in Westminster but in society as a whole. Families and friends become divided as a result of targeted, social-media messaging that appeals to our most base nature; rational debate is cancelled as political influencers use digital platforms to reduce highly complex political issues to a soundbite. Today, strong views are formed on the back of fifteen second videos posted on Instagram. All of our opinions are now right or wrong, black or white, good or evil, and bullying of people’s points of view, their culture, faith and political preferences is commonplace. The change has happened with such speed, it has taken most of us by surprise. We have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of demonstrations on our streets and on university campuses as social media is weaponised in this way. Do we really now want to see demonstrations transfer from universities to the school gates? Will we see political lobbyists turning up at the playground? Tribal arguments breaking out among triggered parents in the car park? Read More NADINE DORRIES: Snobbery, wealth and the mean whispers I overheard at a Cotswolds barbecue that left me in tears Social media has long raised concerns because of the damage it does to young and vulnerable people. Will we now see it used to bombard the same youngsters with advertising and marketing campaigns? And at what age would the bombardment begin? Will children become targets from as young as 13 or 14, as politicians try to catch them early? Then there’s the question of how votes for 16-year-olds would affect the behaviour of MPs who already walk with phones gripped in their palms, constantly refreshing Twitter and Facebook to check the number of ‘likes’ and comments they have received as algorithms remove all original thought and debate from the Mother of all Parliaments - the very place democracy should be protected. When it comes to being a Conservative, we all know about the secret Tory who is too afraid to voice their opinion due to the fact that they feel ‘uncool’ and could potentially expose themselves to social condemnation and covert bullying. Imagine how that pressure would feel if you were only 16. Too afraid to say how you wanted to vote but also deeply confused as you are bombarded with opinions from friends, social media, teachers, and even your own parents telling you which way you should vote as you’re about to sit your GCSEs and hormones are ripping through your veins. You’re actually more interested in getting inside a girl’s bra, or having your tongue pierced and yet, now, you are being pressured to make a decision you can’t reverse for five years. We know how politicised our education sector is today. The doctrine of the years when I was young - that teachers should not influence political opinion and schools should be a neutral place of learning - is very much a thing of the past. Teachers in schools and lecturers in universities are overwhelmingly more likely to support Labour than Conservative and Keir Starmer knows the ground is now fertile to bag votes with his policy, even though it would make the life of 16-year-olds far more complicated and miserable than it already is. Did young Eddie Cosgrove find out if I was wearing a bra? Are you kidding? One Saturday night I was suddenly alone in a room in a friend’s house where he had engineered for me to be. He pranced into the room, carrying a four pack of Babycham in one hand, two Embassy Regal cigarettes in the other, wearing nothing more than a baggy pair of white Y fronts and declared undying love as his circular wire framed glasses steamed up. I laughed so much it killed the moment. Fortunately, when he got over the shock, so did he. By Monday, he had moved on and sent Rita Green a box of Milk Tray.

By Sarah Ewall-wice, Senior U.S. Political Reporter In New York, Ny For Dailymail.Com Published: 11:51 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 12:35 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 46 View comments As the trial of Donald Trump over hush money payments to a porn star heads into its final stage, Trump's wife Melania Trump has been noticeably absent from the courtroom. Over the course of five weeks, a series of Trump supporters including Republican lawmakers, former administration officials, vice presidential hopefuls and a few of his own kids have been in court. They've sat through hours of salacious testimony as the ex-president stands trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment for pornstar Stormy Daniels . Melania Trump, however, has remained far away from the New York criminal court room home in Florida .

'Generally speaking, jurors pay attention to who is seated in the courtroom,' explained Anna Cominsky, Managing Attorney of New York Law School Legal Services. 'Defense attorneys usually like to have 'support' for their client evidenced by friends and family - it's something that humanizes the client. That said, this is a very different case. The jurors know that this is the former president.' Cominsky also pointed out that this particular courtroom is ' completely packed with people from both sides.' She said it makes it hard for the jury to distinguish who is there for whom. Ex-president Trump seated in the Manhattan criminal courtroom on May 21 as he stands trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records Berkeley Law professor John Yoo also said he did not think her absence matters much and may perhaps have a benefit to the defense. ' I could see how some jurors would ask where Melania Trump was. Perhaps her presence would show her support for Trump's story that his fling with Stormy never happened,' he added. 'But her presence would also buy into the prosecution's underhanded effort to make the trial about Stormy [Daniels], and not about whether any bookkeeping misdemeanors occurred and whether they concealed some greater crime.' Yoo argued Trump's defense team has done a good job of attacking the failure of the prosecution to prove its case on the law. He said they were smart to keep the focus on that and not alleged affairs. Cornell law professor Randy Zelin believes no one would care and 'it would look contrived anyway.' On Tuesday, both sides are set to give closing arguments before the case goes to jury for deliberations. While Melania has not traveled to New York to stand by her husband's side as he came face-to-face with Daniels or others testifying about the hush money payment , the former first lady has been spotted along side her embattled husband elsewhere. Earlier this month, the two sat side-by-side at their son Barron's high school graduation in Florida and the former first lady was seen smiling and clapping as Barron's name was called. Court in New York was recessed early for the week so the ex-president could attend. Former First Lady Melania and Trump were all smiles at the ceremony as their son Barron graduated from high school on May 17 Melania attended the Republican fundraiser hosted by billionaire John Paulson that raised more than $50 million as Trump runs for a second term in the White House The Trumps arriving to vote in Florida on March 19. When asked if she would be joining Trump on the campaign trail she responded 'stay tuned.' The former first lady has not attended any of Trump's 2024 rallies or primary election night celebrations to date Melania was also in attendance last month in a stunning purple jumpsuit for a campaign fundraiser hosted by John Paulson in Florida where the ex-president raised more than $50 million for his presidential bid. The former first lady jumped back into politics to speak at a fundraiser for the pro-conservative LGBT organization Log Cabin Republicans last month. But she has not hit the campaign trail for her husband as he holds rallies in battleground states across the country or celebrated his primary nights in early contest states. When asked if she would be joining him on the campaign trail in March while joining her husband to cast ballots in the Florida GOP primary, Melania responded 'stay tuned.' DailyMail.com has inquired with the Trump campaign about any future plans for Melania to hit the campaign trail. While Melania has not been spotted in court, both of Trump's older sons Don Jr. and Eric and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump have been in attendance for some of the many hours of testimony. His sons could be seen arriving and leaving the court with their father's large entourage and sitting a few rows behind him in the courtroom. His adult daughters Ivanka and Tiffany Trump's names have come up in the testimony during the hush money trial, but they have not appeared in the courtroom to support their dad. Both live in Florida. Trump's son Eric and daughter-in-law Lara Trump returning to the courtroom from a break in the hush money trial on May 14 Eric Trump has been a regular in the Manhattan criminal courtroom to support his father.

During her days of lurid testimony, Daniels recalled Trump telling her in 2006 before their alleged sexual encounter that Trump told her the couple slept in separate bedrooms . Michael Cohen claimed Trump was not worried about Melania leaving him over the Daniels affair story and even claimed the then presidential candidate said 'how long do you think I'll be on the market for?' But other witnesses painted a picture of a very different relationship between the former first couple during testimony.

Madeleine Westerhout told the court she believed they had a relationship of mutual respect and Trump cared a lot about Melania's opinion. 'There was no one else who could put him in his place,' Westerhout testified. She also recalled Melania texting her asking when Trump would be coming up for dinner while they were in the White House and Trump calling Melania from the Oval Office while he was president to chat.

        "content": "Iga Swiatek began her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean on Monday, stretching her winning streak to 13 matches. Swiatek, who has been ranked No. 1 for nearly every week since April 2022, put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier in the 1-hour, 1-minute match: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Three of her four Grand Slam trophies came in Paris — in 2020, 2022 and 2023. The last woman to win the championship at the clay-court major three straight times was Justine Henin in 2005-07. “It feels like home here,” said Swiatek, who will meet four-time major champ and former No. 1 Naomi Osaka next. “I'm really happy to be back. Just feel like I can play really good tennis, so hopefully I'm going to be here as long as possible.” Her match was going to be followed by one involving someone even more comfortable on the red clay: Rafael Nadal, the 14-time champion at Roland Garros. He was scheduled to face No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev in the first round — in what might end up being Nadal's last French Open match. “For sure, I'll be watching Rafa’s match,” Swiatek said. “Comparing me to him? I don't think I'm at that level yet. He's a great person and a great athlete ... I will try to take lessons from him.” In other early action Monday, reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner improved to 8-0 in Grand Slam play in 2024 by defeating Chris Eubanks 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova eliminated Rebeka Masarova 6-1, 6-3 and two-time major finalist Ons Jabeur beat Sachia Vickery of the US 6-3, 6-2. Sinner, who missed the Italian Open this month with an injured hip, moved well and his strokes seemed just fine. He limited the big-serving Eubanks to four aces, converted 5 of 10 break points and was broken only once himself. Not surprisingly, the clean-striking Sinner won 10 of the 14 points that lasted nine strokes or more. “The hip is good. I'm very happy. I'm glad that my team and myself worked very hard to be back on court as soon as possible,” Sinner said. “For sure, (my) general shape is not at 100% yet, so we try to build every day.” The encounter lasted only a little more than two hours and, truth be told, Sinner was not really tested all that much. “I'm obviously happy by what I have achieved in the last months. But our goal is to improve every day. That for me is more important. I know I have to improve some things,” said Sinner, who now faces French veteran Richard Gasquet. “Let's see what I can achieve in the future.” Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti knows he will have a tough decision to make in goal for the Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. Will he pick Andriy Lunin, who has played in goal nearly the entire season, or Thibaut Courtois, the veteran who has won the Champions League before but has just returned from injury? “It’s really difficult,” Ancelotti said Monday. “Of course it’s really difficult, because both of them deserve to play this final. Lunin because he did a fantastic season, and Courtois because he is back from his injury and everyone knows the quality of Courtois. It’s a difficult decision but I think I’m going to take into the game this decision, no doubt.\" Lunin was nursing a fever and was the only Madrid player who didn’t train on Monday as Madrid began its final week of preparations. But Ancelotti said the 25-year-old Ukrainian was expected to be available for Saturday’s final in London. The illness surely doesn't help Lunin's chances, though, and many had already expected Ancelotti to go with the more experienced Courtois despite his lack of minutes this season. Courtois ruptured a left-knee ligament in August, just two days before the start of the season. The 32-year-old Belgian then also ruptured the meniscus in his right knee in March, when he was close to making a comeback. He was sidelined until the beginning of this month, when he started in a 3-0 win over Cadiz, a victory that secured Madrid’s 36th Spanish league title. Lunin was back in goal as Madrid beat Bayern Munich in the Champions League semifinals. He had saved two penalties in the decisive shootout win over Manchester City in the quarterfinals. Lunin had earned the starting position over Kepa Arrizabalaga, the former Chelsea player who is Madrid’s other reserve goalkeeper. Ancelotti said Lunin was the best goalkeeper in the world right now. Courtois has proven experience in finals, though, having won the 2022 Champions League with Madrid, the FA Cup with Chelsea, the Europa League with Atletico Madrid, and two Copa del Rey titles (one for Madrid, one for Atletico), among several other titles. “Both deserve to play for various reasons,” Ancelotti said. Ancelotti joked that he will wait as long as possible to announce the starting goalkeeper because otherwise the debate would be over, and “I like the debate.” The two-day WWE SmackDown and King & Queen of the Ring events, organized by Saudi Arabia's General Entertainment Authority as part of Jeddah Season, culminated in thrilling matches at the Jeddah Superdome on Saturday. In a captivating main event, Austrian Gunther emerged victorious over American Randy Orton, to claim the coveted King of the Ring title, igniting electrifying cheers from the packed audience. Meanwhile, in the women's division, Australian Nia Jax emerged triumphant, defeating Irish Lyra Valkyria to capture the Queen of the Ring title. The tag team action was equally intense, with Americans Bianca Belair and Gigi Dolin securing the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship belts after a hard-fought battle against fellow Americans Tamina and Candice LeRae. American Liv Morgan successfully defended her WWE Women's World Championship title against Irish Becky Lynch, while American Cody Rhodes emerged victorious in the Undisputed WWE Championship, defeating fellow American Logan Paul. The evening concluded with Canadian Sami Zayn retaining his Intercontinental Championship title, overcoming American Chad Gable and Australian Bronson Reed. Olivier Giroud scored in his final match for AC Milan as the Rossoneri drew with bottom club Salernitana 3-3 on a Saturday night of farewells at San Siro. The 37-year-old Giroud, who helped Milan to the Serie A title in 2022, is leaving after three years and will join Los Angeles FC. Giroud was given a standing ovation when he was substituted off six minutes from time, hugging all of his teammates and coach Stefano Pioli as the crowd sang his name. Milan’s last match of the season was also Pioli’s final match in charge, bringing to an end a five-year stint that included the Champions League semifinal last year as well as the Serie A title. There were emotional scenes before the match as Pioli was encircled by his players. He had tears in his eyes as he embraced each of them individually as they applauded, while the whole stadium gave him a standing ovation. Rafael Leão immediately went over to celebrate with Pioli after scoring the opening goal in the 22nd minute following a howler by Salernitana goalkeeper Vincenzo Fiorillo, who dropped the ball at his feet. They were joined by the rest of the Milan team. Five minutes later it was Giroud’s turn as he acrobatically struck home a corner for his 15th league goal of the season. The France forward has 49 goals for Milan in his three seasons. Simy pulled one back for Salernitana in the 64th but Davide Calabria restored Milan’s two-goal advantage 13 minutes later. However, goals from Junior Sambia and Simy in the last three minutes rescued a draw for already-relegated Salernitana in its last top-flight match. It was also Milan defender Simon Kjær's last match for the club. Pioli, Giroud and Kjær were all celebrated in a special ceremony after the match, and all three struggled to hold back tears. RECORD-EQUALLING Alex Sandro made his 327th and final appearance for Juventus as the Brazilian equaled Pavel Nedved’s record for the most matches by a foreign player for the Bianconeri. Alex Sandro headed in Juve’s second in a 2-0 win over Monza. Federico Chiesa claimed the opener two minutes earlier. Nicolò Fagioli hit the crossbar in the 16th minute on his first start for Juventus since returning from a seven-month ban for betting violations. Monza forward Alessio Zerbin was sent off in the final minute following a second yellow card. Real Madrid drew with Real Betis 0-0 on Saturday in its last warmup game before facing Borussia Dortmund in the Champions league final. Madrid wrapped up the Spanish league title three weeks ago, and since then coach Carlo Ancelotti has rotated his lineups to rest his starters. But the Italian likely had his top-choice players back in his starting 11 against Betis at the Santiago Bernabeu. There were only two changes from the Champions League semifinals victory over Bayern Munich. The versatile Eduardo Camavinga was in the spot of injured holding midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, who will miss the final due to a foot injury. The other tweak was goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois starting over Andriy Lunin, the backup who played most of the season before the Belgian recovered recently from an ACL injury. Ancelotti, however, would not confirm that this will be his starting team for the final in London on June 1. “I have a week to think about it, we may still have some doubts,” Ancelotti said. “We will enjoy preparing for the final and arrive at our best form on Saturday and try to win it.” KROOS HONORED Toni Kroos played his last home game for Madrid. The 34-year-old midfielder announced this week he will retire after playing for Germany at this summer’s European Championship. Kroos' teammates donned his No. 8 shirt to hold an honor guard for him before kickoff. When he was substituted late, his teammates and coach took turns hugging him. Kroos then embraced his three young children. He can add to his 22 titles, including four Champions League crowns, with Madrid next weekend. “I couldn’t have asked for more,” Kroos said. “These have been 10 unforgettable years. Now the best way for me to finish would be winning another title.” DOVBYK EYES TOP SCORER Ukraine striker Artem Dovbyk is set to finish the Spanish league as its top scorer after his main challenger fell one goal short of his mark. Dovbyk, who is expected to play in Euro 2024, leads the league in the final round with 24 goals. Villarreal striker Alexander Sorloth has 23 and had a chance to equal Dovbyk when it visited Osasuna. But the Norway striker appeared to suffer a leg injury early and had to be substituted without scoring. Dovbyk was two goals behind Sorloth in the goals race until he bagged a hat trick to fuel a 7-0 rout of Granada on Friday. Dovbyk's last outside threat is Robert Lewandowski, who has 18 before Barcelona visits Sevilla on Sunday in Xavi Hernández's last game in charge. Dovbyk joined Girona last summer from Ukrainian club SC Dnipro-1 and helped transform the small club into a European sensation. The Catalan club partly owned by Manchester City's Adu Dhabi ownership qualified for the Champions League for the first time with a third-place finish. Villarreal drew at Osasuna 1-1 after Sorloth's replacement, José Luis Morales, scored a second-half equalizer. Osasuna striker Ante Budimir, who is on Croatia's Euro 2024 squad, netted his first goal since recovering from fractured ribs to give the hosts a first-half lead. He finished the league with 17 goals. Villarreal will likely conclude the campaign with the league’s top assist-maker. Midfielder Álex Baena, who could be on Spain’s Euros 2024 squad, made it 14 assists by setting up Morales. Villarreal said that tied a club record set by Juan Riquelme. The game also featured the farewell of coach Jagoba Arrasate after his six years at Osasuna. Arrasate announced in March that he turned down the offer of a contract extension, saying he needed a fresh start. NICO SHINES Nico Williams capped his superb season by scoring to give fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao a 1-0 win at Rayo Vallecano. Williams helped Athletic win the Copa del Rey and is a sure bet to play for Spain at Euro 2024. Fourth-placed Atletico Madrid got goals from Samuel Lino and Reinildo Mandava to defeat sixth-placed Real Sociedad 2-0. The final round had no drama with the title, European berths and relegation spots all decided beforehand. Madrid, Barcelona, Girona and Atletico will play in the Champions League next season, while Athletic and Sociedad are Europa League bound. Betis will play the Conference League. FINALLY A REASON TO CHEER Almeria, which was relegated a month before the season ended, was at least able to escape last place and give its fans something to cheer about after crushing Cadiz 6-1. Luis Suárez and Sergio Arribas both notched braces in the rout. Almeria pushed Granada to the bottom. Cadiz will join them in the second division next season. Manchester United stunned Manchester City 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley on Saturday, ending City's dreams of a second straight league and cup double. Alejandro Garnacho put United ahead in the 30th minute and Kobbie Mainoo doubled their lead nine minutes later after a well-worked team move, with Jeremy Doku pulling one back late on. While Ten Hag was receiving his medal from the future king of England, Prince William, the Dutchman then got his hands on his second trophy in as many seasons to end a troubled campaign on a high. “I’m not satisfied with it, we have to do better, and if they don’t want me anymore then I go somewhere else to win trophies because that is what I did my whole career,” a defiant Ten Hag said. “We are constructing a team and when I took over it was a mess at Manchester United.” First-half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo set up the win. City piled the pressure on after the break and eventually pulled a late goal back through substitute Jeremy Doku. United’s owners were watching on from the executive seats at Wembley and have a decision to make. “We are all very proud of the players and the staff who work tirelessly to support them,” new co-owner Jim Ratcliffe said. It would have been different if Mauricio Pochettino had been willing to trust Chelsea’s great restructuring is going to work. In the end, the problem for the Argentinian was that he joined a club who do not want a manager who has all the power. It is clear by now that anyone who hopes to last under Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital has to collaborate with the board on everything, be open-minded about constructive criticism and remember not to rock the boat too much when it comes to recruitment. Unfortunately that was never going to be Pochettino – just as it was never going to be Thomas Tuchel, who lasted seven games before being fired. Pochettino is 52. He is a big, magnetic character and an experienced coach who believes his way is best. He was never going to listen to suggestions that he could ease Chelsea’s injury problems by reviewing and altering his training methods. Inevitably there will be talk of an amicable split. Tuchel left under a cloud after the collapse of his relationship with Boehly and Clearlake, a private equity fund managed by Behdad Eghbali and José E. Feliciano. Pochettino was better at managing upwards. He is a more amiable figure than Tuchel. That, though, does not mean he did not have strong views about the way to run the club. Pochettino was not afraid of flexing his muscles when he spoke to the media during the second half of the season. He was not shy of making it clear that he wanted more control over signings. Yet Chelsea, who have spent over £1bn on players since Boehly and Clearlake bought the club from Roman Abramovich two years ago, were not willing to alter their approach to suit the man who carried them to sixth place. Eghbali, whose voice carries most weight, was unsure about Pochettino from the start. Would anything change his mind? Losing the Carabao Cup final to Liverpool’s kids did not help, nor did the failure to challenge for Champions League qualification. Ultimately, Pochettino could never quite solidify his position. It is hard not to conclude that his great mistake was failing to realise that this was not a club conditioned to serve a manager; if power is being doled out, then it is heading only in the direction of the co-sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, who is said to be close to Eghbali. It is Stewart and Winstanley who have implemented Chelsea’s youth-first policy. That Pochettino, who was popular with the players, made it work by making sense of an immature squad has not really registered. It is instructive that the team’s late surge to sixth place was merely seen as evidence that criticism of Stewart and Winstanley was misguided. Chelsea are determined to modernise. Joe Shields is a popular figure in the recruitment team and Sam Jewell is the latest addition from Brighton. They are scouring the globe and are close to completing a deal for the Palmeiras sensation, Estêvão Willian, for just over €60m. Estêvão, 17, is seen as a future Ballon d’Or winner by good judges. Chelsea’s plan is ambitious. It can look crazy. If it works, though, they could end up with one of the best teams in the world. So the head coach has to swear allegiance to the recruitment team. Do not rock the boat. Do not make the mistake of thinking that Pochettino going for a “very nice dinner” with Boehly last Friday meant anything. Pochettino wanted experienced signings last year and this summer. He disagrees with plans to sell two of his most important players, Trevoh Chalobah and Conor Gallagher, because of profit and sustainability concerns. He was not really into Chelsea bringing in Brentford’s set-piece coach, Bernardo Cueva. Admittedly it can be argued that Pochettino is behind the times given how much having a set-piece coach has helped Arsenal. Chelsea want a young, progressive manager who will be comfortable with their structure. They do not want fireworks. Expect them to steer clear of a combustible character such as Roberto De Zerbi. There is strong interest in Ipswich’s impressive 38-year-old manager, Kieran McKenna. But Chelsea want to be consistent challengers for the title. Young coaches are in vogue, but history suggests that the successful clubs build around the person on the touchline. Arsenal, for instance, cater to Mikel Arteta’s needs. Bayer Leverkusen’s unbeaten season is not down to their structure; it is because of Xabi Alonso. Sometimes an inspiring, demanding, obsessive, slightly unhinged character is required. Liverpool had that in Jürgen Klopp. Players need to believe. They need a talismanic figure to carry them over the line – particularly when Pep Guardiola is in charge of the team at the top. Chelsea have a way to go to reach those heights. The worry is that they have created more instability for themselves; perhaps even that they are becoming unmanageable. Graham Potter was gone after less than seven months, Pochettino after less than a year. At this rate, potential hires will wonder if this is the impossible job. McKenna, and others, will need to consider if this is worth the hassle. The rewards are potentially magnificent. There is a chance to take this talented young side and create something special. Alternatively, the payoff could be huge if you aren’t willing to say yes to football’s great disruptors. - The Guardian Sport Adam Wharton could hardly have picked a more difficult Premier League debut at the start of February. With Crystal Palace trailing 1-0 against their arch-rivals Brighton, a knee injury to the captain, Marc Guéhi, forced Roy Hodgson to throw in the 19‐year‐old, who had signed 48 hours earlier from Blackburn. Brighton doubled their lead within five minutes and seven seconds after Palace kicked off again a moment arrived that must have been replayed in Wharton’s mind countless times. Receiving the ball midway in his own half, he turned and attempted to pass to Tyrick Mitchell but was surprised by Pascal Gross and ended up losing possession. What a difference a few months make. Wharton is one of four Palace players in Gareth Southgate’s 33- man provisional England squad for Euro 2024, and the midfielder – who turned 20 four days after the 4-1 defeat by Brighton – has become the heartbeat of a team transformed by the new manager, Oliver Glasner. Palace won five of their final six matches, scoring 20 goals, and Southgate’s assistant, Steve Holland, was at Selhurst Park last Sunday to witness the 5-0 rout of Aston Villa in their final game. Whereas the England call-ups for Henderson, Eberechi Eze and Guéhi caused few ripples, the selection of Wharton is something of a surprise. He made his debut for England Under-21s as a substitute against Luxembourg in March and this tournament had been regarded as coming slightly too early despite his impressive form. A dearth of experience in central midfield caused by the problems with Jordan Henderson and Kalvin Phillips this season mean England have been forced to search for alternatives. Kobbie Mainoo – who Southgate watched being outplayed by Wharton in Palace’s 4-0 thrashing of Manchester United this month – is expected to be part of the final squad after featuring in friendlies against Brazil and Belgium in March. It could come down to a straight fight between Wharton and Liverpool’s Curtis Jones, who has yet to win a senior cap but was in the team of the tournament when England Under-21s were crowned European champions last year. “We need to see some of the younger guys. They’ve had good seasons and we can learn more about them,” said Southgate, a former Palace captain, when asked on Tuesday about his midfield options. “They are the best players at this moment to fulfil the roles that we are talking about.” Much of the credit for Wharton’s rapid progression must go to Glasner, the Austrian who has implemented an exciting system that relies heavily on Wharton’s metronomic passing ability from deep positions. Not since 1991 when Graham Taylor selected Nigel Martyn, Geoff Thomas, John Salako and Ian Wright for an end‐of‐season tour to Australia and New Zealand have four Palace players been in the same England squad. Mitchell can consider himself unfortunate not to have made it five this time after being capped twice in 2022 and excelling as a left wing‐back since Glasner’s arrival. Steve Coppell’s Palace had finished third in the old First Division in 1991 but sold Wright to the champions, Arsenal, a few months later and slipped to 10th, before relegation the following season. This time around the chairman, Steve Parish, will be delighted to see the praise being lavished on the club’s excellent recruitment record, all four players having been signed for relatively modest fees. Henderson, who cost an initial £15m from Manchester United in August, has a strong case to be included in the final 26-man squad by the deadline on 7 June after playing well since being handed his opportunity at Palace because of an injury to another England goalkeeper, Sam Johnstone. Guéhi, the defender who has returned from three months out just in time and proved his versatility by playing in midfield against Villa, will fancy his chances of forcing his way into England’s starting lineup having won nine caps under Southgate and been part of the Under-17 World Cup-winning side along with Phil Foden in 2017. As for Eze, who ended the season in sparkling form and won his first senior caps last year, making the cut would be particularly poignant. Three years ago, the attacking midfielder discovered he was part of Southgate’s provisional squad for the postponed Euro 2020 immediately after injuring an achilles during a Palace training session and being ruled out for several months. Now he and England’s other Eagles have their opportunity to take flight. - The Guardian Charles Leclerc took pole position for Ferrari at the Monaco Grand Prix and ended Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen's bid for a record-extending ninth straight pole on Saturday, The Associated Press reported. Verstappen, who shares the F1 record with the late Ayrton Senna, starts Sunday's race from sixth place for Red Bull on arguably the most difficult track for overtaking in the series. Leclerc secured his third pole in four years at Monaco, where he grew up overlooking the start-finish line, and took his career total to 24 poles. He finished .154 seconds ahead of McLaren's Oscar Piastri and .248 clear of Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. McLaren's Lando Norris qualified fourth ahead of Mercedes driver George Russell. “Really, really happy about the lap,” Leclerc said. “I know more often than not that qualifying is not everything in the race.” Leclerc took pole in 2021, but could not start due to a gearbox problem. He led from pole in 2022 until Ferrari made an incorrect call to change his tires. Verstappen won the race from pole last year but will be hard pushed to win his sixth race of the season. But Leclerc is well set to end his run of nearly two years without a win, dating to July 2022 at the Austrian GP. “I just need a good launch (from the start),” said Leclerc, who has won five F1 races in his career. Traffic forced a couple of drivers to swerve around other cars struggling for space on Monaco's tight and sinewy 3.3-kilometer (two-mile) street circuit. Spanish veteran Fernando Alonso narrowly avoided a piece of debris just before heading into the tunnel section during Q1, the first part of qualifying. Alonso failed to make it into Q2 and so did Red Bull's Sergio Perez, who muttered an expletive on race radio. He is out of contract at the end of the season and Red Bull has yet to confirm he will get a seat for 2025. Norris only just squeezed into Q2, but then found his rhythm. Women's basketball sensation Caitlin Clark drilled a dagger three-pointer to help the Indiana Fever notch their first win of her debut WNBA season Friday, 78-73 over the Los Angeles Sparks. Clark, whose record-setting exploits in collegiate basketball brought unprecedented attention to the women's game, has struggled since Indiana made her the number one pick in the NBA draft. She endured another tough shooting night on Friday, but finished with her first WNBA double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds -- and provided the kind of fireworks her fans have come to expect. After Rickea Jackson had cut the Sparks' deficit to three with a big three-pointer with 2:27 to play, Clark answered with her first three-pointer of the night, AFP reported. Los Angeles had pulled within two when Clark hit another three-pointer with 40.5 seconds remaining that put Indiana up 76-71 and effectively snuffed out the Sparks' challenge. She had eight assists and four steals to help Indiana erase an 11-point halftime deficit. Clark and the Fever had opened the season with five straight defeats. Even so, her drawing power remained undeniable and the crowd of 19,103 at Crypto.com Arena was a record for the Sparks. Kelsey Mitchell scored 18 points to lead Indiana with Aliyah Boston and Temi Fagbenle adding 17 points apiece. The Sparks lineup also boasted some of the WNBA's newest stars in second draft pick Cameron Brink and fourth-pick Jackson. Center Dearica Hamby led the Sparks with 18 points and 12 rebounds while Brink added 15 points and nine rebounds and Jackson scored 16 points off the bench. Last in the majors in home runs last season, the Cleveland Guardians are showing their power resurgence. José Ramírez started a run of three straight homers in the fourth inning of Friday night's game against the Los Angeles Angels as the Guardians became the first team in the majors this season to go back-to-back-to-back. On the next pitch, Josh Naylor chased Patrick Sandoval with a drive into the bleachers in right-center for his 13th of the season, which is tied for seventh. Jose Suarez came in for Sandoval. But two pitches in, David Fry drove a fastball into the Guardians’ bullpen in left field. The homer onslaught came with two outs and extended the Guardians' lead to 9-2. “It's a unique emotion. It's very fun for the team and I'm glad we got to share in that,” Ramírez said through an interpreter after Cleveland won 10-4 to extend its winning streak to seven. The three homers came in the span of four pitches, The AP reported. With four homers on the night, Cleveland has 58 on the season, tied for ninth in MLB. They had 124 all of last season. “Val (hitting coach Chris Valaika) and the hitting group challenged our guys starting over the winter on impacting the ball more, taking your shots and knowing what pitches you can drive,” manager Stephen Vogt said. “It's OK to swing and miss early in the count. Our guys have responded and taken pride in that. And fortunately we're hitting some homers.” After Andrés Giménez got aboard with a base hit, Ramírez followed with a two-run shot to center for his second homer of the game. It was the 24th multihomer game of Ramírez's career and first since last July. The homer was Ramírez's 14th of the season, tied for fifth in the majors. With four RBIs in the first four innings, he moved past Atlanta's Marcell Ozuna for the MLB lead with 49. “It's a combination of having a good plan, being able to execute and getting the results. That's what's working for me right now,” Ramírez said. It's the first time Cleveland has had three straight homers since June 18, 2019, at Texas. “It's pretty cool. Everyone in the dugout was fired up,” Fry said. “Let's have another good at-bat and luckily I snuck it inside the bullpen.” Coincidentally, the Angels were also the last team to allow a team to go deep three straight times. The Texas Rangers had three straight solo shots against the Halos on Sept. 25, 2023.",

        "content": "BRITNEY Spears gave an emotional update and revealed that all her jewelry was stolen on Sunday night. The 42-year-old uploaded a video via her Instagram and showed the inside of her empty drawers from her lavish Los Angeles mansion. Britney said her home was robbed and she was left feeling unsettled. In the video, she opened a white draw in her home that was completely empty. \"You guys, for real, all my jewelry was stolen,\" she said behind the camera. \"See? There’s nothing. Well, there’s a Mother Mary... I’m scared. It’s all gone. All my jewelry is gone,\" she continued. \"So you can see for real all my jewelry was stolen ... it’s hard to buy new now because I’m scared it will go missing,\" Britney captioned the post. \"I buy it cheap and fake, but it’s hard because some of my pieces were originally made for me. \"And my baby cross that I wore since I was 4 is gone ... it’s so thin,\" she concluded in the caption. Britney shared another post that night of a photo of a coral reef with several tropical fish swimming around. She went into detail on what she's currently enjoying at the moment in her caption. Britney mentioned that she had purchased new silk pajamas as well as a lamp for her dog's bedroom. In the middle of the long caption, Britney mentioned she was worried about leaving her home. \"I’m scared of the outside world because god forbid I break a foot and someone calls an ambulance so I don’t go out much,\" she wrote. Within the caption, which was shared before the video of her empty jewelry draws, she said that she had been emptying her draw after her recent trip to Mexico . I'm scared of the outside world \"My favorite thing to do is to clean out drawers at the moment ... \"I’ve bought stencils for my walls to create designs and accents, and I drew a really cool tropical tree in my room on the wall with a bird in a nest,\" she concluded. Britney currently has comments turned off, meaning fans can't write underneath her photos. A spokesperson for Ventura County Sheriff’s Office spoke to Page Six about Britney's video. “We haven’t received any calls for service regarding any reports of theft from Spears’ residence,\" they emphasized. The publication reached out to Britney's rep for comment. This was not the first confession made by the star online, with Britney recently admitting her conservatorship prevented her from drinking coffee for 13 years . She uploaded a clip from the comedy movie Bridesmaids, starring Melissa McCarthy . In the over-the-top scene , Annie ( Kristen Wiig ) made loud noises and silly faces as she drunkenly mocked Lillian (Maya Rudolph) and Helen (Rose Byrne). The short video ended with Annie making a sexual gesture at her gal pals. Britney included the word \"Me,\" over Annie's head, which indicated Britney saw herself as the character. \"Me talking to my family after the conservatorship telling me no coffees...spas...or cash for 13 years,\" Britney captioned the post. In September 2021, Britney's case returned to a Los Angeles courtroom where Judge Brenda Penny made a number of bombshell rulings, following her father's decision to end the conservatorship the month prior. She ruled to rid Jamie of his daughter's conservatorship, however, it did not mean the end of the conservatorship altogether . Speaking in court, Judge Brenda Penny said: \"Based on what I read in the filings, and I read everything. I do believe the suspension of Jamie Spears is in the best interest of Britney Spears. \"The current situation is unattainable. The court finds the toxic environment Jamie Spears has created needs to be removed today.\" Following the judge's decision, a temporary conservator was put in Jamie's place for about a month. In early November 2021, Jamie was back in court filing new legal documents that show he's done fighting. Jamie had previously demanded $2 million in exchange for stepping down but documents at the time showed that he was not seeking any further compensation. On November 12, Judge Penny ruled in favor of the pop star, removing Jamie from the position of conservator without requiring any further mental examination from Britney. The star was in a legal battle after her father, Jamie, had sole control over her finances during her career. Page Six revealed that Britney became candid about how the conservatorship affected her in a now-deleted post. \"There was a time when I was held in a spot against my will for a very long time,\" she wrote. \"I haven’t been the same since.” \"I portray myself as very together on IG, but there are a lot of people who don’t know what my body physically went through!\" the hitmaker continued. “I have to be the bigger person and forgive my own parents...but that’s extremely hard!\" \"I will do my best to let it go and not let others down by my anger,” Britney ended.",

        "content": "A US airline is taking flight to new heights, adding another stop just in time for summer. The travel change is sure to make the jet-set happy, as more direct flights are added to a summertime hotspot. According to a press release from United Airlines , the direct flights will begin on June 9, 2024. The flights will take place from Newark and John F. Kennedy airports to Tenerife South airport. The summer stop from the United States to the Canary Islands has a little something for everyone. The tourist hot spot is home to Siam Park — a water park ranked as number one in the world by TripAdvisor. United Airlines boasted the summer flight plan from the greater New York City area to the Canary Islands. \"Travelers looking for an additional new beach destination can enjoy the stunning black and white sand beaches of Spain's Canary Islands with United's new flight from New York/Newark to Tenerife,\" they said in a press release. \"United will be the only airline to fly direct between the Canary Islands and North America with three-times weekly service launching June 9 with a Boeing 757-200.\" United Airlines also added that they will have more flights to Spain than any other airline of its kind. \"Along with the new service to Palma de Mallorca, United will fly to more Spanish destinations from North America than any other airline,\" they added. The number one water park in the world, as noted by TripAdvisor, is Siam Park . Located in Tenerife in the Canary Islands, it's sure to make a splash with the whole family. The water park has kept its number one spot for nine years in a row — and not without reason. Attractions include the Naga Race — a mat water slide for the whole family. For the adrenaline junkie, the Kinnaree is a 656-foot slide, boasting a \"tornado wave.\" Those looking to relax also have options at the world-renowned waterpark. The Mai Thai River stretches a little over half a mile. Parkgoers can sit back and relax as they float along the serene attraction. There are also VIP experiences for the customer looking for a higher end experience. Siam Park includes the Champagne Club, which is about $400 per night to stay in. It includes a bottle of champagne, \"Balinese beds,\" and other high-end amenities.",

And, unless lawyers drastically change their direction in closing, Trump will become a convicted felon, Renato Mariotti told CNN. “This is a case that could have been winnable by the defense if they pursued a different strategy,” he said. “...But they really haven’t had a focus presentation. They haven’t tried to focus the jury on issues ... they've really been all over the place, scorched earth attacking not just Michael Cohen, but Stormy Daniels. Contesting everything. “I think that we're going to get more of that scorched-earth attack everything approach in the closing arguments. And, if that's the case, I do think there's going to be a conviction here . “Really, there needs to be an entirely different approach.” He told CNN host Jim Acosta that the whole defense appeared to have been run by Trump. ALSO READ: 'Oh, come on!' Tommy Tuberville dismisses Trump connection to 'unified Reich' video “I'm not sure that Donald Trump's willing to let his defense attorneys pursue a strategy that has a chance of winning in this case,” he added. Former White House ethics czar Norm Eisen agreed. “He has hit the nail on the head,” he said. “This was a winnable case. It still is not a slam dunk in my view, having been there every day for the prosecution I think the odds of a conviction are somewhere upwards of 80%. “The defense, in part because of this scattershot approach, the defense is not really gunning for an acquittal. That's out of reach here. What they're hoping for is one angry juror, that there's one juror who either feels a whole sympathy for Trump or just for whatever reason does not follow the evidence and the law, the holdout.” Watch the video below or at this link. CONTINUE READING Show less Donald Trump’s jury is set to start deliberations in his hush money trial this week — and whatever its decision is, it's set to send shockwaves that could upend November’s election, an analyst wrote for MSNBC Monday. “Whatever happens, America is in no way ready for the new chapter that a verdict — or lack thereof — in Trump’s case will usher in,” Hayes Brown wrote. “Once the foreperson has announced the jury’s decision, any prior assumptions about the 2024 presidential race will need to be recalculated.” Lawyers in the case, in which Trump faces 34 felony charges of business fraud involving allegations he paid an adult movie star to keep quiet about a sexual relationship the pair had, are set to start giving their closing arguments Tuesday. After that, jury deliberations will begin. “What I sense ... is that whatever happens, America is in no way ready for the new chapter that a verdict — or lack thereof — in Trump’s case will usher in,” wrote Brown. “Once the foreperson has announced the jury’s decision, any prior assumptions about the 2024 presidential race will need to be recalculated.” Brown laid out three likely options awaiting Trump. Conviction, acquittal or a deadlock resulting in a mistrial. ALSO READ: Why Trump’s strength is illusory He wrote that, up to now, the effect of a conviction on the election was based on hypotheticals. But, after the jury returns its verdict, voters’ decisions will be based on fact. “We are now finally moving away from possibility to hard and fast reality, which may look very different than the predictions based on polling,” he said. “And encouraging as those statistics may have been for Democrats, they still left unanswered some important questions. None of the polls ... asked voters how an acquittal would affect their support for the former president, something that remains a possibility. “Depending on where the jury lands, Trump, as he always has, will either praise or denounce the system. A conviction in a state court would be something he couldn’t undo even if he’s elected president again. It would be yet another asterisk next to his name, one more humiliation to add to the list. While it would be another grievance for him to seek revenge against, an appeal would be yet another costly distraction to a campaign already hemorrhaging money on his legal fees. “And yet his supporters, following the lead of the spineless Republicans who have showed up at court to buoy him, may well shrug and cast their votes for a convicted criminal.” \"An acquittal, though, will be another supposed “total exoneration” — and this time it would be true.\" He went on, “All of this is projection, of course, as we wait for the end of the yawning silence that has echoed since the defense, which only called one witness, rested Tuesday. In this liminal space, the future hangs by a thread. Guilty? Not guilty? A mistrial? Whichever it is, it will likely be more than we can truly wrap our heads around.” CONTINUE READING Show less",

        "content": "First Sgt. Virgil “Bud” Brown was killed saving the life of his comrades under enemy fire weeks after the D-Day invasion. Watch the interview above to learn more about him. | Courtesy photos IDAHO FALLS – When Virgil Brown said goodbye to his wife and her son from a previous marriage, he fully expected he would see them again. But he didn’t. The 22-year-old Idaho Falls man, known as Bud to friends and family, enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II and was deployed overseas in 1943. The following year, he was killed while saving his comrades under enemy fire on the beaches of Normandy six weeks after the D-Day invasion. His body was later buried at the Normandy American Cemetery. His name is etched on a headstone in the shape of a white cross that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean, according to researcher Kelly Smyth. For many years, Bud’s remains and whereabouts were unknown to those who knew him, except for members of his extended family. Smyth, a history teacher in Caldwell, learned of Brown about 10 years ago while doing a research project with one of her students in conjunction with the 70th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. Smyth tells EastIdahoNews.com it made the project extra special to learn about a soldier from her home state whose story was “lost in time.” “We were honored to be a part of researching this phenomenal man. He won the distinguished service cross, which is second only to the medal of honor,” Smyth says. Pete Revell, a British historian, heard about Smyth’s project. He lives part-time in Dangy, France, a city that was liberated from German occupation because of Brown’s actions. Revell worked with the mayor of Dangy to create a memorial honoring Brown and two other men who helped him. It will be dedicated this summer on the 80th anniversary of his death. Virgil Brown’s medals and headstone | Photos provided by Kelly Smyth Brown was born in Idaho Falls on August 31, 1921 to Edwin and Carrie Brown, according to . He was the second of five kids and the only son. He attended Idaho Falls High School and was a halfback on the football team. Brown joined the Idaho National Guard in 1940 and enlisted in the U.S. Army the following year. While training with the 183rd Field Artillery Battalion in Yakima, Washington, he met Betty Wyatt Laidler and her young son, Gary. He and Betty were married on Feb. 3, 1943. Brown met his family one last time in Pocatello before his deployment on Oct. 19, 1943. First sergeant Brown was with his artillery battalion in Sainte-Lô, France on July 28, 1944 when they were unexpectedly attacked from behind by German forces. A citation on his Distinguished Service Cross explains what happened. “First Sergeant Brown, with complete disregard for his own safety, courageously led his men through incessant automatic weapons and small arms fire in a vicious counterattack. Surprised by a sudden burst of fire from a well-concealed machine gun, Brown daringly charged the gun emplacement. Although seriously wounded by a burst of fire from the gun, he continued his heroic advance until he was again hit and mortally wounded.” Larry Manion, Brown’s nephew from Texas who has a second home in Victor, says it was several weeks to a month before the family was notified of Bud’s death. Two of Bud’s sisters were told by a friend that a telegram was sent to their parent’s house. Manion’s mom, one of Brown’s other sisters, was in Virginia with her dad at the time and didn’t find out until later. “My grandfather (Bud’s dad) served in World War I. Losing his son over there was a real blow for him,” Manion says. “It was hard on all of them.” Bud’s parents chose to have their son’s body buried in Normandy. Manion isn’t sure why they made that decision. A memorial service was held in Idaho Falls, but Manion’s mom was unable to attend. “I have been to (the cemetery where Bud is buried),” says Manion. “One thing on my dad’s bucket list was to go to that cemetery and visit Uncle Bud’s grave. Me and my wife were never able to do that with him.” Old Brown family photo provided by Larry Manion. Bud is pictured in the bottom right hand corner. Though Brown never saw his family after his deployment, he continued to write letters. A letter dated July 20, 1944, was the last letter he wrote before his death. An excerpt from that letter contains a casual remark “about the weather, how hard training was” and an inquiry about “how everyone was” at home. Eighty years later, it’s a stark reminder of how fragile life is. Betty and her son, Gary, have since passed away as well. Manion says Betty remarried about six years after Brown’s death. She moved back to Yakima, Washington and died in 2010 of natural causes. Gary died in 2017, but Manion isn’t sure what caused his death. Though Bud’s grave has never officially been recognized by his family, Manion says they talked about and remembered him as a family every Memorial Day. Manion is unable to attend the dedication of Bud’s memorial in France but he’s grateful that his uncle is being recognized. As for Smyth, she say it’s “an honor to uncover his story” and share it with the world. “They (Bud and the other two men who sacrificed their lives) should be honored and remembered (so) ... future generations will never forget his sacrifice,” Smyth says.

He details the secret sauce behind the homegrown brand which burst onto the scene in 1972 when India’s consumer sector was dominated by Western multinationals during the pre-economic liberalization era. Piramal is an ardent advocate of the free market and hails Bharat’s robust growth in the past decade, buoyed by widespread reforms of the tax code. He singles out the government’s “Make in India” scheme, which was launched in 2014 to take on Asia’s economic powerhouse: China. Piramal is optimistic about India’s emergence on the world stage in 2047 – known as “Amrit Kaal,” or “The Era of Elixir” – in the centenary year of Bharat gaining freedom from colonial British rule.",

        "content": "Former Bayern Munich boss and current German national team manager Julian Nagelsmann kicked off his team’s training camp with a press conference and gave an update on the squad’s injuries. “(David) Raum, Leroy (Sané), Pavlo (Aleksandar Pavlović), and Jamal (Musiala) won’t train at 100% this week. We’ll try to integrate them partially Wednesday or Thursday. We have to be careful not to go from 0 to 100. They’ll take it easy now and hopefully be involved in full training on Friday,” Nagelsmann said (as captured by @iMiaSanMia ). “The Leverkusen players and Ilkay Gündogan will join us on Wednesday and start training on Thursday. Marc-André ter Stegen will join on Monday. The Champions League finalists will join on Tuesday next week. We have spoken to all four of them. It’s important that all of them are injury-free. From Tuesday onwards we will have a full squad. “(Manuel Neuer has) nothing dramatic (as an illness). Just a mild gastrointestinal infection. He won’t be here before Wednesday, I expect him to join on Thursday. If he’s healthy, he will be #1 (at the EUROs).” To help compensate, Nagelsmann has called up Rocco Reitz and Brajan Gruda to give some young players some extra work and an opportunity to experience the first team atmosphere. “Gruda is extremely creative in the final third, a very fine footballer. I’m very excited to see him in training. I hope he has the necessary self-confidence with us. Reitz has had a very good season, is very hard-working. He tries to initiate a lot of attacks. They’re here just for training for now, but there’s also a chance [to be in the squad], something can always happen. It’s a sign for them that they were called up for training,” Nagelsmann said. “In the end, the tournament outshines everything, everyone has the same goal, no matter how their season went. I demand everyone to give everything in training, but at the beginning it will be a bit more relaxed. There’s no need for many discussions. Everyone will be fully focused. The EUROs is the start of the new season, everyone is really looking forward to it. Everyone is excited. When you lose a Champions League final, it hurts, but you can quickly refocus to have a great tournament.” With so many question marks regarding the health of his team, Nagelsmann also addressed bringing up other players if someone cannot compete. Specifically, Nagelsmann was asked about Leon Goretzka. “Nothing is completely ruled out for any player. Of course we would like to have the squad that we nominated in the tournament. I don’t want to give anyone false hopes. We hope nobody gets injured. But nothing is ruled out,” Nagelsmann said. Finally, the manager gave some insight as to what the biggest event for this week will be. “On Thursday, the team will have an event with the Special Operations Command, where the aim is to find a team that has to function absolutely perfectly, that has to have solutions in all situations, that support each other. That is at the forefront when it comes to communication. No mistakes can be made,” said Nagelsmann. “It’s a bit different in football. Nevertheless, I think there are a lot of elements that these men and women can teach us. What it means to communicate perfectly, to protect each other, to be there for each other in tricky situations, when things aren’t going so well. To always keep a cool head. To find solutions. I think it will be very, very interesting. I won’t be there myself. It’s for the players. I’m excited to hear what the team says afterwards.” The time they are a changin’ at Bayern Munich. Vincent Kompany looks like he is taking over in Bavaria, while the club’s former favorite son — Hansi Flick — is heading to FC Barcelona . Which one will make out better with their new club? We’ll find out, but in the meantime, there could also be some Bayern players who are on Flick’s transfer radar, too. basically, we’ve got a lot to talk about with all of that, plus some appreciation for Bayer Leverkusen’s incredible season. You can check all of that out on the Bavarians Podcast Works Show, which is available on Spotify or below: Related Didi Hamann says Germany needs unity, team spirit to success at EUROs",

        "description": "The management consulting firm P3, which specialises in electric mobility, has compiled an Asian edition of the P3 Charging Index—a comparison of electric cars' long-distance capability, showing the real charging time in relation to consumption. One Geely model outperformed all other cars from German and Chinese manufacturers.",
        "content": "The consulting firm has previously published four editions of the P3CI—the first three of which focused on Europe (where was the most recent winner) and, last year, for the first time, an edition with models available in North America. The won that charging comparison. The P3CI Asia was created on the occasion of the 37th Electric Vehicle Symposium in South Korea. The methodology is the same as in previous editions. If a car is capable of recharging enough power for 300 kilometres of range in 20 minutes, it results in an index value of 1.0. If the index number exceeds that, the range recharged in 20 minutes is higher. If it is lower, less than 300 kilometres were charged in the same time window. The Asian edition pushed this methodology to its limits for the first time , but more on this later. P3 tested ten vehicles from various manufacturers sold in significant numbers in Asia or that set new standards in terms of performance. The drive variant with the longest range was used for each model. German models include the and the , both of which have 100 kWh batteries. From South Korea, the with rear-wheel drive and the Genesis G80 electrified were tested, as well as the . Chinese brands included the , the and the with a long-range battery. Two models have a special status: although the comes from a US manufacturer, it is built in Shanghai and sold in significant numbers in Asia. And although Lotus is a classic British brand, it is owned by the Chinese Geely Group, and with its 102 kWh battery is built in China. P3 tested all vehicles itself and calculated the charging curves. The tests took place in North America and Europe, and the company used a measuring instrument to monitor the “power line communication” between the vehicle and the charging station. The goal was to ensure that the car was the limiting factor in terms of charging performance and that the charging station did not deliver less power than the vehicle could have processed. That was a particular challenge with the Lotos Emeya. Unlike the European editions of the P3CI, however, the basis for the recharged range is not the ADAC EcoTest, but the WLTP due to international comparability. The current index values are thus not directly comparable with those of previous editions. So much for the preamble. Now to the results, where the Lotus Emeya stands out. With a P3 Charging Index of 1.53, the Emeya achieved the best result to date. In 20 minutes, the vehicle recharged sufficient electricity to drive 458 kilometres. That is precisely where the Lotus pushed the limits, as the Charging Index methodology de facto prevented an even better result. The Emeya had already charged from 10 to 80 per cent after just 14 minutes. As the charging capacity decreases progressively at even higher charge levels, the test result also includes six minutes with a relatively low capacity. In the first ten minutes, a peak of 310 WLTP kilometres was recharged with 402 kW and only 148 kilometres in the second ten minutes. From ten to 80 per cent, the average charging power was 331 kW. That means the Emeya’s average charging performance was even better than the second-best model in terms of peak charging performance. The Xpeng G9 reached a peak of 320 kW but could not maintain this charging power up to 30 per cent charge level – from 35 per cent, the charging curve also fell below that of the Hyundai Ioniq 6. However, an average of 233 kW is a good result. But as the G9’s consumption of 19.4 kWh/100 km is the second highest in the comparison, it is only enough for third place in the P3CI with 1.20 points. In second place is the Mercedes EQS 450+, which charges more slowly but more consistently at peak times with its 400-volt system and is one of the more efficient vehicles with 16.4 kWh/100 km – resulting in a P3CI of 1.24. In total, seven of the ten models tested achieved an index value of over 1.0, i.e. recharging more than 300 kilometres in 20 minutes and are therefore considered “suitable for long journeys” in the P3 definition. How the result is achieved varies significantly in some cases. The Hyundai Ioniq 6 achieves a decent average charging capacity of 184 kW and extremely low consumption. The platform brother Kia EV9 with a larger battery charges slightly better at 190 kW (and also highly consistent at around 200 kW), but has the highest consumption in the field – and has to admit defeat to the Ioniq 6 with a total of 1.07 to 1.16. In the fuel consumption section, it is pretty surprising that the aerodynamically optimised Ioniq 6 is followed by two SUV models, the Model Y and BYD Atto 3, which undercut other saloons such as the EQS, Emeya, G80 electrified and the i7. The other two SUVs in the comparison, the Kia EV9 and Xpeng G9, are at the bottom of the fuel consumption rankings. Not all of the models tested are currently available in Europe, so the results are not necessarily relevant for end customers. Nevertheless, P3 derives some key findings for electrive that are important for the industry and should also be of interest to consumers in the near future.",

        "description": "Our experts explain how to choose a juicer to make sure that you're meeting your needs. We break down the different types of juicers and best juicing brands too",
        "content": "If you're wondering how to choose a juicer that will fit in with your kitchen, you're in the perfect place. The juicer market is immense with plenty of expensive models on offer. To avoid wasting your time and money, you'll need some advice. Lists of the will lump together all the , which is great if you want an overview. However, if you try to make green juice with a centrifugal juicer, or nut milks with a citrus juicer, it's a recipe for disappointment and disaster. That's why we're here. Our experts have plenty of advice for how to choose a juicer that will suit your needs. We'll cover budget, speed, convenience, nutrient retention, and versatility. That way, you'll be able to tell which juicers are worth the squeeze without needing to consult the experts. There are . Looking at these can feel simultaneously overwhelming and confusing, so, before we go into the specifics of how to choose a juicer, I'll break down the different types and who they'll suit. These work using a spinning blade to shred fruits and vegetables. It's a quick, cheap process that is easy to clean up after. The only trouble is that this process can be noisy. It also introduces a lot of oxygen and some heat into your juice, so it won't last as long or have as many nutrients as other, more gentle juicing methods. They're also less efficient at extracting juice from leafy greens and fibrous vegetables. This is the best centrifugal juicer on the market. It's tiny but can make delicious juices in next to no time. If you've never had a juicer before, you'll love this. Masticating juicers work by crushing and pressing your fruits and vegetables to extract juice from them. These tough juicers generally give a higher juice yield, with less oxidation than centrifugal juicers. This means that the nutrients are well-extracted and expertly preserved, even if you use leafy greens, wheatgrass, nuts, and frozen fruits. They're quieter than cenrifugal juicers too. Whilst that all sounds appealing, there are some drawbacks that come with masticating juicers. Not only do these models come with a more premium price tag, they are also made up of lots of little parts. These can be fiddly to assemble and a drag to wash up. This is, without a doubt, my favorite juicer of all time. It looks smart and makes incredible juice, nut milk, smoothies, and sorbets. Nama even makes a smaller if the dimensions won't suit your home. Twin gear juicers give an even higher juice yield than masticating juicers. They use two gears to crush and grind ingredients, giving you as much juice as nutrients as possible. People use these for their yield, nutrient retention, and versatility. However, they're the most expensive, complex, and the slowest kind of juicer on the market. I've never tasted better juices than the ones I made in the Tribest. The yield is incredible, but the process is very involved and quite demanding too. These come in all shapes and sizes (some have motors and others don't). The clue is in the name with citrus juicers really. They're great for fresh orange juice and lemonade, but they can't juice many other ingredients. If you're on a budget and looking for a simple juicer, this is a good option. The Smeg Citrus Juicer wins full marks for style. It's available in a range of colors and patterns and will work your oranges and lemons hard. It's a design piece as much as it is an appliance. Manual juicers require you to flex some muscles. They typically use a hand-crank mechanism to press and extract juice from your ingredients. This is great if you don't want to be plugged into electricity or often on the go. It's an affordable option, but you'll need to give it more effort and time for less yield. This is another beautiful juicer. I fell in love with the retro aesthetics of the Verve Culture and then, as far as manual juicers go, this offers a lot of help with the lever and stand too. Juicers are getting more and more attractive, you only have to browse through Nama or Smeg's selection to get some evidence of that. Whilst aesthetics might not sound like a key deciding factor for your appliances, it's actually really important for juicers. If you plan on juicing daily or keeping yours out on the countertop, it needs to be a style piece too. You can pick your juicier in a color that matches your kitchen scheme or you might want yours to make more of a style statement. If in doubt, black, white, and stainless steel tend to blend into all homes. Aside from color, the build of different juicers can vary significantly. For example, r looks really retro and if you can find models from their , you'll see just how colorful they can be too. , on the other hand, makes modern, minimalistic juicers that look sleek and simple. Depending on your kitchen style, you might opt for a different juicer. Juicers come in all shapes and sizes, so you'll want to think about how often you'll use it and where you'll store it before you commit to any specific models. Juicers tend to get very tall, so whilst you check the width and depth of your countertop, take special care over the height that you have underneath any cupboards. A juicer that's too tall to sit against your wall will get in the way. If you use your juicer every day and you have the space, you might keep yours on the countertop. Alternatively, if you want to tuck yours away in a cupboard or pantry, make sure that you've got space for your juicer and all of the accessories. You might also want to think about how heavy your juicer is and how much juice it can make. There are plenty of petite and portable options on the market, which are great for small kitchens (I'd recommend either the or the ). However, if you're juicing for the whole family, you might want a bigger juicer that offers more capacity. Here's a table to break down the different capacities to expect from juicers: If I had to emphasize one specific decision factor category, it's the functions and features of your juicer. If yours doesn't effortlessly meet your needs, you won't ever reach for it, rendering it a waste of money and space. You'll have seen further up that the different types of juicers lend themselves to different functions. You'll want to think about the kinds of juices you want to make when choosing which juicer to buy. If you know you'll be juicing leafy greens, wheatgrass, and ginger as well as making sorbets and nut milk, you'll want a masticating or twin-gear juicer. On the other hand, if you know you'll only use soft or citrus fruits, you might opt for a centrifugal or citrus juicer. The nutrient retention plays into the kind of juicer that you want. The slower, more expensive juicers tend to preserve your juice better as well as extracting more of the nutrients. This might not be at the top of your list of priorities, since you'll get nutrients from any juice. However, recovering cancer patients, for example, often opt for twin-gear juicers since these extract the maximum amount of nutrients. A good test for juice extraction and nutrient retention is to look at the waste pulp and the bubbles on your juice. The waste produced by a juicer should be minimal and dry. This indicates that your machine has extracted every last drop of goodness in the process. Similarly, whilst foam on top of your juice might look fun, it shows that your juice has been spun around and oxidized. This is fine if you drink your juice straight away, but it means that your juice will break down and go off within the next day or so. Another feature to consider is speed. The centrifugal juicers will make you juice in seconds. That's not even a turn of phrase, the Magic Bullet juicer made me a batch of carrot juice in 20 seconds. I have a masticating juicer at home, which is a little slower. It doesn't take more than two minutes to make up to 30 oz of juice, but if you hate waiting around, you'll want to opt for a speedy, motorized model. Juicers can be really expensive. You could spend thousands of pounds on them, but even the most expensive ones aren't necessarily bad value. If you want a cheap juicer, you can pick one up for under $100. At this price point, you'll be looking at a basic centrifugal juicer or a manual juicer. If you're happy to spend up to $250, you'll get centrifugal juicers which are more durable, with more features, and a higher juice yield. There are even some entry-level masticating juicers in this price bracket. If your budget can stretch to $500, you'll have access to high-end masticating juicers as well as some twin-gear models. These give better juice yields, higher nutrient retention, and a much better build quality. They're a larger upfront cost, but you'll get more guarantees and premium materials thrown in. If you can, I'd recommend looking around this price point. If you're happy to spend more, there are plenty of premium twin-gear and masticating juicers at this price point. Here you're getting long warranties, maximal extraction, and premium materials. However, these are often complex to assemble and clean. I recently reviewed the Tribest Greenstar 5 juicer, which falls into this category. It made the best juice I've ever had, but it wasn't without its faults. The pre and post juice work is often hidden, but it's really important to consider. More basic models won't require much assembly and they're often built from dishwasher-safe plastics, so you can throw everything in the dishwasher when you're done. As you look at masticating and twin gear juicers, you'll find that there are more parts to remove and deep clean. It can be a real faff (and I've been put off juicing because of this before), so you shouldn't underestimate the power that a big cleaning job can wield over your juicing enthusiasm. If you're new to juicing, you might not be ready to drop $700 on the elite juicers on the market. That's totally fine. You should be looking to spend up to $250 (unless you know you're going to use yours every day). Consider the space that you have on your countertops and cupboards. You might want to opt for a small, portable, or manual juicer if you're in a small kitchen, or you can go for a bigger option if you have the space for it. A key decision factor is what you'll be juicing. If you plan on juicing leafy greens, fibrous ginger, and tough vegetables, you'll need a tougher, more premium juicer. However, if you want to focus on soft fruits, a simple juicer will do the job. Also think about how much time you are happy to dedicate to assembling and cleaning your juicer, more advanced models will demand more time for you. I would recommend that someone new to juicing starts with a centrifugal model. This will be quick to make juice and can handle a good chunk of ingredients. Our buying guide for the best juicers on the market is aimed at domestic users, so all of those are perfect for home use. Generally, I'd recommend a centrifugal, masticating, or citrus juicer for your home. Twin gear juicers head towards a more commercial style of juicing, both aesthetically and practically. We've dedicated a whole article to the debate. In essence, a centrifugal juicer is quicker, cheaper, and easier to use. If you're about practicality, these are better. If you want a better yield, more nutrients, and higher quality juice, a masticating juicer is the one for you. If we take healthiest to mean the juicer which extracts the most nutrients from your fruit and vegetables, then a twin gear juicer is the best. It will make the most nutrient-dense drink of them all. Next in line are masticating juicers, which still extract a lot of nutrients from your ingredients. Then comes centrifugal juicers, which don't have quite as much extraction power.",

        "description": "Lead contamination has been found in three parks and a middle school in the East Trenton neighborhood.",
        "content": "Public health officials plan to knock on the doors of homes in the East Trenton neighborhood to offer testing for children, after three parks and a city school there tested positive for high lead levels recently. Trenton Mayor Reed Gusciora announced in January that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found lead in Grant intermediate school and in April, three parks: Sony (also spelled Sonny) Vereen Playground, Breunig Avenue Park, and Grant Avenue Playground. The EPA is coordinating cleanup, and the city wants to test the 600 students at Grant. So far, though, only 118 of them have been tested. Last week, the city’s health division and the mayor announced the door-to-door plan. The testing is free. Gusciora said the city was running into logistical issues for testing the students, from language barriers, to the requirement that a parent/guardian needs to be present for the test, which is a blood draw. So they city is working with the school district , and Isles, a city organization that specializes in lead issues, to try to get to all affected students. “This is a great opportunity to test a sample of Trenton kids and see how pervasive elevated levels are in small children,” the mayor said. If a child’s test comes back with elevated levels, the city will then inspect the child’s home, and grant money exists to have lead removed or abated, the mayor said. Lead in homes is commonly in paint on walls and pipes. “It’s also an opportunity to turn the tables...and get the lead out of Trenton once and for all,” Gusciora said. Any child in the city, no matter the neighborhood, can be tested by contacting the city’s Health division, which has a bureau dedicated to lead , and is located at 218 N. Broad Street in the city, or by phone at 609-989-3242, ext. 103. The Health division’s website can be found by clicking here. The lead in East Trenton - which is in the North Ward - is likely from decades of pottery production in the neighborhood, once called Coalport, which was known worldwide for its output from many factories.

        "description": "Vic and Andi Javeri create and innovate with handcrafted mulit-use pieces",
        "content": "From his initial assessment of pilates equipment purchased by his spouse Andi, Vic Javeri thought he could build it better. “My father built cabinetry and when I was in college I worked with him all the time...,” said Javeri. “When I started seeing the pieces Andi had coming in, I rolled my eyes and said, ‘this is ridiculous you’re paying this kind of money for this stuff.’” Vic admits now that he underestimated the level of craftsmanship that can go into the production of pilates equipment. “I was very wrong; this equipment is extremely complicated to build,” said Vic, the craftsperson behind The Pilates Architects, which manufactures handcrafted classically inspired pieces of pilates equipment. Vic and Andi run the business, with a shop in the Salmon Arm Industrial Park as well as a home-based studio filled with their equipment in Canoe, out of which Andi operates AXIS Pilates, teaching classes. With Andi providing steady input and guidance, Vic’s foray into producing reformers and other pieces of equipment began in a tent in their backyard. He said it was an expensive process of trial and error, explaining each piece represents a mix of woodwork, engineering, physics and the support of other Salmon Arm businesses when it comes to welding and some of the metalwork, upholstering and even the “Now I’d say our product is better than anybody else’s,” said Vic, who is proud of his handiwork and refers to each piece as a work of art. “We didn’t move into our own space (the industrial park shop) until we had the process nailed down tight.” Vic explained his designs are inspired by those of pilates founder Joseph Pilates. For his reformers, which are based around a bed-like frame with a moving platform inside attached to a set of springs, Vic uses European steamed beech, which he said is very dense, strong and long-lasting. For other pieces, including spine correctors he uses Baltic birch plywood. For metal, Vic employs aircraft grade aluminum.Welding is done by neighbour Alumex Manufacturing, while upholstery work is done by New Roots Upholstery. “It’s nice to find people who are compatible,” said Andi of their relationship with other Salmon Arm businesses. “It’s a relationship you need to have and they work with you so you can work with your clients.” One of the ways the Javeri’s equipment deviates from classic pilates pieces is how they are designed to serve multiple uses. For example, reformers are made to transform easily into cadillac tables. “It’s important for me that any equipment can be converted in less than 60 seconds,” said Vic, wanting the conversion process to take as little time as possible during pilates classes. Then there’s the “chairrel,” a piece unique to The Pilates Architects that serves as both a ladder barrel and a pedal stability chair. “A lot of research went into whether the pilates world would actually get their arms around it because it’s a little different than the other stuff that’s out there,” said Vic, noting interest in, and sales of the chairrel have picked up substantially since the piece was first introduced. “People would see Andi using it on Instagram or something like that and say, ‘oh, what a great idea,’ but orders weren’t coming in. The first year I thought, well, it was a great idea... and then one order turned into two, turned into 10 and it became very popular.” Another benefit of the Javeris’ multi-use pieces of equipment is that they enable instructors to have a fully equipped studio in less space. The Javeris are also proud of the working relationships they’ve developed with clients, including those seeking custom designs, and their ability to produce equipment in a relatively short time. Vic said they recently produced 16 units for a $100,000 order for a Vancouver studio. “We worked with that company through each individual component to make sure it was still our equipment but met the specific needs of their clientele,” said Vic, noting on average it takes about three weeks to construct one reformer. Andi’s studio also serves as a showroom, where people can try out their creations before buying. “It guarantees that there’s no problems – everything is where it needs to be before it goes out the door,” said Vic of custom orders. “Nobody else has that capability.” For more information, visit thepilatesarchitects.ca.",

        "description": "Autism is often a huge challenge for a family. About 85% of children diagnosed before age 5 will never be able to live independently as adults.",
        "content": "Autism is often a huge challenge for a family. About 85% of children diagnosed before age 5 will never be able to live independently as adults. This increasingly common developmental disorder is expressed by problems socializing and communicating, and repetitive and restrictive behaviors. A recent study reported by UC San Diego Today shows how digestion affects brain development. “Behavior and metabolism are linked – you cannot separate them,” says Robert Naviaux, professor in the Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics and Pathology at UCSD School of Medicine. There are large differences in the metabolic profiles of kids who are neurotypical and those who develop autism. UCSD researchers investigated 50 separate biochemiocal pathways. They found that “14 were responsible for 80 percent of the metabolic impact of autism,” according to UC San Diego Today. “The pathways that were most changed are related to the cell danger response, a natural and universal cellular reaction to injury or metabolic stress. “The body has biochemical safeguards in place that can shut down the cell danger response once the threat has passed, and Naviaux hypothesizes that autism occurs when these safeguards fail to develop normally. The result is heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and this effect contributes to sensory sensitivities and other symptoms associated with autism.” There’s been a dramatic increase in the number of children diagnosed with autism — now clinically referred to as ASD, autism spectrum disorder — since the 1960s. In the 1980s, quacks and personal injury attorneys attributed the growing number of autism diagnoses to childhood vaccinations. Bogus lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers were so costly that some lifesaving vaccines became unavailable. Congressional action in 1986 ended that emerging public health crisis. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program shielded pharmaceutical companies from these lawsuits. The public has since paid the bill — about $5 billion! — any time a jury awards compensation to a “victim” of vaccinations. So, if not vaccines, what accounts for the large rise in ASD? Most of the change is due to greater awareness of the diseases that are now grouped together as autism spectrum disorder. It was not until 1994 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) categorized autism as a spectrum; and not until 2013 that the term autism spectrum disorder was coined, combining what had been a variety of diagnoses. According to autism researcher Christina Corsello of the University of North Carolina, “Those revisions have allowed us to capture and include children who might have more mild difficulties, more subtle difficulties and less comorbid cognitive delays or intellectual disability.” In the last decade, there has been a substantial increase in the percentage of Black children diagnosed with ASD. Almost all of that can be attributed to better awareness among physicians and more widespread access to autism specialists. “As recently as 2010, white kids were deemed 30% more likely to be diagnosed with autism than Black children and 50% more likely than Hispanic children,” according to a 2023 Associated Press article. These numbers have largely reversed. “The new estimates suggest that about 3% of Black, Hispanic and Asian or Pacific Islander children have an autism diagnosis, compared with about 2% of white kids,” according to the AP story. Genetics plays a large role in autism . But another important factor in whether a child will be diagnosed with ASD is maternal obesity. “Compared with children whose mothers were at normal weight, children born to overweight and obese mothers have a 28% and 36% higher risk of developing ASD, respectively,” according to a 2016 study published in Nature . Americans are much more likely to be overweight or obese now than they were in the 1960s. According to a 2011 CDC study, in 1960-62, 24% of white women had a body mass index greater than or equal to 27.3, putting them in the overweight category. That rose to 46% during 2005-08. For Black women, the numbers rose from 42% overweight or obese (1960-62) to 66% (2005-08). “Based on data collected between 2017 and 2020, 41.9% of adults in the U.S. have obesity,” Forbes Health reported earlier this year. Children born to mothers who are obese and diabetic are “more than four times as likely to develop autism compared to children born to normal weight mothers without diabetes,” according to research published by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Even though autism does not present itself when a baby is born, there is increasing science that the disorder starts in utero. During the second trimester of a pregnancy, organization of the cortex begins. Autopsies of autistic children who have died reveal patches of disorganization in the cortex, harming cells that are needed for learning and memory. “So something must have gone wrong at or before that time,” Eric Courchesne, director of the Autism Center of Excellence at UCSD, told NPR. In a neurotypical child, the cortex will have six distinct layers, each composed of a specific cell type. However, in kids with ASD, Courchesne says, “there are patches in which specific cells in specific layers seem to be missing.” Rather than distinct layers, the brain cells appear as disorganized collections. Going forward, researchers hope to find effective treatments that, if given before symptoms appear, will perhaps fix the cortex, prevent autism or reduce its severity. That gets back to the research done by Dr. Naviaux and his colleagues, including Chelsea A. Kelland and Judy Van de Water at UC Davis. They are studying the use of a drug called suramin. When a child’s cell danger response malfunctions, they hope suramin can repair the body’s adenosine triphosphate (ATP) signals, eliminating an autistic child’s heightened sensitivity to environmental stimuli. At the same time, if we can tackle the obesity epidemic, we’d make a lot of progress in reducing ASD. — Rich Rifkin is a Davis resident; his column is published every other week.

        "description": "Two iconic marine mammals are known to call the River Thames home, but there's also a breed of venomous shark you might want to avoid if you're ever taking a dip",
        "content": "The River Thames is teeming with a variety of incredible creatures. Thanks to significant conservation efforts, the water quality has improved, leading to an increase in wildlife sightings. In 2021, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) published its first-ever State of the Thames Report. The report revealed that two marine mammal species permanently reside in the Tidal Thames - the Grey Seal (Halichoerusgrypus) and the Harbour Seal (Phoca vitulina). Both species rely on the estuary for habitat and food, with the Harbour Seals also using it as a birthing place for their pups. READ MORE: The hidden lido in London's largest park branded 'perfect little gem' Besides these two permanent residents, several other mammal species occasionally visit the estuary. As the water continues to get cleaner, these visits may become more frequent. Species like Minke and Bottlenose whales are known to make infrequent visits, while Harbour Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) are also sighted. However, there's one creature you might want to keep your distance from - the venomous Spiny Dogfish or Spurdog shark. This shark, named after the spines in front of its dorsal fin used for defence, has a pointed snout, large eyes, a streamlined body, and a greyish-brown colour on top. It also features a lighter belly and rows of white spots down its sides. The Spurdog is one of the few venomous fish found in UK waters, along with the Stingray and Weever fish. The Thames estuary is believed to be a birthing and nursing ground for sharks, thanks to the improved water quality and increased oxygen levels in recent years. But here's a word of caution for those thinking of taking a dip - the venom from Spurdogs can cause severe discomfort and swelling in humans. But there's no need to panic. These sharks aren't interested in snacking on humans and would only attack if seriously provoked. Their diet mainly consists of small fish like flounder, plaice, codling and sprats, as well as midwater swimmers like herring and small crustaceans. A report by ZSL also identified two other shark species in the Thames - the Starry smooth-hound and Tope shark. The Starry smooth-hound, which can grow up to 140 cm (55 in), is a grey or greyish-brown fish with small white spots on its upper surface and a white underbelly. It has a somewhat rounded snout and rows of shallow teeth. The Tope shark, a slender and elegant species often found close to shore, can grow up to six feet long. They feed on a variety of fish species as well as crustaceans or cephalopods when available. Tagging studies have revealed that Tope sharks can travel vast distances, with some individuals tagged in the UK later found as far away as the Canary Islands.

While it's exciting to see sharks in the Thames, the effects of climate change are worrying, and we're unsure of the impact this will have on such species. Climate change has caused London's waterway temperature to rise by 0.2C annually, and as a result, water levels in the tidal Thames have been rising since 1911, according to ZSL.

        "description": "The real story: Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas put their jurisprudence up for sale and got caught doing it. They should have been impeached and removed by now.",
        "content": "Ah, the merry month of May -- and U.S. Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito once again faces questions relating to his ethics. Well, no, not really. What's under question is his \"impartiality.\" That's a different thing entirely ... and not really a thing at all. Fake news item number one: Alito sold his stock in Anheuser-Busch InBev last year, at the same time the company found itself boycotted by \"conservative\" randos who objected to the company sending a special can of beer to a social media influencer \"conservative\" randos don't like. There's no question of insider trading or anything like that involved. Alito took a loss on his Anheuser-Busch InBev shares. Maybe he did it because he agreed with the \"conservative\" randos, or maybe he just needed some quick cash. To the best of my knowledge, there are no cases before the court relating to the conflict between Anheuser-Busch InBev and \"conservative\" randos. Fake news item number two: In early 2021, someone (Alito says it was his wife, not him) flew an American flag upside down outside the Alitos' home. That's a traditional sign of emergency or distress, and coming around the time of the January 6 Capitol riot and the inauguration of a new president, it seems to convey political overtones. But there's no law against Supreme Court justices (or their spouses) having, and expressing, political opinions. These two fake news items are fake news neither because they're necessarily untrue nor because they may not reveal political opinions the public might not like. They're fake news items because they're silly and trivial distractions from Alito's REAL ethics problems and those of his fellow justice, Clarence Thomas. ADVERTISEMENT As revealed by ProPublica last year, both Alito and Thomas accepted (and conveniently \"forgot\" to report) bribes ... er, \"gifts\" ... from wealthy friends with business before the court they sit on. In Alito's case, an expensive charter flight to Alaska and a $1,000+ per day stay at a luxury resort seemingly sufficed to buy his (non-decisive -- he was one of a 7-1 majority) vote in a case worth $2.4 billion to bribe-payer ... er, \"gift-giver\" ... hedge fund manager Paul Singer. Thomas likewise accepted unreported \"gifts,\" loans, and sweetheart property deals from the deep pockets of plutocrats with cases before the court. And he also got some fake news cover-up action focused on his wife's associations with the Cult of Trump. It doesn't bother me if Samuel Alito takes a loss on stock because he doesn't like a company's politics, or if his wife flies a flag upside down over a supposed argument with a neighbor. Nor do I think it's reasonable to expect Alito or Thomas to control their spouses' actions just because those actions are or might be \"political.\" It does bother me that the over-the-top whining about such things obscures the real story: These two Supreme Court justices put their jurisprudence up for sale and got caught doing it. They should have been impeached and removed by now. The bribes, and Congress yawning instead of acting, are the real scandals. Thomas L.

Cala Major, a public beach in Palma, on the island of Majorca, is charging up to €70 (£60) per day to use premium facilities, including luxury deckchairs and beach umbrellas. A normal set of two deckchairs and an umbrella would still set back a holidaymaker €25.50, or just under £22, for an entire day. Lawyer Toni Bennàssar, who shared a picture of the signs showing the extortionate prices at Cala Major, said that the move would price out regular Majorcans. '[The City Council of Palma] has guaranteed that Majorcans occupy the beaches for as little time as possible, so that they remain unoccupied for foreigners who can pay these prices', he wrote on X. Cala Major, a public beach in Palma, on the island of Majorca, is charging up to €70 (£59) per day to use premium facilities A tourist enjoys the weather at Magaluf beach Last month, Palma's ruling political party, the People's Party, was criticised for extending private businesses' right to monopolise public beach space (File image) Read More Brits heading to Majorca this Bank Holiday weekend face disruption as thousands of anti-tourist protesters take to the streets Last month, Palma's ruling political party, the People's Party, was criticised for extending private businesses' right to monopolise public beach space until at least April 2025. Neus Truyol, a spokesperson for the Més per Palma party, told local media that Cala Major 'has been affected by the massive placement of sunbeds and umbrellas, leaving no space for the fundamental right to enjoy the beach without paying.' He added: 'We demand that the PP inspect the occupation of sunbeds and umbrellas in Cala Major. 'We cannot subject the entire beach to the private tourist business.' Tensions between locals and holidaymakers flared over the weekend, when thousands of anti-tourism protesters paraded through the streets of Majorca , booing and jeering at foreign visitors in the first of many mass demonstrations planned by furious activist groups. An estimated 15,000 locals joined the protest that snaked through the capital Palma and headed for Weyler Square, where holidaymakers were out in force for dinner and drinks. Protesters hold a banner reading 'Mallorca is not for sale' during a demonstration to protest against the massification of tourism and housing prices Protesters carrying banners with anti-tourism slogans and banging drums gathered in the centre of the capital Palma An estimated 15,000 locals joined the protest that snaked through the capital Palma and headed for Weyler Square, where holidaymakers were out in force for dinner and drinks Protesters shout at shocked holidaymakers enjoying dinner and drinks in Palma Read More Tourists pose for photos outside Majorca club where four people died in rooftop bar collapse as residents reveal why they fear the tragedy 'will happen again' Marchers were heard chanting 'Tourists go home' as they passed through the central square on the 20-minute route from a nearby park, carrying banners emblazoned with the message: 'Salvem Mallorca, guiris arruix' which in Catalan Spanish means 'Let's save Majorca, foreigners out'. The colloquial expression 'Guiri' is used to describe the likes of British holidaymakers renowned for partying and heavy drinking, typically in a mildly offensive way. Another placard said in Catalan: 'Wherever you look, they're all guiris.' The Palma protest was organised by Banc del Temps, a group which hails from the inland Majorcan town of Sencelles and is outraged by the struggles locals face in affording homes on the island due to the higher prices owners can get for holiday rentals. Following Saturday's protest, Banc del Temps spokesman Javier Barbero issued a chilling warning. 'This is just the start of things. If measures aren't taken we will continue taking to the streets until we see action.'

The 38-year-old has led the Tractor Boys to back-to-back promotions and will bring flight football back to Portman Road next season for the first time since 2001. His exploits at the Suffolk club have made the 38-year-old a top target, and he's been linked with the vacant posts at Brighton and Chelsea in recent weeks, as well as a possible candidate to replace Erik ten Hag if was relieved of his job at Manchester United . However, according to The Athletic , the Northern Irishman is set to commit his future to Ipswich and sign a new contract to spearhead their Premier League campaign. McKenna took over at Ipswich in December 2021, when the club were in League One, and in his first full season in charge led the club to promotion to the Championship. Kieran McKenna will pen a new deal at Ipswich despite interest from several top flight clubs McKenna has led the Suffolk club to back-to-back promotions since taking over in 2021 The LMA voted McKenna their manager of the year for his achievements at this season Having got the club into the second tier, the club then repeated this season, leading Ipswich back to the Premier League after they finished in second place to gain automatic promotion. A feat made all the impressive with Ipswich finishing ahead of recently relegated sides Southampton and Leeds, and their financial benefits. The achievement was rewarded by being names the LMA's Manager of the Year earlier this month, and it has seen him linked with a number of big jobs in the Premier League. After Brighton decided to part ways with Roberto De Zerbi at the end of the campaign, McKenna was looked upon as the ideal fit to replace the Italian at the Amex Stadium. Then following Chelsea's decision to remove Mauricio Pochettino from his job, McKenna was one of the early names linked replacing the Argentine as the Blues looked for a more progressive coaching appointment. McKenna's name has heavily been linked with the possible manager's job at Man United, too, if the club decide to sack Erik ten Hag ahead of next season. It would seem him return to the club where he served as part of the coaching staff under both Ole Gunnar Solksjaer and Ralf Rangnick before he was appointed as Ipswich boss. McKenna had been linked with returning to Man United were he served as a coach previously McKenna's story at Ipswich is set to continue as they embark on their Premier League return With McKenna set to stay at the newly-promoted club, the trio of clubs will not look at other options to fill their vacancies. Chelsea, who in the last week had cooled their interest in McKenna, have now set their sights on Leicester City boss Enzo Maresca. While Brighton could make the bold move to re-appoint Graham Potter, with him still out of work following his stint at Chelsea. Over at United, Ten Hag's may have bought himself some time after the FA Cup win on Saturday, with the board set to discuss his future at a performance review later this week.

Gurman hints at a soft launch strategy for upcoming iOS 18 update, sparking speculation on AI features for core iOS apps.",
        "content": "Apple's highly anticipated Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is just on the horizon, and the tech world is abuzz with excitement as Apple gears up to unveil its latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). With recent news of Apple's collaboration with OpenAI and its keen interest in Google's Gemini model, speculation is rife about the company's AI strategy. Renowned Apple analyst , in a recent report for Bloomberg, has shed light on what to expect from the upcoming iOS 18 update, which is slated to be released initially as a Beta or Preview version before its official rollout later in September. This soft launch strategy suggests that Apple's AI innovations may still be in the oven, not quite ready for prime time. While Apple has been playing catch-up in the AI race, the company is gearing up for a significant leap forward this year to rival the likes of Google and Samsung. While has been making waves with its AI endeavors, including recent shifts towards image generation and comprehensive AI summaries, Apple is approaching its AI evolution with careful consideration. Gurman notes that the AI features expected in iOS 18 are not yet fully developed. However, there is much speculation about how AI will power core iOS apps such as Safari, Notes, Messages, and Siri. Among the anticipated features are voice memo transcription, enhanced Spotlight capabilities, and intelligent email and text suggestions. One particularly intriguing development is Apple's reported work on , allowing users to create custom emojis tailored to any occasion. This could potentially revolutionize emoji usage, offering users a whole new level of personalization beyond Apple's existing catalog of options. As WWDC approaches, the question remains: how will Apple showcase these AI features, especially given the delay in their development? Will Apple be able to catch up with leading brands, or does it still have significant ground to cover in the AI race? Only time will tell as Apple steps out of the shadows and unveils its plans for the future. Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world to know more. You are on Mint!

        "content": "DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — The weakening tropical storm Remal flooded dozens of coastal villages and left nearly 30 million people without power Monday in southern Bangladesh and eastern India. At least 10 people died in Bangladesh. About 3.7 million people along the coast were affected, said Bangladesh’s junior minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibbur Rahman. More than 35,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 115,000 were damaged. Nearly 800,000 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas on Sunday. Bangladesh, a delta nation of nearly 170 million people, has a history of violent storms. Disaster preparedness programs have upgraded the capacity to tackle natural disasters, resulting in fewer casualties. Changing climate patterns have increased storms’ intensity, making preparations more urgent. Remal weakened after making landfall in Bangladesh’s Patuakhali district early Monday, with sustained winds of 111 kilometers (69 miles) per hour. India's Meteorological Department said it was likely to weaken throughout the day, but warned of heavy showers over Assam and other northeastern states for the next two days. India's Kolkata airport reopened after being shut Sunday. Bangladesh shut the airport in the country’s second largest city, Chattogram, and canceled all domestic flights to and from the coastal district of Cox’s Bazar. Loading and unloading at Chittagong seaport was halted. Strong rain and winds battered the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. Many roads were submerged. Authorities ordered all government officials to stay at their stations until the situation improved. Aid agencies said they deployed thousands of volunteers in Rohingya refugee camps and other affected areas to provide emergency support. Bangladesh has sprawling camps housing more than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in Cox's Bazar. In India's West Bengal state, thatched roofs on houses were blown away and electric poles and trees were uprooted in some coastal districts. Heavy downpours inundated streets and homes in low-lying areas of Kolkata. All schools in the region were closed until further notice. ___ AP video journalist Al-emrun Garjon contributed to this report. Julhas Alam, The Associated Press",

        "content": "Rumored release window Expected price Design & display speculation Specs rumors The is still many months away, but leaks about the iPhone 17 lineup are already coming out in full intensity. We’ve gathered everything known about the 2026 iPhone lineup. The iPhone 17 is rumored to be a huge upgrade compared to the iPhone 16 lineup. Apple might introduce changes to the display, cameras, and even the dimensions. We might see new iPhones in slimmer-than-ever sizes and may also have to say goodbye to one iPhone model. However, the iPhone 17 lineup isn’t expected to be announced until late 2026, and a lot could change before the phones are officially revealed. We’ll update this article as new information emerges, but take everything with a pinch of salt. Rumored release window Apple hasn’t announced the iPhone 17’s launch date yet, but you can expect the new lineup to debut in 2026. The Cupertino company usually holds its smartphone launches in September, so it’s reasonable to expect the iPhone 17 to launch around the same time. For reference, the iPhone 15 was announced in September 2023, the iPhone 14 in September 2022, and the iPhone 13 in September 2021. Expected price The pricing of any smartphone depends a lot on the prices of its components and the cost a company has to put into research and development. Apple has so far been pretty consistent with the iPhone prices, but we might see a slight price increase with the iPhone 17. reported that the production costs for the iPhone 15 were higher than those for the iPhone 14 models. Apple absorbed the increased costs to keep the prices the same as the iPhone 14 series. It might not do the same for the iPhone 16 or iPhone 17 series. Design & display speculation All recent iPhones have debuted with almost the same design as their previous generation models. This is to change with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, and we might see even more drastic changes on the iPhone 17 lineup. Apple might have big changes in store, at least for the iPhone 15 Plus. In a post shared on X, display industry expert the “iPhone 17 Plus” will be equipped with a smaller screen than the current-generation iPhone 15 Plus, which has a 6.7-inch display. Related: The iPhone 15 Plus has the same screen size as the iPhone 15 Pro Max. One reason why Apple could be trimming down the Plus model might be to further differentiate it from the Pro Max model, starting with the iPhone 17 lineup. Another reason could be to discontinue the phone entirely and replace it with an iPhone 17 Slim. In a research note with investment firm Haitong, analyst Jeff Pu Apple is planning an “iPhone 17 Slim” model that would replace the Plus model in the lineup. Pu said this model will feature around a 6.6-inch display and a slimmer design. Pu reports that the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Slim, and iPhone 17 Pro models will ditch the usual aluminum design for a more complex one (details yet to be revealed). The iPhone 17 Pro Max will stick with the titanium build. It will also sport a slimmer notch at the top of the screen, thanks to a new “metalens” technology that shrinks the Face ID sensor. The other iPhone models will keep the current notch size. Here are the expected display sizes of all four models, according to Pu: The Elec that the iPhone 17 and 17 Plus (or 17 Slim) will receive upgrades in their display technology. Both the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus models stick to a 60Hz panel, and the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are expected to do the same. However, the iPhone 17 models might feature a 120Hz refresh rate, which Apple calls the ProMotion screen. The smartphones will also support an always-on display feature. Specs rumors In terms of performance and specifications, Pu reports the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Slim might come with 8GB of RAM and either an Apple A18 or A19 chip. The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to feature up to 12GB of RAM with an A19 Pro chip. Right now, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus come with 6GB of RAM, while the Pro models, the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, bump it up to 8GB. This year, Apple is expected to offer 8GB of RAM across the board for the iPhone 16 lineup, making things uniform. However, Pu suggests Apple will bring back different RAM tiers with the launch of the iPhone 17 in 2025. On top of that, the analyst says all iPhone 17 models will pack a whopping 24MP front-facing camera. This is a major jump from the current 12MP selfie snappers Apple uses. This upgrade aligns with a previous , who earlier mentioned the iPhone 17 getting a 24MP front camera.",

        "content": "Publicité Digested week 27 mai 2024 19:27 Commentaire(s) Par Marie Claire Lassémillante Partager cet article Facebook X LinkedIn WhatsApp Digested week The speaker «on his feet», admonishing the leader of the opposition in Parliament last Tuesday. Each session of the national assembly brings its share of clashes and “unparliamentary” expressions. After the «collect him» incident, the speaker told the opposition leader to «rest in peace!» last Tuesday. The latter retorted, «you are a shame to democracy» and «not worth to be a speaker» before being expelled. His expulsion together with three colleagues, without counting the whip and veteran MPs for many sessions, puts into perspective the role and behaviour of an increasingly controversial speaker... Introduction Tension escalated between speaker Sooroojdev Phokeer and opposition leader Shakeel Mohamed on Tuesday, May 21, at the National Assembly. It ended up with the “naming” and subsequent expulsion of Shakeel Mohamed, with the speaker ordering the Serjeant-at-Arms, as he had done with opposition veteran MPs, Paul Bérenger and Rajesh Bhagwan, to “collect this man.” The altercation began during the Private Notice Question to minister of commerce Dorine Chukowry regarding the price of medicines and the measures to curb this increase. The opposition leader asked why the recommendations of the 2023 report on the market study to allow parallel importation of medicines had not been implemented. He was to make it public later in the afternoon since the minister had refused to table it. This was followed by a commotion, with Phokeer inciting the opposition to stage a “walk-out” and subsequently naming and expulsion of Labour MP Mahend Gungapersad. Decoding politics Every Friday on a video podcast called “Décryptage”, La Sentinelle (LSL) publications director Nad Sivaramen, political analyst and press veteran Subash Gobine, and journalist Shelly Carpayen comment the political news. Last week, the focus was on the style and role of the speaker of the National Assembly. Nad Sivaramen immediately labelled Sooroojdev Phokeer as a “bully speaker,” stating that the situation had never stooped so low and had indeed hit rock bottom. Subash Gobine highlighted that the speaker is bent on protecting the prime minister (PM) Pravind Jugnauth and his ministers, while ensuring that the parliamentary opposition is downtrodden and demobilized with a series of expulsions. Traditionally, the opposition held ministers accountable, but this speaker seems to exercise a dictatorship. Ultimately, the question was whether the speaker is acting as an agent of the Mouvement socialiste mauricien (MSM) led by Pravind Jugnauth? Nad Sivaramen thus recalled that Phokeer was the MSM campaign manager in constituency No. 10 for the last legislative elections and behind Labour leader Navin Ramgoolam’s defeat in that constituency. His reward may have been his appointment as speaker. He then drew a parallel with Sir Harilal Vaghjee, a speaker who made history and commanded respect from all sides. Parliament at that time was characterized by intellectualism, culture, and strict adherence to formality and respect. Sir Harilal avoided any familiarity with MPs, referring to them only by their constituencies – not with crude remarks like “look at your face” directed at MP Rajesh Bhagwan and said 11 times in a row in August 2021. There was a consensus around a single person. “He never yelled. Quite the opposite of Phokeer. I don’t believe it’s the position that makes the man, but in the case of Sir Harilal Vaghjee, it’s the man or the person that makes the position” , said Nad Sivaramen. Subash Gobine then mentioned that Phokeer may have become a source of embarrassment and created many discontented members within the MSM. Therefore, it wouldn’t be surprising if attempts were made to “get rid of the Phokeer phenomenon” as speaker before Parliament dissolves... However, the veteran journalist thinks that Phokeer could also be an asset after the Budget presentation at the Committee of Supply stage to expedite the process. He also mentioned how the opposition wishes to amend the law so that the speaker is an elected member to limit the damage caused by Phokeer or ensure that the next speaker be accepted by all. “A sort of Vaghjee formula.” He then referred to the live broadcast of parliamentary proceedings that have become “a national disgrace”. All permissible limits have been exceeded and ultimately, the MSM is being tainted by the dictatorial actions of an out-of-control speaker... (From L to R) : Labour MPs Boolell, Mohamed and Gungapersad – all three named and expelled at different times by the speaker – met the press last Tuesday. Innovation and discrimination The rate of suspensions and expulsions is accelerating. Questions are being removed, and supplementary questions prohibited. Not to mention the lengthy responses from ministers, often off-topic, and the refusals to answer for various reasons. Speaker Phokeer began removing questions indiscriminately as early as 2023, such as those scheduled for July 18, 2023, from MPs Patrick Assirvaden, Farhad Aumeer, and Osman Mahomed, all related to the Commissioner of Police (CP) hiring private lawyers instead of free ones from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). It was then stated that the reason for rejection was that a case was before the courts and therefore sub judice . Contrary to the reason given to Patrick Assirvaden, Phokeer gave a less elastic interpretation of the sub judice concept on April 16, 2024, to justify admitting a Prime Minister’s Question Time from Joanne Tour (B/159) on the case of the Labour Party leader Navin Ramgoolam’s safes, although it is before the court. Paul Bérenger and Rajesh Bhagwan were “named” and expelled from Parliament following heated exchanges with Phokeer and suspended for the next six sessions. During parliamentary questions, MP Joanna Bérenger was suspended for the next three sessions for “lying,” according to the speaker, about remarks made against PM. Meanwhile, MPs Stéphanie Anquetil and Ariane Navarre- Marie were expelled for remarks against the speaker. All this on the same day. In fact, in 2024, the speaker had stepped up his actions. At resumption of parliament on March 26, he made one of his famous announcements referring to press statements by MPs Ehsan Juman, Farhad Aumeer, and Arvin Boolell, who had complained that their questions were rejected without explanation. He invoked Standing Order (SO) 27, which states that the speaker is the sole judge of whether a question is admissible or not. In that case, the rejected questions were rather embarrassing for the government. Phokeer deemed it appropriate to add that any member whose question is refused should discuss it privately with the speaker, implying not with the press. Interpreting Article 21 (4) of the SO in his own way, Phokeer decreed that if a member wants to contest the rejection of their question, they must do so privately with the Speaker – by letter or verbally – and not during a parliamentary session. On May 7, when Arvin Boolell wanted to ask a supplementary question about Silver Bank, the Speaker introduced a new rule: “It is the speaker who thinks whether it is fit and proper to ask a supplementary question.” On the same day, opposition whip Patrick Assirvaden was expelled and suspended for the next six sessions for refusing to apologize “for writing a letter to the speaker” about the drawing of lots for parliamentary questions. Phokeer found the letter offensive and did not allow the Labour MP to explain. On May 14, to support his claim that the Kistnen Papers were merely a “karné laboutik,” Pravind Jugnauth stated that Kistnen’s widow did not recognize her late husband’s handwriting in the agenda. The PM was relying on a press article. The speaker allowed this, whereas a few minutes earlier, Alan Ganoo had advised Phokeer to forbid Shakeel Mohamed from citing press articles in Parliament. Mohamed also wanted to know if the PM had been questioned about swearing a false affidavit. For the speaker, one cannot ask a question to the PM as an accused. The same day, Franco Quirin wanted to ask a supplementary question to the Minister of Sports about the recruitment of the national football coach. The Speaker prevented him, stating that it was his prerogative to decide whether supplementary questions could be asked. Contacted, Franco Quirin explained that through his main question, he wanted to know, among other things, the criteria used to choose the coach. “The Speaker forbade any supplementary questions before even knowing the content. When I asked for explanations, he expelled me.” The MP lamented: “It’s a poor minister dodging the question and a poor goalkeeper attacking the opposing player instead of the ball, to use a football analogy.” On May 14, to justify the non-implementation of a specialized court to handle drug cases, Maneesh Gobin explained that among other reasons, it was not the courts delaying the suspects’ trials, but the police investigation taking time. Aadil Ameer Meea wanted to ask another supplementary question: “Yes, I know. Of course, it is enquiries that take the time, but very often, the Court also takes time to give conviction. It is not only...” The speaker intervened, not allowing the MP to finish his question: “Let the Hon. Minister reply!” thus preventing Ameer Meea from asking his question and doing it himself. Arianne Navarre- Marie intervened: “You are putting the question in his place!” Phokeer was miffed and retorted: “You, keep quiet!” Navarre-Marie was stunned: “You, keep quiet too!” The speaker ordered her to walk out. Navarre-Marie: “Keep kicking women out! Asking questions for us!” The speaker: “This is not the way to talk to a speaker.” Publicité Les plus récents Publicité 27 mai 2024 20:37 Tennis: Nadal éliminé par Zverev au premier tour de son possible dernier Roland-Garros 27 mai 2024 20:00 La bosse du commerce des musulmans à Rodrigues 27 mai 2024 19:27 Black tuesday for parliament with a “bully and goalkeeper” speaker 27 mai 2024 19:00 Marcel Cabon, mémoires d’outre tomes 27 mai 2024 18:56 La COI en quête d’une reconnaissance internationale vivement recherchée 27 mai 2024 18:19 Une synergie innovante pour un tourisme durable à Rodrigues 27 mai 2024 18:10 Accès facilité pour les PME à des logiciels sur le cloud 27 mai 2024 18:00 Les femmes centenaires: ces guerrières au grand cœur 27 mai 2024 17:45 Yamal et Cubarsi retenus par l'Espagne, pas Asensio 27 mai 2024 17:00 Quand les gangs redéfinissent la justice Publicité",

        "content": "Temperatures rose above 52 degrees Celsius (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh, the highest reading of the summer and close to the country’s record high amid an ongoing heatwave, the met office said on Monday. Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said. In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters. The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers. But with the current heatwave, shops are seeing almost no footfall. \"The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,\" Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town. \"I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.\" Close to Ali's shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop's shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water. “Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,” Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, said at a news conference on Friday adding that the government is running awareness campaigns due to the heatwaves. The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54 C (129.2 F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said Sardar Sarfaraz, Chief Meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological Department The heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in Sindh, including the capital, Karachi - Pakistan's largest city. Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Cheered by several thousand spectators, scores of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of London, since at least 1826, and the sport of cheese-rolling is believed to be much older. The rough-and-tumble event often comes with safety concerns. Few competitors manage to stay on their feet all the way down the 200-yard (180 meter) hill. This year’s hill was especially slippery and muddy after recent rain. Members of a local rugby club lined up at the bottom to catch the tumbling competitors. Tom Kopke from Munich, Germany won one of the three men's races. He said attitude was more important than technique. \"You start and then the adrenaline takes over and you just go, go go,\" Kopke said. \"Look at this event, look at this hill,\" added the muddy, breathless winner. \"England is mad. I love it.\" Local competitor Josh Shepherd and Dylan Twiss from Perth, Australia won the other two men's downhill races. Abby Lampe from North Carolina triumphed in the women’s race with a lighting-fast roll that left the rest of the field far behind. \"You just have to roll,\" said Lampe, a graduate of NC State who also won in 2022. \"There’s a little bit of pain, but it’s just going to be temporary.\" Dozens of children and adults also competed in safer and slower, but no less grueling, uphill versions of the race, which are traditionally held on a late-May national holiday. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) away in the town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) over a 240-yard (220-meter) course up and down steep Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972, drawing on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. A volcano on the remote Indonesian island of Halmahera erupted on Monday spewing a grey ash cloud six kms (four miles) into the sky, the country's volcanology agency said, adding it had issued a warning for aviation authorities managing local flights. This follows a series of eruptions this month after authorities noticed an uptick of volcanic activity since April, leading to evacuations of people from seven nearby villages. \"The ash column is seen to be thick and grey and moving westward,\" the agency said, adding the eruption occurred at 3 a.m. local time (7 p.m. GMT) and recommending that a seven-km (4.35-mile) radius be cleared. Footage shared by the agency on Monday showed the volcano spewing ash that grew thicker and eventually obscured it. The agency also issued a \"red\" color code warning to local aviation authorities on Monday, the highest of its kind due to ash exceeding six kms in height, its website stated. It previously raised the alert level of the volcano to the highest on its scale on May 16. Ibu's activities follow a series of eruptions of different volcanoes in Indonesia, which sits on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\" and has 127 active volcanoes. Flash floods and cold lava flow from Mount Marapi, one of the most active in West Sumatra province, covered several nearby districts following torrential rain on May 11, killing at least 62 people with 10 people still missing. In recent weeks North Sulawesi's Ruang volcano has erupted, spewing incandescent lava. The eruption prompted authorities to evacuate more than 12,000 people on a nearby island. Pilgrims arriving in Saudi Arabia for this year’s Hajj season will benefit from a well-organized transportation system. The system ensures pilgrims safe and comfortable travel between Makkah and Medina, enhancing their spiritual journey. In the past, pilgrims traveled between Makkah and Madinah on camelback, a journey that took almost 10 days. Now, with cars and buses, it’s down to about 6 hours. But with the “Haramain High Speed Railway,” pilgrims can make the trip in just 135 minutes. Once on board, pilgrims have everything they need for a comfortable journey, allowing them to focus on their worship and prayers. The railway project, one of the largest in the Middle East, is providing around 1.6 million seats on 3,800 trips for pilgrims and visitors this Hajj season. The train stations in Makkah and Madinah are conveniently located near the holy sites. With a capacity for 60 million passengers a year and speeds of up to 300 kilometers per hour, the railway meets the increasing demand for transportation services. At the train stations in the al-Sulaymaniyah district and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Asharq Al-Awsat observed smooth passenger traffic. Local staff warmly welcomed the pilgrims, assisting them with inquiries and guiding them to departure lounges while informing them of train schedules. Passenger journeys start with quick procedures, checking reservations and luggage allowances. Passengers then move to the departure lounge and to their seats, which are comfortable with individual screens. The train provides services for business class and support for passengers with special needs. Operations run with 35 electric trains, each carrying up to 417 passengers. These trains have 13 carriages, five for business class and eight for economy, all equipped with food vending carts. Many travelers praised the top-notch care they received upon arriving in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the Haramain High Speed Railway. The pilgrims appreciated the “excellent and outstanding” services that made traveling between the two holy cities easier. E-services let travelers book early, check schedules, and choose departure stations. The smooth running of train journeys and punctual schedules across different stations show how well the teams manage the numerous daily trips along the electric railway track. Stations are located in Makkah, Madinah, al-Sulaymaniyah district, King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, and King Abdullah Economic City station in the Rabigh governorate. The stations’ architectural design is inspired by the landmarks of Makkah and Madinah, reflecting their Islamic and unique architectural styles. The stations offer various traveler services like parking, e-booking, ticket counters, and assistance desks. The station at King Abdulaziz International Airport is the world’s largest airport-connected train station, covering over 105,000 square meters with multiple floors and six platforms, making it easy for travelers heading to Makkah or Madinah. Since its launch in 2018, the Haramain High Speed Railway’s success has made booking, scheduling, and travel between the holy sites easier for a growing number of passengers. Built with high-quality standards and safety features, the train plays a crucial role in Saudi Arabia’s railway network development and expansion plan. In a cowshed in Gaza's Khan Yunis, zookeeper Fathi Ahmed Gomaa has created a temporary home for dozens of animals including lions and baboons, having fled with them from Israel's offensive in Rafah. \"We've moved all the animals we had, except for three big lions that remain (in Rafah)\", he told Agence France Presse. \"I ran out of time and couldn't move them.\" Ahmed abandoned his zoo in Rafah when Israel ordered the evacuation of parts of the southern Gazan city. Before the offensive, the city on the border with Egypt had been spared a ground invasion and more than half of the Gaza Strip's population was sheltering there. \"I am appealing to the Israeli authorities: these animals have no connection to terrorism\", Gomaa told AFP, saying he wanted their help in coordinating with aid agencies to rescue the lions left behind in Rafah. He fears they won't survive long on their own. \"Of course, within a week or 10 days, if we don't get them out they will die because they'll be left with no food or water.\" Gomaa said he had already lost several of his animals to the war. \"Three lion cubs, five monkeys, a newborn monkey and nine squirrels,\" he said. And while the squawking of parrots fills the air, many of Gomaa's other birds are no longer with him. \"I released some of the dogs, some of the hawks and eagles, some of the pigeons and some of the ornamental birds. I released a lot of them because we didn't have cages to transport them.\" In the cowshed, Gomaa is making do with what he has, using improvised fencing to raise the heights of the pens so that their new inhabitants, spotted deer, can't leap out. The Soudah Development Company, a subsidiary of the Public Investment Fund, announced the birth of three ibexes in the \"Red Rock\" area within King Abdullah National Park in Soudah. These new arrivals follow the release of 23 ibexes into the natural areas last year in collaboration with the National Center for Wildlife (NCW) as part of the company's initiative to release endangered animals and the center's program to breed and re-localize wildlife species, reported the Saudi Press Agency on Sunday. Previously, the NCW released two mothers who recently gave birth to the ibexes in the \"Red Rock\" area. The third mother, approximately two years old, was born in an enclosed area before being released into the project area in February 2023 and recently gave birth in the park, contributing to the increase in ibex numbers within the protected area. Currently, Soudah Development Company is monitoring nine ibexes and providing a suitable environment for them to live in the park's \"Red Rock\" area. CEO of Soudah Development Company, Eng. Saleh Al-Oraini, stressed that these births represent a significant step towards re-localizing endangered species and enhancing ecosystems in the region. He also highlighted the company's steadfast commitment to the goals of the Saudi Green Initiative and its contribution to the sustainability of the local environment and biodiversity in the Soudah Peaks. In a Beirut car park, migrant workers cheer as their teams face off in a cricket tournament, a moment of respite in crisis-hit Lebanon, where working conditions are often tough. \"Sunday we are so happy... We eat together, we laugh together,\" said cricketer Pradeepa Silva, a 42-year-old Sri Lankan, as she and her teammates prepared coconut rice and other traditional food nearby to share. \"Work is very tiring\" and workers are stressed and worried, said Silva, who is employed as a housemaid six days a week and pays for her daughter's university studies back home. Every Sunday, players mainly from Sri Lanka but also from the Philippines, India and Pakistan gather in Beirut's Ashrafieh neighborhood to play cricket -- a little-known sport in Lebanon. Migrant workers are employed under Lebanon's controversial \"kafala\" sponsorship system, which rights groups have repeatedly denounced saying that it enables a wide range of abuses. On May 19, several hundred people gathered for a tournament that also brought together traditional food stalls, a DJ playing Bollywood hits and other music, teams from the British and Sri Lankan embassies and young Syrian refugee players. Iris Sagario from the Philippines ran onto the field for the Roaring Lions women's team, wearing an orange and blue shirt with her name printed on the back. \"I love cricket,\" said the 43-year-old, who works as a housekeeper. \"I'm very excited to play every Sunday\" -- her only day off. After winning their match, Sagario's team broke out into cheers, hugging and high-fiving each other. They went on to take the women's trophy. - 'Lord's of Lebanon' - More than 160,000 migrants from 84 nationalities were in Lebanon last year, according to a report from the International Organization for Migration. With daily bombardment in south Lebanon as Hezbollah and the Israeli army clash amid tensions over the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, some foreign embassies have advised their nationals to leave the country. \"At first I was worried\" but \"my sir (employer) assured me that all is good,\" said Sagario, who was also in Lebanon in 2006, when Israel and Hezbollah last went to war. \"I'm choosing to stay because... I don't know what I'll do if I go back to the Philippines. I want to give financial (help) to my family,\" she said. Curious passersby sometimes peered over a tumbledown stone wall to watch the matches. Organizer Fernando Sugath, 52, from Sri Lanka said some players nicknamed the car park they have been using for around two decades \"Lord's of Lebanon\", a reference to the famous Lord's cricket ground in London, which is known as the \"home of cricket\". Matches in the car park were halted for five years when the players lost access to the site but resumed in 2022, Sugath said. His team changed its name to the Saint Joseph Cricket Club in honor of the neighboring church that helped them return to the site. - 'Let them have some freedom' - Migrant workers at the cricket match \"are very lucky that they've got some good employers who give them the Sunday off\", said Sugath, who first came to Lebanon in 1996 as a cleaner and is now an administrative assistant. Rights groups have long criticized Lebanon's restrictive sponsorship system, saying it facilitates exploitation and leaves migrant workers at the mercy of their employers, amid persistent reports of physical and sexual abuse, unpaid wages and long work hours. Sugath appealed to all employers to give workers \"at least one hour, two hours off on Sunday... Let them have some freedom, let them use the phone, call their families\". As the men's competition kicked off, big hitters began smashing the ball into the trees lining the car park as fielders scrambled for a catch. Majid Satti, 39, from Pakistan, captains the Eleven Brothers team -- with five players from Pakistan and six from India -- which came runner-up in the men's tournament. Their two countries have long had a strained relationship, but \"we have no issue... we are all like brothers here,\" said Satti, a concierge who has been in Lebanon for 15 years. Vice-captain Raju Singh, 41, from India, said the players \"never think about\" politics. An electrician by trade, Singh wore his team's traditional cricket whites, with long white trousers and shoes, and was among those in charge of the coin toss to decide which teams would field or bat first. The Lebanese 500 lira coin he used, valued until 2019 at around 35 US cents, is now worth less than a single cent following Lebanon's economic collapse, during which some migrant workers were abandoned by their employers and others pushed to leave the country. Singh said he loved cricket and travelled almost 30 kilometers (20 miles) each week for the Sunday games. \"When we finish (and) we go home, we are waiting for next Sunday,\" he said. The \"abab\" plant, also known as \"Saudi ginseng\" or \"ashwagandha\", has returned after a 20-year absence in the deserts of the Northern Borders Region, the Saudi Press Agency said on Sunday. This evergreen shrub with yellow flowers has reemerged, alongside other wild plants. In an interview with SPA, Director of the Amana Environmental Association in the region Nasser Rashid Al-Majlad, said that the area's rich green wealth presents economic opportunities. By utilizing natural plant resources, the region can enhance biodiversity, combat desertification, expand green spaces, promote tourism, and foster human development. Al-Majlad said that these efforts align with the principles of the green economy, which aims to strike a balance between economic and environmental needs for the benefit of both humanity and the planet. Khonaysser Al-Anazi, a plant enthusiast, said the abab plants on the outskirts of Arar city reappeared due to increased rainfall and the expansion of green areas. He highlighted the potential for cultivation and utilization of these plants for various purposes. The estimated number of wolves in France last year was 1,003, down nine percent from the year before, environmental associations said earlier this week, urging the French government to lower its quota for the number of the animals which can be killed each year. The drop in the predator's population is the first in almost ten years, according to loupfrance.fr, a site managed by France’s biodiversity authority. \"This new estimate reinforces the finding that the species' conservation status is not good,\" the six conservation groups wrote. The current quota allows for 19 percent of the French wolf population to be legally killed. But an administrative source close to the matter —- who confirmed the 1,003 figure —- told AFP that current hunting limits would be maintained, allowing for \"209 wolves\" to be culled, AFP reported. The percentage is \"based on the estimated population at the end of the winter, which was 1,104,\" said the source, asking not to be named. The number of wolf attacks is also on the rise, added the source. For their part, agricultural groups argue culling nearly one-fifth of the predator's population is still too low to prevent what they say is a growing number of attacks on livestock. Wolves had vanished from France but began returning in the 1990s, with farmers saying they suffered 12,000 attacks on their animals in 2022. \"For 2024, we're expecting to see an increase in the number of reports and victims,\" said a representative for France's sheep farmers group, Claude Font. \"If we hold at 19 percent of the estimated wolf population, we're not going to stop the number of sheep being killed,\" he said, calling for political action at the highest level to increase the percentage. But for League of the Protection of Birds (LPO) president Allain Bougrain-Dubourg, \"wolves are being sacrificed on the altar of agricultural demagoguery\". In addition to authorised hunting, \"we're seeing an upsurge in poaching and poisoning\", he told AFP. The National Wolf Group (GNL) meeting, scheduled for Friday, will bring together environmentalists, elected officials, civil servants, the agricultural industry, and hunters. But several environmental groups pulled out of the organisation in September 2023, deeming the government's 2024-2029 wolf plan \"unacceptable\". The proposition calls for increased support for farmers dealing with livestock loss from wolf attacks, simplified population culling, and an overhaul of the current counting system, which is an estimate drawn up by France's biodiversity authority. The wolf is categorised as \"strictly protected\" in the European Union, but France's new plan raises the possibility of reviewing the animal's status. In September 2023, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen warned that \"the concentration of wolf packs in some European regions has become a real danger for livestock and potentially also for humans\". For conservation groups, however, the dip in the wolf population is a clear sign that efforts to protect the predator are falling short. The government must \"stop advocating downgrading the species’ level of protection\". Germany's health minister, Karl Lauterbach, plans to introduce stricter rules to curb the sale of nitrous oxide, sometimes known as laughing gas, especially to young people. The drug, which is used in medicine as an anaesthetic and for pain reduction, has become a particularly popular party drug among young people in Germany. The sale and consumption of nitrous oxide is not restricted under current law, dpa reported. \"We will come up with a regulation quickly,\" Lauterbach told public broadcaster ARD on Friday. Among the possibilities is including nitrous oxide in the list of psychoactive substances, which come with very strict rules for sale and possession. He said that a complete ban would not be possible because nitrous oxide is used for industrial purposes as well. \"We are now tackling this very quickly,\" assured the minister. Until the government takes action, Lauterbach recommended that parents educate their children: \"It may sound fun and harmless, but it's not,\" the minister warned. Regular consumption could lead to accidents or even neurological damage, and permanent damage cannot be ruled out either, he said. \"It's very dangerous for children and young people,\" said Lauterbach. More than 10,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Britain in small boats so far this year, updated government data showed on Saturday, underlining a key challenge facing Prime Minister Rishi Sunak ahead of a July 4 national election. The number of people landing on England's southern beaches after making the dangerous Channel crossing fell by a third in 2023, but the latest numbers on a government website showed 10,170 arrived between January and May 25, up from 7,395 over the same period last year. Sunak, who announced the election date on Wednesday, said later this week that asylum seekers who come to Britain illegally would not be deported to Rwanda before the vote - casting doubt on one of his Conservative Party's flagship policies, Reuters reported. The plan has been bogged down by legal obstacles for more than two years, and the opposition Labor Party, which is about 20 points ahead in opinion polls and seen on track to end 14 years of Conservative rule, has promised to scrap the policy if it wins the election. Labor's shadow immigration minister Stephen Kinnock said Sunak's government had not done enough to tackle the issue. \"Because all the government's efforts are now focused on getting a few hundred people flown to Rwanda, they have lost sight of the thousands more who are crossing the Channel every month,\" Kinnock said in a statement. Labor has said if elected it would create a Border Security Command that would bring together staff from the police, the domestic intelligence agency and prosecutors to work with international agencies to stop people smuggling.",

        "content": "The Shippers’ Councils of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have expressed confidence in the operations of Ghana’s ports on transit trade. They expressed their confidence when a delegation from the councils paid a working visit to the management of the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA). They affirmed their loyalty to Ghana’s ports despite fierce competition in the transit trade sector in the West Africa sub-region. The delegation also used the visit to tour the modern GPHA Unity Terminal, which is being considered to serve transit operations in Ghana. Colonel Ibrahim Souley, the Director General of the Nigerien Council of Public Transport Users, speaking on behalf of the councils, expressed hope of the many opportunities that the Unity Terminal might bring to the transit trade in the region. He said their mission was targeted at prospecting the possibilities of establishing a stronger relationship with the Tema Port and seizing opportunities for their economic operators. He said the GPHA’s presentation on their facilities showed that there were numerous opportunities and facilities available to effectively handle transit cargo for the landlocked countries. He added that it was evident that the Tema Port was putting in efforts to provide excellent transit business, which he said they were impressed about. Mrs Sandra Opoku, the Director of Tema Port, briefing the delegation on the port’s operations, said GHPA has put in place several initiatives to enhance and expand transit business through Ghana’s ports. Mrs Opoku said their transit customers had been an important part of Ghana’s trade for a long time, and therefore the ports always want to open their doors to them to ensure that they get the best facilities that could be offered.",

        "description": "\"It is widely known that the mayor does not support the chief of police.\"",
        "content": "BENNETTSVILLE, S.C. ( ) – If the tension between Bennettsville’s city hall and the city’s top law enforcer wasn’t tight before, it is now. Last week, Chief Kevin Miller filed a lawsuit against the city administrator and city leaders, accusing the administrator of targeting him to force the chief out of his job. It was no secret that former Mayor Carolyn Prince, who was in office when the city hired Administrator William Simon Jr., wasn’t a fan of her police chief. Prince’s dislike for Miller was documented in a police assessment published by city hall in February. “It is widely known that the mayor does not support the chief of police,” said Stephen Campbell, an assessor with Legal and Liability Risk Management, a risk assessment firm the city paid $22,500 to issue an opinion on the department’s policies and practices. LLRMI compiled a 46-page report and delivered it to the city in February. The report misspelled the former mayor’s name, writing “Mayor Caroline Prince.” “During the interview, she affirmed that widely held belief herself,” Campbell wrote, continuing to describe the former mayor’s feelings toward the chief. Prince didn’t think Miller had “the experience” to be the chief of the Bennettsville PD. “She has not spoken to the Chief in nearly four years,” Campbell wrote in his report. Prince was defeated as mayor in November 2023. Prince would not agree to schedule an interview with us or to provide a statement for this report. Simon also declined our interview request, and no other member of the council responded to our request to interview them about the chief’s suspension and lawsuit. The city redacted multiple pages and names of four former officers who gave statements to the assessor, which are included in the report. “There appears to be little support for the chief of police. A frequent concern was low morale and lack of leadership,” Campbell wrote. However, we spoke with two former BPD officers: Bob Hale and Dozier Rhames. Both men said the assessment mischaracterized their interviews and that their statements weren’t meant to be as harsh as the report detailed. The chief is “...vindictive, egotistical, and a narcissist,” Rhames is quoted in the assessment, saying he left “solely because of Chief Miller.” Rhames said he “is adamant” he never called the chief vindictive, “I don’t remember using those exact words, but I won’t say I didn’t,” Rhames told QCN’s Chief Investigative Reporter Jody Barr during a May 24 phone call. “I’m adamant that I didn’t say it; if I did say it, I stand corrected. Rhames, who left BPD in 2023, is now a captain with the McColl Police Department and is currently on administrative leave pending the outcome of a S.C. Law Enforcement Division (SLED) investigation into a use-of-force complaint against him from McColl. Rhames said he expects the state investigation to soon end and he’ll be back to work. Rhames said he stands behind his comments to the assessor that Miller fostered a “toxic work environment,” but that Chief Miller wasn’t his only reason for leaving BPD. Miller, he said, promised Rhames a K-9 handler position that would allow him to earn 17.5 hours of overtime each week, but the chief never kept that promise, according to Rhames. Despite his belief that BPD was a toxic work environment, Rhames filed an application to return to the agency in January, a few months after his interview with the outside assessor. Bob Hale also left BPD in 2023 and took over as chief of the McColl PD, where he remains today. “I left because of the bad culture created by Chief Miller. Chief Miller created a cesspool of a work environment,” Hale told the assessor. Hale told QCN in a phone call on May 21 that he wouldn’t “explicitly rule out” returning to BPD to work under Chief Miller. “I’ve told several people that if circumstances were different, I’d go back,” Hale said his decision to leave BPD wasn’t all on the chief. “I can’t put that all on the chief. It was a position where I could be a chief, get training and make some connections. It did weigh on my decision, but I can’t put it all on the chief,” Hale said in the call. Hale said he stands behind his statement on the work environment at BPD, as well as his belief that Chief Miller is “arrogant.” In January, just a few months after giving those statements to the assessor, Hale texted Chief Miller, asking for the number of open positions at BPD. Miller, who would not see the officers’ statements in the assessor’s report for another month, said he asked Hale who wanted to come back. Hale told QCN he was asking the question to find positions for the three other officers who left BPD with him when he took over the McColl PD. Miller said Hale also asked for a job for himself, something Hale denied in the call with Barr. “They [the city] shouldn’t have leaked out the names. It makes it seem like I hated Kevin Miller, and that’s not the case. It comes across extremely personal and that’s not what I wanted to convey,” Hale told Barr about the assessment. That assessment led to Chief Kevin Miller losing a week’s pay in March. City records show Administrator Simon sent Miller a copy of the assessment on Feb. 16, writing in the internal memorandum that he wanted to use the assessor’s opinion for good, “This is a fantastic opportunity for us to make improvements,” Simon wrote. The memo included a list of next steps, which included meetings between Miller and Simon. Miller told Barr that those meetings never happened and that the administrator told him in person that the assessment wouldn’t be used against him. On the order of city hall, acting Assistant Chief Sammy Crosland went to Miller’s home on March 4, 2024, and confiscated Miller’s gun and badge. Miller was locked out of his own department from March 4 until March 12, 2024. But the chief believes a Queen City News investigation that aired the night of that assessment email, his refusal to write a reference letter for Simon’s fraternity brother, and a series of other events led to the administrator’s decision to use the assessment against him. That decision has led to Kevin J. Miller v. The City of Bennettsville and William Simon Jr. This video report contains the chief’s story and the evidence he believes shows he was a target for standing up and speaking out.",

Here's why it's proving popular Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Sky's innovative Glass TV is changing the game for UK households with its dish-free, internet-powered streaming service. Currently on offer, this 4K screen delivers sports, movies, and entertainment straight to your living room, and its easy setup has made it a hit. However, Sky Glass does come with a catch - adding extra channels can bump up the monthly cost to £26, potentially leading to higher bills. But now there's Freely, a new player in the streaming market that won't cost you a penny. Launched just last month, Freely comes packed with features like a comprehensive TV planner, live pause capability, and personalised recommendations. It even offers a Mini Guide for a quick peek at what's currently on and next. For those enticed by the prospect of free live TV streaming without an aerial, numerous TVs now come with Freely pre-installed, mirroring Sky Glass's approach. These TVs are gaining traction fast, reports the Mirror . Retail giant Argos recently announced price reductions on these cutting-edge TVs, and it seems customers can't get enough. Some Freely-equipped models are listed as \"in demand\" and \"selling fast.\" Take, for example, the Hisense 50 Inch 50E78NQTUK Smart 4k UHD HDR TV. Its launch price earlier this month was £599 but that's already been slashed to just £379. • SEE THE DEAL HERE If that sounds a bit big for your living room there's also a deal on the Hisense 43-inch Freely television which is now just £329 - down from £519 • SEE THE DEAL HERE There are plenty more Freely-powered screens available as well - see the full list below: SEE THE DEAL HERE Hisense 50 Inch 50E78NQTUK Smart 4k UHD HDR • WAS £599 - NOW £379 SEE THE DEAL HERE Hisense 43 Inch 43E78NQTUK Smart 4K HDR UHD QLED TV • £519 - NOW £329 SEE THE DEAL HERE Hisense 65 Inch 65E6NTUK Smart 4K UHD HDR LED TV • £799 SEE THE DEAL HERE Hisense 55 Inch 55U7NQTUK Smart 4K UHD HDR Mini-LED TV • £1,299 SEE THE DEAL HERE These new TVs are clearly enticing but remember they can't match the might of Sky Glass. Bonus features on Sky's connected telly include the ability to save shows to watch at a later date, personalised recommendations and full integration with all the best streaming platforms such as Netflix. There are also more live channels to watch and Sky Glass gets a soundbar built-in for improved audio. Right now, you can get Sky Glass for as little as £11 per month thanks to a new sale launched by the firm. Full details below. Apple is launching new tablets with a refreshed iPad Air and all-new iPad Pro hitting UK stores. The iPad Air now boasts a more powerful M2 chip housed within its aluminium chassis, increased standard storage, new colours, improved connectivity and extended battery life. For the first time, this tablet also comes in two sizes including a standard 11-inch display and a much larger 13-inch panel. If you're looking to go Pro, there's a significant upgrade with the 2024 range featuring a super slim design, a greatly enhanced OLED screen that's brighter and an incredibly fast M4 processor which makes these tablets faster than most PC laptops. One deal that piqued our interest comes from Sky who are offering the 11-inch Air with Wi-Fi and Cellular from just £17 per month with no upfront fee and 100MB of data included as well. You can learn more about the iPad Air deal on Sky's website here. This deal is based on a 48-month contract, with the total cost over four years coming to £816 - in comparison, the same tablet from Apple costs £749, but this doesn't include any data and requires an upfront payment. Sky also offers other deals, including the 13-inch Air for £21 per month or the Pro for £27 per month. As we've previously noted, Sky isn't the only network offering iPads on contract, with Vodafone and EE also providing customers with the option to purchase these devices via a monthly plan.

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Children’s Day: IPGI urges Nigerians to build children’s capacity for peace Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Children’s Day: IPGI urges Nigerians to build children’s capacity for peace Published on May 27, 2024 By Esther Chisom As Nigeria marks the 2024 International Children’s Day, the Idimuwem Peace and Governance Initiative, IPGI, has called on Nigerians to build children’s capacity for peace and effective conflict management. Convener of IPGI Peace Art Competition, Uduak-Abasi Akpabio, who made the call at the Peace Tale Competition, on Monday in Abuja, said children remain an important element for peace in Nigeria in the long term. Akpabio stressed that children aged 8-10 can indeed engage on issues of peace and conflict, adding that if the nation must build capacity for peace and effective conflict management, it has to start early and start with children and young people. According to her, the conversation on peace is an important issue for Nigeria given the security challenges in some parts of the country but that conversation must also begin with children. “We realise the importance of starting early to build capacity among our citizens for peace, effective conflict management and good governance. “Yes, there’s a lot of stabilization work going on in places that had violent conflicts to stabilize the country, but we realise that an important element in the long term, to build capacity for peace and effective conflict management is to start early and to start with children and young people. “That’s one of the mandates and initiatives of IPGI; the peace art competition is targeted at children aged 8-10. We realise that children can indeed engage in issues of peace and conflict. We can build the capacity of children, but we need to use a medium that children understand engage and enjoy. “While we advocate for peace education, we’ve put together books that can be used for peace education curriculum for children. “It’s important to reinforce every messaging, give opportunities for children to think through the different concepts and in this year, we are going to be looking at the theme unity in diversity,” she said. On her part, the Programmes Officer of a youth-based non-governmental organization, Youth Alive Foundation, Precious Essien, said understanding and practising conflict resolution from a very young age will help children to develop personal and social harmony. Essien stressed that conflict resolution is a vital key in life and equips young people with the ability to navigate disagreements and build healthier relationships, adding that the peace art competition aligns with the objectives of the foundation. While saluting every child on the occasion of the 2024 Children’s Day celebration, she described children and their unique abilities as an essential part of human society. Earlier, a representative of the Embassy of Belgium in Nigeria, Chilotam Chibundu, stressed that the goal of peace was shared by artists of all ages, and by diplomats, stating that “when the guns are silenced, diplomats negotiate and sign the peace.” Chibundu, who is also the Political and Economic Officer at the embassy, said art was essential in depicting peace even at the United Nations level. “As they say a picture says more than a thousand words. That is why you will be challenged to capture Peace in an image, rather than in words. As it happens, Belgium has tried to do as much as just five years ago when the country campaigned to earn a seat in the Security Council of the United Nations. “Building peace, both within the United Nations and in our daily lives, is always a work in progress. It will be your job now to depict it in your own language of lines and colours. Good luck with that! The Embassy of Belgium is eagerly awaiting to contemplate your works of art,” she said.

        "content": "The larger-than-expected Rs 2.11 lakh crore dividend by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the government should help to ensure the 5.1 per cent of GDP deficit target for the fiscal year ending March 2025 (FY25) will be met and could be used to lower the deficit beyond the current target, says Fitch Ratings. The new government’s budget following the release of election results in June is likely to be presented in July and it will determine how the dividend will be used. The government has signalled it aims to narrow the deficit gradually to 4.5 per cent of GDP by FY26. Sustained deficit reduction, particularly if underpinned by durable revenue-raising reforms, would be positive for India’s sovereign rating fundamentals over the medium term, said the global rating agency. Last week, the RBI announced a record-high dividend transfer to the government equivalent to 0.6 per cent of GDP (Rs 2.11 lakh crore) from its operations in FY24. This is above the 0.3 per cent of GDP expected in the FY25 budget from February, so will aid the authorities in meeting near-term deficit reduction goals. An important driver of higher RBI profits appears to be higher interest revenue on foreign assets, though the central bank has not yet provided a detailed breakdown. In its post-election budget, the new government has two alternatives. First, the government could opt to keep the current deficit target for FY25, and the windfall could allow the authorities to further boost spending on infrastructure, or to offset upside spending surprises or lower-than-budgeted revenue, for example from divestment. Alternatively, all or part of the windfall could be saved, pushing the deficit to below 5.1 per cent of GDP. The government’s choice could give greater clarity around its medium-term fiscal priorities.",

        "description": "With June right around the corner, Quebec residents should prepare to receive a set of new benefits and credit payments from both the Government of Canada and Retraite Québec.Inflation is high and the cost of living in Quebec is soaring, so it's no surprise that many residents are looking for ways to earn extra money, whether through work or financial assistance programs from the Canadian and Quebec governments. A few of the benefits being paid out in June include the Canada Child Benefit, Quebec Pension Plan and Quebec public-sector pensions.It's important to verify your eligibility for many of the benefits and credits being sent out this month, as you could be entitled to thousands of dollars. Here are six government benefits and credits to look out for: Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)The Québec Pension Plan (QPP) is a mandatory public insurance plan for workers aged 18 and over with annual employment income exceeding $3500, providing basic financial protection in retirement, death, or disability, according to Retraite Québec. The QPP, similar to the Canada Pension Plan, consists of a base and an additional plan since 2019. The additional plan raises the income replacement rate from 25% to 33.33% and increases the maximum pensionable salary to 114% of the maximum pensionable earnings by 2025. In 2024, contributions to the QPP are 10.8% for the base plan and 8% for the additional plan, both split equally between employers and employees, while self-employed workers cover both portions. All contributions are collected by Revenu Québec.Payment Date: June 28More about the Quebec Pension PlanCanada Pension Plan (CPP)The CPP retirement pension is a monthly, taxable benefit that partially replaces your income upon retirement and is payable for life if you qualify, the Canada Revenue Agency indicates. To be eligible, you must be at least 60 years old and have made at least one valid contribution to the CPP, either through work in Canada or via credits from a former spouse or common-law partner. In 2024, the maximum monthly amount at age 65 is $1,364.60, while the average monthly amount for new retirees at that age in January 2024 was $831.92. The exact amount you can receive depends on your individual circumstances.Payment Date: June 26More about the Canada Pension PlanOld Age Security (OAS)The Old Age Security pension is a monthly payment available to Canadians aged 65 and older. Service Canada may automatically enroll you if sufficient information is available, notifying you of your enrollment status. If not automatically enrolled, you may need to apply after turning 64. Employment history does not affect eligibility, so you can receive OAS even if you have never worked or are still working. To qualify, you must be a Canadian citizen or legal resident, have resided in Canada for at least 10 years since turning 18 if living in Canada, or for at least 20 years if living outside Canada.Canadians aged 65 to 74 years can receive up to $713.34 per month, while those aged 75 and up can receive $784.67. Payment Date: June 26More about Old Age SecurityCanada Child Benefit (CCB)The Canada Child Benefit, administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, is a tax-free monthly payment to help eligible families with the cost of raising children under 18. It may include the child disability benefit and related provincial and territorial programs.

A few of the benefits being paid out in June include the Canada Child Benefit, Quebec Pension Plan and Quebec public-sector pensions. It's important to verify your eligibility for many of the being sent out this month, as you could be entitled to thousands of dollars. Here are six government benefits and credits to look out for: The Québec Pension Plan (QPP) is a mandatory public insurance plan for workers aged 18 and over with annual employment income exceeding $3500, providing basic financial protection in retirement, death, or disability, according to Retraite Québec. The QPP, similar to the Canada Pension Plan, consists of a base and an additional plan since 2019. The additional plan raises the income replacement rate from 25% to 33.33% and increases the maximum pensionable salary to 114% of the maximum pensionable earnings by 2025. In 2024, contributions to the QPP are 10.8% for the base plan and 8% for the additional plan, both split equally between employers and employees, while self-employed workers cover both portions. All contributions are collected by . June 28 The CPP retirement pension is a monthly, taxable benefit that partially replaces your income upon retirement and is payable for life if you qualify, the Canada Revenue Agency indicates. To be eligible, you must be at least 60 years old and have made at least one valid contribution to the CPP, either through work in Canada or via credits from a former spouse or common-law partner. In 2024, the maximum monthly amount at age 65 is $1,364.60, while the average monthly amount for new retirees at that age in January 2024 was $831.92. The exact amount you can receive depends on your individual circumstances. June 26 The Old Age Security pension is a monthly payment available to Canadians aged 65 and older. Service Canada may automatically enroll you if sufficient information is available, notifying you of your enrollment status. If not automatically enrolled, you may need to apply after turning 64. Employment history does not affect eligibility, so you can receive OAS even if you have never worked or are still working. To qualify, you must be a Canadian citizen or legal resident, have resided in Canada for at least 10 years since turning 18 if living in Canada, or for at least 20 years if living outside Canada. Canadians aged 65 to 74 years can receive up to $713.34 per month, while those aged 75 and up can receive $784.67. June 26 The Canada Child Benefit, administered by the Canada Revenue Agency, is a tax-free monthly payment to help eligible families with the cost of raising children under 18. It may include the child disability benefit and related provincial and territorial programs. To qualify, you must live with a child under 18, be primarily responsible for their care, be a Canadian resident for tax purposes, and you or your spouse must meet specific residency or citizenship criteria.

        "content": "UKRAINE has conducted its deepest ever drone strike into enemy territory Russia, flying a kamikaze drone more than 1,120 miles inside Russia. Kyiv's kit buzzed Vladimir Putin’s cliff-top £1 billion Black Sea palace , sparking explosions in two nearby villages. Dzhanhot, close to the sprawling Gelendzhik Palace and Krinitsa - which could also belong to the dictator - were hit. The explosions landed just seven and four miles respectively from the heavily guarded palace . It showed an impressive new milestone by Ukraine - marking the furthest an unmanned attack aircraft has been flown during the war. The result also showed a serious weakness in Russia 's air defences - in a humiliating result for the tyrant. One of the drones was reportedly aiming for a nuclear early warning radar station in Orsk, the Orenburg region. Another Voronezh M long-range nuclear missile radar station in Krasnodar was previously targeted - sparking fury in Moscow. Kyiv believes the radar stations are used for military purposes against Ukraine in the war. Fire damage was clearly visible at buildings linked to the Voronezh radar station in Krasnodar, a £13.15 million base providing radar coverage for 3,750 miles. A source in Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence said: \"The Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicle covered a distance of over 1,800 kilometres to the enemy object, setting a new record for the range of kamikaze drones .\" Russian sources reported that a UAV \"crashed near Orsk\" and the target of the drone “was possibly a military facility”. Dmitry Rogozin, 60, a pro-Putin senator, former deputy prime minister and ex-head of the Russian Space Agency raged that the targeting of radar stations would spark nuclear tensions. He said: “We stand not only on the threshold, but already on the edge, beyond which, if the enemy is not stopped in such actions, an irreversible collapse in the strategic security of nuclear powers will begin.” And Rogozin - who as Russian space agency chief played a key role in the testing of the Satan-2 - or Sarmat - rocket, Russia 's most powerful weapon, blamed the US. He snarled: “Washington has ordered a crime, hiring an irresponsible bandit trying to damage our missile attack warning systems facility,.” He also threatened World War 3: “We can assume....that it was carried out on Kyiv’s own initiative or on the orders of some military maniac of the Ukrainian Armed Forces who wants to spark a Third World War.\" A satellite image shared by Radio Svoboda is reported to show traces of fire damage at the radar station near Orsk. Another drone attack reportedly hit the same area near Vlad's palace last week - in what could be a bid by Ukraine to rattle Putin. Putin's crony governor in the Krasnodar region, Veniamin Kondratyev, scrambled to claim that that Russian air defences had neutralised all incoming drones . He said: “Air defence has neutralised all drones. “Drone debris damaged an unfinished building in the Krinitsa village. “A drone fell on trees in the Dzhankhot village, the fire has been put out.” Belarus opposition channel NEXTA said: \"The target of Ukrainian drones could be Putin's palace in Gelendzhik..... “Krinitsa is home to vineyards and a winery that may belong to the residence of the Russian dictator.” The drone news come amid reports Putin’s is revamping his palace after he suffered embarrassment over its original decor. He is getting rid of his pole-dancing bedroom and installing a church with a “throne” for his personal use. The dictator, 71, was stung when investigative journalists discovered gaudy Gelendzhik palace overlooking the Black Sea three years ago. Amid a scandal over misuse of state funds, the Kremlin claimed it belonged instead to his friend Arkady Rotenburg, 72, who told reporters he was creating a sumptuous “apart-hotel”. Out goes the dictator's notorious striptease stage and pole-dancing hookah hall, casino, gaming room and ‘aqua disco’, for which he was mocked and shamed in the 2021 disclosure.",

        "content": "A man died after I didn't speak up, and I still feel guilty about it, says DR SCURR. But second opinions aren't enough to save lives - it's the culture of hospitals that has to change By Dr Martin Scurr Published: 16:55, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:41, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments The tragic death of 13-year-old Martha Mills following poor, possibly negligent care at a major London hospital brought back bitter memories of the death of one of my own patients. It also confirmed for me why, sadly, the plan to introduce Martha’s rule — which would give every patient in hospital the right to a second opinion from other experts at the same hospital — won’t help. In February, the Government announced that hospitals in England were to be offered funding to roll out the rule. Already 143 have signed up, it was reported today, and should be operating the scheme by 2025. Martha’s parents have been heroic in their efforts to try to spare others the awful, needless loss of a loved one . Martha's rule follows the tragic death of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who died after developing sepsis in 2021 under the care of King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South London But Martha’s rule, while laudable, cannot, I am afraid, do one thing that’s vital to its success: and that is to change our hospital culture . I don’t mean just that people are afraid to speak up, to challenge the hierarchy of senior doctors, for that is still an issue (although it is improving, slowly). I mean the lack of continuity of care — no longer taking full responsibility for a patient for their whole hospital ‘journey’ — which came when the structure of hospital care changed from the late 1990s. There’s no doubt that when you have concerns, questioning the doctor is an entirely acceptable and justified approach. And it can save lives. I have never forgiven myself for not intervening more aggressively on one of my own patient’s behalf, with hindsight knowing that if I had, he would have survived. The only way to stop preventable deaths occurring in the NHS is to change our hospital culture, writes Dr Martin Scurr He’d taken himself to A&E — as in Martha’s case, to a top London hospital (although a different one) — on a Friday night with a high temperature, rigors (sweating and shivering) and severe pain down one side of his abdomen. Yes, he was nearly 90 and had type 2 diabetes and a history of heart surgery, but until the day he fell ill with a kidney infection, he’d been able to work — full time. Always dressed in a three-piece suit and the upright bearing of a gentleman, he was the image of how many of us would like to be seen at that seniority: elegant and cognitively intact. But when I went to the hospital to see him on the Monday afternoon after my morning appointments — with three days’ beard growth, desperately ill with developing sepsis, dehydrated and now slightly confused — he was lying parked in a corner bed, where he’d spent all weekend on a small dose of an antibiotic, by mouth: with sepsis he should have been on an antibiotic drip. I was worried about his state and I phoned the consultant (the ward staff were unhelpful, but I found the name of the consultant over the head of the bed). The consultant told me that as it was nearly 5pm, the patient would now be handed over to a new team. That was where I should have intervened — even though as just his GP, I had as much authority as any loved one. What my patient needed was immediate intensive care, but as I suspect many medics would do, I deferred to the hierarchy — I was treading on territory where I had no mandate, hoping instead that the consultant would inform the colleague who was about to take over, about my concern. But I should have stepped over that invisible line. For while those who cared for him in the real world knew this man in his normal, healthy and magnificent self, the hospital team clearly viewed him as a pre-terminal geriatric with a urinary infection. He died the next day having received minimal care with nobody keeping an eye on him to witness his rapid deterioration. I took his death very badly. I felt very guilty that I had not intervened more successfully. As I see it, a major contribution to this sort of tragedy is fragmentation of care — lack of continuity under one single hospital team. This is the result of the loss of the old system where care was provided by a traditional ‘firm’, a team headed by one or two consultants with senior registrars (just below the level of consultant), registrars, senior house officers (two to three years out of medical school) and housemen (recent graduates from medical school). Read More 'Changing the culture of the NHS': As Martha's Rule comes into force, what it means for you and your loved ones - and the complete list of hospitals already signed up In the old ‘firm’ system there was accountability going up through each level of the team: the most junior members saw the most of the patients and when things went badly, they aired their concerns with the next level up; for example, to the registrar, who may well discuss with the senior registrar, and at times the consultant was then involved. This might sound like a recipe for ‘group think’, a sort of mindless consensus of opinion — but my argument would be that the recurrent audit and introspection about whether the right action is being taken countered that. Also, it was not unheard of for a consultant or senior registrar to make a decision to ask another team to come and have a look — a sort of joint team meeting. The sense of responsibility of the firm meant you would often see the senior doctors pop in on the weekend if they were worried about a particular patient. But in my patient’s case, the old type of ‘firm’ had long gone (the victim of the shift in power to management and new restrictions on working hours). It was a weekend and so there was probably only one harassed junior doctor around, there was no Saturday ward round, probably nobody came to see my patient at all unless maybe one of the nursing team called the duty doctor to come along, who may have then shrugged their shoulders and noted that this was an old person on their way out... The old tight-knit team — caring for patients right through the duration of their period of treatment, holding full responsibility — has evolved into what we have now, with experience and increasing responsibility (and full accountability) lost. We will never get the genie back into the bottle and no amount of increased regulation or Care Quality Commission inspections and sanctions can possibly achieve the diligence of the past. Nor will a legal framework, Martha’s rule, enforcing the option of a second opinion when requested. Despite its undoubtedly good intentions, driven by such heartbreaking and needless tragedy, I believe that such a rule will be a non-starter: fiddling while Rome burns.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: North Korea on Monday said the launch of its new military reconnaissance satellite failed as the engine exploded in flight. The attempt came just hours after Pyongyang issued a warning that it would try to launch a satellite by June 4, in what would have been its second spy satellite in orbit. \"The launch of the new satellite carrier rocket failed when it exploded in mid-air during the flight of the first stage,\" the deputy director general of North Korea's National Aerospace Technology Administration said in a report carried by state media. North Korea launched a projectile southward from its western coast around 10.44pm (1344 GMT), as reported by the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Just two minutes after liftoff, a significant amount of debris from the rocket was detected in the sea, according to the JCS. The object, propelled by North Korea, vanished over the Yellow Sea , stated Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi during a press briefing, noting that the government assumes no breach of outer space. Hayashi condemned the launches as violations of pertinent Security Council resolutions, highlighting the threat they pose to public safety. Video footage aired by Japanese public broadcaster NHK captured what seemed to be an orange dot ascending into the night sky before erupting into flames near the border shared by China and North Korea. An official from Japan's defense ministry informed journalists that the flames' hue in the footage hints at the use of liquid fuel, though further analysis is pending, NHK relayed. The launch site was traced to Dongchang-ri, a northwestern region housing North Korea's primary space launch facility, as per the JCS. On Monday, the Japanese government issued an emergency alert advising southern residents to seek shelter from a potential North Korean missile threat. However, the warning was rescinded shortly afterward, as the missile trajectory was not anticipated to cross Japanese airspace.

        "content": "Report Washout at Beckenham between SE Stars and Western Storm Heavy rain ruins Bank Holiday Monday clash in Charlotte Edwards Cup ECB Reporters Network 27-May-2024 • 52 mins ago Phoebe Franklin prepares to bowl • Getty Images for Surrey CCC Western Storm 38 for 3 vs South East Stars - match abandoned Torrential rain washed out all hopes of a positive result between SE Stars and Western Storm in their Bank Holiday Monday clash at Beckenham. Only six overs were possible in which time the visitors reached 38 for 3 before the heavens opened, drenching the outfield and leaving pools of water on the bowlers' run-ups. Umpires James Tredwell and Fiona Richards gave the ground every chance to recover, calling for a 4.45pm inspection, but a further shower left them no alternative but to abandon the game. Both sides take two points meaning Stars are still unbeaten while Storm are yet to win in the campaign. In the little play before the rain there was a lovely moment for Tilly Corteen-Coleman and a dazzling piece of fielding from Stars' all-rounder Paige Scholfield. England U19 slow left-arm spinner Corteen-Coleman, currently on a pay as you play contract with Stars gave the hosts the perfect start, bowling Alex Griffiths with the first ball of the game. Shortly afterwards, Tash Farrant removed Emma Corney, the batter's attempted pull shot coming off the toe end of the bat for Phoebe Franklin to take a good catch falling forward at mid-wicket. Then just before the rain arrived, Niamh Holland, who'd struck some fine boundaries square of the wicket chanced her arm on a short single to Scholfield and paid the price, the South African pulling off a direct hit despite only having one stump to aim at.

        "content": "Home | Bhadradri Kothagudem | Issue Of Violation Of Traditions In Bhadradri Lord Rama Kalyanotsavam To The Fore Again Issue of violation of traditions in Bhadradri Lord Rama Kalyanotsavam to the fore again Hearing the petitions Justice NV Shravan Kumar in an order dated April 15, 2024 directed the principal secretary of the Endowment Department to constitute a five-member committee to verify the spiritual customs, traditions and sthalapuranam. By Telangana Today Published Date - 27 May 2024, 09:26 PM Bhadrachalam (Kothagudem): The issue of improper addressing of Lord Rama as Ramanarayana during religious rituals at Bhadradri Temple has come to the fore again. Three writ petitions were filed by Kancherla Venkata Ramana, GTV Manindhar and Jamalapurapu Srinivas Rao as Endowments Department, Commissioner of Endowments, Kothagudem district Collector, Sri Seetha Ramachandra Swamy Devasthanam Executive Officer and the chief priest of the temple the parties regarding the issue. Hearing the petitions Justice NV Shravan Kumar in an order dated April 15, 2024 directed the principal secretary of the Endowment Department to constitute a five-member committee to verify the spiritual customs, traditions and sthalapuranam. The committee was also directed to verify what was the Gothram and Pravara revered during Kalyanotsavam before 2012 and after. In view of the above development the temple Executive Officer L Rama Devi issued a circular on May 25 asking the templesthanacharya, 21 priests including, the chief priest, deputy chief priests,priests and nine vedic pundits to submit a report regarding the matter by May 26 to submit the same before the Endowment Commissioner by May 28. The contention of the petitioners was inappropriate recital of the Pravara (Invocation of the illustrious ancestors) and Gothram (Clan/original ancestor) of the principal deities of the temple during the performance of the annual celestial wedding (Kalyanam) of Lord Sri Rama and Seetha on Sri Rama Navami. The priests were now reciting/chanting the nameof Lord Ramaas “Rama Narayana” instead of “Ramchandra Swamy” during the Sankalpam. Further the traditional practice of reciting “Ramachandra swamine Varaya” has been replaced with “Ramanarayana Swamine Varaya”, the petitioners said. It might be recalled that on 17 April, 2019 the members of Bhadradri Parirakshana Samithi launched a signature campaign against alleged violation of religious traditions by the priests at the historic Sri Seetha Ramachandra Swamy Devasthanam.

        "content": "With the Odisha unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) terming the role of CEO over the arrest of Khordha MLA candidate Prasanta Jagadev as ‘unbiased’, the accusations of a man who drove the car in which the arrested leader was travelling on the day of election has raised many eyebrows. The driver identified as Banamali Behera from Ghatikia village on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar today alleged that he was pressurised by police to act as an official witness to the alleged vandalisation of EVM. “I was standing near my vehicle (OD-02 Y-7053) last night when a cop came near me and asked me to meet his higher-up, who was sitting in a white-coloured SUV. I was taken to a location between Ghatikia and Khadagiri in the police vehicle. Initially, I was charged with careless driving,” Banamali said. “Had you been to Begunia on May 25 with Prasanta Jagadev and others in this car during polling,” the driver stated quoting the cops. Prasanta Jagadev broke the EVM on the intervening day or not, the cops questioned the car driver. “I cannot say anything on the alleged vandalisation of EVM Sir!, as I have not seen anything and was standing near my vehicle,” Banamali said in his reply to the policemen. “I was then roughed up and scolded over my ignorance. While three policemen discussed something at a furlong away from me, a cop told me that I must act as an official witness,” the driver expressed. “The cop pressurised me and I was threatened to implicate in a false case. After, under pressure and with much reluctance, I assured them of acting as an official witness, the cops allowed me to go home. I walked down the road back home at around 10.30 PM,” Banamali added. Also Read: Meanwhile, in a presser held here, senior BJP leader and spokesperson Pitambar Acharya brought fresh allegations against Khordha sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Dillip Das. “SDPO Dillip Das is a mining mafia. He made the BJP MLA candidate (Jagadev) sit on the floor at the police station as if the latter was a culprit. This is a gross violation of police norms. He did this, acting on the directives of Chief Minister Patnaik and the CM’s Special Secretary DS Kutey,” Acharya alleged. “On-duty presiding officers and several others were pressurised and their statements were recorded to suit the fabricated needs. Why the CCTV footage is not being made public?” Acharya questioned. “The entire incident was sponsored by BJD goons. Jagadev had been to the booth as a candidate to verify the polling process. He was misbehaved by police there,” the BJP leader further said. Taking to her personal ‘X’ handle and embedding a visual in it, Bhubaneswar BJP MP candidate Aparajita Sarangi wrote, “Please listen. This explains the foul game of Police yesterday. MLA, Sri Prasanta Jagadev is in jail when there is no evidence, while BJD MLA, Chhendipada, Angul, whose acts of violence are in the public domain, is enjoying fresh air. Will Sri @Naveen_Odisha answer?” Pl listen. This explains the foul game of Police yesterday.

        "description": "President Joe Biden delivered a Memorial Day address at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance.",
        "content": "In observance of Memorial Day, hundreds gathered at the Arlington National Cemetery to pay their respects to those who fought for the United States. The ceremony began with the traditional wreath laying. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. For Biden, it marking a solemn occasion that is personal for the commander in chief. United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, who served more than four decades, was among the speakers at the 156th National Memorial Day Observance. During Biden's remarks, he acknowledged how difficult it is to lose a child. The president said this week marked nine years since he lost his don Beau Biden to brain cancer. The ceremony continued as hundreds waved American Flags during an interpretation of \"God Bless America.\" The president on Monday morning also hosted a breakfast in honor of Memorial Day with administration officials, military leadership, veterans and Gold Star family members. The day is also personal for the president - Biden has frequently drawn on the death of his son, Beau Biden, from brain cancer that he believes was linked to the toxic burn pits Beau Biden was exposed to during his tour in Iraq. Thursday will mark the ninth anniversary of Beau Biden's death. In a personal and political win in 2022, Biden signed the bipartisan PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits to millions of veterans who were exposed to burn pits, which were used to burn waste - including trash, munitions, hazardous material and chemical compounds - at military sites throughout Iraq and Afghanistan until about 2010. These massive open-air burn pits often operated at or near military bases and released dangerous toxins into the air that, upon exposure, may have caused short- and long-term health conditions, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The president's remarks come just two days after he delivered the commencement address at West Point, where he pointed to the United States' role \"as the indispensable nation, the world's only superpower, and the leading democracy in the world.\" \"From the very beginning, nothing is guaranteed about our democracy in America,\" Biden told the graduating cadets. \"Every generation has an obligation to defend it, to protect it, to preserve it, to choose it. Now, it's your turn.\" It also comes as Biden prepares to travel to Normandy, France, in two weeks, where he's slated to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day. The speech comes at the beginning of what is expected to be a busy period of campaigning ahead of the November election. Biden's opponent in that race, former President Donald Trump, marked Memorial Day in a Truth Social post in which he attacked E. Jean Carroll and the judges who have presided over his defamation, civil fraud and criminal hush money trials. \"Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country,\" Trump said in the lengthy social media rant. The annual event is free and open to the public, according to the",

Podcast By Tum Balogun Published: 11:52 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 11:58 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments German police are set to introduce a robust five-point plan to ensure they are equipped to deal with any security threat during the European Championships next month, according to reports. The much-anticipated tournament gets underway in Munich on June 14 with a clash between the hosts and Scotland at the Allianz Arena. The fixture will see the first portion of the expected 2.7million fans expected in stadiums and up to 12m in fanzones and other areas across the ten host cities. German police are stepping up their preparations and will particularly target five 'perpetrator groups' - terrorists, violent hooligans, travelling criminals, including thieves and serious criminals - according to Bild . The outlet claim that a total of 22,000 federal police will be deployed at borders, stadiums, public viewing areas, airports, railway stations and sensitive areas of the critical infrastructure every day.

Additionally, there is a ban on police holiday during the month-long tournament. Bild report that law enforcement are especially concerned about the risk of hooligans during the European Championships. In March, Mail Sport reported that thousands of football fans have been banned from following England in Germany under a UK government clampdown. Read More Cocaine and booze-fuelled young England fans are a concern for German police at the Euros - and law enforcement need serial hooligan Tommy Robinson like a hole in the head, writes IAN HERBERT Over 1,600 fans with football banning orders will be forced to surrender their passports to the police from 4 June until the European Championship final on 14 July to ensure they do not attempt to attend matches. Anyone failing to hand in their passport or attempting to travel to Germany will face a large fine or prison term, with a maximum sentence of six months. The new powers to enforce fans to surrender passport were introduced following a surge in football-related violence in recent years, with police making 2,264 arrests at matches last season and issuing 682 new banning orders, the highest figures since 2011. Meanwhile, Bild report that German hooligans are preparing for riots, with them seeing the event as a 'home game' where 'presence' must be shown. One source is quoted as saying: 'The hooligan and ultra scene in particular has an increased potential for aggression and an affinity for violence. Particularly away from official venues, disruptive actions must be expected - if the opportunity arises.' One source told Bild: 'The hooligan and ultra scene in particular has an increased potential for aggression and an affinity for violence' In March, Mail Sport reported that thousands of England fans have been banned from travelling to Germany for the duration of the Euro 2024 tournament As a result, fan groups that are particularly hostile will reportedly be assessed internally as a 'red game' during the European Championships, with security measures being increased to handle the threat. Measures such as threat speeches, reporting requirements, bans on entering areas, expulsions and detention will be utilised. Furthermore, identified violent troublemakers will not be allowed to buy tickets.

        "content": "OKLAHOMA CITY ( KFOR ) – To improve training and the focus of air traffic control trainees (ACT), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has tapped University of Oklahoma researchers to study their heart and brain activity. The hope is that it can help them understand how to teach them to handle everyday stressful situations. “It’s a complicated job. It can be very stressful,” OU professor of psychology and lead researcher Dr. Eric Day said. “Air traffic controllers have a lot of demands on them.” LOCAL NEWS: OESC accepting applications for disaster unemployment assistance; 5 new counties added Working in the ATC towers is no easy gig. They help planes get off and onto the ground, manage traffic flow, and guide pilots while providing critical information. Day said they are researching the best ways to get them to focus in those moments. “We really want to help these trainees get through the process and be successful,” Day said. The FAA is tapping OU for this study after Congress passed Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization to enhance the aviation workforce among other things. It will discover information about heart and brain related activity as they accomplish a task. “We, at the same time measure their brains activity using this net,” Day’s colleague and fellow professor of psychology Michael Wenger said. “This has 128 electrodes on it that all sit on the scalp.” Wenger said they sit them at a desk and close the door to block out outside noise and light. Then, they have them play a first person shooter video game. “We’ve been using this task for over a dozen years,” Day said. “Among the many things we’re looking for is the way in which attention shifts when an unexpected event occurs,” Wenger said.

        "content": "Ladies dealing with diabetes often face a sticky situation with high blood sugar levels, and unfortunately, this tends to trigger urinary tract infections (UTIs). Read on to know how diabetes leads to UTI symptoms. Diabetes is a non-reversible health condition that is caused by unmanaged or unregulated blood sugar levels. The condition not only weakens the immune system but also leaves you open to various infections, including UTIs. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), are bacterial invasions happening anywhere down the urinary tract (kidneys, ureters, bladder, urethra). In today's article, we highlight and understand the unusual link between these two conditions and various home remedies that can come in handy when trying to control sugar levels affecting the body's defense against infections. Why Do Diabetic Individuals Frequently Encounter UTIs? Here are some of the reasons why a diabetic is more prone to suffer from Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) than others: High sugar levels, also known as diabetes, can hamper the function of white blood cells, the body's defense mechanism against infections. This is one of the main reasons why a diabetic patient is more prone to bacterial infections like UTIs. A diabetic patient is prone to releasing high amounts of glucose through their urine. This is exactly when the patient catches a bacterial infection, resulting in UTIs. Diabetes can affect your nerves which can hamper your bladder's performance. This entire thing can result in the bladder holding on to urine, giving bacteria a conducive environment to multiply and possibly leading to UTIs. Uncontrolled diabetes reduces blood flow to the urinary tract, affecting how the body clears out bacteria. This environment is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria, resulting in infections. var firstScrolled3 = false; window.addEventListener(\"scroll\",(event) => { if(!firstScrolled3) {window._taboola = window._taboola || []; _taboola.push({ mode: \"thumbnails-m\", container: \"taboola-mid-article-thumbnails\", placement: \"Mid Article Thumbnails\", target_type: \"mix\" }); firstScrolled3 = true; } }); Symptoms of UTI Seen In Diabetic Patients Are you suffering from diabetes and worried about UTI (Urinary Tract Infection)? Here are some of the warning signs you should look out for: Be on guard for UTI symptoms because left unchecked, they can spiral into more serious problems. How To Manage UTI Symptoms Induced By Diabetes? Knowing the increased UTI risk for diabetic individuals, it's paramount to act proactively to impede these infections. Some precautionary measures include: Diabetes makes you more prone to Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs), largely due to a weakened immune response and a higher likelihood of catching infections. However, understanding the symptoms of this condition and following the tips mentioned above can help in managing UTI effectively without medication.",

        "content": "is entering a new season on June 11, the second of Year 9 for the game. As part of that, two of its most are getting major nerfs that could shift the meta significantly. Defenders being overpowered has the potential to wildly shift individual games of Rainbow Six Siege. As such, Fenrir, Solis, and Kapkan (to a lesser extent) are at the forefront of conversations in the community regarding balancing. The arrival of the Operation: New Blood season is going to change that. It’s introducing major changes for Fenrir and Solis that should bring them in line with other defensive options. These aggressive nerfs should help address frustrating balancing issues. On Fenrir, the changes are more about enabling other players to subvert his biggest strength – traps. The latest had this to say about the operator: “Our main goal is to provide Attackers with additional methods and opportunities to effectively handle the deployed mines while enhancing a more strategic environment without negating Fenrir’s anti-rush capabilities. “Fenrir’s effectiveness will now be closely tied to the deployment type and gadget size, rather than relying mainly on bulletproof capacities. Similar to other devices, ensuring that the mines are discreet and strategically placed increases their effectiveness and survivability through the round.” Solis has been a lesser offender but still hasn’t escaped the nerf hammer. The operator will now be less able to aggressively deal with attacking drones. SPEC-IO resources are also deemed too generous and will be reduced. “Solis has proven highly effective in hunting and neutralizing drones, which are crucial to build a successful Attack strategy. If Attackers cannot reveal the defenders’ setup and position their drones inside the building, the attack is likely to fail. “Our goal is to strike a balance: Solis should remain relevant in this role while Attackers gain additional opportunities to fulfill their droning operations,” read the Designer’s Notes. Related: The new season of Rainbow Six Siege will allow players to see if these changes are too extensive. to fill the gaps in the meta is unclear, but Mira and Kapkan seem likely options at this stage.",

B.C.'s wide-ranging ecological zones are home to over 70 percent of Canada's mammal, bird and non-vascular plant species.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by Jennifer Sunday, David Castle, George Poulakidas and Mary I. O'Connor, The Conversation From massive kelp forests to monumental old-growth on land, British Columbia's biodiversity—which is unrivaled in Canada—provides an array of cultural, economic, social and other benefits . B.C.'s wide-ranging ecological zones are home to over 70 percent of Canada's mammal, bird and non-vascular plant species. The province is ostensibly proud of having a healthy environment, with its mottos \"Splendor without Diminishment\" and \"Beautiful British Columbia\" promoting its natural beauty. Yet despite this awareness, the province is hindered by a fragmented approach to biodiversity management. B.C. possesses considerable knowledge resources with a wealth of top biodiversity scientists, biodiversity-based industries and leading conservation organizations. It is also home to more than 200 First Nations with traditional knowledge systems closely tied with nature. However, current conservation initiatives lack coordination and there is no independent organization or provincial governing body overseeing the many actions underway. This must change. The lack of coordination in B.C. makes it difficult to obtain a clear picture of ecosystem health across the province. This murky picture has negative implications for efforts to quantify, forecast and adjust to biodiversity changes—with further knock-on repercussions for efforts to hold people and organizations accountable for infractions. For example, when a species is listed on Canada's Species at Risk Act , the first step for legislated action by the province is to map locations of habitats that are necessary for the species' recovery. But, in part due to poor biodiversity inventories and low engagement across sectors , this information has been regularly delayed, by an average of 9.8 years . This is a costly time frame for an endangered species. We cannot manage what we do not monitor and this challenge will only get worse as climate change shifts the range of many species . Biodiversity work in B.C. is currently being performed by a passionate and engaged group of stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations, academics, First Nations, local interest groups, federal and provincial agents as well as private consultancies. The breadth of work is vast and, despite having so many different groups involved, the goals are often aligned. Yet despite having similar goals, shared methods and the potential for combining knowledge across projects, fragmentation across individuals and groups persists. The fragmented nature of B.C. biodiversity work is a missed opportunity that can lead to gaps and blind spots that ultimately undermine action. Potential interconnected threats like diseases, invasive species, ecological impacts of new developments and a range of other issues may be missed. Biodiversity loss is too important to be detected by chance; it should be monitored in a systematic, open and inclusive way. New technologies are vastly increasing our capacity to monitor biodiversity. Advances in environmental genomics and the discovery that organisms leave traces of their DNA in the environment means biodiversity now can be assessed from samples of water , soil and even the air . NGOs, Indigenous stewards and conservation groups in B.C. are already using environmental DNA (fragments of DNA floating freely in the environment) to track biodiversity change . Remote automatic cameras deployed in a network can quickly and continuously record the distribution of certain species . What's more, the data from these cameras can be processed quickly using community science web-based platforms quickly using crowd-sourced knowledge and artificial intelligence . Satellite data can reveal the status of forests across the province . We are on the cusp of a deluge in biodiversity data, but data on its own is not knowledge. To translate this data into actionable insights, collaboration and coordination is key. We need to work together to share knowledge and capacity for understanding change. User-friendly platforms are needed to make the data accessible, but it is equally important to integrate it with existing knowledge held by local communities and Indigenous groups. Establishing a system of natural capital accounts would provide a clear picture of the value our ecosystems provide empowering decision-makers to understand the economic and social consequences of their choices. In December 2022, Canada hosted the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Montréal. In response to the Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework, Canada committed to protecting 30 percent of biodiversity by 2030. Canada also committed to developing a plan in response to the framework's four goals and 23 targets . Yet coordinated action is needed at the provincial level to achieve this. B.C.'s draft framework for biodiversity and ecosystem health is a positive step with its emphasis on \"connecting initiatives,\" \"providing accessible and credible data\" and \"fostering innovation, skills, and training\"—but much more work is still needed. We need a body that draws together independent expertise in biodiversity and social sciences with policymakers and interest groups. Importantly, this body would need to be transparent, track progress and provide research and synthesized information to support informed decisions. Crucially, any effort to coordinate biodiversity work in B.C. must inclusively engage with the many ongoing initiatives in the province to ensure it is adding value. We may not have to look far for an effective model. Québec recently launched Biodiversité Québec —a partnership across government, scientific and Indigenous partners—to create an integrated monitoring system for nature. Drawing inspiration from such initiatives and its own capacity, B.C. can rise to the challenge of biodiversity loss. With coordination and sustained support of expertise, B.C. can set clear goals, leverage existing initiatives, ensure efforts are aligned and results are communicated and ultimately, ensure that B.C.'s natural splendor remains undiminished.

        "description": "The team has helped 315 people into new lives in Moray.",
        "content": "MORAY Council’s refugee and asylum seeker resettlement team will be restructured, the local authority has confirmed. The team, which has supported 315 people into new lives in Moray , was made up of a mix of housing and Health and Social Care Moray staff. They will now be absorbed back into their respective departments. The council says that the decision has been made as the support being given is effectively the same as anyone gets from the local authority‘s services and is no longer an additional response. A number of the government supported schemes are coming to an end or being supported in different ways but six Afghan families, seven Syrian families and over a hundred Ukrainians will continue to be supported across Moray, in addition to more recently approved asylum cases. As reported in March , the Home Office relocated all asylum seekers previously housed at the Eight Acres Hotel in Elgin to other accommodation within its asylum estate. Since the first asylum seekers arrived in Moray in May 2023, a total of 68 people were supported by the resettlement team and community. Council leader Kathleen Robertson said: “The teams in the council and Health and Social Care Moray adapted quickly to provide the professional support needed by those arriving in Moray at a time of uncertainty for them and in a position of vulnerability. “I thank them all for the great care they have taken to resettle and integrate our newest residents in Moray. “I must also recognise everyone in the community who played a part in making the individuals seeking asylum and refugees feel welcome during their time in Moray. “I know from my own experience of welcoming Ukrainian citizens to my home how traumatic an experience it can be for those coming here alone and with little to their name. “It shows how caring we are as a community here in Moray and I’m extremely proud of how we’ve stepped up to our role and will continue to support those still in Moray.” The resettlement team focused on community integration, which enabled displaced people to integrate into communities across Moray. Multiple partners across various sectors provided key support to help people resettle and build community ties. The Red Cross provided donations of clothing and shoes; Moray Fresh Start provided starter house starter packs; and Fit Life cards were provided to give access to sport and recreation activities. Various groups such as conversation cafes, sewing groups, cycling and sporting clubs were also set up to build confidence and make friends.",

SO WHAT: If you purchased Lincoln National securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Lincoln National class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24462 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 24, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Lincoln National was experiencing a decline in its variable universal life insurance business; (2) as a result, the goodwill associated with the life insurance business was overstated; (3) as a result, Lincoln National’s policy lapse assumptions were outdated; (4) as a result, Lincoln National’s reserves were overstated; (5) as a result, Lincoln National’s reported financial results and financial statements were misstated; and (6) as a result of the foregoing, defendants’ positive statements about Lincoln National’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

        "content": "Dad-of-three put on life support just weeks after catching a 'bad cold' READ MORE: Mom thought she had a cold - but doctors found stage 4 cancer By Maiya Focht For Dailymail.Com Published: 16:50 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:18 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments When most of us get a cold, we assume that we'll be on the mend in a few days. That's what Jared Maynard, a 33 year-old powerlifter, physiotherapist and dad-of-three from Ontario, Canada , believed, when he developed a sniffle in January last year. But he was wrong. Mr Maynard, his wife and three daughters all came down with what seemed like mild a cold. His daughters and wife got better within a week. Mr Maynard, however, seemed to be getting worse. Eventually, his skin began turning yellow and he became delirious. Subsequent hospital tests revealed he wasn't suffering a cold, but something far more sinister. Mr Maynard developed a rare condition called hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in response to what seemed like a mild cold. He lost 43 pounds while in the hospital and was on life support for five weeks. Mr Maynard, pictured here before his illness, alongside his wife Ashley, 32 and their three daughters, Elizabeth, 6, Mary-Claire, 6, and Cecilia, 3. His 'cold' was in fact a virus that had triggered a rare immune system disease that had caused his liver and kidneys to stop functioning. Doctors discovered he had developed life-threatening hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) which hijacks the body's immune system, making it attack the body like it's a foreign invader. This makes a person whose already fighting a virus much sicker and weaker than they normally would be. Doctors put Mr Maynard on life support, trying to make him comfortable in what they assumed were his last days. This condition is rare, and doctors are unsure how many people it affects. One study from internists at Rochester General Hospita l found that there were 16,136 cases of the disease diagnosed in the US between 2006 and 2019. It is fatal in about 40 percent of the people who develop it, doctors from the L yon Immunopathology Federation in France estimated . There are two types of the disease. One is triggered by your genetics, and the other is triggered in response to a virus or bacteria. In Mr Maynard's case, the doctors determined that he developed HLH in response to the Epstein-barr virus, otherwise known as mono, or the kissing disease. With plenty of rest, people can usually recover from mono within a few weeks, according to the Mayo Clinic . But the combination of mono and HLH sent Mr Maynard into organ failure. He was sedated, put on a ventilator and dialysis in late January. Doctors normally treat HLH with a cocktail of chemotherapy drugs - but since the treatment is hard on the body, and Mr Maynard was weak, they were unable to give him the full treatment. His physicians were skeptical about whether he'd survive, and started him on palliative care, figuring his days were numbered. But in March, he began, miraculously, to recover. 'It was enough to earn me the nickname \"Miracle Man\" in fact', Mr Maynard told Jam News. That wasn't the end of his journey. Mr Maynard's doctors were unsure if he was going to survive his intense HLH treatment. But he pulled through, earning the nickname, 'Miracle Man'. When he was allowed to go home in May of 2023, he began strength training again. In the five weeks since he had been on life support, Mr Maynard lost 43 pounds. His body had eaten away at his muscle in order to survive the long weeks of bedrest. 'My doctors told me that without me being as fit and strong as I was going in, I likely wouldn't have made it through,' he said. He remained in the hospital until May 2023 - relearning how to walk, sit, stand, and even breathe, speak and swallow again. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement Even as he began to regain motor functions, he suffered due to nerve damage to his feet from the chemotherapy, and struggled to reawaken his sense of smell. But since getting out, his focus has been on rebuilding his strength, despite the pain he still suffers from. As a strength coach himself, he poured his attention into weight lifting. Since he began lifting weights again in June 2023, Mr Maynard has worked his way up to be able to lift 465 pounds. On May 25, he competed in his first powerlifting competition since he got sick. But far and away his biggest accomplishment, he said, was being able to pick up his daughters again. When he was able to lift all three, he said 'It felt like a piece of my heart was restored.' Mr Maynard has always been dedicated to fitness, but said his harrowing experience underscored the importance of taking time to exercise. 'I wish people knew that building muscle, strength, and physical resilience is the best life insurance policy you'll ever take out,' he said, adding, 'it's too easy to put yourself last on your list of priorities between work, school, kids and other obligations.' 'We all think we have time to get our act together until we don't. I found that out the hard way.'

        "content": "HOUSTON, May 27 — Mice fed raw cow’s milk infected with bird flu experienced high levels of the virus in their lungs, according to a study published Friday that suggests risk to humans who consume the drink. Over the past few years, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus called HPAI H5N1 has spread to infect more than 50 animal species, including, from March, dairy cattle in the United States. To date, 52 herds across the country have been affected, with two human infections involving farm workers who developed mild symptoms, including pink eye. In the new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Texas A&M fed droplets of raw milk from infected cattle to five mice. The rodents developed signs of illness, including lethargy, and were then euthanised four days later to study their organs. The researchers found high levels of virus in their nasal passages, trachea and lungs, and moderate-to-low levels of virus in other organs. “An important consideration is that the consumption of raw, unpasteurised milk is becoming increasingly popular,” said Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the research. Raw milk laws vary by state in the US, with some permitting its sale in retail stores, others only allowing it to be sold on the farm it was produced, and others still prohibiting it altogether. An official 2019 survey found that 4.4 per cent of adults said they had consumed raw milk in the past year. Such consumers tended to be younger and lived in rural areas. “While this study shows that mice can become systemically infected due to ingesting infected milk, this does not prove that the same is true for humans, though it does increase the possibility,” added Kao. In addition to the mice tests, the research confirmed that heating raw milk to high temperatures destroys nearly all virus after a few seconds, and completely destroys the pathogen after several minutes. A recent nationwide survey of pasteurised milk found all samples were negative for viable virus, though inactivated virus, no longer capable of spreading or infecting a host, was found in about 20 per cent of retail samples. Finally, the researchers tested the effect of storing infected raw milk at fridge temperatures and found that the virus levels declined only slightly after five weeks, indicating that refrigeration alone is not sufficient to make raw milk safe. — ETX Studio",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza’s population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel’s close allies. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are “spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.” Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called it a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "content": "Dr Bright Danyoh, Head of the Paediatric and Child Health sub-BMC of the Ho Teaching Hospital has cautioned paediatric nurses and midwives not to downplay the severity of jaundice in newborns. He said it must be considered an act of crime to ignore the risks of the neonatal jaundice, a disease that threatens almost all newborns with brain damage, loss of eyesight and death. Dr Danyoh gave the caution at the launch of the 2024 Newborn Jaundice Awareness month. The celebration was on the theme: “The Newborn Jaundice and Exclusive Breastfeeding: Nurses and Midwives Lead,” Present at the Launch were members of the Paediatric and Child Health Sub BMC. The admonition was against the realisation of the role of health workers in the rising incidents of the disease, and stakeholders at the event spoke of how some paediatricians and midwives were found to dismiss the suspicions of mothers although jaundice remained the leading cause of newborn admission. Dr Danyoh said despite successes with awareness campaigns, the attitude of health workers caused severe newborn jaundice to remain a challenge. He said there was fear of health workers giving out wrong information and false hopes and insisted that they had no right to ignore the signs of the disease. “It is criminal not to know the bilirubin levels of new borns and tell the mothers to go home,” Dr. Danyoh said adding that nurses’ knowledge on early detection would be strengthened through training. “These things are really going on,” Mary Kutsi, Nurse Manager of the Paediatric unit lamented, sharing details of how mothers lost their babies after health workers waved off their suspicions. She said midwives and paediatricians were found to often shrug suspicious mothers off and ask them to apply the conventional sunlight therapy, and that such were the cause of late referrals. “Mothers take these advises and before they realise it’s too late. We need to advocate more because it is causing a lot of damage to the community,” the Nurse Manager said. Dr. Edem Sarbah a lead paediatrician in the Region also said, “Mothers are picking up public awareness, but they come to meet health workers who turn them back” “Let’s make sure we get the right information and do what must be done.” Ms Gift Dravie, in charge of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), noted that the year 2022 remains the highest with admissions for neonatal jaundice with a total 415 cases, and that that the success also was that death rates remained “very low”. She also attested to increased awareness among mothers and care givers, saying, “more mothers are reporting on their own to the clinic and it shows our advocacy is working.” Ms. Dravie would use the moment to draw stakeholder attention to the need for equipment, saying the unit worked with limited phototherapy machines and test equipment. Madam Perfect Titianti, Ho Municipal Director of Health Services chaired complimented the Sub BMC for “the passion and commitment to the issues” and said the Health Directorate would collaborate to ensure babies with challenges were promptly referred. Ms Evelyn Sunnu, Acting Head of Department Midwifery at the UHAS School of Nursing and Midwifery delivered the keynote address and said education on neonatal jaundice should begin at pregnancy, and that health workers must reconsider visiting mothers in their homes after delivery to monitor the babies.",

        "content": "AHMEDABAD: The Additionally Driven Intermediate Tunnel (ADIT) of 394 meter at Ghansoli for Mumbai- Ahmedabad Bullet Train Project , has been excavated. This will expedite the construction of 21 km long tunnel between BKC and Shilphata in Maharashtra. The 26-meter-deep inclined ADIT will facilitate construction of the 3.3 km (approx.) tunnel through New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM), by allowing simultaneous access for tunnelling 1.6 meter (approx.) on each sides. Out of 21 km of tunnelling works, 16 km is through Tunnel Boring Machines and remaining 5 km is through NATM. The excavation work for ADIT was started on 6th December 2023, and the entire length of 394 meter is excavated in a short duration of six months. Total 214 controlled blasts were done using 27,515 kg explosives under supervision of experts and high level of instrumentation was used to ensure safe excavation. The ADIT of internal dimension: 11 meter X 6.4 meter will give direct vehicular access to the main tunnel during construction and operations and may also be used for the purpose of evacuation process in emergency situation. A number of monitoring instruments are being used to ensure safe excavation of the tunnel and all the structures in the nearby area. Some of the instruments being used for the work are SSP (Surface settlement Points), ODS (Optical displacement Sensor) or tilt meter for displacement in both axis, BRT (By reflect target/3D targets), Strain Gauge for micro strains in tunnel surface, Seismograph for Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) or vibration & seismic wave monitor. The construction activities related to 21 km (approx.) long tunnel from Mumbai Bullet Train station to Shilphata in the state of Maharashtra is progressing at a fast pace. The 7 km (approx.) stretch of this tunnel will be under the sea at Thane Creek (Intertidal zone). This is the first of its kind tunnel to come up in the country. The 21 km long tunnel will be a single tube tunnel to accommodate two track meant for up and down tracks. To construct this tunnel, Tunnel Boring Machines (TBMs) with cutter heads of 13.6 meter diameter will be used. Usually 6-8 Meter Diameter cutter heads are used for urban tunnels used in MRTS – Metro system, as these tunnels accommodate one track only. The under construction three shafts at BKC, Vikhroli, and Sawli will facilitate the construction of 16 km long tunnel through TBMs.",

However, there is a need to distinguish between consensual sexting and forms of sexual harassment like cyberflashing.",
        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source written by researcher(s) proofread by Dianne Lalonde, The Conversation Sexting—sending sexually suggestive or explicit messages and images—is now a widespread practice, and can be a healthy way to express and explore sexuality. However, there is a need to distinguish between consensual sexting and forms of sexual harassment like cyberflashing. Cyberflashing refers to the act of non-consensually sending sexual imagery (like nudes or \"dick pics\") to another person. It is facilitated through communications technologies including text, AirDrop and social media applications like Snapchat and Tinder. Similar to flashing—when a person unexpectedly and deliberately \"flashes\" their genitals to others—that occurs in person, cyberflashing involves an intrusive denial of autonomy and control. It can lead to people feeling distressed, objectified and unsafe. And like flashing, which involves physical proximity to the person, cyberflashing can occur through location-specific technology like Apple's AirDrop . A cyberflasher may also access further information about the recipient online, including their name and location. Cyberflashing is often normalized and perceived as something to laugh off , but it is a form of gender-based sexual violence that must be taken seriously. My research on technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including non-consensual sexual deepfakes , highlights the need for legal and societal responses to these emerging challenges. In 2018, Statistics Canada found that 11 percent of women and six percent of men aged 15 or older were sent unwanted sexually suggestive or explicit images or messages. For young people aged 15 to 24 , that increased to 25 percent of women and 10 percent of men. Cyberflashing studies from the United States and the United Kingdom suggest higher rates of cyberflashing, with women still being the most targeted. While further intersectional data is not available for explicit images, generally women with disabilities, Indigenous women and bisexual women face a high prevalence of online harassment overall. Cyberflashing can also occur alongside further forms of violence including stalking, sexual harassment and physical threats. Violating impacts The impacts of cyberflashing are compounded by contextual factors. In one case, a fire inspector in London, Ont., sent explicit photos to women he worked with . Another factor involves location: for instance, women in Montréal received sexually explicit images while riding the Metro , while British students were cyberflashed during university lectures . A study of 2,045 women and 298 gay or bisexual men in the United States found that women reported cyberflashing as a predominantly negative experience that left them feeling grossed out, disrespected and violated. The same study found that, although gay and bisexual men received high rates of cyberflashing, they reported more positive reactions, showing how gender and sexual orientation may impact experiences of violence. It is important to situate this finding in terms of unequal gender dynamics, social expectations that men should appreciate sexual advances and a broader culture wherein incidents of sexual violence against men who have sex with men are minimized . The result of cyberflashing is women engaging in \" safety work ,\" including restricting or changing their movements and communication. Such emotional and physical labor is time-consuming and can limit women's participation in everyday life . Cyberflashing reflects and reinforces rape culture wherein sexual violence is normalized and consent is viewed as unnecessary. There is an assumption in cyberflashing that the unsolicited sexual content will be positively received despite the lack of consent. When heterosexual men were asked what reaction they hoped for from the recipient when cyberflashing , the majority of them said that they were after a positive reactions like sexual excitement and attraction. A significant minority of men, however, sought negative reactions like shock, disgust and fear. This frequent, mistaken belief from heterosexual men that there will be a positive reaction to cyberflashing may be because they are socialized to be sexually aggressive . Beyond individual cyberflashing , rape culture in society more broadly results in belittling sexual violence and victim-blaming. This is reflected in advising women to simply ignore unwanted images and in the wrongful assumption that the person must have \"asked\" to be flashed . Canada can address cyberflashing by exploring criminalization, a method already present in England, Wales, Scotland and Singapore . Criminalization of cyberflashing serves as a deterrent by making it an illegal act with potential consequences. Currently in Canada, only individuals sending sexual content to youth under 18 may face criminal charges under child luring laws if done with the intent to commit an offense such as sexual exploitation, trafficking and indecent exposure. However, criminalization is limited, given the lack of cyberflashing reporting. Survivors of sexual violence may also distrust the criminal justice system due to its harmful treatment of survivors, especially survivors who face structural oppressions including anti-Black racism and ableism. A promising alternative to criminalization is transformative justice , an approach to addressing harm that focuses on healing, community accountability and societal change. Another aspect of ending cyberflashing requires the participation of social media platforms, which can use technology, including artificial intelligence, to detect sexual content and block it unless the user decides to accept. This approach is used by Bumble's Private Detector and Instagram's Nudity Protection . Finally, there is a need for sex-positive sex and tech safety education that differentiates sexting from sexual harassment like cyberflashing. Rather than stigmatizing sexting overall, age-appropriate practices should be promoted on how to meaningfully and consensually communicate about sex.

        "content": "Bitcoin , the first decentralized digital currency, has been surrounded by mystery since its inception. The true identity of its creator, known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto , remains one of the most intriguing puzzles in the tech world. Over the years, several individuals have been speculated to be the real Satoshi, with one of the most controversial figures being Craig Steven Wright . Wright, an Australian computer scientist and businessman, has made multiple public claims to be the main part of the team that created Bitcoin and to be the person behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. These assertions have been met with skepticism and have been widely disputed by the media and the cryptocurrency community. The debate over Wright’s claims intensified when, in March 2024, the British High Court ruled that Wright is not Nakamoto. The controversy around Wright’s claims is not just a matter of curiosity but also has significant legal and financial implications. In 2016, Wright was involved in a court case where he claimed to keep a cache of Bitcoin worth billions of dollars. The jury’s decision allowed Wright to retain these assets, although he was ordered to pay $100 million for intellectual property infringement to his late partner’s company.

Join Tekedia Capital Syndicate and i nvest in Africa’s finest startups here . Despite the legal battles and the claims, the crypto community has not accepted Wright as the creator of Bitcoin. Investigations and reports have raised concerns about the possibility of an elaborate hoax. The lack of conclusive evidence and the refusal to provide irrefutable proof have left many doubting Wright’s narrative. The question of who created Bitcoin is more than just a quest for the truth about an individual’s identity. It is a reflection of the very nature of the cryptocurrency itself—decentralized, anonymous, and open-source. The ongoing debate about Wright’s claims serves as a reminder of the core values of the Bitcoin community and the importance of transparency and trust in the digital age. A series of court rulings have cast doubt on the authenticity of documents presented by Wright to support his assertion of being Satoshi Nakamoto. A judge has described the evidence as forgeries created on a “grand scale,” undermining Wright’s claims. The Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) pursued legal action to challenge Wright’s claims, seeking a negative declaration that he is not the pseudonymous author Satoshi Nakamoto. The implications of these legal proceedings extend beyond the personal claims of Wright. They touch upon the broader principles of open-source development and the collaborative nature of the cryptocurrency community. The court’s findings affirm the community’s commitment to transparency and truth, ensuring that the foundational ethos of Bitcoin remains intact. What is clear, however, is the enduring legacy of Bitcoin as a transformative financial technology, one that continues to evolve and inspire innovation across the globe. The debate over its origins serves as a reminder of the importance of integrity and honesty in the digital age. As the saga continues, the crypto world watches on, waiting for the day the true Satoshi Nakamoto steps forward, or perhaps, prefers to remain forever unknown, leaving the legacy of Bitcoin to speak for itself. For now, the mystery endures, and Craig Steven Wright’s role in the history of Bitcoin remains a topic of intense discussion and speculation.",

        "description": "Khabib Nurmagomedov respects Dustin Poirier but is confident Islam Makhachev will defeat him at UFC 302 using strategies from their 2019 fight",
        "content": "Retired former undefeated UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov has expressed respect for his former opponent D ustin Poirier . Having defeated \"The Diamond\" himself, the Russian fighter-turned-coach believes he has studied Poirier's tendencies thoroughly enough to prepare his protege, Islam Makhachev, for victory in their upcoming main event at UFC 302 . Nurmagomedov currently serves as Makhachev's head coach. The former sambo wrestler, who transitioned to MMA in 2010, has only lost one fight in his UFC career, during his second fight with the promotion. Following a single loss in 2015, Makhachev embarked on a historic company winning streak that etched his name in the annals of UFC history. With 13 consecutive victories, his last three fights against former champions, Makhachev's pedigree is undeniable. In preparation for the fight, Nurmagomedov addressed the media during Islam's training camp. Despite his respect for his former opponent, Nurmagomedov intends to leverage his experience from their bout to guide Islam. Latest UFC TV channels, live streams, start times and full fight card UFC 302 card full as Sean Strickland and Dustin Poirier return to the octagon By sharing insights and strategies derived from their time in the cage, Nurmagomedov aims to provide Makhachev with a comprehensive blueprint for victory, underscoring the mentorship that has defined their relationship. \"Many people underestimate Dustin Poirier,\" Nurmagomedov said in a YouTube video during camp. \"I personally fought him, spent three rounds and over 10 minutes with him, and I have a good sense of his strengths and weaknesses. We are working hard on these aspects.\" \"Dustin is very experienced; he's been in many battles already,\" continued Khabib. \"Yes, he has lost, but he also has many victories in the UFC, more than 22 or 23 wins. Using our slang, he is a seasoned warrior. You can't take him lightly. We have great respect for Dustin, but on June 1, he is our opponent.,\" he continued. \"We have a clearly developed plan for the fight, and I believe Islam will follow it. I really hope that Islam will finish him off in the second or third round.\" Nurmagomedov and Poirier last fought in a UFC lightweight championship bout at UFC 242 in 2019 in Abu Dhabi. This marked the second-to-last fight of Nurmagomedov's career. The longest-reigning lightweight titleholder ever entered the bout with an undefeated 27-0 record. Poirier, the interim lightweight champion, aimed to unify the titles. The Dagestan \"Eagle\" won the fight by forcing Poirier to tap out with a rear-naked choke in the third round, further securing his status as the undisputed lightweight champion in the UFC. The victory was particularly influential as it marked Nurmagomedov's return to the octagon after his win over Conor McGregor and subsequent suspension due to the post-fight incident. During Nurmagomedov's suspension, Poirier defeated Max Holloway at UFC 236 to claim the interim title, setting the stage for their unification bout at UFC 242. The Louisiana native competed in two title fights outside his interim Holloway showdown, losing both chances against Nurmagomedov and Charles Oliveira at UFC 269. Fifteen of Poirier's 30 wins have come by way of knockout. His head coach, Mike Brown, has also noted the similarities and differences between Nurmagomedov and Makhachev, particularly in the striking department. “Similar styles, but the techniques they use are quite different,” coach Brown said to MMA Fighting. “I think Islam uses a lot more upper body trips and Khabib took a lot more shots. I think Islam’s striking looks maybe sharper, looks cleaner, but it’s not to say Khabib’s striking wasn’t effective. Sometimes he was maybe a little unconventional, but he wasn’t a bad striker.

        "content": "Two Purolator truck drivers from Guelph, Ont., are being recognized for \"an incredible act of heroism\" after they saved a man they saw in distress on a highway. Melinda Olah and Manohar Rehal saw the man walking in live lanes of traffic on Highway 407 by the Highway 410 on-ramp near Brampton, Ont., on April 29. Olah says she drives on Highway 407 daily, completing three trips to Toronto and back. On April 29, she was finishing her day, heading back to Guelph, when she spotted a person in the middle of the road. \"I veered to miss him but it's not something that you expect to see,\" Olah told CBC News in an interview. She said she pulled over and tried to call out to the man. \"'Hey, man, what's going on? Are you OK? Why don't you come off the highway?' I mean, he was on a four-lane highway. He was walking right smack in the middle of it, so definitely not a normal thing to do,\" she said. There was definitely traffic coming and passing and nearly hitting him - Melinda Olah, Purolator driver When she got no response from the man, Olah called the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP), who told her they had been previously notified and were on their way. \"There wasn't a lot of traffic, but there was definitely traffic coming and passing and nearly hitting him,\" Olah said. \"You couldn't see him. It was dark.\" Olah said she pulled out onto the highway with the hazard lights on her truck flashing and drove behind the man. \"I'm driving a transport truck with a full-size trailer. So, with my lights flashing, I can make a bigger scene, at least try to protect him from getting hit and try and protect other drivers from hitting him and having to go through that trauma,\" she said. Olah says she drives on Highway 407 daily, completing three trips to Toronto and back to Guelph. (Submitted by Alana Reich) Olah continued behind the man for about 20 minutes when she observed another transport truck behind them with hazard lights on as well \"It happened to be Manohar,\" she said. She explained what was happening and asked her fellow Purolator driver to help her block the lanes. \"[Melinda] pointed ... to the guy ... 'We are going to like help this guy out, can you please help me? We can block two lanes until the cops come,'\" Rehal told CBC News. \"[I said], yeah, for sure. And I was there for like another 10 to 15 minutes until the cops came.\" WATCH | Video of the truckers driving slowly behind the person was posted to YouTube : 'Courage and selflessness in the face of danger': OPP On May 1, Staff Sgt. Nathan Majer of the OPP's highway safety division sent a letter to Purolator indicating they were looking to formally recognize Olah and Rehal. \"As a result of their decisive actions, two lanes of live traffic were blocked protecting the citizen in distress awaiting police arrival,\" Majer wrote in the letter. \"Their quick thinking and selflessness undoubtedly saved the person's life, enhanced officer safety, and prevented a potential tragedy from unfolding,\" the letter went on to day. \"Their courage and selflessness in the face of danger truly exemplifies the values of Melinda and Manohar. Their actions went well above and beyond their duty as courier drivers, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to the well-being of others and public safety.\" Rehal says, 'I'm always going to help if I can.' (Submitted by Alana Reich) Olah said she was \"definitely very overwhelmed\" with the amount of gratitude coming their way, especially from the OPP. \"I hope that more people will try to help each other out. I mean, after all, we are all in this rat race together, regardless what the profession or where we're going or what we're doing. And I think as a society, we would be much better off if we all just helped each other out a little bit more,\" she said. Rehal said he showed the OPP's letter to his parents and \"they felt proud.\" \"If anything happens, like in the future, I'm always going to help if I can,\" he said.

        "content": "The European Union pledged more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Monday to support displaced Syrians, but it dismissed any notion of them being able to return home because of instability under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Before an EU-led donor conference on the 13-year-old war, Jordan's foreign minister said that the international community was abandoning Syrian refugees as funding to support them in host countries dwindles, suggesting that ways had to be found to ease voluntary returns to Syria. The EU conference aims to keep the war on the agenda, as well as support for the millions of refugees it has created. But as the economic and social burden on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions, diplomats say. Refugees returning home is not yet one of them however, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made clear at the start of the conference. \"While the European Union would wish that returning home could be a realistic option for all refugees, everywhere and always, we concur with the United Nations system that currently the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns to Syria are not in place,\" Borrell said. \"We insist that it is the Assad regime that bears the primary responsibility for putting in place these conditions.\" Borrell said the bloc was pledging 560 million euros in 2024 and 2025 to support refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and a further 1 billion euros for Türkiye. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir, amid the Israeli war in Gaza and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. Although Assad has long since reasserted control over most of Syria in a war that began with a 2011 uprising against him, more than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon, Türkiye and Jordan and millions more displaced internally still have little prospect of returning home. \"We're going to be sending a very clear message from Jordan as a host country that we feel that refugees are being abandoned,\" Ayman Safadi told reporters on arrival in Brussels. \"Host countries are being abandoned.\" Jordan is hosting around 1.3 million Syrians. Safadi said the issue \"can only be solved by them going back to their country. So, we need to focus more on creating conditions conducive for them to return voluntarily.\" Funding to support refugees is dropping with the likes of the World Food Program reducing its aid. Countries say hosting refugees is an increasing burden, notably in economic crisis-hit Lebanon, where the discontent has seen forced deportations. \"We expect our partners to uphold international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, and reject and condemn any forced deportations,\" Borrell said. The 8th Syria conference brings together European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges there are few signs that Europe can take the lead, diplomats said. The bloc has no ties with the Assad government and Monday's talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the EU's 27 member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. An upswing in migrant boat arrivals from Lebanon to Europe, with Cyprus and Italy major destinations, has prompted some EU countries to warn of a big new influx into the bloc. \"We'll continue to do everything we can. But unless we're helped, unless the international community shoulders its responsibility, there will be a decrease in services and there will be more suffering for refugees,\" Safadi said. Arab countries and organizations slammed on Monday Israel for its strikes on a center for displaced Palestinians that killed dozens near the southern city of Rafah on Sunday. The health ministry in Gaza said in a statement that the strikes \"claimed the lives of 35 martyrs and left dozens injured, most of them children and women\". The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza earlier said the attack hit a center run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees near Rafah, branding it a \"horrific massacre\". The Palestinian Authority presidency in the West Bank called it a \"heinous massacre\", accusing Israeli forces of \"deliberately targeting\" the tents of displaced people. The massacre is an act of \"defiance to all international resolutions,\" it added in a statement. Gaza's civil defense agency said Israeli strikes killed and wounded at least 50 people in the area, where it said 100,000 displaced people live. Hamas said Palestinians must \"rise up and march\" against the attack. The Israeli army said it had targeted Hamas fighters. Israel's army said its aircraft \"struck a Hamas compound in Rafah\", killing Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar, both senior officials for the Palestinian armed group in the occupied West Bank. It added that it was \"aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.\" Palestinians carry a body after an Israeli army raid on a camp at an area designated for displaced people in Rafah, southern Gaza Strip, 27 May 2024. (EPA) Qatar said on Monday the latest Israeli attack on Rafah could hinder mediation efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage exchange deal, a foreign ministry statement said. Kuwait's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attack, saying the Israeli forces’ actions against Palestinians \"exposes their blatant war crimes and unprecedented genocide to the whole world.\" \"This calls for immediate and firm intervention by the international community to compel these forces into adhering to international legitimacy resolutions, including the International Justice Court resolution on immediately ceasing the aggression against Rafah, and protecting the Palestinian people,\" it demanded in a statement. Egypt strongly condemned the attack, saying Israeli forces \"deliberately\" targeted the displaced. The Foreign Ministry said Cairo had called on Israel \"to meet its legal commitments as an occupying power\" and respect the International Court of Justice’s call on it to immediately cease its military operations. The Jordanian Foreign Ministry condemned the \"ongoing heinous war crimes committed by the Israeli forces in Gaza,\" saying the latest attack in Rafah was a \"flagrant challenge to the ICJ and grave violation of international law and international humanitarian law.\" The Arab Parliament echoed the condemnation, warning in a statement that \"failure to hold Israel to account for its crimes and massacres against the Palestinians and failure to take any deterrent measures against it will only make it commit more killings and cause more destruction.\" The Organization of Islamic Cooperation slammed the \"heinous Israeli massacre against Palestinian civilians,\" describing it as a \"war crime, crime against humanity and state organized terrorism\" and demanding that Israel be held to account before international justice. An Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders who urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the militant group in Rafah had caused the fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there had been a \"tragic mistake\" and that Israel was investigating. In a speech before Israel’s parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that \"despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake. We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.\" Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighborhood where thousands were sheltering there after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. \"We were praying...and we were getting our children's beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,\" said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. \"All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.\" Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on \"precise intelligence\", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip. The incident was being investigated by the Joint Chiefs of Staff investigation mechanism, the Israeli military said on Monday. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\" over Israel's latest attacks. \"These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,\" he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. \"International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,\" Baerbock said. NO SAFE ZONE More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds. Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah's western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. \"The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,\" he said. \"What have they done to deserve this? Their children have been orphaned.\" The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned \"the heinous massacre.\" Egypt also condemned Israel's \"deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people\", state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt's military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. \"On top of the hunger, on top of the starvation, the refusal to allow aid in sufficient volumes, what we witnessed last night is barbaric,\" Ireland's Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Israeli tanks have probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, since May 6 and have entered some of its eastern districts. The United Nations Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, said on Monday that reports of attacks on families seeking shelter in Rafah in the southern tip of the Gaza Strip were \"horrifying.” \"Information coming out of Rafah about further attacks on families seeking shelter is horrifying,\" UNRWA wrote on X. \"There are reports of mass casualties including children and women among those killed. Gaza is hell on earth. Images from last night are yet another testament to that.\" Palestinian health and civil emergency service officials said on Sunday Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 Palestinians and wounded dozens in an area in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah designated for the displaced. The Israeli military said its air force struck a Hamas compound in Rafah, and that the incident was under review. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on Monday it had filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court over Palestinian journalists killed or injured in Gaza. RSF said it was asking the ICC's prosecutor to investigate alleged war crimes committed by the Israeli army against at least nine Palestinian reporters since December 15, Agence France Presse reported. The ICC said in January it was probing potential crimes against journalists since the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza, which has cost the lives of more than 100 reporters. RSF said it had \"reasonable grounds for thinking that some of these journalists were deliberately killed and that the others were the victims of deliberate IDF (Israel Defense Force) attacks against civilians.\" This specific complaint -- the third the RSF has made -- concerns eight Palestinian journalists killed between December 20 and May 20, and one other who sustained injuries. \"All concerned journalists were killed (or injured) in the course of their work,\" RSF said in a statement. Antoine Bernard, RSF advocacy and assistance director, said: \"Those who kill journalists are attacking the public's right to information, which is even more essential in times of conflict.\" ICC prosecutor Karim Khan last week asked the court to issue arrest warrants for top Israeli and Hamas leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for alleged war crimes and crimes and humanity. Israel has strongly denied the allegation and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that to draw a parallel between Hamas and Israeli leaders was \"despicable\". The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says at least 107 journalists and media workers have been killed during the Gaza war, the \"deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992\". The RSF complaint includes the case of two Palestinian journalists killed in January while working for Al Jazeera. Hamza Wael Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuria, who also worked as a video stringer for AFP and other news organizations, were killed while they were \"on their way to carry out their duty\" for the channel in the Gaza Strip, the network said. Egypt on Sunday emphasized the importance of achieving security, stability, and peace in Somalia as a fundamental pillar for security and stability in the entire region. Cairo also affirmed its full support for Mogadishu. Last January, Egypt emphasized the necessity of full respect for the unity and sovereignty of Somalia over its lands, expressing its full rejection to any measures that would undermine Somalia's sovereignty. This came after Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding with Somaliland that would give Addis Ababa access to the Red Sea, a key waterway for global trade. In return, Ethiopia would consider recognizing Somaliland's independence. Mogadishu had rejected the MoU, saying it violates its sovereignty. On Sunday, Egypt reiterated its support for Somalia’s stability during a meeting held between its Prime Minister, Moustafa Madbouly, and Ambassador Ilyas Sheikh Omar Abu Bakr, the outgoing Ambassador of Somalia to Egypt. The PM affirmed Egypt’s full support for Somalia in light of close historical relations between the two sides. Madbouly asked the ambassador to convey his greetings to the Somali Prime Minister and expressed his desire to strengthen joint cooperation between the two nations. For his part, Abu Bakr praised the cooperation he received from Egyptian state institutions and emphasized Somalia’s aspiration for continued Egyptian support, particularly in light of the political and security challenges the country faces. The Arab League had also rejected the MoU between Ethiopia and Somaliland and affirmed its support for Somalia’s sovereignty. Somaliland is a former British colony that declared its independence from Somalia in 1991 but was not recognized by the international community. Last January, the MoU faced international opposition. The US, the EU and the UK urged parties to respect Somali sovereignty. The Somali Ambassador on Sunday expressed his appreciation for the Egyptian political leadership’s support in achieving stability in Somalia. Egypt on Sunday reiterated its concerns about the devastating humanitarian impact of the Israeli military operations in Rafah on over 1.4 million Palestinians and the broader implications for regional peace and stability. Cairo, therefore, called on Israel to fulfil its responsibilities as the occupying power by removing barriers to aid entry by opening all land crossings between Israel and Gaza and ensuring secure conditions for international relief efforts in Gaza. The Egyptian warnings came during a meeting held Sunday between Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell in the Belgian capital, Brussels, to discuss the escalating crisis in Gaza. On Sunday, the Israeli army continued its bombardment of Gaza and Rafah despite an order from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last Friday to immediately halt Israel’s operations in this southern Gaza Strip town. The UN's top court based in the Dutch city of The Hague also ordered Israel to “maintain the Rafah crossing open for humanitarian assistance.” The crossing has been closed since the Israeli army launched its ground assault on the city early this month. During their meeting in Brussels, Shoukry and Borrell stressed the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza as well as a cessation of the Israeli military operations in the Palestinian city of Rafah, according to Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ahmed Abu Zeid. They also emphasized the importance of ensuring unhindered and safe access to humanitarian aid and relief supplies throughout Gaza to address the urgent needs of its residents. Egypt's top diplomat and the EU official then asserted the necessity for Israel to protect and respect humanitarian workers and refrain from targeting the facilities of international relief agencies. Both sides further stressed that Israel should facilitate the movement of relief teams in the Gaza Strip per international humanitarian law. Shoukry and Borrell discussed the dire humanitarian, security, and political aspects of the crisis in the Gaza Strip, Abu Zeid said. Furthermore, they explored ways to mitigate the consequences of the crisis in Gaza and advance a political path to implement the two-state solution, thus resolving the crisis comprehensively, according to the FM’s spokesperson. Shoukry then highlighted the crucial role sought from influential international parties, including the European Union, in supporting the ongoing efforts to halt the Israeli war on Gaza and prevent further loss of Palestinian lives. The Minister expressed his appreciation for the significant efforts of the EU top official in alleviating the humanitarian crisis and its repercussions. He also reiterated concerns about the devastating humanitarian impact of the Israeli military operations in Rafah and called on Israel to fulfil its responsibilities as the occupying power by removing barriers to aid entry by opening all land crossings between Israel and Gaza and ensuring secure conditions for international relief efforts in Gaza. Last week, Egypt's state-run Al-Qahera News channel quoted a high-level Egyptian source as denying Israeli media reports saying Cairo and Tel Aviv are coordinating on Israel’s military operation in the Palestinian Rafah city. The source stressed that “Egypt had warned Israel of the repercussions of escalation in the Gaza Strip, and refused any coordination with Tel Aviv on the Rafah crossing.” In this regard, Shoukry on Sunday said: “Egypt rejects Israel's insistence on controlling all of Gaza's crossings as a tool to tighten the siege and starve the Palestinian people in Gaza, creating an uninhabitable reality in the strip.” He also affirmed Egypt's categorical rejection of any attempts to displace Palestinians from their lands or liquidate the Palestinian cause. Hamas fired a barrage of rockets from Gaza that set off air raid sirens as far away as Tel Aviv for the first time in months on Sunday in a show of resilience more than seven months into Israel's massive air, sea and ground offensive. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage in what appeared to be the first long-range rocket attack from Gaza since January. Hamas’ military wing claimed the attack. Palestinian fighters have sporadically fired rockets and mortar rounds at communities along the Gaza border, and the military arm of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group later Sunday said it fired rockets at nearby communities. The Israeli military said eight projectiles crossed into Israel after being launched from the area of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where Israeli forces recently launched an incursion. It said “a number” of the projectiles were intercepted. Earlier Sunday, aid trucks entered Gaza from southern Israel under a new agreement to bypass the Rafah crossing with Egypt after Israeli forces seized the Palestinian side of it earlier this month. But it was not immediately clear if humanitarian groups could access the aid because of fighting. The war between Israel and Hamas has killed nearly 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its count. The Health Ministry said the bodies of 81 people killed by Israeli strikes had been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Around 80% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds some 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a ceasefire last year. The prime minister of the Palestinian Authority expressed hope on Sunday that Spain, Ireland and Norway's recognition of a Palestinian state would encourage other European countries to do the same. Mohammad Mustafa, in Brussels to attend a meeting with international donors, said he was grateful that the three had effectively joined 143 other countries that backed a Palestinian bid to become a full United Nations members in a resolution earlier in May. \"We obviously want to have every country in Europe do the same,\" he told a news conference in Brussels with Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares. \"So this is again hopefully a source of encouragement for these countries to take the necessary courageous step.\" The Middle East conflict has exposed diverging views in the European Union. Some EU diplomats have said it is not the right time to recognize Palestinian statehood. Mustafa said recognition now was vital to keep the peace process alive. Spain's Albares said other European countries were thinking about it, including Slovenia that had started the process. Spain, Ireland and Norway said they will formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday to help secure a halt to Israel's Gaza offensive after the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 and revive peace talks that stalled a decade ago. Israel has called plans for recognition of a Palestinian state a \"prize for terrorism\". Mustafa said he would spell out to international partners three priorities for his authority - supporting the people of Gaza, including by restoring basic services, building the institutions of a state and stabilizing the financial situation. Yemen's Houthi group freed more than 113 detainees in Sanaa on Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported. The Houthi group claimed the detainees had been government soldiers captured at the battlefront. But Yemen's internationally recognized government said the detainees were not soldiers, but civilians the Houthis had kidnapped from homes, mosques and workplaces. \"Releasing these victims under any name does not absolve (the Houthis) of this crime,\" Majed Fadail, deputy minister for human rights in Yemen's internationally recognized government wrote in a post on social media platform X. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed on Sunday the unilateral release of 113 \"conflict-related\" detainees and said in a statement that it assisted the detainees to ensure their release was humane and dignified. \"I feel completely at ease, as if I was born again today. Because we were desperate and thought we would never get out,\" said Murshed Al Jamaai, a detainee released on Sunday. Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthis ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in late 2014. The outlines of a proposed Yemen UN roadmap for peace were agreed last December, but progress towards peace stalled as the Houthis ramped up attacks on ships in and around the Red Sea, alleging they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza war. The campaign has disrupted global commerce, stoked fears of inflation and deepened concern that fallout from the Israel-Hamas war could destabilize parts of the Middle East. Israel's armed forces bombarded Gaza on Sunday, but officials also said diplomatic efforts were expected to resume in coming days towards a truce and hostage release deal. Air strikes and artillery shelling rained down again overnight on northern, central and southern area of Gaza in the more than seven-months-old war sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack. Fighting has centered on the far-southern city of Rafah, where Israel has vowed to destroy the last remaining Hamas battalions despite a chorus of international opposition to a ground invasion of the city. Israel's assault there from early May led Egypt to shut its side of the Rafah border crossing -- but on Sunday, aid trucks from Egypt again rolled into Gaza, this time via the nearby Kerem Shalom crossing. US President Joe Biden said Saturday his administration was engaged in \"urgent diplomacy to secure an immediate ceasefire that brings hostages home\". Mediator Egypt was also continuing \"its efforts to reactivate ceasefire negotiations\", said Al Qahera News. Israeli media has said intelligence chief David Barnea had agreed a new framework for talks on a ceasefire in a meeting with America's CIA chief and Qatari mediators in Paris. An Israeli official, requesting anonymity, told AFP on Saturday that \"there is an intention to renew these talks this week\". However, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told Qatar's Al Jazeera network that so far \"there is nothing practical on this issue. It is just talk coming from the Israeli side.\" - Bodies pulled from rubble - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under increasing domestic pressure over the fate of the hostages, with demonstrators rallying again in Tel Aviv on Saturday. In recent days, the bodies of seven dead hostages have been retrieved from Gaza, heightening the fear and pain of relatives of the remaining captives. In Tel Aviv, a crowd of several thousands observed a minute of silence Saturday for dead captives. \"I feared this moment,\" Avivit Yablonka, whose brother Chanan was brought back dead from Gaza, told the rally. \"I will continue to shout, support, fight and do everything so that all the hostages return home.\" Hamas meanwhile said Saturday it had taken \"prisoner\" at least one Israeli soldier in an ambush in Jabalia camp. The claim was denied by the army, which said there was \"no incident in which a soldier was abducted\". The war broke out after Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. Gunmen also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,903 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. The UN has warned of looming famine in the besieged territory, where most hospitals are no longer functioning. In the latest fighting, Gaza's civil defense agency said Sunday it had retrieved six bodies after a house was targeted in a strike on Rafah's eastern Khirbet al-Adas neighborhood. Witnesses said Israeli artillery had also targeted central Rafah's Yibna camp, and that heavy artillery shelling hit the city's Sooq al-Halal and Qishta neighborhoods. Elsewhere in Gaza, Israeli air strikes targeted the Nuseirat camp, and witnesses said heavy artillery shelling hit northern Gaza. Israeli tanks in Gaza City rained heavy gunfire on targets in the Zeitun and Netzarim area, an AFP reporter said. Israel's military meanwhile said Sunday the arrival of aid had been stepped up, both via a new US-built pier and through its own land crossings, Kerem Shalom and Erez West. \"This week, after the pier began operating for the first time, a total of 1,806 pallets of food were transferred in 127 trucks to logistics centers of international aid agencies in the Gaza Strip,\" it said. \"In total, this week, 2,065 humanitarian aid trucks were inspected and transferred through the Kerem Shalom and Erez West crossings, which is almost twice the number in the previous week.\" US Central Command said Saturday that four US Army vessels supporting the pier broke free of their moorings, and had run aground in heavy seas, with Israel aiding the recovery effort. - Global pushback - As the bloodiest ever Gaza war grinds on, Israel has faced heavy global pushback over the surging civilian death toll and the destruction of vast swathes of Gaza. In the past week it faced landmark moves from two international courts based in The Hague and from three European governments. Last Monday, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court said he would seek arrest warrants on war crimes charges against Netanyahu and his defense minister as well as against three top Hamas figures. On Wednesday, Ireland, Norway and Spain said they would recognize Palestinian statehood by May 28, a move Israel angrily rejected as a \"reward for terrorism\". And on Friday, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, demanded the release of hostages and urged the \"unhindered provision\" of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The ICJ ruling came in a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel's military operation amounts to \"genocide\". It ruled that Israel must \"immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\". Israel has denied any military operations in the Rafah area that \"could cause the destruction of the Palestinian civilian population, in whole or in part\".",

        "content": "MUMBAI: The BMC has imposed a penalty of Rs. 54.68 lakhs on contractors involved in cleaning the city’s drains ahead of the upcoming monsoons . This includes a penalty of Rs 2.5 lakhs which has been levied on the contractor involved in cleaning the Irla and Chamdawadi (located in Bandra ) nullahs. The penalty comes in wake of the visits made by the Chief Minister Eknath Shinde to the ongoing drain cleaning sites in the city over the weekend. The maximum penalty of Rs 31.65 lakhs has been levied for the drain cleaning contractor of Mumbai city area, Rs 12.55 lakhs for the contractor involved in the eastern suburb drain cleaning works and Rs 10.48 lakh on the western suburbs contractor. Additional municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar said that there are many stretches which need to be desilted more than once if required. “For this the machinery needs to be on the ground and therefore in case any area work is found to be lagging action is initiated,” he said. BMC made an appeal to citizens to not litter nullahs in the city especially those where pre monsoon works have already been carried out. “Dumping of garbage from the surrounding areas occurs frequently in nullahs where silt has been removed. Due to this, the civic administration has to repeatedly remove the floating garbage from the same place. Also, even after cleaning, citizens throw garbage in the drains. More importantly, such garbage and bulky items get stuck in nullah and increase the chances of flooding during heavy rains,” said the civic body.",

        "description": "A speedrunner of Xenoblade Chronicles X managed to squeeze in one last world record before Nintendo shut down the Wii U's online servers, making it the last record ever.Last month, Nintendo did the at best quite annoying, at worst outright destructive thing of shutting down its online servers for both the Wii U and 3DS. That left numerous titles outright unplayable, and others with online modes that are no longer accessible. Xenoblade Chronicles X was one such game with an online mode, but now you can't play it anymore because of the servers being shut down. It's a lesser known entry in the beloved RPG series, but one that many hope will get a Switch port somewhere down the line (or maybe at this point a Switch 2 port). As it turns out, speedrunner YMG-C actually performed one last run of the game's online mode right before the servers shut down, and in the process beat the world record, as shared by a fan on Twitter (thanks, GamesRadar).With the Wii U's servers now offline, this also makes it impossible for anyone else to speedrun the online mode at all, meaning YMG-C will forever be the world record holder. Though, if no one else had decided to do a run before the servers shut down, it wouldn't matter much, as they were the previous world record holder anyway. Their previous record was two hours and 57 minutes long, whereas this new record is a minute shorter at two hours and 56 minutes, and that will be the record forever more. Even if the game does get a Switch port, speedrun categories will also be placed across various platforms, and with the Wii U being a generation behind, that would obviously cause discrepancies in things like load times.

Mahamat in a recent post on X said “With horrific overnight airstrikes killing mostly Palestinian women & children, the State of Israel continues to violate international law with impunity and in contempt of an International Court of Justice, ICJ, ruling two days ago ordering an end to its military action in Rafah. “The ICJ order must be urgently enforced if global order is to prevail.” DAILY POST recalls that the ICJ, on Friday, ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, and demanded the release of hostages and the provision of humanitarian aid into Gaza. However, Israel dismissed the ruling, insisting that the court had got it wrong.

        "content": "Bringing back national service is not a policy, it is a meme ( Rishi Sunak’s national service pledge is ‘bonkers’, says ex-military chief, 26 May ).

James Cleverly has suggested recalcitrant teenagers could be working weekends as emergency health responders and special constables. How will the ambulance service deal with someone they must spend resources on training, who is unable or unwilling to contribute? Perhaps refuseniks can be press-ganged into building a wall along the Kent coast so we may make Britain great again. With the government unable to refer to their past and the opposition unwilling to refer to their future, the weeks leading up to 4 July will be characterised by more vacuous memes. Let’s get this election done! David Marston Coventry My father did his national service in the RAF. He was crystal clear – he was there as cannon fodder and to massage the unemployment figures. If the world is as scary as Rishi Sunak says, then the £2.5bn needs to go to into the military now. Otherwise, this is clearly a gimmick from the campaign playbook where a losing candidate desperately announces increasingly “bold” – ie wild – ideas to try to get some traction. Next week, expect monkey tennis . Derek Long Rainhill, Merseyside National service? Are the Tories deliberately trying to lose the vote of every 18-year-old in the UK? John Richards Oxford Do the Tories seriously believe that grandparents like us with five grandkids under the age of 14 will be voting for the reintroduction of national service so they can learn how to carry out orders, march and use guns? Rather, we wish them a peaceful future, a clean environment, a university education, good friends and free access to a fully funded NHS. Viv and Mick Beeby Bristol What did I gain from my national service? I learned to type and improved my social skills, but otherwise it was a waste of two years. Surely the money would be better spent on apprenticeships and reducing university fees. Harry Chesney Loughborough, Leicestershire When no 18-year-olds turn up at universities in September 2025, how will the higher education establishment manage a 33% cut in its undergraduate funding? Charles Jenkins Wrexham, Denbighshire Rather than turning the armed forces and charities into youth workers, why didn’t Rishi Sunak consider restoring the £1bn cut from youth services since 2010, and using the skills of the 4,500 trained youth workers lost since then. Pam Walker Hartburn, Northumberland If Tories like James Cleverly dislike the idea of young people living “ in a bubble ”, they could start by closing public schools. Laura Wright Bleadon, Somerset The restoration of national service would instil discipline, respect and an understanding of team-playing, which so many young people need. A bold but a necessary move to help standards of morals and behaviour. Jonathan Longstaff Buxted, East Sussex Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

        "content": "The House of Representatives Committee on Shipping Services and Related Matters on Monday, said the Nigerian Shipping and Port Economic Regulatory Agency Bill will curb arbitrary charges and other illegality of operators in the nation’s maritime industry when passed into law. Speaking with newsmen after a Public Hearing on the repeal of the Nigerian Shippers Council Act, Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Abdussamad Dasuki, explained that the Committee is still collating memoranda from various stakeholders on the bill before going ahead to present the report before the House of Representatives for third reading. According to Dasuki, the bill seeks to repeal a law preventing Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) from enforcing a presidential directive concerning economic regulation of the ports. “We are still collating memoranda. You know the next process is to present the report to the House of Representatives for consideration. The public hearing today (Monday) showed that every stakeholder in the Nigerian Maritime industry wants an economic regulator for the industry. The era of impunity has to stop. There are no concerns from everybody. The stakeholders input were very useful and educative for us today.” He continued, “The bill is to repeal a law which is preventing the Nigerian Shippers Council from enforcing a presidential directive concerning economic regulation of the ports. The nation’s maritime industry is overdue for this, and we will see to its implementation.” Also speaking, the Minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Adegboyega Oyetola explained that the new bill will enthrone regulatory framework in the Nigerian Maritime industry. Represented by the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Olorunola Olufemi, the Oyetola stated that the ministry is elated to be part of the process that will reform the sector. He also disclosed the readiness of his ministry to partner with necessary stakeholders to enthrone regulatory framework for the maritime sector. “The Ministry of Marine and Blue Economy is willing to partner with all stakeholders in the sector, especially the National Assembly, to enthrone regulatory framework for the Marine and Blue Economy industry. It is on this note that we are eager and very happy to be a part of the process that will reform the sector. “The Ministry is in the process of collating its considerations on this bill and submit accordingly. We will encourage all stakeholders to also contribute their quota towards the actualisation of this process for the interest of the nation,” Oyetola said. Speaking earlier, the Executive Secretary of the NSC, Barrister Pius Akutah explained that concerns raised by some stakeholders will be taken into consideration. “I am very impressed with the outcome of today’s public hearing. I am particularly grateful to the minister of Marine and Blue Economy, Gboyega Oyetola for his support. This is one of the Key Performances Indicators that we signed with the Honourable Minister. “On some concerns raised by some stakeholders, some of them are Germaine and will be looked at, going forward. We are not bringing in a law that will strangulate the sector. The intention is to bring sanity to the sector and to ensure that the sector is booming,” Akutah said.",

(Watch the video below.) In a C-SPAN clip shared by a MeidasTouch editor on Sunday, Jeff Coleman told Chair Angela McArdle he had “a request for information.” Advertisement “Did this body grab a former president by the pussy last night?” he asked, clearly expecting a big reaction. “Sit down,” McArdle snapped. “Completely out of order. ... No.” Request for information at the Libertarian National Convention: Did this body grab a former president by the p—— last night? pic.twitter.com/qizZehgVYh — Acyn (@Acyn) May 26, 2024 Summoning the president’s most misogynistic quote , which Trump uttered to describe the liberties he thought he could take with women, was not the best way to gloat. The convention repeatedly booed Trump and shouted insults at him when he made an appearance on Saturday. On Sunday both Trump and independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were nominated by delegates to be the party’s presidential nominee, but Trump was ruled ineligible by McArdle because he didn’t file the necessary paperwork. Advertisement “But he was nominated, and it’s nice to be nominated ,” McArdle added. Chase Oliver was selected as the party candidate. With typical bombast, Trump said he would have won if he were permitted by the Republican Party to represent another party, thus enabling him to file the paperwork.
