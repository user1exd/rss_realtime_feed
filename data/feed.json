        "content": "Kieran McKenna is set to stay at Ipswich and sign a new long-term contract after attracting interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Brighton. The 38-year-old coach has guided Ipswich to back-to-back EFL promotions and a first Premier League campaign at Portman Road for 22 years, but there were question marks over whether he would remain at the club next season. Sky Sports News revealed McKenna was a candidate for the vacant Brighton job following Roberto De Zerbi's departure, while Man Utd officials met with representatives of the Ipswich boss . McKenna was also linked with replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Chelsea, but was told by phone on Sunday that the club were looking elsewhere. Sky Sports News also learned that Ipswich Town majority shareholder Ed Schwartz flew into the UK from the United States at the end of last week for talks with the club's chief executive officer Mark Ashton and McKenna. It is understood discussions were over a proposed new deal. And now the speculation around the Ipswich boss' future is set to end with McKenna poised to extend his stay at Portman Road in what would be a major boost for the newly-promoted club. Ipswich appointed McKenna in 2021, and in his first full season in charge he led Ipswich to promotion from League One to the Championship.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sky Sports' Adam Williams: On December 16, 2021 Ipswich confirmed 35-year-old Manchester United assistant manager McKenna had been appointed their new manager on a three-and-a-half year contract. \"Kieran who?\" was understandably the majority of the reaction beyond those who may not have been familiar with McKenna's work under Jose Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick at Old Trafford alongside Michael Carrick. Softly spoken at first, but methodical, clear and honest in his media engagements, fans soon welcomed the departure from McKenna's more brash and at times, overbearing predecessors. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Promotion would prove too tough a task to achieve in the remainder of that season as Ipswich finished 11th but already McKenna had irons in the fire for his first full season in charge. Freddie Ladapo, Dom Ball and Leif Davis would be the notable summer signings and from the off, it was clear the race to win League One that season would be hotly contested. Plymouth set and maintained the pace throughout while Ipswich, Sheffield Wednesday and Barnsley tried to keep up. After slipping down to fourth on February 14 with a goalless draw at Bristol Rovers, thoughts were understandably turning to another season of disappointment with Town eight points adrift of the top two. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player But January's transfer window had already seen four key additions in George Hirst, Harry Clarke, Massimo Luongo and Nathan Broadhead. They would prove to be pivotal as Ipswich went on to win 13 of their 15 remaining league games, including eight in a row, to amass 98 points and automatic promotion back to the Championship after a four-year absence. It felt good to be back in the second tier and as this season began, many supporters were hoping to just win more games than they lost and use it as a chance to continue building on the good work of the previous 18 months. But 46 games later they are heading back to the top flight. A season of free-scoring, free-flowing, full-throttle football has seen both Ipswich's and McKenna's stock soar. Erik ten Hag will be replaced as Manchester United manager only if the club believe there is a better option out there. The final decision on Ten Hag’s future will be made during the season review United are carrying out now. Ten Hag is waiting for the outcome of the review but is convinced he is the best man for the job. He is confident United will perform much better in the league next season if he stays – especially if key players remain fit and the club sign a centre back, midfielder and striker.

        "content": "NBA Hall of Famer and UCLA legend Bill Walton has passed away of cancer. He was 71. The announced Walton's death Monday. NBA commissioner Adam Silver released a statement on the two-time NBA champion. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" Silver said. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear, and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was a beam of light and one of the biggest and brightest stars in sports. His college and professional career was unmatched. The College Basketball Hall of Famer is a two-time NCAA champion, three-time National College Player of the Year, and a three-time Consensus first-team All-American. Walton was the Portland Trail Blazers' No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft. He spent 10 seasons in the NBA and was named a two-time All-Star, two-time All-NBA, 1977-78 NBA MVP, two-time All-Defense, and the 1985-86 Sixth Man. Walton spent his NBA career with the Blazers from 1974-79, the San Diego Clippers from 1979-85, and the Boston Celtics from 1985-88. His No. 32 is retired by the Trail Blazers. While Walton had a great career, he suffered numerous injuries throughout his historic career, including chronic foot injuries, a sprained ankle, a twice-broken left wrist, two dislocated toes, two dislocated fingers, a broken toe. He also injured his leg in a accident. These injuries limited his career totals, and he decided to call it quits after 14 seasons in the NBA. Walton finished his career averaging 13.3 points per game, 10.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists. The California native possibly had an even better post-playing career. Walton pivoted to college basketball commentary on national telecasts for ESPN, Sports, and Sports, among other outlets. He earned an Emmy Award for his analysis in 1991. Walton was a larger-than-life figure whose transcended basketball. He is survived by his wife, Lori, and four sons: Adam, Nate, Luke, and Chris.

In what was arguably his toughest campaign in Manchester since his arrival from Aston Villa in 2021, the winger has finished the season with just three goals in 36 appearances. Reports suggest Grealish is unhappy with his reduced role this term, and could be interested in leaving the Citizens in the coming transfer window. Bayern Munich have been linked with the England international, who was named in Gareth Southgate's provisional 2024 UEFA European Championship squad, with Vincent Kompany reportedly eyeing a move for the player. The Belgian is expected to succeed Thomas Tuchel at the Allianz Arena after recently informing Burnley of his wish to take the opportunity in Bavaria. claims City could accept a big offer for Grealish should they receive one ahead of next season, with the winger still having three years on his deal at the Etihad Stadium. The ex-Villa captain made only 10 starts in the Premier League this season after injuries and the arrival of Belgian wide man Jeremy Doku seemed to impact his role in the side. Grealish was also an unused substitute in City's FA Cup final loss to Manchester United on Saturday, while he also played no part in the team's final three league games of the season.

        "content": "by: Cameron Kiszla Posted: May 27, 2024 / 11:01 AM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 11:01 AM PDT A new front in the legal war over Arrowhead bottled water’s access to natural springs in the San Bernardino Mountains has opened up, reports the Los Angeles Times. While previous legal wrangling has sought to answer the question of whether Arrowhead parent company BlueTriton Brands is legally allowed to use water from the springs — bottled water has been taken from the creek and sold since 1906 — environmental activists are now petitioning the state to say the company’s use of water is hurting wildlife. According to Rachel Doughty, lawyer for the environmental nonprofit Story of Stuff Project, BlueTriton has “dewatered” Strawberry Creek. Doughty explained to the Times that if the company weren’t siphoning water in its network of pipes, Strawberry Creek “would be habitat for endangered species, it would be providing a downstream water supply, it would support fish, and it can’t do any of those things without water.” In an email to the Times, BlueTriton Brands said the company will “partner with people in our communities, governments, policy makers, businesses, and consumers to sustainably protect and shape our shared future.” “Responsible and proactive water stewardship is central to everything we do,” the company said. “We’re proud of the work we’ve done and continue to do in Strawberry Canyon, studying, reporting, and managing our operations to help protect the land and natural resources. We will continue to operate in compliance with all state and federal laws.” The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is evaluating the activists’ petition.

        "description": "Suzi Walsh says using puppies in yoga classes raises concerns about consent, exploitation and animal welfare.",
        "content": "PUPPY YOGA CLASSES are increasingly popular around the world, enticing people with the allure of puppies as a unique attraction. Although new to Ireland, the experience around these classes and the welfare of puppies has in other jurisdictions. You can see why people might think it a good idea to go along, what’s not to love about a nice yoga class, complete with the cutest, softest and playful puppies? No harm, right? Well, maybe we should all stop here and ask ourselves: Are the puppies there because it’s good for them? What are they getting from it? Do they have a choice? What about their welfare? Am I satisfied they’ve made their way here today because this is ultimately for their good, or is this just for my entertainment? Let’s look at what exactly puppy yoga is and why it should be avoided... Puppy yoga is worryingly emerging as a new fitness trend where members of the public engage in yoga while interacting with puppies. Much of the time, in various locations around the world, organisers can be found claiming there are benefits to both the participants and the puppies. Some providers of this global craze contend that interaction with animals reduces stress and anxiety while helping with well-being (presumably for the yoga participants). While this holds true in theory, the reality is that all of this relies on the animals themselves being relaxed, calm and content. Additionally, the idea that there are benefits for the puppies here, that it allows them to strengthen their confidence and learn to behave out in the world really doesn’t stack up. My view is that socialising puppies in this manner is likely to have the opposite effect. Using puppies in yoga classes raises concerns about consent, exploitation and animal welfare. Exposing young, often untrained puppies to unfamiliar environments and handling by numerous strangers can be stressful and potentially harmful to their physical and emotional health. Puppy yoga has been designed to entice the public into booking expensive spots in what is essentially a standard yoga class. An investigation recently uncovered some disturbing truths about puppy yoga classes in the UK. The growing trend comes on the back of the rise of social media, where posts to Instagram and TikTok help raise the profile of many influencers. When the investigative reporter questioned if the puppies had access to water during classes, the response was that it would only cause the pups to urinate more. Dogs should never have restricted access to water, they have the inability to sweat or store water in the way that humans do and therefore they can overheat fast leading to potentially fatal consequences. During this investigation, it was discovered that some pups were as young as six and a half weeks old, barely weaned and unvaccinated. It found that some users would pay up to £40 British pounds for a session. In a commercial environment, dog yoga classes should adhere to the same standards as other enterprises involving animals. They should require a welfare officer or veterinary specialist to be on-site at all times. This is a standard practice in the TV & film industry, and yoga classes should be no different. The welfare of the pups should be a priority but that cannot be the case if the participants’ needs are prioritised over that of the puppies. In my opinion, such investigations demonstrate that yoga class is not an appropriate setting for young puppies. In my long experience as a dog behaviourist and trainer, socialisation is about introducing a young animal to something in a way which is gradual and calm, they must have the freedom to choose to move away. At such a young age, it is crucial for their confidence development to experience the world at their own pace without being overwhelmed. Negative experiences during the can impact their behavioural development. Introducing new experiences — such as meeting people, encountering other dogs, and exposure to various noises and objects — should be gradual, controlled and occur when the puppy is relaxed. While we often discuss the lack of socialisation for dogs, but I have learned in my many years of this work that overexposure or flooding a puppy with stimuli for their well-being. A poorly socialised puppy may become fearful of new people, animals, environments and experiences. This can result in chronic anxiety and stress. For example, some have criticised the practice of repeatedly handling a pup over the course of a yoga class, and having the puppy passed from one person to the next. This is likely to create an aversion to people as well as an avoidance of handling. There’s a significant distinction between a puppy genuinely enjoying being handled and one that is merely tolerating it. Fear and insecurity can manifest as aggression towards people, or unfamiliar situations. Without proper and gentle socialisation, a puppy may struggle to cope with changes or unexpected events, leading to overreaction or avoidance behaviours. Other criticisms include concerns that a yoga class is long for a puppy. They have short attention spans and need lots of rest. Puppies need plenty of food and lots of undisturbed sleep. This is very difficult to achieve if they are participating in several classes in addition to being transported to and from a venue. So where do the pups come from for this yoga? Certainly, the UK investigation that the craze can be ‘a sort of marketing tool for puppy sales’ and lead to ‘irresponsible puppy sales’. The obvious fear is that unscrupulous breeders will step in. Responsible and compassionate breeders should never subject their young puppies to these environments if they aim for them to grow into confident and content adult dogs. I should make it clear, however, that puppy yoga is new to Ireland and there is no evidence of the involvement of any puppy farm animals. Regrettably, there are always irresponsible breeders who prioritise profit over the welfare of dogs, leading to numerous victims of illegal puppy farming each year. Last year, there was a record number of surrender requests, highlighting the urgency to stop supporting the unnecessary breeding of dogs. Puppy yoga only makes the breeding of pups that bit more attractive to those looking to make a quick buck. The answer is, “we don’t.” Instead, I would encourage anyone seeking positive interactions with puppies and dogs to volunteer with their local rescue centre, where teams work tirelessly to help animals in Ireland. There, you can walk a dog, transport a puppy, or simply lend a hand, knowing you’re aiding dogs rather than supporting puppy farmers and backyard breeders. While puppy yoga may appear harmless and enjoyable on the surface, a closer examination, particularly of experiences abroad, reveals numerous ethical, environmental and societal concerns. Yoga is a massively beneficial class to take in its own right, and there are some terrific studios offering amazing classes all around Ireland. I encourage you to do it for yourself without the need for an additional gimmick.",

        "description": "Using some of the same technology found in America's Cup winning sailing vessels, marine tech company Vessev has launched a premium tourism electric hydrofoil ferry.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Vessev VS-9 electric hydrofoil. The 10-seater vessel is being tested and will go into commercial ... [+] service later this year through Fullers360 in New Zealand. Once an engineering program lead for the original Apple Watch, Eric Laakmann has morphed into a sort of ferry godfather, as CEO of marine tech company Vessev . With Laakman at the helm, The New Zealand-based company unveiled the VS-9, what it terms the “world’s first premium tourism electric hydrofoiling vessel,” on Monday. After an initial test period going on now out of Aukland, once certified later this year, Vessev expects the VS-9 to go into commercial service through Fullers360 , New Zealand’s largest ferry operator. “It’s our intention for Fullers360 to be 100% electric or hydrogen operated by 2040 and foiling is absolutely a part of that vision for us,” said Mike Horne, Fullers360 CEO, in a statement. The 29-foot long VS-9 can carry up to 10 passengers plus a skipper at a top speed of about 30 knots, or 34.5 miles per hour, with a cruising range of between 40-50 nautical miles, or 46-57 miles.

Unlike a conventional vessel floating on the water’s surface, a hydrofoil hovers just above the surface, typically providing a more comfortable ride since it’s not affected as much by pounding waves. In the case of the VS-9, the company touts construction of the actual foils as a key differentiator enhancing control and passenger comfort even further while improving energy consumption. The VS-9 uses what Vessev describes as ultra-high authority hydrofoil systems, where the foils change shape using high precision flaps under the water to optimize efficiency, based in part, on technology used in America’s Cup sailing vessels. Vessev worked with Fullers360 and the ferry operator’s “decarbonization” partner NetZeroMaritime to develop the VS-9. Eric Laakmann, CEO, marine technology company Vessev. “The ability to remove the foils from the water completely is a design element we’re particularly proud of. We were told it would be impractical, but we’ve delivered a system which makes it easy for operators to maintain pristine foils for maximum efficiency. To our knowledge, the VS 9 will be the only certified passenger electric hydrofoil in the world capable of this,” said Laakmann in a statement. The Vessev VS-9 is not the first electric hydrofoil to be used as a ferry. Tech startup Navier launched a hydrofoil transit program with financial platform company Stripe in ... [+] the San Francisco Bay Area to transport Stripe employees from Marin County to company headquarters in South San Francisco. This past March, San Francisco, Calif.-based startup Navier began providing a water taxi service using one of its high-speed electric, six-passenger, N30 hydrofoil boats to ferry employees of financial infrastructure platform company Stripe to and from Larkspur in Marin County to Oyster Point near the company’s South San Franciso headquarters, about 22 miles each way. The N30, however, is largely being marketed as a recreational vessel for private use. Acknowledging the fact there are what he termed a “handful” of recreational hydrofoiling electric vessels in the marketplace, Laakmann maintains in email responses to our questions, “there are no vessels of this type which have passed survey for use in commercial passenger applications. Laakmann bases Vassev’s claim to be the “first hydrofoiling tourism vessel to operate in the world” on both the VS-9’s features and the arrangement with Fullers360, explaining, “We will be the first in the world to certify a vessel of this type for passenger use in commercial applications (tourism and point to point marine services). The VS—9 will be the first electric hydrofoiling vessel to be operated in commercial service by a private operator (Fullers360).” Laakmann points out the VS-9 contains additional attributes for commercial use that include: · Full battery structural fire protection and safety systems. · Designs reviewed and approved by regulators (load cases, structural design, electric system, etc) · DNV-GL design standards. “Far more significant safety systems.” Several VS-9 have already been sold with a starting price of $620,000, according to Laakmann, declaring, “We are calling it the \"Rivian of the Sea,” referring to the U.S. brand of electric pickup trucks and SUVs. Vessev is now developing the 100-passenger capacity VS-18. Indeed, just as the auto industry is moving more towards electric vehicles to improve the environment and reduce fossil fuel consumption, the marine sector is following suit for certain boating segments, in particular, electric hydrofoils. “There are 33 million vessels in the world today with sustainable vessels representing the smallest fraction,” said Laakmann. “Through significant enhancements in efficiency, hydrofoiling will play a key role in this once-in-a-generation shift.” Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "description": "The Super Bowl champ showed off his buff physique while enjoying some holiday fun with two of his kids.",
        "content": "Tom Brady is ready to kick off summer. On Monday, the retired NFL star shared a video on Instagram featuring him enjoying some splashy good times with two of his kids, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11 , whom he shares with his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. “You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!☀️🇺🇸🏄‍♂️,” he captioned the clip, which was overlapped with Post Malone and Morgan Wallen’s “I Had Some Help.” In it, the 46-year-old showed off his buff physique while driving a speedboat, jet-skiing and wakeboarding. His kids also joined in on the fun as they went tubing. The outing comes on the heels of Brady’s Netflix roast that poked fun at his personal life. The Super Bowl champ — who also has a son, Jack, 16 , with ex-Bridget Moynahan — admitted he “didn’t like” how his kids were “affected” by jokes made about his exes. “I loved when the jokes were about me,” he shared on “The Pivot” podcast. “I thought they were so fun. I didn’t like the way that affected my kids.” Brady shared that he initially signed up for the roast because he didn’t mind jokes being made at his expense but confessed he hadn’t thought the decision through. “It’s the hardest part about like, the bittersweet aspect of when you do something that you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize, ‘I wouldn’t do that again,’ because of the way that affected actually the people that I care about the most in the world,” he explained. “So it makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you’re naive you don’t know or you get a little like, ‘Oh s–t!’” During the roast, comedian Nikki Glaser made fun of Brady for breaking up with Moynihan while she was pregnant with their son. And Kevin Hart teased the Patriots player about his ex-wife, Bündchen, and her new romance with her jiu-jitsu trainer, Joaquim Valente. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

Page Six exclusively reported that the Brazilian model, 43, felt hurt because Brady “once again put football before his family” during his comedy roast. And, Moynahan, 53, shared cryptic messages on social media about being “kind” and “loyal.” Glaser then clapped back at Brady’s comments , saying it’s “impossible” he didn’t know what would happen during the roast. “I also think Tom Brady does not do anything without doing his research and knowing exactly what he’s getting into,” Glaser, 39, claimed on the “Today” show. Following the drama, Brady paid tribute to the “Blue Bloods” actress, Bündchen and his mom in a sweet Mother’s Day post . “Happy Mothers Day to these kind, caring, compassionate and POWERFUL moms that I’m lucky to have in my life. None of this would be possible without your love ❤️❤️❤️,” he captioned the post.",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal has all but ruled himself out of competing at Wimbledon next month. The 37-year-old Spaniard bid an emotional au revoir to the French Open on Monday after losing in the first round to Alexander Zverev. Nadal, a 14-time winner at Roland Garros, plans to be back in Paris for this summer’s Olympic Games and has not entirely ruled out a return next year. But he believes the quick turnaround from clay to grass and back again means he is almost certain not to return to the scene of his 2008 and 2010 Wimbledon triumphs. “It looks difficult, honestly,” he said. “For me now I can’t confirm what’s going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay. “So I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts. “But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. “Today I feel that’s not a good idea, but I can’t confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Unseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros. But Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd. The Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not “close the door” on a return to the Paris showpiece. 🫶🧡 — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) It seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players’ boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz – Nadal’s heir apparent – long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women’s number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Nadal added: “I didn’t see them, but I think in some way it’s normal, no? I think if that’s the last time that I’m gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it’s normal. “I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.” Also in attendance were Nadal’s wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni – his former coach – and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Vintage Rafa 👀 — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) They were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third. But a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight. So Nadal’s astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here. Zverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: “Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment.”",

        "description": "Nadal bid an emotional farewell to Roland Garros after a first-round defeat to fourth seed Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "Rafael Nadal has all but ruled himself out of competing at Wimbledon next month. The 37-year-old Spaniard bid an emotional au revoir to the French Open on Monday after losing in the first round to Alexander Zverev. Nadal, a 14-time winner at Roland Garros, plans to be back in Paris for this summer’s Olympic Games and has not entirely ruled out a return next year. But he believes the quick turnaround from clay to grass and back again means he is almost certain not to return to the scene of his 2008 and 2010 Wimbledon triumphs. “It looks difficult, honestly,” he said. “For me now I can’t confirm what’s going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay. “So I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with team. I need to analyse so many facts. “But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. “Today I feel that’s not a good idea, but I can’t confirm. But my feeling is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Unseeded after his long injury absence and still way below the peak of his powers, Nadal was unfortunate to run into the in-form world number four Zverev in the opening round at Roland Garros. But Nadal gave the 27-year-old, 10 years his junior and a favourite for the title, a serious match before going down 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 in front of an adoring and emotional Philippe Chatrier crowd. The Spaniard had told tournament organisers last week that he did not want a farewell ceremony as he would not “close the door” on a return to the Paris showpiece. 🫶🧡 pic.twitter.com/7DApnv0rxD — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 It seemed no one had got the memo, though. The seats behind the players’ boxes were crammed with current stars including Carlos Alcaraz – Nadal’s heir apparent – long-time rival Novak Djokovic and women’s number one and three-time champion Iga Swiatek. Nadal added: “I didn’t see them, but I think in some way it’s normal, no? I think if that’s the last time that I’m gonna be playing here and if I know that Novak is the last time playing in Wimbledon or in Australia and I was there, it’s normal. “I mean, happy that that happens, you know, because that means that I had a positive legacy here and positive legacy my career.” Also in attendance were Nadal’s wife Xisca, who rarely watches his matches, baby son Rafael Jr and uncles Toni – his former coach – and Miguel Angel, the ex-Spain footballer. Vintage Rafa 👀 #RolandGarros pic.twitter.com/PewWj1Dp9W — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 They were all treated to flashes of the old brilliance; the rat-a-tat volley exchange in the first set, the drop shot from three feet behind the baseline in the second and the flashing forehand winner to clinch a break at the start of the third. But a slow start had cost Nadal a break in the opening game which he never retrieved, while Zverev was too strong in the tie-break and held his nerve down the final straight. So Nadal’s astonishing Roland Garros record now reads played 116, won 112, as Zverev added his name to Djokovic and Robin Soderling as the only players to beat him here. Zverev, a gracious winner having left the same court in a wheelchair two years ago after hurting his ankle in his semi-final against Nadal, said: “Thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment.” We do not moderate comments, but we expect readers to adhere to certain rules in the interests of open and accountable debate.",

        "description": "Your first sexual experience can shape your emotions and attitudes around sex and self-image throughout your life.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Your first sexual experience can shape your emotions and attitudes around sex and self-image ... [+] throughout your life. A person’s first sexual experience is often regarded as a significant milestone in their lives. It is an event loaded with emotional, social and psychological weight. Research shows that it is highly common to have mixed or conflicting emotions about this experience, including happiness, fear and indifference. The reverberations of your first time can be felt for years after, influencing self-esteem, relationship dynamics and sexual and psychological well-being. Adding to this complexity are the various perceptions of “virginity”—as a gift, a rite of passage or even a burden— that deeply affect how people feel about their first time. Here are two primary ways your “first time” can affect you years later, according to research. 1. Feelings About The Event Impact Long-Term Well-Being A positive first sexual experience—characterized by mutual and enthusiastic consent, emotional intimacy, respect and emotional readiness—can foster positive emotions and a healthy sexual identity. In contrast, research shows that negative experiences, such as those involving regret, coercion, emotional unpreparedness, peer pressure and drug or alcohol use can lead to poorer psychological and physical health outcomes in adulthood and long-lasting feelings of guilt, shame, anxiety and sexual difficulties . Apple Brings Back iPhone 14 Pro For First Time—At Lower Price, Refurbished The Birkenstock Memorial Day Sale Features Styles For Over 50 Off The 82 Best Memorial Day Sales To Shop Now Before They re Gone Such experiences can also fuel beliefs that sex is inherently shameful or dangerous, which can impede healthy sexual development and future relationships. Additionally, a 2022 study published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior found that consenting but just “going along with it” in a first-time sexual experience, without feeling much desire for it, can become a life stressor and lead to greater psychological distress and poorer physical health outcomes in later life, even post-retirement. Importantly, the most positive first-time encounters involve having the agency to form your own definition and context of what pleasure means to you and engaging in sex only when it is something you completely desire throughout the process. Research also shows that women are less likely to have a highly satisfying first-time experience compared to men, as they are comparatively less likely to achieve orgasm . However, being in a committed relationship with one’s sexual partner enhances psychological satisfaction for both partners, highlighting the importance of feeling safe and connected to each other. Socio-cultural norms also play a crucial role in shaping an individual’s perception of their first time. In societies where virginity is heavily stigmatized or highly valued, there can be immense pressure surrounding this event. The fear of judgment or shame associated with losing virginity outside of culturally accepted contexts can also exacerbate long-term psychological distress. 2. Your First Time Influences Your Future Sexual Identity Research shows that the average American loses their virginity at about 17 years old. Researchers found that this initial experience influences one’s “sexual self-efficacy,” which in turn affects one’s current level of sexual adjustment. Sexual self-efficacy refers to an individual’s confidence in their ability to make their own decisions about their sexuality, practice safe sex, initiate sexual activity, communicate sexual needs, desires, boundaries and preferences with a partner as well as advance and navigate sexual relationships. Adolescence and early adulthood are critical periods for cognitive and identity development. One’s first sexual experience often coincides with these developmental stages and consequently shapes sexual identity and cognitive schemas about sex and relationships. A positive or negative first experience can influence how individuals perceive themselves as sexual beings and how they approach future sexual encounters. Research shows that positive first-time experiences can lead to greater levels of sexual satisfaction and lower sexual depression years later, in one’s current sexual interactions. Additionally, the disparity between societal or personal expectations and the reality of the first sexual experience can also have long-term psychological effects. Unrealistic expectations around sex, often fueled by media portrayals, can lead to disappointment, disillusionment and a sense of inadequacy, affecting sexual satisfaction and confidence in the years that follow. A 2021 study also found that if men believe they have not lost their virginity at an appropriate age, they tend to have more negative experiences and face sexual performance anxiety, lowering their sexual self-efficacy in the long run. Further, a 2016 study found that being a sexual “late bloomer” or engaging in sex for the first time after most of one’s similarly aged peers already have, can impact future romantic relationships. “We observed that sexually inexperienced adults perceived themselves to be stigmatized due to their inexperience and were not highly desired as relationship partners. Even sexually inexperienced adults themselves did not find other inexperienced adults to be attractive relationship partners,” the researchers explain. However, it is essential to remember that there is no “right time” to have this experience and it is best to follow what aligns with your own needs and values. Reflecting on your first sexual experience, regardless of when it happened, can provide important context for understanding how you feel about yourself and your relationships today. If it did not occur as you envisioned or desired, it is possible and essential to heal and redefine what sexual experiences mean to you on your own terms. The importance of safety, consent and readiness in any sexual experience cannot be overstated. Encouraging younger people to recognize the importance of positive initial sexual experiences is also crucial. Comprehensive sex education can enhance sexual self-efficacy by providing accurate information about sexual health, safe practices and communication strategies for the generations that follow, allowing us as a society to feel empowered in our sexual identities and establish more fulfilling relationships with ourselves and others. Understanding attitudes towards sex is an important aspect of self-awareness.

        "content": "WASHINGTON ( ) — When a Purple Heart recipient named Pat reached out to U.S. Sen. Patty Murray in November to inform her that he couldn’t transfer his GI bill benefits to his children, he wasn’t expecting congressional action to solve the problem. He simply just wanted to let the Washington state Democrat know, he told States Newsroom in an exclusive interview. With a child about to head to college, Pat, who didn’t want his last name used, had recently been told by the Army that he couldn’t transfer his education benefits to them because he received the Purple Heart after he was medically discharged. This rule does not apply to those who receive the medal while still in service. Murray and Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday aimed at closing that loophole. The legislation, titled the , would permit retroactive award recipients who served on or after Sept. 11, 2001, to transfer their education benefits to one or more dependents. It was unveiled just ahead of Memorial Day, when the nation honors its deceased service members. “As the daughter of a Purple Heart recipient, I’ve seen firsthand the enormous sacrifices Purple Heart veterans make to defend our freedoms, and I feel strongly that we should be doing absolutely everything we can to help all veterans and their families thrive,” Murray said in a statement Thursday. “It doesn’t make any sense that service members who are awarded a Purple Heart after their service can’t transfer their GI benefits to their dependents, while those who receive it during their service can — and I am grateful to Pat, my constituent in Washington state who brought this gap in the law to my attention,” continued Murray, a senior member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs. “Our legislation will close this loophole and allow more children of Purple Heart veterans to further their education. I want to thank Sen. Tillis for joining me on this legislation, and I’ll be working hard to get it passed into law.” Pat was medically discharged from the U.S. Army and retroactively received a Purple Heart for his actions during Iran’s retaliatory missile barrage in January 2020 on an Iraq airbase, after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. The Army later approved 39 Purple Hearts for service members who experienced the attack, to a December 2021 report by the Army Times. As his teenager looks to enroll at Central Washington University next year, Pat found out that by law his education benefits would only be available for transfer if he had received the award while still in service. “My thought was, ‘I doubt that legislators would have done that intentionally.’ I just thought, you know, people probably just didn’t think about how that happens — that some people are going to get retroactive Purple Hearts, or for whatever reason in evaluating them, they’re delayed. So it’s not like an unusual thing,” Pat said in a phone interview. “I wasn’t thinking much was going to happen, but I just wanted to write Sen. Murray, who is my local senator, and let her know the issue. They responded by saying, ‘That’s an oversight on our part, and we want to make good on that.’” Pat said he’s “grateful for Sen. Murray” and hopes his action is able to help other Purple Heart veterans. For now, his family is moving forward with the college enrollment process for his child, he said. Among the provisions in the legislation, Murray and Tillis’ bill would also allow veterans to split up 36 months worth of benefits to each of their dependents. For example, they could transfer 20 months to one and 16 months to another. The bill, if enacted, would also prohibit the benefits from being treated as marital property or a marital estate asset. And, the bill would permit dependents to access unused benefits if their veteran family member has died. “Purple Heart recipients are heroes who honorably served our country at great costs, and this oversight that prevents servicemembers who received this distinguished award after their service from transferring their GI bill benefits to their dependents needs to be corrected immediately,” Tillis said in a statement Thursday. “I am proud to co-introduce this commonsense legislation with Sen. Murray to close this loophole and ensure every Purple Heart recipient and dependents are able to further their education,” continued Tillis, who also sits on the Senate’s Veterans’ Affairs Committee. The number of veterans who retroactively received the Purple Heart after their post-9/11 service is unclear. The bill is estimated to cost $500,000 in mandatory spending over 10 years, according to an informal analysis provided to Murray’s office by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill has received praise from veterans groups, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “Unfortunately, not every veteran’s service and sacrifice on behalf of the United States of America is fully recognized while they’re still in uniform,” IAVA CEO and Iraq War veteran Allison Jaslow said in a statement Thursday. “The Purple Heart Veterans Education Act ensures that those veterans who’ve endured bodily harm on behalf of our nation, but weren’t recognized for it until their service concluded, are able to turn that recognition into an investment in the education of their loved ones.” The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have “greatly increased” the number of Purple Heart recipients as the Department of Defense has added some traumatic brain injuries as a recognized condition for the award, to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. It wasn’t until a that Purple Heart recipients were able to receive full post-9/11 GI Bill benefits regardless of their length of service. Previously, the recipients had to have 36 months of active service. The Department of Defense does not maintain a record of the number of recipients, according to the CRS, but by law they do maintain a publicly accessible list with the permission of the veteran or next of kin. Military historians and the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor about 1.8 million Purple Hearts have been awarded since 1932. The Army Historical Foundation as of 2016 that 30,000 Purple Hearts had been awarded since 2001. The CRS this statistic. To remove this article -",

        "content": "Thousands of Latin music lovers will be heading to Napa this weekend to witness . The two-day event, set for June 1-2 at the Napa Valley Expo in downtown Napa, features such popular acts as Grammy-winning pop-rock group Mana, corridos tumbados specialist Junior H, multimillion-selling vocalist Alejandro Fernandez and chart-topping San Bernardino band Fuerza Regida. The party is being thrown by the same people behind the massively popular BottleRock Napa Valley, which finished up its 2024 run over Memorial Weekend with Stevie Nicks, Pearl Jam, Ed Sheeran, Megan Thee Stallion and many others. Oh, and Mana — the Day 2 (June 1) headliner at La Onda — was also set to perform at BottleRock. Other acts worth catching at this first-ever Festival La Onda include Mexico City’s Los Ángeles Azules, Guadalajara’s Ximena Sariñana, Stanislaus County act Eslabon Armado and Dallas DJ/music producer RayBurger. In all, more than two dozen Latin music acts will perform across multiple stages during the two days. And, of course, there will be plenty to eat and drink over the weekend as well. We are, after all, talking about Napa. Tickets start at $179 per day and $309 for weekend passes; .",

        "content": "BOISE— Memorial Day weekend is shaping up to be a busy travel time in the Gem State. Idaho is about to enter the 100 Deadliest Days on Idaho roads- the time between Memorial Day and Labor Day when there is a spike in fatal and serious injury crashes. Seventy* people have been killed in crashes on Idaho roads so far this year — including the recent crash on US 20 in Bonneville County that tragically killed six people in one vehicle. The Idaho Office of Highway Safety (OHS) is imploring drivers to be vigilant and drive engaged this Memorial Day weekend and all summer. “We call this period the 100 Deadliest Days, but it would be great to be proven wrong. Make it safer out there for yourself and others by slowing down, putting down distractions, buckling up, and planning a sober ride home,” said OHS program manager Josephine Middleton. While it would seem like winter is the most dangerous time to drive, driving is more dangerous in summer. This seems paradoxical. Why would roads be more dangerous in summer when weather conditions are better? During the summer more people are out of school or work, on vacation, and celebrating leading to higher rates of risky behavior behind the wheel like impaired driving, distracted driving, and speeding. This summer OHS and its partners across the state will work together to remind people to make safer choices whenever they are on the road. Some of these activities will include partnering with law enforcement agencies to get dangerous drivers off the road, public awareness campaigns, and community outreach events. “We have a lot of wonderful partners who help us make Idaho’s roads a safer place, but we can’t just rely on them,” Middleton said. “We can all do a better job of looking out for each other on our roads and make it safely through this summer.” 2024 Fatality information*: 70 people killed in traffic crashes to date 2024 Fatalities by county: District 1 District 2 District 3 District 4 District 5 District 6 *All 2024 data is preliminary and subject to change.

        "content": "Smoke Justis is hosting an event designed to honor those battling Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS. The event, Q4A Cure, will take place on Saturday, June 1—the same weekend as Major League Baseball’s ALS Awareness Game. The goal of Q4A Cure is to bring people together to raise money and awareness of the progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Currently, there is no cure. Smoke Justis’ founder, Richard Dickmann, has a personal connection with ALS. Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) “In 2005, after a seven-year-long battle with ALS, I lost a good friend to the disease and another close friend is battling it right now, so for me, this cause is near and dear to me,” Dickmann said in a press release. “Over the past 30 years, I have had countless friends, relatives and customers that have had loved ones also fight this horrible disease, so, this is why we decided to host Q4A Cure. We want to bring as many people together as we can to support the mission of The ALS Association.” Starting at 11 a.m., Ben Maile and the Zack Attack band take the stage, followed by the Marty Connor Band at 3 p.m., with the Derek Alan Band closing the evening at 7 p.m. Marking the 10th anniversary of the Ice Bucket Challenge, Q4A Cure will be honoring this challenge that meant so much to the ALS community. Meals will also be provided with a minimum donation of $25 for adults and $12 for children, and pork barbecue will be included with a collection of classic sides and desserts. “On behalf of The ALS Association, I would like to express sincere gratitude to the Northern Kentucky community and everyone at Smoke Justis who have made this event possible,” said Drew Keelin, development manager of The ALS Association Kentucky Chapter. “This groundbreaking event, the first of its kind, will not only elevate awareness but will generate substantial funds for individuals bravely battling ALS.” Proceeds from Q4A Cure will be presented to The ALS Association on Sunday, June 9 during the Cincinnati Reds’ ALS Awareness Game against the Chicago Cubs. Reservations for Q4A Cure can be booked online at smokejustis.com/q4a-cure-2024 .

        "description": "Rafael Nadal is unsure if he will be back next year at Roland-Garros – the tournament he won 14 times – after bowing out in the first round.",
        "content": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal has cast serious doubt on whether he will play the French Open again after suffering his earliest exit ever at Roland-Garros. This year’s Olympic Games will be played at the home of the claycourt major, so Nadal will be back for that – assuming his battle-weary body lets him – but there is every chance he has contested his last match at his favourite tournament. Rafael Nadal remains unsure if he will return to Roland-Garros next year. Credit: Getty Images Nadal conceded as much after Alex Zverev played the party-pooper in a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 first-round triumph across three-plus hours under Roland-Garros’ new retractable roof as the German bids to win his maiden grand slam title. “It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know [if] it’s going to be the last time that I’m going to be here in front of all of you, honestly. I am not 100 per cent sure,” Nadal said. “But if it’s the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparation, and the feelings that I have today are difficult to describe in words, but for me, it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way that I felt in the place that I love the most. “It’s difficult to say what’s going on in the future. It’s a big percentage that I will not be back playing here at Roland-Garros, but I can say 100 per cent I enjoy a lot playing here. “I am travelling with family, and I am having fun, and the body is feeling a little bit better now than two months ago. I think maybe in two months, I [might] say it’s enough, I can’t give anything else, but it’s something that I don’t feel yet. I have some goals in front. “I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics – that motivates me, that’s going to be another chance. I really hope to be well-prepared [for that].” The Parisian crowd did everything they could to get Nadal across the line. Credit: Getty Images There was enough doubt for the likes of world No.1s Novak Djokovic and Iga Świątek, plus Nadal’s Spanish successor Carlos Alcaraz, to cram into a frenzied Court Philippe-Chatrier just in case this was it. The lion’s share of the crowd, from Nadal’s wife Maria Francisca Perello to his father Sebastian, long-time coach Carlos Moya and Spanish Tennis Federation boss Miguel Díaz Román, were left disappointed as he lost in the first round at Roland-Garros for the first time. Handed a painfully difficult draw against Rome champion and world No.4 Zverev in a rare visit to Paris as an unseeded competitor, Nadal produced some of his best tennis of the year. The 37-year-old legend played well enough to be up a break on Zverev – whose domestic violence trial in Germany will be held mid-tournament, without him needing to attend – in the second and third sets, but could not hang on. Zverev quickly reeled Nadal in each time he fell behind and looked every bit the title contender he is being billed as. The roof on Court Philippe-Chatrier, under which back-to-back women’s champion Świątek earlier breezed through to the second round for the loss of only three games on a rainy Paris day, was another reminder of the changing times. Even so, Nadal’s ability to still challenge one of the sport’s best players off an abbreviated preparation might be why he is finding it so hard to let go. There was mutual respect between Nadal and Alex Zverev. Credit: AP This was a much more pleasant experience for Zverev than their last meeting on this court. That epic, high-quality semi-final stoush two years ago ended prematurely when the German rolled his right ankle and tore three lateral ligaments before leaving in a wheelchair. “I have to congratulate Sasha [Zverev] for this great match and last week, [his] victory in Rome, and I really wish you all the best for the rest of the tournament,” Nadal said. “2022, I know was a super tough moment for you, so you deserve more, so many congratulations and all the best. “I have been going through a very tough two years, in terms of injuries. I went all through this process with the dream to be back here at Roland-Garros. It’s true that the first round [draw] hasn’t been the ideal one ... I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player like Sasha.” Zverev spoke briefly, and graciously, before Nadal but quickly stepped aside to let the 22-time grand slam winner take centre stage. “To be honest, I don’t know what to say. First of all, thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It’s such a great honour [to share the court with you]. I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court, and I don’t know what to say – today is not my moment, it’s Rafa’s moment.” Nadal took his time deciding whether to contest this year’s claycourt slam as he struggled to play anywhere near his imperious best on the red dirt, a surface he was nigh on invincible on for most of his hall-of-fame career. The former world No.1’s mind remains willing, but his ailing body stopped him making his much-anticipated return at this year’s Australian Open despite him playing in Brisbane and there were several other withdrawals after that, even throughout the clay season. Once Nadal finally did play, he was suddenly a mere mortal. Alex de Minaur became the first Australian to beat Nadal on clay in Barcelona, but conceded moments afterwards that the result would have been different in the Spaniard’s prime. Nadal recovered to exact revenge on Australia’s top player a week later in Madrid. However, he failed to reach even a quarter-final in any of the four clay tournaments he contested in 2024. Nadal fought hard but could not overcome title contender Zverev. Credit: AP He walked on court at Roland-Garros as a significant underdog – another new feeling – but gave his army of admirers plenty to cheer. Nadal picked at his shorts, pumped his fist with vigour after winning clutch points, oozed energy in general and fought as doggedly as ever. There were outrageously good low volley winners, screaming down-the-line forehands – including one brilliant one on the run off a Zverev overhead – and fearless shot-making in moments others shrink in. But Nadal mostly struggled to match Zverev’s big striking from the baseline, and reverted to serve-volleying where he could to shorten the rallies. As de Minaur effectively said after beating him in Barcelona: this is not the same Nadal who reigned over France for more than a decade. The end is nigh, but the Paris crowd revelled in the chance to watch the master one last time. Sports news, results and expert commentary. Sign up for our Sport newsletter .",

        "content": "Bobby Green has a big fight coming up at UFC 304 , but there’s another name he’s added to his hit list. Green meets Paddy Pimblett on the July 27 pay-per-view event in Manchester, England. Speaking on The MMA Hour , “King” previewed the Pimblett matchup, but said another fighter has also been relentlessly talking smack to him in his social media DMs. That fighter? Dillon Danis . “I don’t even want to give this guy the f*cking clout or the shine ...” Green said. “It’s the guy who sucks clout like no other. That guy is looking to suck up clout anywhere he can find it. “The Logan Paul fight [with Danis], that was f*cking horrible. It was such a terrible representation of what he should put as his work of art. That’s a terrible representation of that, and so he’s been hopping in my DMs and trying to talk sh*t to me, to promote to fight this guy. I’m like Dillon, Dilly, I don’t know where you think we’re even on the same level. I’m a full-fledged killer, you’re just a talker. You [haven’t] even fought nobody real.” Green said it all began after Danis’ back-and-forth with former UFC fighter Paige VanZant , which saw VanZant light up Danis as a “piece of sh*t” and not a real fighter. Danis’ approach to trash talk and promotion is behavior Green would like to use as an example for young fighters — specifically, how not to act. “I was talking to the young guys saying, ‘Don’t be like those guys.’ Because why? You’re going to hate it when [someone like VanZant] tells you [that] you ain’t sh*t,” Green said. “He jumped his ass in there, and now he’s begging for a fight with me. Man, before, these guys wouldn’t pay attention to me. I would post sh*t, I would talk sh*t to them, and they wouldn’t even pay attention to me. And now Dillon, he can’t stop messaging me. “And I’ve been kicking his ass every f*cking time. Kicking his ass.” In his most recent outing, Green earned a lopsided decision win over Jim Miller at UFC 300 in April. Green said he’s been hoping to get the chance to fight Pimblett for quite some time, and now he has it. It’s no coincidence that Green sees Danis and Pimblett as similar when it comes to trash talk and accolades. “In real life, [Danis is] getting beat up by a Logan [Paul], he’s getting beat up by a podcaster,” Green said. “He’s getting beat up by a fake wrestler. In real life, you’re not one of us. It’s the cool kids versus the brats. And Paddy’s another one of the brats. Look how he talks. “Look at him acting spoiled and sh*t like he did some sh*t. You ain’t done nothing in this motherf*cker yet to be talking about, and thinking you’ve earned something. You ain’t earned sh*t yet.”",

        "description": "Brings 140 years of manufacturing at the site to an end",
        "content": "Dulux is to shut its paint manufacturing business on Cork’s Commons Road by the end of this year with the loss of 45 jobs and ending a 140-year history of manufacturing on the site. The company, owned by Dutch multinational AkzoNobel, confirmed the manufacturing site and warehouse is to shut with operations moving to the UK as part of a rationalisation programme. When contacted by the Irish Examiner, Dulux said the Cork site requires significant renovations, upgrades and investment in order to futureproof it in the short term and that longer term, a new plant would have to be developed. As a result, it has decided to shut it in a move that would result in 45 redundancies. Most of the site’s current manufacturing volumes will be moved to the UK which will supply Dulux paint for the Irish market. “We understand the impact this will have on our colleagues and know that the coming weeks will be really difficult for everyone in our Cork plant, many of whom have worked at the site for more than 30 years,” said Seamus O’Donoghue, managing director, Dulux Paints Ireland. “We have an outstanding team in Ireland. But, as a global business we have an obligation to continually look at ways in which we can improve our processes, ensuring our products are produced more efficiently while maintaining the highest standards of quality not just now but into the future,” he said. The company said it will concentrate its efforts on supporting workers impacted by the decision and arrangements are being made to meet and consult with employee and union representatives. It said the only operation to cease in Ireland would be paint production with the company planning further investment in its non-manufacturing operations in Dublin. Sales, marketing, warehousing and logistics as well as AkzoNobel’s Dublin location are not impacted. The company will also expand warehouse capacity in Dublin to supply the Irish market. Under the same rationalisation programme, AkzoNobel said it is also closing plants in Groot-Ammers in The Netherlands and Lusaka in Zambia as part of a multi-year efficiency plan. When the Cprk plant finally closes at the end of this year, it will bring to an end more than 140 years of continuous manufacturing operations on the site. The plant on the city’s Commons Road which straddles the River Bride, has been at the forefront of the Irish paint industry for over 14 decades, dating back to when it originally opened its doors in 1885 when it was established for the manufacture of chemicals. By the formation of the Irish Free State in 1922, it was the largest paint and varnish manufacturer in the country. In the 1930s HGW Paints, as it was then known, partnered with British chemical firm ICI in the production of special paints for the Henry Ford assembly plant in Cork. In the 1960s the facility took responsibility for the manufacturing and marketing of ICI’s Dulux brand in Ireland. ICI was acquired by AkzoNobel in 2008 and more than €2m was invested in the plant in 2010 to upgrade the facility. A collection of the latest business articles and business analysis from Cork.",

        "content": "Organisers of this year’s Inverness Loch Ness Classic and Vintage Car Tour say the door is still open for late entries ahead of its return this Saturday. The non-competitive event, held by the Rotary Club of Inverness Loch Ness, is set to welcome owners of classic cars and vintage sports vehicles for a 160-mile tour of roads across the north. Co-organiser Ormond Smith said: “We’ve lost about three of four entries thanks to a certain concert in Edinburgh held by one Taylor Swift. A few are dragging their kids off to see the concert, but having said that we have three or four new entries, so one compensates the other. “We had set a deadline for our entry list, but we’re happy to extend the date for late entries. We are hoping that we may attract a few more as it’s all money to charities at the end of the day.” Classic Car Tours in the north and organisers from the Rotary Club of Inverness Loch Ness are looking forward to greeting entries from many parts of Scotland for this one day event. The tour is being held to raise funds for two local charities as its principal recipients this year — CHAS (Children’s Hospices Across Scotland) and Highlands and Islands Blood Bikes. Mr Smith added: “What we decided back in 2017 was to concentrate on local, or local branches of charities who will benefit directly from funds raised. We have supported CHAS in the past, but this year we are also supporting Highland and Islands Blood Bikes, who do a very worthwhile job in the region.” The route for the 2024 event takes in Nairnshire, Speyside and Glenlivet, returning to the Inverness Ice Centre base via Strathnairn and Loch Ness side, covering around 160 miles on A and B class roads. Among the cars already entered are a 1950’s Austin A105 Vanden Plas, a Morris 1000 Van — also from the ‘50’s — and evocative sports cars of the 1960’s like the Lotus Elan and the mighty Austin Healey 3000, and a rare Bristol 412 model of which only 97 were ever built. Full information including and entry form can be obtained from the Tour website or from event organiser Nicol Manson on 07774 695640 (before 8pm) or by email to nicol.manson@btinternet.com. Cars can be viewed prior to the start at Inverness Ice Centre before the 10am start and again in the afternoon as the entries arrive back at the Tour finish around 4pm.",

        "content": "In Fort Thomas where North Fort Thomas Avenue, Waterworks Road and Burnet Ridge come together, you may notice a bronze statue of a little girl reading a book. While it’s a pretty addition to a small garden created on the median by the Fort Thomas Garden Club, there is more to the story. The bronze statue honors Amy Head Fennell, a longtime Fort Thomas resident and past president of the garden club who passed away in 2021. Fennell grew up in the city and raised her family there. She attended Fort Thomas schools and graduated from Highlands High before earning a degree from the University of Kentucky College of Design. After establishing a career at design agencies in the region, she opened her own business, Ahead Design, in the city. Fennell’s husband, Bill “Frell” Fennell, said he and Amy grew up very near each other in Fort Thomas. Their parents were friends and had a tight and active social circle. The children grew up playing together and spending summers together, including trips to Florida for spring break. Get the morning's headlines right to your inbox with our newsletters Every Weekday Morning (The Daily LINK) Saturday Morning (The Weekend LINK) The families spent those summers in what Fennell calls “old Florida” before the building boom of condos and businesses in the 1980s and ‘90s. “We had a really cool place. It was 1,500 feet of beach. It was kind of like the old Dirty Dancing type of resort. It was one large cabin and four or five small cabins. They chopped it all up between parents and kids. It was under the Florida pines, so you could get out of the sun. You could have a fire on the beach every night...We just had the time of our lives.” said Fennell. Fennell said he went to college at UK as well, and love blossomed between the two longtime friends. The pair married and established their own home in Fort Thomas and raised their sons there. Although she stayed in her hometown, Frell Fennell said his wife had a creative mindset and talent that sometimes took her far from home. She worked on projects throughout the Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky region, but her work also took her to Tennessee, Florida, New York and North Carolina. She designed homes, condos, restaurants and boutique hotels. She was always up for a challenge, he said. “She always did things that everybody said, ‘You can’t do that.’ She once accessorized an entire condominium in Ashville in one day including driving down and back. It was an empty industrial building with exposed brick and drywall...She installed all the furniture, window treatments, pictures on the wall, made the beds with sheets, lamps, books, everything, so it was ready to live in. It was just crazy,” said Fennell. Amy Fennell was an active community volunteer throughout her life, often drawing on her design and business skills in support of area schools and other projects in the city, said her husband. “She was always giving back, doing something for someone else,” he said. When their sons were in school, she volunteered to chair fundraising events. At Johnson, she volunteered for the school’s annual Hullabaloo fundraiser and later served as chair. While the record for earnings for the event had been around $25,000, as chair Fennell more than doubled the proceeds. “She was very talented and creative...and she always accepted a challenge by going the extra mile,” Fennell said. When their sons reached high school, Amy Fennell turned her attention to supporting her alma mater, where she served on and chaired committees to raise funds for sports teams and other school needs. It was this spirit of giving back, especially to the area schools, that the garden club wanted to celebrate with the little statue, said current club president Lori Wendling, a close friend of Fennell. “Amy was a lifelong member and a generational member of the garden club of Fort Thomas. After she passed, many friends donated to the garden club in her honor. It was decided that a permanent statue of the young girl reading a book would be the perfect memorial,” Wendling said. She said the location, near Johnson School, seemed fitting since Fennell supported the school in many ways for many years. “We chose that because Amy had a very strong connection to Johnson. She went there as a child. She’s always lived right in that community area. It was her home school. It was the elementary school for her kids. And she volunteered there a ton. And we thought, you know, that’d be a good memory,” said Wendling. Wendling and another club member Alison Murphy, owner of Branch Out Design, worked on the project and oversaw the purchase and installation of the statue. They planted rose bushes and a variety of pink flowers around it. Fennell’s friends and family wanted something permanent and something that would reflect her lifelong connection to the community.

        "content": "Tech stocks have been the needle-mover of the economy for the last two decades. Most can’t argue that the stock market has been supercharged by the sheer dominance of tech companies over this time frame. Calls for a bubble are proliferating, but I do not think we are in a tech bubble right now. The average person spends a significant amount of their time online, and that’s not going to change. So, it’s likely going to be a smart idea to continue buying tech stocks over time. These companies are simply much more likely to increase in value over the long-run, as key catalysts such as AI become ubiquitous. Funnily enough, you could search up almost any company right now in any sector (even agriculture), and more likely than not, you’ll hear their management team tout how they use AI. In my opinion, the tech revolution is far from over, as this is one of the mega trends I think can take the entire tech sector higher over time. This article isn’t going to be an AI pure-play article, though. I will focus more on tech startups with solid growth and a clear path to profits. Here are three tech stocks to consider that you likely haven’t heard of before. M-Tron Industries (MPTI) M-Tron Industries (NYSEMKT: MPTI ) is a drone technology company operating in the aerospace and defense sectors. This is a company that I’ve long believed has strong potential for significant growth in the coming years. In Q4 2023, M-Tron posted impressive 29% year-over-year revenue growth to $41.2 million . That’s outstanding, and is the kind of growth many tech investors are looking for. However, what really stood out to me is the company’s increasingly profitable business model. M-Tron’s gross profit margin jumped from 35.6% to 40.7% as the company benefited from higher sales volumes and an improved mix of products. And if you exclude a one-time stock compensation expense, their operating profit margin would have reached 14.6% compared to just 9.1% the prior year. That level of improved operational efficiency can really accelerate earnings growth over the long-term. Notably, M-Tron also has a solid order backlog of $47.8 million on its books, up 3.6% from 2022, and an order filling rate above 1-times. In my view, this shows the company has both near-term revenue visibility and ample potential for continued business expansion. The cash flow growth here is also solid. With M-Tron making smart financial investments in research and development, talent recruitment, and equipment upgrades, I expect its profitability to keep increasing over time. I believe MPTI stock is a hidden gem that is well-positioned to significantly increase in value. Turtle Beach (HEAR) Turtle Beach (NASDAQ: HEAR ) is a company in the gaming accessory industry that seems to be flying under the radar currently. However, this is also a company that appears poised for tremendous growth over time. Even though the stock is up nearly 133% from its trough in 2022, I think this smaller company has the opportunity to potentially see its stock price quadruple over the next two years alone. That’s partly due to Turtle Beach’s very impressive financial performance in Q1. The company reported an 8.6% increase in revenue to $55.9 million . The company also moved into the green, providing $1.4 million in adjusted EBITDA. That’s a stark reversal from the $2.8 million loss in EBITDA they experienced in the same period last year. However, perhaps even more notable is that the overall gaming headsets and controllers markets saw double-digit growth during this time. Accordingly, this company seems well-positioned to capitalize on this momentum, as they are launching a whole new lineup of products in the very near future. The company’s Stealth Ultra controller and VelocityOne simulation gear appear to be fueling gains in HEAR’s market share. For example, their portion of the flight simulation market increased from 20% to 25% over the past year alone. Analysts expect nearly 30% annual earnings per share growth over the next two years. In my view, HEAR stock is definitely one of the top tech plays in the market right now. Intellicheck (IDN) Intellicheck (NASDAQ: IDN ) is an identity verification company that I believe has great growth potential over the next few years. In Q1, the company was able to deliver solid results for adjusted EBITDA (though it was still slightly in the red), and Intellicheck’s management team continued to increase recurring software revenue over the previous 12-month period. Given the company’s current growth trajectory and profitability targets, management expects that by the end of 2024, Intellicheck will achieve positive net income and adjusted EBITDA. The size of the market opportunity Intellicheck addresses is huge. According to a report from Javelin Research , losses from identity theft increased 13% to $23 billion in 2023. Intellicheck’s innovative identity authentication solutions are perfectly suited to help businesses protect their customers without adding unnecessary hassles. Despite the company’s massive growth opportunity (especially in their finance segment), IDN stock currently trades around $3 per share. That translates into only 2.7-times forward sales, as of writing. In my view, that’s dirt cheap for a company that has the potential to surpass the $12 level by 2026. This is one company worth watching closely. On the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Bill Walton , two-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer who went on to become an Emmy-winning broadcaster for ESPN and other networks, died Monday following a lengthy battle with cancer, the league announced. He was 71. “Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA’s 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. Related Stories News Hollywood & Media Deaths In 2024: Photo Gallery & Obituaries News Johnny Wactor Dies: ‘General Hospital’ & ‘Siberia’ Actor Was 37 “Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton famously played for coach John Wooden and the UCLA Bruins, leading UCLA to NCAA championships in 1972 and 1973, along with an 88-game winning streak. In the 1973 NCAA title game between UCLA and Memphis, Walton shot a remarkable 21 for 22 from the field. He also won three consecutive national college player of the year awards from 1972-1974. As the first overall pick in the 1974 NBA draft, Walton was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers, leading the team to an NBA championship in 1977, and earning the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award that same season. He went on to win another NBC title in 1986 with the Boston Celtics. He also played for the San Diego and eventually LA Clippers. After retiring from the NBA, Walton moved on to a second career as a sportscaster, working both as a studio analyst and color commentator at several networks and teams. He earned an Emmy Award for his work in 1991. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. Walton joined ESPN in 2002 after 12 years at NBC as a lead analyst for NBA games, later shifting to college basketball in 2012. He was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time by the American Sportscasters Association in 2009. DEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:",

        "description": "TORONTO - Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action...",
        "content": "TORONTO — Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United. Coach John Herdman said Laryea will travel with the MLS team for Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia but won’t take the field until Saturday. With two away games this week, Toronto plans to stay south of the border after the mid-week game. Laryea, one of Toronto’s designated players along with Italian stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, underwent surgery March 23 in London, England. At the time, his recovery time was said to be three months. Herdman said Laryea won’t be on the active roster for the Philadelphia game. “The expectation is Richie will play minutes against D.C. United,” Herdman said after training Monday. “That’s been the plan, so this week he’s ramping up. He’ll hit all his sort of final check boxes and put a real intense training week in but will travel with the team so he’s ready to go against D.C.” The 29-year-old Laryea and TFC captain Jonathan Osorio were included Monday in Jesse Marsch’s first roster selection as Canada coach for friendlies June 6 and 9 against the Netherlands and France. “I’m proud for those lads,” said Herdman, who stepped down in August as Canada coach to take over Toronto. “I know what it means to them to represent their country. “Richie’s had a tough run so I’m pleased Jesse put the trust in him, because he’s a guy who loves playing for Canada. He gives his everything and I’ve seen him reach special levels in that Canadian jersey. While he plays in MLS, when he plays for Canada he’s able to show he’s got world-class ability. And I’d say the same for Osorio.” While Toronto does not have any games scheduled while Laryea and Osorio are away for the friendlies, Herdman will feel the pain during Copa America, which runs June 20 to July 24. “(Copa America) comes at time for us in June where you’d love to have had that full squad available,” he said. “But having been the guy that took players away from MLS clubs and not worry too much about it, being on the other end you’ve just got to pat these boys on the back and wish them all the best.” Laryea, who has 48 caps, last played for Canada in November’s CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal series against Jamaica. Osorio has 71 caps. Rookie wingback Tyrese Spicer, who came off in the 58th minute of Saturday’s 4-3 loss to visiting FC Cincinnati, is questionable for Wednesday’s game with a gastrointestinal issue. “We’re just learning whether it’s muscular or something different,” Herdman said. Forward Prince Owusu is being monitored for a tight calf. Midfielder Brandon Servania (knee) and defender Shane O’Neil (thigh) remain on the injured list. Bernardeschi returns this week after missing the Cincinnati game due to yellow card accumulation. Toronto (7-7-1) goes into mid-week play in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, two places and four points ahead of Philadelphia (4-4-6). TFC has won just one of its last four league matches (1-0-3). But it has won seven of its last 10 (7-3-0) in all competitions. — Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024 Neil Davidson, The Canadian Press",

        "content": "On Monday at 1:46 p.m. a severe thunderstorm watch was issued by the National Weather Service in effect until 9 p.m. for Adams, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lycoming, Montour, Northumberland, Perry, Snyder, Sullivan, Union and York counties. Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To guarantee your safety in the midst of a thunderstorm, take into account the following recommendations: 1. Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. 2. Indoors safety measures: Once you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors. These precautions help reduce the risk of electrical surges, as lightning can follow conductive pathways. 3. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If no alternative exists, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. Remember that a tent offers no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. Heavy rainfall may lead to flooding if prolonged or if there is excessive runoff. Excessive runoff can be a result of saturated ground and/or rainfall intensity. Follow these recommendations from the weather service to stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of swollen waterways: In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger. Maintain safe driving distances: Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness. Reduce speed and drive cautiously: On wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water. Prioritize visibility Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them. Watch out for slippery roads: The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Don't follow large trucks or buses too closely. The spray created by their large tires reduces your vision. Take care when passing them as well; if you must pass, do so quickly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots. If the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia – The International Organization for Migration on Sunday increased its estimate of the death toll from a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea to more than 670 as emergency responders and traumatised relatives gave up hope that any survivors will now be found. Serhan Aktoprak, Chief of the UN migration agency’s mission in the South Pacific island nation, said the revised death toll was based on calculations by Yambali village and Enga provincial officials that more than 150 homes had been buried by Friday’s landslide. The previous estimate had been 60 homes. “They are estimating that more than 670 people (are) under the soil at the moment,” Aktoprak told The Associated Press. Local officials had initially put the death toll on Friday at 100 or more. Only five bodies and a leg of a sixth victim had been recovered by Sunday. Around 250 additional houses have been condemned since the landslide because of still-shifting ground, leaving an estimated 1,250 people homeless, officials said. Crews have given up hope of finding survivors under earth and rubble 6 to 8 metres deep. “People are coming to terms with this so there is a serious level of grieving and mourning,” Aktoprak said. He said the new estimated death toll was “not solid” because it was based on the average size of the region’s families per household. He would not speculate on the possibility that the actual toll could be higher. Relief crews were moving survivors to safer ground on Sunday as tons of unstable earth and tribal warfare, which is rife in the Papua New Guinea Highlands, threatened the rescue effort. Convoys that have transported food, water, and other essential supplies since Saturday to the devastated village 60 kilometres from the provincial capital, Wabag, have faced risks related to tribal fighting in Tambitanis village, about halfway along the route. Papua New Guinea soldiers were providing security for the convoys. Eight locals were killed in a clash between two rival clans on Saturday in a longstanding dispute unrelated to the landslide. Around 30 homes and five retail businesses were burned down in the fighting, local officials said. Aktoprak said he did not expect tribal combatants would target the convoys but noted that opportunistic criminals might take advantage of the mayhem to do so. “This could basically end up in carjacking or robbery,” Aktoprak said. “There is not only concern for the safety and security of the personnel, but also the goods because they may use this chaos as a means to steal.” Australia, a near neighbour and Papua New Guinea’s most generous provider of foreign aid, along with the United States are among governments that have publicly stated their readiness to do more to help responders. Papua New Guinea is a diverse, developing nation with 800 languages and 10 million people who are mostly subsistence farmers.",

The former President's hand barely left his head during Sunday's NASCAR Cup Series Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina. Trump Force One sent the crowds wild by flying over the track, then Trump got a warm reception as he waved to the fans in the stands. Trump snaps back at booing crowd as he's branded 'worst president in history' Republican governor faces backlash after pushing to get Biden on state ballot Wearing his famosu red MAGA cap, Trump walked down the pit lane as NASCAR fans shouted \"make America great again\" and \"you're our man, Trump.\" However, he was slammed for actually showing a lack of respect by saluting during the National Anthem and a rendition of Saving Grace. Taking to X, one person wrote: \"Serious question. Why is he saluting? He is not the President anymore--so not the Commander in Chief, and he was never in the military. He looks silly saluting.\" \"It should be hand over heart and that is one of the worst salutes I have seen,\" added another. A third said: \"He is saluting whom during the National Anthem? Most hold their hand over their heart.\" Technically, civilians should avoid saluting as a service member would and should place their hand or hat over their heart.

Trump was also seen saluting to a military fly-over that happened before the race. He managed to make his way round a lot of the race course, taking in views from the suite, a special box at pit road and on the rooftop. At one stage he was seen waring noise-canceling headphones as the cars zoomed past. The former President also got the chance to meet 'king of NASCAR' Richard Petty, who has supported Trump since 2016 and gave him a hug. Trump was also the guest of car owner Richard Childress atop the pit box for the No. 3 Chevrolet driven by Austin Dillon. Sadly, the race was shortened due to the rain and was won by Christopher Bell.",

        "content": "The Simpsons , one of the most iconic TV shows in history, has had its fair share of shocking storylines. One such storyline was so controversial that creator Matt Groening has disowned the episode entirely. Simpsons script writer calls out Jeopardy host over huge error on show The Simpsons kill off major character as Lisa unleashes into a murderous rampage The episode in question, The Principal and the Pauper, is widely regarded as one of the show's worst. It was so poorly received that Groening has vowed never to discuss it again. The plot revolves around Seymour Skinner, the principal of Springfield Elementary , preparing to celebrate his 20th anniversary at the school. A surprise party is planned by the school staff, and everything seems to be going smoothly until a mysterious man arrives claiming to be the real Seymour Skinner. In a shocking twist, it turns out he is telling the truth. The backstory reveals that the two men met in the Army, and the person everyone knew as Seymour Skinner was actually Armin Tamzarian.

Armin went to deliver the tragic news to Seymour's mother, who mistook him for her real son. When the truth comes out, Armin leaves Springfield and the real Seymour takes over as principal. However, the townsfolk shun the real Seymour, preferring the imposter. By the end of the episode, Judge Snyder declares that Armin will once again become Seymour Skinner, and the real Seymour is banished from the town. The Simpsons episode, The Principal and the Pauper, has long been a subject of criticism for its outlandish plotline. It seems fans aren't alone in their disdain. In a 2002 interview with Rolling Stone, Matt Groening confessed that the episode was a \"mistake\". He stated: \"We make some missteps, but we acknowledge it on the show. We had an episode where it was revealed that Principal Skinner was an impostor. By the time we finished the episode, we realized it was a mistake, and we had a judge say, 'We'll never speak of this matter again.' And we never did.\" The Principal and the Pauper is often seen as a pivotal moment in The Simpsons' history, frequently labeled as one of the worst episodes ever by fans. References to the episode have appeared in other Simpsons episodes, serving as a reminder of the show's increasingly eccentric storylines.",

        "content": "Basketball Hall of Fame legend Bill Walton laughs during a practice session for the NBA All-Star basketball game in Cleveland, Feb. 19, 2022. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File) Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "content": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded their evacuation orders at 8 a.m. Monday, lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. \"(The) alert will remain in effect until such time as the risk has been eliminated,\" the statement says. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelson on May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at Fort Nelson General Hospital are resuming. \"The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,\" the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality's mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what's expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online Sunday, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a \"tremendous amount of fire\" in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. \"The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It's had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,\" he said. \"And it's not just lightning that's going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that's giving us a lot of challenges.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "description": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires.",
        "content": "FORT NELSON, B.C. — Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded their evacuation orders at 8 a.m. Monday, lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. \"(The) alert will remain in effect until such time as the risk has been eliminated,\" the statement says. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelson on May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at Fort Nelson General Hospital are resuming. \"The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,\" the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality's mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what's expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online Sunday, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a \"tremendous amount of fire\" in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. \"The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It's had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,\" he said. \"And it's not just lightning that's going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that's giving us a lot of challenges.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.

        "content": "When it comes to a George Miller directed Mad Max saga movie, actors are committed 1000% to the stunts, but composers are there too for the long haul. So much so, that Furiosa composer Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL moved to Sydney, Australia to pen the score, his third with Miller after Mad Max: Fury Road and Three Thousand Years of Longing. In fact, there’s a fine line between the metallic bang of motorcycles and trucks, and bass, and one of the arbitrator of that is Holkenborg who had a hand in sound mixing Furiosa. You can listen to our conversation with Holkenborg out of Deadline’s Cannes Studio below: Related Stories News 'Furiosa' Inches Out 'Garfield' With $32M But No. 1 Race Still Close In Dullest Memorial Day Weekend - Monday AM Update News 'Simon Of The Mountain' Review: Federico Luis' Critics' Week Winner Is A Wholly Original Debut - Cannes Film Festival Holkenborg points out that when it came to the music in Furiosa, it’s character-driven given how it centers around the protagonist’s life from 8 to 18 years of age, versus Fury Road, which took place in a desert race of 48 hours. “Musically, everything was being told from a first-person perspective, which is being her, how she, watches the world around her, The Wasteland, its cruelties,” the composer elaborates. A key set piece in Furiosa are the 197 shots devoted to a big rig heist, a bulk of which doesn’t have music. The chords commence when we first learn of Furiosa’s role in the action sequence. “Where there is absolutely silence, (it’s) one of the most powerful tools that you can have as a composer,” says Holkenborg, “The earlier composers and the earlier directors understood this really well.” “George and I talked so much about certain classics like Bullitt with Steve McQueen or The French Connection with Gene Hackman, where there are chases in there where no score is being done for the majority of the scene, and then when it really, really counts, when something becomes really emotional or something gets really, really tense, that is when music is brought in to give that extra layer to an action sequence.” “Restraint was the way forward,” explains Holkenborg. Furiosa opened this weekend to $65.3M at the global box office. The movie received a near eight-minute standing ovation at its Cannes Film Festival premiere. The movie has high grades from Rotten Tomatoes critics at 90% certified fresh and audiences who gave it the same marks. Deadline’s Cannes Studio Is Sponsored by NEOM.",

        "description": "Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United.",
        "content": "Toronto FC fullback/wingback Richie Laryea, sidelined by a hamstring injury since the Feb. 25 season opener, is expected to return to action Saturday at D.C. United. Coach John Herdman said Laryea will travel with the MLS team for Wednesday’s game in Philadelphia but won’t take the field until Saturday. With two away games this week, Toronto plans to stay south of the border after the mid-week game. Laryea, one of Toronto’s designated players along with Italian stars Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi, underwent surgery March 23 in London, England. At the time, his recovery time was said to be three months. Herdman said Laryea won’t be on the active roster for the Philadelphia game. “The expectation is Richie will play minutes against D.C. United,” Herdman said after training Monday. “That’s been the plan, so this week he’s ramping up. He’ll hit all his sort of final check boxes and put a real intense training week in but will travel with the team so he’s ready to go against D.C.” The 29-year-old Laryea and TFC captain Jonathan Osorio were included Monday in Jesse Marsch’s first roster selection as Canada coach for friendlies June 6 and 9 against the Netherlands and France. “I’m proud for those lads,” said Herdman, who stepped down in August as Canada coach to take over Toronto. “I know what it means to them to represent their country. “Richie’s had a tough run so I’m pleased Jesse put the trust in him, because he’s a guy who loves playing for Canada. He gives his everything and I’ve seen him reach special levels in that Canadian jersey. While he plays in MLS, when he plays for Canada he’s able to show he’s got world-class ability. And I’d say the same for Osorio.” While Toronto does not have any games scheduled while Laryea and Osorio are away for the friendlies, Herdman will feel the pain during Copa America, which runs June 20 to July 24. ”(Copa America) comes at time for us in June where you’d love to have had that full squad available,” he said. “But having been the guy that took players away from MLS clubs and not worry too much about it, being on the other end you’ve just got to pat these boys on the back and wish them all the best.” Laryea, who has 48 caps, last played for Canada in November’s CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal series against Jamaica. Osorio has 71 caps. Rookie wingback Tyrese Spicer, who came off in the 58th minute of Saturday’s 4-3 loss to visiting FC Cincinnati, is questionable for Wednesday’s game with a gastrointestinal issue. “We’re just learning whether it’s muscular or something different,” Herdman said. Forward Prince Owusu is being monitored for a tight calf. Midfielder Brandon Servania (knee) and defender Shane O’Neil (thigh) remain on the injured list. Bernardeschi returns this week after missing the Cincinnati game due to yellow card accumulation. Toronto (7-7-1) goes into mid-week play in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, two places and four points ahead of Philadelphia (4-4-6). TFC has won just one of its last four league matches (1-0-3). But it has won seven of its last 10 (7-3-0) in all competitions. —- Follow @NeilMDavidson on X platform, formerly known as Twitter This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024",

        "content": "Bill Walton, the dominant college big man who won a pair of NBA championships and later enjoyed a successful broadcasting career, has died, the NBA announced on Monday. He was 71. Walton died after a prolonged battle with cancer, the league said. He was surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, and he led the team to their only NBA title in 1977. Named the league MVP in 1978, the 6-foot-11 Walton won another title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he earned the Sixth Man of the Year award. But that season proved to be his last hurrah. Walton, who battled injuries throughout his career, would play just 22 more games between the regular season and playoffs before retiring in 1988. Before his pro career, Walton was a two-time champion at UCLA, leading the Bruins to titles in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. His 44 points in the national championship game in 1973 remain a record. Walton was also a three-time national player of the year at UCLA while playing for legendary coach John Wooden. \"On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men's basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton's passing,\" UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said in a statement , adding: \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\" After his playing career, Walton overcame a stutter to become a successful sportscaster known for his colorful commentary, which often included catchphrases and hyperbole. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" A self-professed \"Deadhead,\" Walston sometimes appeared on TV wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts. He was also known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts while delivering his unique commentary, which could be equal parts entertaining and bewildering. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993.

Promotions and products are subject to availability and retailer terms. As we get ready for shorts and bathing suit season , saying goodbye to unwanted hair is a top priority for many (including me). I first dabbled in laser hair removal pre-pandemic when I got professional IPL laser treatment on my face at a med spa. At the time, I was nervous about the procedure and didn’t want to take any chances with my face. But after hundreds of dollars and a few years, I needed a touch-up. As I was leaving my last appointment a couple of weeks ago, having spent $60 for about 30 seconds of treatment, I started to research at-home laser options. I knew I wasn’t looking for any budget-friendly tools—laser hair removal is not where I want to skimp when it comes to devices! I also messaged The Curator’s Beauty Editor Adriana Monachino to see if she had any insight into devices. She was quick to send me a link to the Ulike . Story continues below advertisement It’s all the rage on TikTok , she quickly texted back, and reviewers claim it’s safe, it works and it’s pain-free. I slept on it and then decided to go all in. It takes about four weeks to see the full effects, but as the warm weather is quickly approaching, I wanted to share my results week by week. The Ulike is also on sale right now (don’t forget to add the coupon code!), so if you’ve been on the fence, now is a great time to give it a try. Ulike Laser Hair Removal The Air 3 is an IPL laser hair removal device that you can use at home. You’ll start to see a noticeable reduction of hair in about three weeks. There’s a ‘soft mode’ for your face and bikini area, a ‘body mode’ for legs and arms and a ‘power mode’ for chest and armpits. The kit comes with the device, a charger, protector glasses and a bag to store everything in. $359 on Amazon (was $459) How it works Intense Pulse Light Therapy (IPL) is where the light from the device passes through the skin’s surface and is absorbed by the melanin of the hair follicle. This process essentially kills the hair follicle, so it doesn’t grow back. Story continues below advertisement Now, in order for the light to be able to target the hair follicle, there needs to be contrast between the colour of your hair and your skin tone. The more contrast, the better IPL works. Ulike has this chart which will help you figure out if it’s the right hair removal method for you. (Ulike) Week 1 More Recommendations 20 Father’s Day gifts to show dad you care This Dyson Cool Fan is $100 off right now (hurry!) My target areas: Armpits, bikini and legs. Curator tip : Always do a skin test before you do a full treatment. I did a small area on my leg to see how my skin reacted. I had no issues, so the next day, I started. Step 1 : Make sure you shave the area before treatment. The kit comes with a handy travel razor which I used. Step 2: Plug in the device and hold down the power button. For the first week, I started with ‘soft mode’ just to see how I would react to the treatment. Step 3 : Place the device on your skin and press the flashing button to activate the light pulse. Slowly move the device along the treatment area, pressing the button. For larger areas like my legs, you can hold the button down so the light continuously flashes as you glide the device over your skin. How often? For the first four weeks, I will treat three times a week. Results so far : This device is cool to the touch, so even though intense heat is penetrating your skin, the device feels cool on your skin. After I treat my armpit, I can feel a bit of a stinging sensation for a few minutes—but it’s nothing that would deter me. No marks of any kind were left on my skin, so even though I don’t need a touch-up on my face right now, I wouldn’t hesitate to use it in the future. Use lots of sunscreen after! Slathering on your favorite SPF will be key this entire time. Story continues below advertisement Ulike Air 10 Ulike Air 10 Laser Hair Removal Want to kick things up a notch? Ulike has just released the Air 10. It has the latest technology and promises results in just two weeks. This device has dual lights which means it’s more powerful. Now, it also comes with a bigger price tag, but if you have a lot of unwanted hair and it tends to be dark and coarse, then this device is a great option for you. $559 on Amazon More from The Curator Miracle Balm: Is it worth the hype?",

        "description": "Mexico is on course to elect its first woman president this weekend, with two front-runners competing to break the highest political glass ceiling in a country with a history of gender violence and inequality.The post Mexico expected to elect first woman president appeared first on Khmer Times.",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY – Mexico is on course to elect its first woman president this weekend, with two front-runners competing to break the highest political glass ceiling in a country with a history of gender violence and inequality. Ruling-party candidate Claudia Sheinbaum and opposition hopeful Xochitl Galvez, both 61, have dominated the presidential race in the world’s most populous Spanish-speaking country, home to 129 million people. The only man running, Jorge Alvarez Maynez, is trailing far behind with just days left before the vote. “It’s a huge change,” said Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University, in the United States. “A woman president will be an inspiration for women in every single sector of the economy, politics, society, and culture,” she told AFP. Sheinbaum owes much of her popularity to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a close ally who has an approval rating of more than 60% but is only allowed to serve one term. A former Mexico City mayor and a scientist by training, Sheinbaum has 55% of voter support, according to a poll average compiled by research firm Oraculus. Galvez, an outspoken senator and businesswoman with Indigenous roots who represents a broad coalition of opposition parties, has 33%. Maynez, 38, of the small Citizens’ Movement party, has just 12%. Mexico’s next president will face an array of challenges, including managing migration, delicate relations with the neighbouring US, and criminal violence that has left more than 450,000 people dead and tens of thousands missing since 2006. Around 30 candidates for local office have been murdered in a wave of electoral violence since last September, in a country where politics, corruption, and crime are closely intertwined. Whoever wins, it will likely be business as usual for the cartels that control swaths of the country and smuggle vast amounts of cocaine, fentanyl, and other drugs into the US, experts predict. “They’re not going to change their attitude just because Mexico has a female president,” Correa-Cabrera said. Another major challenge will be Mexico’s complex relationship with the US, particularly if former president Donald Trump is reelected in November, Shifter said. “If he returns to the White House, Trump is expected to double down on his hardline stance on immigration, trade, and drugs – very sensitive issues crucial to the bilateral relationship,” he said. As well as voting for a new president, Mexicans will choose members of Congress, several state governors, and myriad local officials. In total, more than 20,000 positions are being contested, with nearly 100 million people registered to vote.",

        "content": "A&E’s new docuseries “Houses of Horror: Secrets of College Greek Life” exposes the dark side of Greek Row and its impact on some of those involved and will premiere Monday, May 27 at 10 p.m. Each episode will feature first-hand accounts of how the power, control, and secrecy of fraternities and sororities can create a cult-like dynamic leading to an environment where nefarious activity is able to thrive. For those how have cut the traditional cable cord and are opting for streaming services, you can still view the new series on Philo (free trial) or Sling TV (free trial). About the Show According to the show’s official synopsis, “Through exclusive sit-down interviews with those involved including former fraternity and sorority members, family, law enforcement and experts, the series details how these organizations that seemingly offer acceptance and community for young people have far-reaching consequences that can turn dangerous, and even deadly. Over the course of six episodes, the series details a variety of first-hand accounts of the dark side of fraternity and sorority life at universities across the country. From a pledge at the University of Missouri hazed into drinking excessive quantities of alcohol that left him close to death, and a junior at the University of Minnesota who fought back against the Greek system after she was brutally raped by a fraternity brother, to a shocking set of overdose deaths at San Diego State University, and the infamous Machine, steeped in racist traditions of the Old South, at the University of Alabama, the series offers a far-reaching examination of how the seemingly fun and frivolous world of Greek life could hide a much darker underbelly.” Where to find A&E channel You can find which channel A&E is on by using the channel finders here: Verizon Fios, AT&T U-verse, Comcast Xfinity , Spectrum/Charter , Optimum/Altice , DIRECTV and Dish .

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion as a player and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That all followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.”",

        "content": "Andy Murray bid farewell to the French Open following a crushing defeat by Stan Wawrinka , and his career could now be coming to an end. The 2016 finalist suffered his third consecutive loss to the Swiss star at Roland Garros, marking his second first-round exit in a Grand Slam this year. At 37, the Scot was defeated in Paris with a score of 6-4 6-4 6-2 in just two hours and 19 minutes under the harsh lights of Court Philippe-Chatrier. Reflecting on his past performances at the French Open, he said: \"I did really well here over the years. I always showed up and put in some strong performances, considering. It was a good run here over the years.\" Before the match, the 2016 finalist had stated that he had not yet decided on his retirement this summer, saying: \"When the time is right, I will stop. I don't know if I will play past the summer.\" His retirement seemed one step closer last night. Despite playing with a new Yonex racquet, the outcome remained unchanged. He hasn't advanced past the third round in 14 Grand Slams since his title defense at Wimbledon in 2017 ended in the quarter-finals. Murray will still participate in the doubles with Dan Evans in preparation for the Olympics later in the summer. After a final Wimbledon, it could be his last appearance. Follow us on X for the best and latest in sports news World No. 1 Novak Djokovic candid about his struggles and modest hopes for French Open Tennis power couple Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas reunite ahead of French Open Wawrinka, dressed in bright yellow shorts and trainers, dazzled the main court with his brilliant winners, and the one-sided victory was never really in doubt. He swiftly dismantled Murray, breaking him four times and surging to a 4-0 lead in just 15 minutes during the third set. The Swiss maestro clinched victory on his first match point with a 35th winner signature backhand down the line. Post-match, the two legends shared an embrace and exchanged words at the net before Murray paused to acknowledge the crowd with applause as he exited the court, reminiscent of his departure in Melbourne this past January, hinting at a possible farewell. Wawrinka expressed his feelings post-match: \"It was an emotional, for sure. My first words were respect for a great champion.\" Murray reflected on the match: \"Obviously disappointed. It was always going to be a tough, tough match. Stan has played brilliant tennis on that court.\" Murray continued, \"I was expecting him to play very well tonight. I think he did that. He gave me very few opportunities. I wish I could have done a little bit better.\" Despite the loss, Murray remained pragmatic: \"Disappointed but, I didn't have extremely high expectations with the way, you know, the preparation had been coming in. But obviously would have liked to have done better tonight.\" Earlier, Jack Draper's defeat to world No. 176 Jesper De Jong dashed hopes of a high-profile showdown with Carlos Alcaraz. The British No. 2 mounted a comeback from two sets and 0-3 behind to push the match to a fifth set against the Dutch qualifier. However, a visibly frustrated Draper let slip expletives and his serve at 3-4 after a disastrous ninth double fault on break point. The world No. 39 faced a crushing blow, suffering his worst Tour-level defeat by ranking in the longest match of his career. After an intense four hours and six minutes, he was defeated 7-5, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 3-6, 6-3. Visibly disappointed, he expressed his feelings post-match: \"Obviously very frustrated,\" and added, \"This loss hurts a lot. I know I'm so much better than how I played today, and that's what hurts.\"",

        "description": "Fans of Mad Max: Fury Road – Black and Chrome will be excited to learn George Miller has already made his alternate cut of Furiosa.",
        "content": "Furiosa is currently the talk of the box office- for better or for worse- but fans hoping for an alternate cut akin to Fury Road’s Black and Chrome release have reason to get excited. franchise creator George Miller sat down for a chat with Josh Horowitz on the Happy Sad Confused podcast to discuss the release of , as well as the past and future of the franchise. During the chat, Miller surprised Horowitz by confirming that an alternate cut of Furiosa was already completed. “We’ve done it already,” Miller revealed. “It’s the last thing I did on this film. I call it tinted black and chrome.” The potential for a black-and-white cut of Furiosa is undoubtedly exciting news for fans of the saga. Mad Max: Fury Road received a critically acclaimed black-and-white cut called Mad Max: Fury Road—The Black and Chrome Edition. Black & Chrome was arguably received better than the original, with many saying the film’s bombastic visuals work even better in stark black-and-white. This makes the second black-and-white cut of a film Miller has done, though the Australian filmmaker isn’t quite sure himself why he’s so fascinated with the desaturated art style. “I’m still trying to demystify why the black and white, for me, has something more elemental to it.” Miller tells Horowitz. “I still can’t quite put my finger on it. It’s not because they look like old black-and-white movies. If we took a picture of ourselves right now, it might be a little more dramatic if it was black and white.” Miller doesn’t offer an update on when or if Furiosa’s alternate cut will be released, but it may not be long. Fury Road’s Black & Chrome cut was released in 2016, a year after the original theatrical run. Given the success of Fury Road’s re-release, Furiosa’s may get a quicker release. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is currently in theaters, but it’s not all positive news. The film has had a shockingly soft opening weekend, charting the in three decades. You can see Furiosa now, or go read about what meant, as well as learn more about one of the film’s many twisted characters, . Or, read about all the this month. Related:",

        "description": "The Parliamentary Assembly of NATO has passed a new declaration urging the alliance's members to lift some restrictions on Ukraine's use of their weapons on Russian soil as the Kiev regime continues to lose ground on the battlefield.",
        "content": "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told The Economist on May 24 that Western countries should lift their respective bans on Ukraine using their weapons inside Russia. The newspaper alleged that Stoltenberg's target was US President Joe Biden's policy of limiting Ukraine's use of ATACMS long-range missiles and other weapons inside Russia except for Crimea and the nation's new territories admitted in September 2022. On May 27, the NATO Parliamentary Assembly (PA) - the consultative interparliamentary entity – passed Declaration 489 which urges the bloc's members to \"lift some restrictions\" on the use of their weapons by the Kiev regime against Russia's \"legitimate targets.\" NATO PA representatives from nine countries have reportedly not supported the initiative. Earlier, Italy and Germany spoke against the proposal that could lead to the outbreak of a major war between Russia and NATO. The Biden administration has not granted Ukraine a free hand in using its arms against Russia, either. \"The United States has made it clear that it too does not support the lifting of restrictions using American weapons,\" Scott Ritter, a military analyst and former US Marine Corps intelligence officer, told Sputnik. \"There is some debate , discussion and dialog inside the United States to reverse this policy. But, at the present moment, the United States continues to impose restrictions.\" { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_640x0_80_0_0_b398c48a0a435b16a4f550c347198885.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_640x0_80_0_0_3ef894f30d6e57ac4f6a7c525ebfdef5.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_640x0_80_0_0_3ef894f30d6e57ac4f6a7c525ebfdef5.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_640x0_80_0_0_2710efda21760b7f4caa76483fcd50de.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_640x0_80_0_0_2710efda21760b7f4caa76483fcd50de.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_640x0_80_0_0_a2fc6a27eee1ade4a02139a84123943c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_640x0_80_0_0_a2fc6a27eee1ade4a02139a84123943c.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_1280x0_80_0_0_c53abbb04288631f15f5da134df089d8.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1280x0_80_0_0_ef9e8ebd60ade9dbbe1ac89870581467.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1280x0_80_0_0_ef9e8ebd60ade9dbbe1ac89870581467.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_f0cb4d94957c89137f9c8ea3ab2111ca.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_f0cb4d94957c89137f9c8ea3ab2111ca.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_be5a5ae01fe3bb85102a56a9cfbdb484.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1280x0_80_0_0_be5a5ae01fe3bb85102a56a9cfbdb484.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:294:2216:1180_1920x0_80_0_0_ebc84af52c9c897f207aa761ed0c2837.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1920x0_80_0_0_174bb3300113f3eef9df11c29b94a0f7.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_0:113:2216:1360_1920x0_80_0_0_174bb3300113f3eef9df11c29b94a0f7.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e688d94c42112b500ac5df58bed314c9.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_127:0:2091:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e688d94c42112b500ac5df58bed314c9.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e6c811be7885c26349c3fde542c90f01.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/02/1117089119_372:0:1845:1473_1920x0_80_0_0_e6c811be7885c26349c3fde542c90f01.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } World Ukraine Might Not Become NATO Member Within Next 30 Years - Scholz 01:55 GMT However, it's up to NATO member states to decide whether to authorize the use of their weapons by Ukraine against Russia, despite Stoltenberg's calls or NATO PA's non-binding declarations. Ritter pointed out that \"NATO as an institution is not preparing for a larger war with Russia.\" He referred to the fact that so far NATO has conducted a policy to avoid escalation of the Ukraine conflict and prevent a full-fledged confrontation with Russia. The crux of the matter is that NATO member states are unprepared for a war with Russia, according to Michael Maloof, former senior security policy analyst in the US Office of the Secretary of Defense. \"All the [NATO] countries would have to switch their economies over from a service economy to a full production wartime economy. And they're not capable of it. They can't sustain it.

The pundits believe that support for the use of NATO-grade weapons by Ukraine stems from the transatlantic alliance's desperation over the Kiev regime's continuous military failures. In early May, French President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist that Paris could put boots on the ground in Ukraine if frontlines are broken and Kiev officially requests such assistance. Almost at the same time, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron told Reuters that Britain had given the Kiev regime permission to strike targets on Russian territory with weapons it provided. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_640x0_80_0_0_98668d6ec119bd21e56c5e19f647e264.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_640x0_80_0_0_c6bd0e0e9babc006efd21667dbaf3854.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_640x0_80_0_0_c6bd0e0e9babc006efd21667dbaf3854.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_640x0_80_0_0_062a2def597bb0824bfe7084950eac7e.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_640x0_80_0_0_062a2def597bb0824bfe7084950eac7e.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_640x0_80_0_0_a4f15f02ce1f09ed46a0ab50c68263f5.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_640x0_80_0_0_a4f15f02ce1f09ed46a0ab50c68263f5.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_1280x0_80_0_0_18a80bca2ddb7f05822f56aec2dfd4c5.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1280x0_80_0_0_ba8f82d4fd7cbebaca1dd6c53d934039.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1280x0_80_0_0_ba8f82d4fd7cbebaca1dd6c53d934039.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_00a88d6260afa964757247fda474388d.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_00a88d6260afa964757247fda474388d.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_cbed335c0e1061c35366e15404467261.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1280x0_80_0_0_cbed335c0e1061c35366e15404467261.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:290:2253:1191_1920x0_80_0_0_dce7ed155436721459223360ff7853e0.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1920x0_80_0_0_f1cf1969a36f4f3837f24984481d05fe.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_0:107:2253:1374_1920x0_80_0_0_f1cf1969a36f4f3837f24984481d05fe.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_66a31c45b5ebc6acd1e753157248b9ac.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_117:0:2253:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_66a31c45b5ebc6acd1e753157248b9ac.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_b52e2962100406d291cdde4fd6d2a683.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/03/0a/1117236767_648:0:2250:1602_1920x0_80_0_0_b52e2962100406d291cdde4fd6d2a683.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } World Macron and Cameron's Threats to Flood Ukraine With 'Men and Arms': Signs of Weakness? 3 May, 19:10 GMT Moscow has repeatedly warned the collective West against deeper involvement in Ukraine's conflict. Russia condemned Macron's statements as provocative and fraught with a risk of further escalation. Commenting on Cameron's words, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova noted that the British foreign minister de facto confirmed that the West is waging a war against Russia using Ukrainians as proxies. Reflecting on Stoltenberg's remarks last week for The Economist, Zakharova drew attention to the fact that the NATO chief's warmongering rhetoric came ahead of the so-called \"peace\" conference on Ukraine in Switzerland that is advocating the unworkable Zelensky \"formula\" while ignoring Russia's position. \"Objectively, the reality is that NATO is in no position to escalate the war and sustain it,\" Larry Johnson, retired CIA intelligence officer and State Department official, told Sputnik, reiterating his forecast about the Kiev regime's imminent defeat. \"Yes, they could put troops in. They could provide some temporary assistance to Ukraine. But really, there is nothing that's going to change the outcome or the trajectory of the war,\" the CIA veteran concluded. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_640x0_80_0_0_267c53f372d6881fb3292c6c817ae546.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_bd9cd68750a61ede19a32f97bc23f9f0.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_bd9cd68750a61ede19a32f97bc23f9f0.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_3da2ab1472eb4408631199356d9daac3.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_3da2ab1472eb4408631199356d9daac3.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_6039a67919a79e0c572548ad86087756.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_6039a67919a79e0c572548ad86087756.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_1280x0_80_0_0_b2c2d2cf5f896546a0c56058bacfba6e.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_aac87ab74d43c48d5352316537f032d1.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_aac87ab74d43c48d5352316537f032d1.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_b6a0c095dc1b437355ca7ffd5a5a0f4f.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_b6a0c095dc1b437355ca7ffd5a5a0f4f.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_27952844c909092804ab9fd741bf023f.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_27952844c909092804ab9fd741bf023f.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:410:3072:1639_1920x0_80_0_0_1caf154c7e20fa3f315bf160dd33a884.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_7fb22c5d865fad753acdff0727461f22.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_7fb22c5d865fad753acdff0727461f22.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c8939d59bd296baaa625f32e9cd5ee4b.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c8939d59bd296baaa625f32e9cd5ee4b.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_532370fc9e1570ee92c6f83643423e96.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/05/19/1118635499_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_532370fc9e1570ee92c6f83643423e96.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } Analysis Stoltenberg’s Call to Untie Ukraine's Hands to Strike Russia Shows NATO is Desperate 25 May, 17:26 GMT",

        "content": "The Detroit Tigers had an extra day to savor their biggest offensive output of the season. After getting Memorial Day off, they'll open a two-game home series against the Pittsburgh Pirates on Tuesday. Detroit extended its winning streak to three games on Sunday afternoon with a wild 14-11 win over Toronto. The Tigers blew 5-0 and 8-3 leads, then rallied to score the game's last five runs. Matt Vierling capped it off with a two-out, three-run homer in the ninth off Blue Jays closer Jordan Romano. \"There was a lot in that game to love and a few things not to love so much,\" manager A.J. Hinch said. \"But what an ending.\" Vierling, who had four hits, also homered earlier in the game. He was waiting on a slider and got it on a 3-2 count for his first career walkoff homer. \"My brother and I in the backyard, we'd always be doing situations like that,\" he said. \"It's kind of cool when it actually happens.\" The Tigers can reach the .500 level again with a win on Tuesday. The three-game win streak was preceded by a five-game slide. They'll have their best arm on the mound. Tarik Skubal (6-1, 2.25 ERA) will carry a little extra motivation into the contest after taking his first loss of the season in his last start. Skubal gave up four runs in five innings to Kansas City on Wednesday, requiring 96 pitches to get 15 outs. \"It was partly command and they had some really good at-bats,\" said Skubal, who had not given up more than two earned runs in his previous seven starts. \"They fouled off some really good pitches and there were too many pitcher's counts that went to 3-2 counts. And that's a credit, I guess, to their hitters. I've got to do a better job at finishing those at-bats.\" Skubal is 1-0 with a 3.46 ERA in three career appearances against Pittsburgh. The Pirates took two of three games during a weekend series against Atlanta but lost Sunday's finale, 8-1. Starting pitcher Martin Perez and catcher Joey Bart both departed the game early with injuries. Pittsburgh has listed its dynamic young duo of Jared Jones and Paul Skenes as its starting pitchers in the Detroit series. Jones (3-4, 3.05 ERA), a 22-year-old rookie, has gone at least six innings in all four of his May starts. In his last outing, he gave up three runs and six hits in six innings against San Francisco. He allowed a two-run homer to Matt Chapman in the sixth and the Pirates wound up losing in extra innings. \"I threw the pitches I needed to throw when I needed to throw them,\" Jones said. \"Obviously, I need to get better at throwing certain pitches in tight spots where that could end up costing us the ballgame. I think that's what happened. I don't give up that home run to Chapman if I throw a better pitch, (and) we probably walk away with a win.\" Jones will be facing the Tigers for the first time.

        "content": "In a year in which we have already been treated to the \" \" in April and one of the in the past 500 years in May, what other amazing celestial attractions might 2024 have in store for us? How about a bright naked-eye comet? Over the last couple of years, two comets have made headlines in the mainstream media. In early February 2023, Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF), informally called the \" \", passed near Earth and then during the past month, drew attention because of its propensity for experiencing sudden flare-up in brightness and appearing to spout gaseous appendages resembling horns, thus giving rise to the moniker \"Devil's Comet.\" The only problem so far as the person-on-the-street was concerned was that both comets were difficult to see unless you were located under a dark, non-light polluted sky. And even through or a , both were rather unimpressive, appearing as nothing more than faint, fuzzy blobs of light. The only problem so far as the person-on-the-street was concerned was that both comets were difficult to see unless you were located under a dark, non-light polluted sky. And even through good binoculars or a small telescope, both were rather unimpressive, appearing as nothing more than faint, fuzzy blobs of light. But by the end of this summer, we may have a good idea as to whether we'll have a bright and easy-to-see naked-eye comet gracing our early autumn evening sky. The comet in question is C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS), discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) in South Africa on Feb. 22, 2023. ATLAS is a robotic early warning system developed specifically for detecting near-Earth asteroids a few weeks to just days before they might impact . Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. Originally thought to be an , it was later determined that this same object was photographed six weeks earlier by the Purple Mountain Observatory (Tsuchinshan) in the east of Nanjing, . It has since been determined to actually be an incoming comet. When the comet was first sighted, it was far out beyond the orbit of Jupiter, some 680 million miles (1.09 billion km) from the sun. But on Sept. 27 of this year, Tsuchinshan–ATLAS will be making its closest approach to the sun, coming to within 36 million miles (58 million km). That also happens to be the average distance of the planet that is closest to the sun, . And just over two weeks later, on Oct. 12, the comet will pass just 44 million miles (71 million km) from Earth. These figures suggest that the comet might brighten to second or possibly even first magnitude and could develop a notable tail that could make for an eye-catching sight in the western evening sky during mid-October 2024. Unfortunately, there is a caveat: calculations show that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS has an orbital eccentricity of 1.0001081, meaning that it is a \"first-timer,\" coming directly from the , a spherical shell of icy space debris scientists theorize to be situated far beyond the and thought to contain billions or even trillions of comets. Comets originating from the Oort cloud have never passed near to before and their nuclei are coated with very volatile materials that vaporize far from the sun, creating short-lived surges in brightness. But as these comets get nearer to the sun, their brightening slows or even stops completely. Most — though admittedly not all — comets originating from the Oort cloud usually end up being duds. Typically, as these comets cross the orbit of , their steady brightening trend starts to falter, similar to a marathon runner at the 20-mile mark; \"hitting the wall\" so to speak. In the case of a comet having emerged from the Oort cloud, a sudden decline in brightening may be signaling that it ultimately will end up underperforming. Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS will not get to that point in its orbit until late July. If it then continues to steadily brighten beyond that time, then there's a good chance it will evolve into an eye-catching sight. But, more likely, if its brightening trend suddenly slows, or even comes to halt, all bets for a good show are off. Until then, all we can do is wait and watch. Unfortunately, we here in the Northern Hemisphere will not be able to check on the status of Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS during this summer because it will be situated much too far south to be accessible with telescopes. Those living in far-southerly locations, such as Australia, New Zealand and South America, however, will be able to track it in the morning sky before sunrise. We'll need to rely on reports from these parts of the globe to tell us whether the comet is on track to possibly becoming a bright object. Another thing that could work in our favor is that the geometry of the comet relative to the sun and Earth, places it almost in-between the sun and Earth around Oct. 8, creating a phenomenon known as \"forward scattering of sunlight.\" If the comet is particularly dusty, dust particles ejected from the comet nucleus would preferentially scatter sunlight in a forward direction and could cause a dramatic upsurge in the comet's brightness. To this end, there are two comets that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS might be compared to, which suddenly brightened-up thanks to forward scattering. The first was Comet Skjellerup–Maristany (C/1927 X1), which briefly became very bright in December 1927. Forward scattering of light on Dec. 18, 1927 allowed the comet to be seen during daylight by virtue of blocking the light of the sun with one's hand; it has since been ranked as among The other comet was , also known as the Great Comet of 2007 and given the designation C/2006 P1, and was the brightest comet in over 40 years; easily visible to the naked eye for observers in the Southern Hemisphere in January and February 2007. At its brightest on Jan. 12, 2007, this comet appeared at least twice as bright as Venus and, like Skjellerup–Maristany, was visible worldwide in broad daylight next to the sun. This extreme brightness was also attributable to forward-scattering. Some calculations suggest that Tsuchinshan–ATLAS might become as brilliant as Venus around Oct. 8, 2024 — although in the sky — like the comets of 1927 and 2007 — it will also be very near to the position of the sun. In the days that follow, however, Tsuchinshan–ATLAS should sweep rapidly northward and become well-placed for viewing in the western sky by mid-October. Although it will now be fading as it recedes from both the sun and Earth, it hopefully will be bright enough to be well-seen with the naked-eye, perhaps accompanied by a notable tail as well. But there are no guarantees. In the past, there have been comets that seemingly promised a great show that failed to live up to expectations. of 1973-74 is a good example. Conversely, there have been comets that did not look like they would perform well, that ended up unexpectedly becoming celestial showpieces. surprised everyone during the summer of 2020 by putting on a good show. — — — The legendary comet expert Dr. Fred Whipple perhaps said it best when he said: \"If you must bet, bet on a horse, not a comet!\" In the meantime, fingers crossed for Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS!

        "content": "The first step to realising your dream of studying in Canada is getting a Canada Student Visa, officially known as a study permit. This permit is essential—it’s your ticket to study at any of Canada’s designated learning institutions (DLIs). In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know, from eligibility requirements and application steps to what to do once you arrive. Whether you’re curious about working while studying or aiming for permanent residency, we’ve got you covered. Simply put, a Canada Student Visa allows international students to attend schools, colleges, and universities in Canada. The main purpose? To give you legal permission to stay and study. Without it, you can’t enrol in any designated learning institution (DLI). If you’re wondering about the difference between a student visa and a study permit, it’s not a big deal. So, you need both to make your study plans in Canada a reality. I know you’re curious, but studying in Canada is fantastic. Beyond the stunning environment and friendly people, there are some seriously compelling reasons to pack your bags and make the country your next stop. Canada is home to some of the world’s best universities and colleges. Think University of Toronto, McGill University, and the University of British Columbia, just to name a few. These institutions consistently rank high globally for their academic excellence and research opportunities. When you study in Canada, you get a top-notch education that is recognised worldwide. One of the coolest things about studying in Canada is its vibrant multicultural environment. You’ll meet people from all over the globe, making friends and connections that will last a lifetime. Whether in busy Toronto or calm Halifax, you’ll find a mix of cultures, languages, and cuisines. It’s like travelling the world without leaving campus! Studying in Canada doesn’t just mean being glued to the books. Thanks to the Canada Student Visa, you can work part-time during your studies (up to 20 hours a week) and full-time during breaks. This is a great way to gain valuable work experience, earn extra cash, and get deep into Canadian culture. Aside from this, you can apply for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) after you graduate. This allows you to work in Canada for up to three years. It is a fantastic opportunity to kickstart your career and secure a permanent job. Many international students fall in love with Canada and decide to stay. Thankfully, Canada makes this transition smoother than you might expect. There are several pathways to permanent residency for students: In short, Canada values the contributions of international students and actively encourages them to stay and build their futures in the country. Before you seize this opportunity, let’s make sure you tick all the boxes for eligibility. Here’s a rundown of what you need to qualify for a Canada Student Visa. ALSO READ: Canada removes requirement for language testing in non-express entry applications First, you need an acceptance letter from a designated learning institution (DLI). DLIs are schools approved by a provincial or territorial government to host international students. You can only start the visa application process with this acceptance letter. So, apply to your chosen schools, get accepted, and keep that letter handy. Next, you must prove you can afford to live and study in Canada. This means showing you have enough money to cover: Typically, you need to demonstrate you have at least CAD 20,635 for each year of your stay (in addition to tuition). This amount might be higher if you’re studying in a more expensive city or bringing family members. Canada takes safety seriously, so you must provide a police clearance certificate to show you don’t have a criminal record. This step ensures you won’t pose a risk to Canadian society. If you’ve had any issues with the law, be upfront about it and provide the necessary documentation. You might need to undergo a medical exam depending on where you’re coming from and how long you plan to stay. This assures the authority that you’re in good health and won’t pose a health risk to Canadians. The exam needs to be done by a panel of physicians approved by the Canadian government. The medical exam cost will vary depending on the clinic you visit. It typically ranges from CAD 150 to CAD 300. You can find a list of Panel Physicians authorised to conduct Immigration Medical Examinations on the website of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Lastly, you must convince the visa officer that you’ll return home after your studies. This means showing strong ties to your home country, like a job offer, family, or property. The aim is to prove that you won’t overstay your visa and that you’re genuinely planning to return after graduation. If you’ve decided to study in Canada, we’ve got you covered. We’ll explain the application process step-by-step to help you move from dreaming to doing. The application process for a Canada Student Visa might seem difficult, but breaking it down into manageable steps can make it a whole lot easier. Here’s what you need to do: Here’s a checklist of the documents you’ll need: Biometrics—your fingerprints and a photo—are an essential part of the application process for most applicants. Here’s how it works: Getting a Canada Student Visa requires careful attention to detail, but with the right preparation, you’ll be well on your way to starting an exciting new chapter in Canada. We know this is everyone’s favourite topic. Maybe yours, too. Because, let’s face it, nobody likes waiting around or breaking the bank. Here’s what you need to know to plan your Canada Student Visa journey. How long does it take to get your visa sorted? Well, it varies. The processing time for a Canada Student Visa can range from a few weeks to a few months, depending on where you’re applying and the time of year. Generally, applying well in advance is a good idea to avoid any last-minute stress. The application fees for a Canada Student Visa can change, so it’s essential to check the latest updates on the IRCC website. As of now, here’s a rough estimate: Remember that these fees are subject to change, so always double-check before submitting your application. Okay, so we’ve covered the basics, but what about these little additional costs that can catch you off guard? Here is one to keep in mind: It’s essential to budget for both the application fees and these potential extra expenses to ensure you’re financially prepared for your Canada Student Visa journey. Staying updated on the latest changes to the Canada Student Visa program is crucial for prospective students. Here are the key updates for 2024: Starting January 22nd, 2024, most students will need a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL) from the province or territory where they plan to study. This new requirement means that your study permit application will likely be returned without a PAL. For more details, check the official IRCC page on PAL . The Canadian government has introduced a two-year cap on the number of study permits issued in response to the high volume of student visa applications. For 2024, approximately 35% fewer permits will be issued compared to 2023. This temporary cap might impact application processing times, so it’s important to apply as early as possible. The minimum proof of funds requirement has been increased. To study in most provinces, you must now show access to at least $20,635 per year, excluding tuition fees. This is a significant increase from the previous requirement of $10,000. Ensure you have the necessary financial documentation to meet this new threshold. These updates aim to manage the influx of student visa applications and ensure that international students are well-prepared to study in Canada. Stay informed and plan accordingly to navigate these changes smoothly. By now, you must have been in Canada. Yes, this is the time to put yourself together and get settled in for a new chapter. Here’s a helpful guide on what to do once you touch down in Canada. First, you’ll need to go through immigration clearance when arriving at the entry port. Have your Port of Entry (POE) Letter of Introduction, acceptance letter, proof of funds, and other necessary documents ready. The immigration officer will ask a few questions, stamp your passport, and welcome you to the country. Now that you’re officially in Canada, setting up a local bank account is essential. Having a Canadian bank account makes it easier to manage your finances, pay bills, and receive wages if you plan on working part-time. Research different banks and their student account options to find one that suits your needs. Finding a place to call home is next on the agenda. Whether you’re looking for a dorm room, an apartment, or a homestay, plenty of options are available to international students. Websites like PadMapper and Kijiji can help you search for rental listings in your desired city. When deciding, consider factors like location, budget, and amenities. Your Social Insurance Number (SIN) is your ticket to accessing government services and working in Canada. You’ll need it to get paid, file taxes, and access certain benefits. To apply for a SIN, visit a Service Canada centre with your passport, study permit, and proof of address. It’s a straightforward process that shouldn’t take too long. Lastly, you must arrange health insurance and familiarise yourself with the Canadian healthcare system. Most provinces and territories have their health insurance plans for residents, known as provincial health insurance. As a student, you may be eligible for coverage under your school’s health plan or through a private insurance provider. Be sure to enrol in a plan as soon as possible to ensure you’re covered for any medical emergencies. Let’s talk about putting some extra cash in your pocket while looking at the books in Canada. Working while studying can be a great way to gain experience, meet new people, and offset some expenses. Here’s what you need to know about working as an international student. As an international student with a valid Canada Student Visa, you can work part-time during your studies. Here’s the lowdown: These are fantastic opportunities to gain hands-on work experience in your field of study while earning academic credit. Many Canadian universities and colleges offer co-op and internship programs integrated into your academic curriculum. These programs typically require a co-op work permit, which you can apply for through your institution. I’m here imagining your graduation day. You’ve tossed your cap and celebrated with friends and family. Now, you’re wondering what’s next. Enter the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). This permit allows you to stay and work in Canada for up to three years after completing your studies. To be eligible for a PGWP, you must have completed a program of study at a designated learning institution (DLI) that lasted at least eight months. The length of your PGWP will depend on the duration of your program, with a maximum validity of three years. During your PGWP validity period, you can work for any employer in Canada, gain valuable work experience, and potentially transition to permanent residency through programs like the Canadian Experience Class (CEC) or Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs). You’ve read enough to guide you on settling into your Canadian student life like a pro, but what if you need more time to finish your studies? Don’t worry; extending your study permit is doable. Before we get into the application process details, let’s talk about the conditions for extending your study permit. To be eligible for an extension, you must: You should be good to go as long as you meet these criteria! Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you explore the process: While you’re waiting for your study permit extension to be processed, it’s crucial to maintain your legal status in Canada. This means continuing to attend classes, refraining from working off-campus without authorisation and complying with any other conditions outlined on your study permit. Suppose your study permit expires before you receive a decision on your extension application. In that case, you may be eligible for implied status, which allows you to remain in Canada under the same conditions as your previous permit until a decision is made on your extension application. This part ensures you have all the resources and support needed to explore the Canada Student Visa process easily. Here’s an important list of official government websites, educational consultants, and support groups to help you. It’s normal if you still have some burning questions you want to ask about the Canada Student Visa. And this is why we decided to provide detailed answers to the top five common questions to help clear up any confusion. Facing a visa refusal can be disheartening, but all hope is not lost. If your Canada Student Visa application is refused, you’ll receive a letter explaining why. You may have the option to appeal the decision or reapply with additional supporting documentation addressing the concerns raised by the immigration officer. If you encounter common issues, such as visa delays or technical difficulties with the application process, don’t panic! Contact the nearest Visa Application Center (VAC) or the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) helpline for assistance. They’re there to help you figure out any bumps in the road and ensure a smooth application process. The processing time for a Canada Student Visa can vary depending on your country of origin, the volume of applications, and the time of year. Generally, the process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. Applying well in advance is always a good idea to avoid any last-minute stress. Yes, under certain circumstances, a Canada Student Visa (study permit) can allow you to bring your family with you to Canada. Absolutely! As an international student with a valid Canada Student Visa, you can work part-time during your studies.

In a statement, the crypto exchange labelled the decision unjustified and requested that the charges against Gambaryan be dropped. Justice Emeka Nwite, delivering the ruling in Abuja on Friday, held that the bail application was refused as he had carefully reviewed the application and determined that Gambaryan would likely jump bail if granted. The court ruled that Binance could be served with the Federal Inland Revenue Service tax evasion charge through Gambaryan. Gambaryan’s lawyers objected, stating they needed to review the amended charge to advise him on taking his plea. The court agreed to adjourn the matter to May 22. Binance asserted that Gambaryan, who had no decision-making power in the company, was innocent and had dedicated his life to public service and fighting crime. “We are deeply disappointed that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, continues to be detained. Tigran has been dedicated to public service and fighting crime for most of his life. “These charges against him are completely meritless. He should be freed while discussions continue between Binance and Nigerian government officials,” the exchange stated. Gambaryan, who has been detained since February, faces charges of money laundering and terrorism financing alongside his company and fellow executive Nadeem Anjarwalla, who is currently on the run. The charges were brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. In another separate statement, Gambaryan’s wife, Yuki Gambaryan, lamented, “I truly cannot believe that my innocent husband is now, on his 40th birthday, having to face a trial for charges that he has nothing to do with. “The whole world is watching what he is being put through, and I just pray that commonsense and justice will prevail and that Tigran will be allowed to come home to us.” A few weeks ago, the Chief Executive Officer of Binance, Richard Teng, described the detention of Gambaryan by the Nigerian government as ‘unjust’ and that it was a “dangerous precedent” for international businesses. Teng also said that despite Binance’s repeated efforts at constructive engagement and cooperation with Nigerian authorities, Gambaryan remained in detention for ‘spurious’ reasons. The Binance CEO declared that inviting a company’s mid-level employees for collaborative policy meetings, only to detain them, had set a dangerous new precedent for all companies worldwide. “The message from the Nigerian government is clear: we must detain an innocent, mid-level employee, a former U.S. federal agent, and place him in a dangerous prison to control Binance. “This regrettable turn of events contradicts the spirit of cooperation and transparency that Binance has consistently demonstrated in its interactions with the regulatory authorities,” Teng added.",

        "content": "Investors seeking to build sustainable wealth over the long term regard buy-and-hold stocks as one of the most reliable investment strategies. By focusing on fundamentally strong companies and holding their stocks for extended periods, investors can typically enjoy substantial returns. Meanwhile, they can better mitigate the risks associated with short-term market volatility. The principle behind buy-and-hold investing is simple. First, identify quality stocks with strong growth prospects, solid financials and competitive advantages. Then, hold onto these investments through market ups and downs. Historically, this approach has been proven to generate impressive returns. Research suggests that the S&P 500 index has delivered an average annual return of approximately 10% over the past 90 years. Such an impressive performance underscores the power of long-term investing. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, is a staunch advocate of the buy-and-hold strategy. His investment philosophy centers on purchasing stocks of companies with strong fundamentals and holding them indefinitely. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A , NYSE: BRK-B ) has consistently outperformed the market, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach. With that information, let’s delve into three stocks that are well-positioned to deliver long-term growth and stability. Celsius Holdings (CELH) Beverage company Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ: CELH ) has emerged as a standout player in the energy drink market. It captures the attention of health-conscious consumers with its unique beverages. Management’s innovative product line has resonated well with a growing demographic focused on fitness and wellness. In early May, the energy drink company reported robust first quarter fiscal 2024 results, highlighting its ability to scale its operations and grow market share. Revenue increased 37% year-over-year ( YOY ) to $356 million. Gross margin surged to a record high of 51%, benefiting from economies of scale in sourcing. First quarter diluted earnings per share ( EPS ) of 27 cents jumped 108% YOY. In fact, CELH’s strong sales momentum is primarily attributed to its success in expanding its global distribution channels. It has a long-term distribution agreement with PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP ) for the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the beverage company has recently announced expansions into the U.K., Ireland, France, Australia and New Zealand. Currently, international markets account for just 5% of revenues. This suggests robust growth opportunities outside the U.S. Consensus analyst estimates call for 40% earnings growth through the next two years. Year-to-date ( YTD ), CELH stock has surged by close to 75%. As a result, the stock currently trades at an expensive forward price-to-earnings ( P/E ) ratio of 94x. And, its trailing sales ratio of 15.8x indicates high growth expectations. Investors may want to wait for a pullback toward the $90 level. Diebold Nixdorf ( DBD) Financial and retail technology company Diebold Nixdorf (NYSE: DBD ) is a company known for its ATM managed services. DBD offers a variety of security solutions and self-service technologies. This makes it a potential pick for investors looking for buy-and-hold technology stocks in the financial transformation space. First quarter metrics showed mixed results for Diebold Nixdorf. Revenue grew 5.1% YOY to $897.1 million, falling short of analyst expectations. Nonetheless, the company delivered positive net income of $45.2 million, suggesting a strategic focus on profitability. Recently, Diebold Nixdorf has unveiled Vynamic® Connection Points 7 (VCP 7), its latest self-service software, at the Intersect Conference. Investors are hopeful that VCP 7 could streamline digital transformation for financial institutions, potentially increasing efficiency and customer satisfaction. Since January, DBD stock has advanced 54%, trading favorably at 10.5x earnings and almost 1x sales. At present, the 12-month median price forecast for DBD stock stands at $44.60. Micron Technology (MU) Semiconductor manufacturer Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU ) specializes in high-performance memory and storage solutions that are essential for artificial intelligence ( AI ) applications. In its Q2 of fiscal year 2024 report, Micron revealed strong momentum across all of its four segments, driven by strong AI server demand. Revenue jumped 58% YOY to $5.82 billion. Adjusted EPS improved to 42 cents, compared to a loss of $1.91 per share in the previous year. The ramp-up of investments in data centers, cloud and AI is boosting demand for Micron’s offerings. With high-bandwidth memory ( HBM ) widely regarded as a bottleneck technology for AI, Micron’s flagship HMB3E chip for AI servers is already sold out for 2025. The chipmaker is ramping up its HBM offering with 30% less power than the competition. Amid growing concerns about AI’s power consumption, HBM3E is expected to boost Micron’s market share and lead to sustained pricing strength due to tight supply. Also, the company’s diverse segments and products are demonstrating robust growth momentum, which helps minimize revenue concentration risks for Micron. In Q3, management anticipates YOY revenue growth to accelerate to 76%. Record revenue expectations for fiscal 2025 indicate management’s confidence in its current growth momentum over the next several quarters. Since January, MU stock has increased by 49%. Shares are changing hands at 7.7 times trailing sales. Wall Street remains optimistic for Micron stock with a potential upside of 10% from current levels.

She is currently a freelance Writer at Driving.ca since 2016 Summary · Professional writer for more than 35 years, appearing in some of the top publications in Canada and the U.S. · Specialties include new-vehicle reviews, old cars and automotive history, automotive news, and “How It Works” columns that explain vehicle features and technology · Member of the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada (AJAC) since 2003; voting member for AJAC Canadian Car of the Year Awards; juror on the Women’s World Car of the Year Awards Education Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features. Experience Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written. An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day. In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest. Her non-automotive work, covering such topics as travel, food and drink, rural living, fountain pen collecting, and celebrity interviews, has appeared in publications including Harrowsmith, Where New Orleans, Pen World, The Book for Men, Rural Delivery, and Gambit. Major awards won by the author 2016 AJAC Journalist of the Year; Car Care Canada / CAA Safety Journalism award winner in 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2013, runner-up in 2021; Pirelli Photography Award 2015; Environmental Journalism Award 2019; Technical Writing Award 2020; Vehicle Testing Review award 2020, runner-up in 2022; Feature Story award winner 2020; inducted into the Street Rodding Hall of Fame in 1994.

        "description": "Upgrade your home security hardware with these Memorial Day deals.",
        "content": "Home security devices can give you peace of mind while you're away from home, but they can be a large investment at full price. With tons of Memorial Day sales going on today, now is the perfect time to finally take the plunge and upgrade your home security. We found the best deals on smart locks, cameras, doorbells and more so you can feel reassured knowing you have some control of the safety of your home. We keep our list current with the latest sales for Memorial Day, where you can save 30% to 50% off excellent home security technology from our top-recommended brands. Before you buy, make sure the discounted product is compatible with your current smart home setup (such as a preference for Google Home or Apple's HomeKit) and your overall privacy goals . You'll also want a strong home router for connecting any outdoor cams. For more, check out our tested lists of the best home security systems for renters , best value video doorbells and best smart locks in 2024. Best Memorial Day home security cam deals This Arlo Pro cam is currently one of our favorite picks for wireless and outdoor security cameras, a complete package with high resolution, a spotlight, great smart home compatibility, and plenty of other bells and whistles. But it's very expensive... until this deal, which drops the price by nearly 30%. If you're interested in only one cam and want it to be one of the best available, think about taking advantage of this discount. The Blink Outdoor 4 is one of our favorite all-purpose outdoor cameras . It offers an easy app for controls, AA lithium batteries rated for two years of work and a hub for local storage is included. Blink subscription fees for advanced object detection and storage are lower than most at around $3 per month, too. Keep in mind that, like Ring, this is an Alexa-only cam. The affordable Blink Mini 2 is even more affordable with this deal, and the little cam comes packed with features like a mini spotlight, two-way audio, night vision and motion detection. It's an ideal cam for a more limited space, and with an outdoor cable you can mount it outside as well. Ring's Stick Up Cam Battery version is one of our favorite picks for a versatile shelf cam that you can pick up to watch the kids or pets wherever they are, inside or out (it also has a mounting option). Ring offers highly customizable motion detection along with two-way audio and night vision. As an Amazon brand, it's an excellent fit for Alexa, too. While it's a little more expensive than budget cams, this EufyCam is 40% off with an unprecedented opportunity to get rare features like Apple Home compatibility and object recognition with no additional fee. It also offers a 2K resolution and IP67 weatherproof rating, as well as night vision. You don't usually see a high-end outdoor cam at this price, but keep in mind, if you want video storage, you'll need to buy a Eufy hub and microSD card. Or you could choose this two-cam Eufy package that comes with a hub and is $110 off thanks to a similar deal. Lorex is currently our go-to choice for local storage-only cameras that stay off the cloud ( and can even stay off the internet altogether ). This spotlight camera can do a little bit of everything, including object detection, and thanks to Lorex's sitewide Memorial Day sale, it's one of the many cameras available with a discount. Ring's HD video doorbell may not be quite as advanced as its latest Pro model , but this battery doorbell still does a great job of surveying the porch -- without quite as many settings to muddle through. At this hefty discount it's one of the most affordable, quality doorbells currently available for those who prefer to save. Important extras like two-way audio and night vision are included, but video storage will cost extra. Blink's doorbell was already one of the most affordable models. With this deal it's one of the best cheap video doorbells you'll find -- at least for now. Even at this discount, it still has key features like two-way audio, custom alerts, wireless installation and more. You can add a Sync Module 2 for local storage if you prefer to stay off subscriptions. Read our Blink Video Doorbell preview . Pet cameras can watch out for intruders, but their primary focus is the Fidos and Felixes in our homes. They can be expensive purchases, but this sale cuts the price by nearly a third. This HD camera has Alexa built in and can provide motion and audio alerts, along with night vision. It even has one of those little treat dispensers to interact with your pet -- just don't overfeed them when you're away. Did you know ? We have an Amazon Storefront with some of the best Memorial Day deals available. Best Memorial Day home security bundle deals TP-Link's affordable Tapo system includes two 2K-resolution cams and a connection hub, ideal for a front-and-back camera setup at your home. The cameras are weatherproofed, come with 49-foot night vision, and allow you to set activity zones for identifying people, pets and vehicles. They're all-purpose outdoor security cams that can fill many roles, although you may want to grab a microSD card if you don't plan on using the Tapo subscription service. Ring is one of our top picks for easy DIY installation if you want a speedy system equipped with door and window sensors. The five-piece model is a perfect starting point, and this bundle throws in the Ring video doorbell for front door protection as well. A Ring subscription (starting at $5) is a very good idea, but it's still an excellent choice for a discounted starter kit. If you're a fan of Ecobee (its products work reliable with Apple HomeKit, Alexa and more) you can deck your home out in Ecobee security and a smart thermostat with this deal. Save on a start sensor pack, an Ecobee video doorbell and the Thermostat Premium. That's a good combo if you've experimented with Ecobee products before and are ready to jump into a whole smart home setup. Note that the doorbell is wired in this pack. Finding a large home security system can feel frustrating if you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars and risk getting locked into a contract. Using this hefty discount, this SimpliSafe system is available for less than $300 -- and while a monitoring subscription is available, you can choose to self-monitor and waive the monthly fees. Included in this kit is a base station, keypad, pack of entry sensors, motion sensor, key fob, siren and smoke detector. That makes it an effective DIY way to outfit a new home or apartment that's never had security tech before. Eufy is doing a sitewide sale to celebrate both its anniversary and Memorial Day, with major deals off its camera bundles, all the way up to several hundred dollars off a camera three- or four-pack. We Eufy cameras fori ts free object recognition and on-board storage so you can skip the subscription if you want. Eufy cams tend to be compact with high resolutions, too -- but you'll need to act fast before these sell out. This solar powered set incudes four eufyCam 3 and a 1 TB harddrive. Note that the $370 discount is available with code WS24T88731TBSP , which will be automatically applied when you add it to your cart. Best Memorial Day smart lock deals Aqara's U100 smart lock is one of the best locks we've reviewed , and you can find it on sale with this discount that drops it below $200. Considering the lock offers every type of control from fingerprints and codes to digital passes (and a hefty deadbolt replacement), that's a good deal. It's even better if you're an Apple user, since Aqara works natively with Apple HomeKit. Add a hub and you can get Matter support along with Google Assistant and Alexa. August's durable smart construction often comes with a price to match, but this deal lets you get a fourth-generation August smart lock on more affordable terms. The Wi-Fi smart lock fits onto your existing deadbolt, providing it with app management including the ability to share digital keys. You can also set schedules or make sure the door automatically locks after a certain period of time. The lock also has excellent compatibility, working with platforms including Alexa, HomeKit, Google Home and Samsung SmartThings. Best Memorial Day deals on smart home tech An Echo Show pairs well with any compatible security camera or video doorbell (Blink, Ring, Arlo, Google Nest, etc.), showing you a live view via a quick Alexa voice command, and letting you talk through devices without using the app. This is the most affordable we've seen the excellent Echo Show 8 with a 33% discount. You can also use that screen for video chats, YouTube videos, Amazon Prime shows, looking up recipes, catching the news and much more. With Google's Nest Hub, second-generation, you can pair it with Nest cameras and doorbells and view them from your hub. If you buy the Nest Aware subscription (starts at $8/month) it will also alert you on your phone when you aren't home if it hears breaking glass, a smoke alarm or other unusual sounds that may mean a safety risk is occurring at your home. In addition to the safety features, it also works as a smart assistant for your home, allowing you to voice activate music, lights and other smart devices as well as display videos and more. Check out our full review of the Google Nest Hub, 2nd Gen to see more of its capabilities. Read our Google Nest Hub (2nd gen) review . If you're looking for simpler security tech, these little doorstops sound an alarm when they're activated. That's it -- they just help you know when a door has been opened. Sometimes that's all you need, and at under $15 this pair is currently a very good deal. Best Memorial Day sale security platform pick Cove's offers DIY security systems with an onsite kit builder to quickly customize your home security sensors, leak detectors, cameras and other important add-ons. Cove is a good pick for those who want a hybrid of traditional home security (subscriptions and professional monitoring are generally required with Cove) with the ease of DIY setup and no contracts.

While prices fluctuate year round, the best prices on home security devices including cameras and smart locks, is often during Amazon's Prime Day , held each year in early July, when Amazon slashes prices and its competitors step up to match those. Black Friday and holiday sales also bring some great prices, but Memorial Day sales remain competitive, which means if you're shopping for a home security device, now is the best time to snag a deal before midsummer.

        "description": "A woman could be Mexico’s next leader. Millions of others continue in shadows as domestic workers.",
        "content": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — Concepción Alejo is used to being invisible. Alejo, 43, touches her face up with makeup on a Tuesday morning, and steps out of her tiny apartment on the fringes of Mexico City. She walks until the cracked gravel outside her home turns into cobblestones, and the campaign posters coating small concrete buildings are replaced with the spotless walls of gated communities of the city’s upper class. It’s here where Alejo has quietly worked cleaning the homes and raising the children of wealthier Mexicans for 26 years. Alejo is among approximately 2.5 million Mexicans — largely women — who serve as domestic workers in the Latin American nation, a profession that has come to encapsulate gender and class divisions long permeating . Women like her play a fundamental role in Mexican society, picking up the burden of domestic labor as a growing number of women professionals enter the workforce. Despite reforms under the current government, many domestic workers continue to face low pay, abuse by employers and long hours. It is an institution dating back to colonial times, and some researchers equate the unstable working conditions to “modern slavery.\" Now, with Mexico on its way to possibly electing its first female president June 2, domestic workers hope either or former might shift the balance in their favor. “I’ve never voted all these years, because it’s always the same for us whoever wins. ... When have they ever listened to us, why would I give them my vote?\" Alejo said. “At least by having a woman, maybe things will be different.\" Born to a poor family in the central Mexican state of Puebla, Alejo dropped out of school at age 14, moving to Mexico City as a live-in nanny with two sisters. “It’s like you’re a mother. The kids would call me ‘mama’,\" she said. “I would bathe them, care for them, do everything from the moment I awoke to the moment they slept.\" While some domestic workers live separately from families, many more live with families and work weeks, if not months, without breaks and isolated from family and friends. Alejo said the demands and low pay of domestic work led her not to have children herself. Others told The Associated Press they were fired from their positions after they fell ill and asked for help from their employers. “When you work in someone else’s house, your life isn’t your own,\" said Carolina Solana de Dios, a 47-year-old live-in nanny. Their help is essential for working women like 49-year-old single mother Claudia Rodríguez, as they continue to fight to enter professional spaces historically dominated by men. In Mexico and much of Latin America, a gap has long divided men and women in the workplace. In 2005, 80% of men were employed or looking for jobs, compared to 40% of women, Mexican government data shows. That gap has narrowed over time, though large disparities in salary and leadership roles still exist. Born in a town two hours outside Mexico City, Rodríguez fled an abusive father with her mother and siblings, taking refuge in the capital. Instead of pursuing her dream of professionally dancing, she began to work and study not to “make the same sacrifice\" as her mother toiling away in different informal jobs. She spent years clawing her way up in the IT industry, but took over all the housework when she had kids with her husband. When her husband left her for another woman six years ago, hiring a live-in domestic worker was the only thing she could do to stay afloat. Today, she and her nanny, Irma, both wake up at 5 a.m., one making lunch for her two daughters while the other drops them off at school. “In the case of women in business, we couldn’t take it all on alone simply because it’s far too much that society expects of you,\" she said. Yet a historic number of Mexican women are taking up leadership roles, in part due gender quota laws set on political parties. Since 2018, Mexico’s Congress has had a 50-50 gender split, and the number of female governors has shot up. While neither presidential candidate has spoken explicitly about domestic workers, both Sheinbaum and Gálvez proposed addressing violence against women and closing the country’s gender pay gap. In 2019, the government of passed landmark legislation granting domestic workers basic rights like paid leave, limits on working hours and access to health insurance paid by employers. But failures by the government to enforce those rules left domestic workers unprotected and locked in a “dynamic of power inequality,\" said Norma Palacios, head of the country’s domestic workers union, SINACTRAHO. “Nothing has changed ... even if on paper we should have more labor rights,\" Palacios said. Neither Alejo, the domestic worker, nor Rodríguez, the single mother, say they particularly identify with either candidate on the ballot. Both plan to vote. Even if they see the leaders as more of the same, they echoed Palacios in saying that a woman leader would be an important step. “It’s still a woman who is going to be at the head of a country — a sexist country, a country of inequality, a country of violence against women, a country of femicides,\" Palacios said. Meanwhile, workers like Alejo continue down a shaky path. Alejo is among the 98% of domestic workers yet to enroll in health insurance, according to SINACTRAHO data. She finally works with a kind family that pays her a fair wage, but she’s summoning up the courage to ask the family to pay for her health insurance, worrying that she’ll be replaced if she asks for her rights to be respected. “They don’t like that you ask for things,\" she said. “It’s not easy finding work, and if you need to work, you end up accepting whatever they give you.\" ___ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at Livemint tops charts as the fastest growing news website in the world to know more.

        "content": "NATO won’t defend Ukraine from missiles KYIV – NATO does not intend to use its air defences to provide cover for Ukraine, the military bloc’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has insisted. His comment comes days after Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky urged the US and its allies to shoot down Russian missiles. Speaking to the New York Times on Monday, Zelensky stated that he sees no problem with such NATO involvement, arguing that it would not be tantamount to an “attack on Russia”. “NATO will not become part of the conflict,” the military bloc’s chief insisted. RT Yemen’s Houthis release 113 detainees SANAA – Yemen’s Houthi group unilaterally released 113 detainees in the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sanaa on Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. “We are pleased to see that humanitarian considerations are being prioritised ... for the families eagerly awaiting the return of their loved ones. We hope this paves the way for further releases,” said Daphnee Maret, head of ICRC’s delegation in Yemen. The UN has been making efforts to release all detainees, mostly political opponents, human rights activists, and journalists, and reach a political settlement between the Yemeni warring parties. Xinhua Twelve injured on Qatar Airways Dublin flight DUBLIN – Twelve people have been injured, including eight taken to hospital, after a Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Ireland hit turbulence on Sunday, Dublin Airport said in a statement. Flight QR017, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, landed safely and as scheduled, it added. Irish broadcaster RTÉ said the incident lasted less than 20 seconds. Passenger Paul Mocc said he saw “people hitting the roof”, and food and drinks flying everywhere. “The aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Türkiye,” the airport said. “All passengers were assessed for injury prior to disembarking the aircraft. Eight passengers were subsequently taken to hospital.” ABC",

        "content": "An automated driving testing system (ADTS) was started today by the Transport Department in Rourkela of Sundargarh district. This is the first of its kind DTS in Odisha. According to an official source, at least 112 applicants for the Driving License (DL) appeared for the test. CCTV cameras were pressed into service for flawless and accurate driving testing. The automated DTS and video analytics system (VAS) will be of immense help to bring about transparency in the process. The driving testing of applicants was conducted based on existing norms of the Department. A six-step method was followed and successful applicants will be issued DLs soon, the source added. When contacted, Rourkela regional transport officer (RTO) Bibhanjan Samantasinghar said, “ADTS is a fully computerised process of driving testing. Twenty-six cameras have been installed for effective testing. The steps that an applicant has to qualify are overtaking, zebra crossing, ‘S’ track, parallel parking, gradient, and ‘8’ track etc. Visual analysis of driving is being done during the testing.”",

        "content": "The Home Alone house is up for sale — and no, it doesn’t include any of Kevin McCallister’s scalding doorknobs or paint-can booby traps. The famous house, located north of Chicago in Winnetka, Ill., hit the market on Friday for the first time in 12 years, and it could be yours for US$5.25 million (about C$7.16 million). View image in full screen The ‘Home Alone’ house living room. Dawn Mckenna Group With five bedrooms and six bathrooms, the 9,126-sq. ft. home is both a part of American movie history and a valuable piece of real estate. Story continues below advertisement Though the home was built in 1921, it’s been extensively renovated to feature a number of lavish amenities, like a state-of-the-art movie theatre and indoor sports court that features a true 3-point line.

Dawn Mckenna Group View image in full screen The ‘Home Alone’ house features an indoor sports court with a true 3-point line. Dawn Mckenna Group The property was also redesigned to include a spacious kitchen that has dual islands, as well as a screened-in porch with a wood-burning fireplace, among other luxuries. Story continues below advertisement View image in full screen The ‘Home Alone’ house kitchen, which features two islands, bespoke white cabinetry and a hidden pantry. Dawn Mckenna Group According to the property listing, the current owners renovated and expanded the property in 2018, but “took the utmost care in maintaining the architectural detail and integrity of the home’s most memorable and recognizable spaces.” Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. The memorable spaces include the “unforgettable entry staircase,” which actor Macaulay Culkin sleds down in the Home Alone movie, as well as the formal living and dining room spaces that hosted a fake holiday party complete with a Michael Jordan cut-out rigged onto a toy train. View image in full screen The front staircase of the ‘Home Alone’ house. Dawn Mckenna Group Real estate company Dawn McKenna Group is handling the sale of the iconic home. Story continues below advertisement In a social media post advertising the property, realtors called the home “a piece of American history” and “one of the most famous houses in the world.” The walk-through video of the Georgia-style home highlighted the home’s open-concept floor plan, spacious sunroom and renovated attic space made to include a full bath with a soaking tub. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Dawn McKenna Group (@thedawnmckennagroup) In recent years, the home has only been listed on Airbnb for one night in December 2021. Home Alone, released in 1990, remains one of the most well-known Christmas movies ever made, featuring the story of a clever 8-year-old boy who is accidentally left behind when his family takes a vacation to Paris, France. The film has since spawned a number of holiday sequels. Story continues below advertisement Maybe, with the new renovations in place, the property’s pull will be enough to intrigue even Culkin himself to move back in. 3:14 Open House: Century old estate home featured on Vancouver Heritage Foundation house tour Open House: Century old estate home featured on Vancouver Heritage Foundation house tour Open House: Mid-century modern home featured on Vancouver Heritage Foundation House Tour Climate change is affecting the housing market: report Previous Video Next Video More on World Grayson Murray, 2-time PGA Tour winner, dead at age 30 Russia claims NATO members’ support for Ukraine is ‘escalation’ of conflict Mexico heat wave: Records shattered, experts warn of hail, whirlwinds Partial injunction granted against pro-Palestinian encampment at UQAM",

        "content": "....Protesters Notify Party Leaders Of Abure’s Suspension Anti-Julius Abure protesters, who were at Labour Party’s headquarters in Abuja to notifying the party leadership of the confirmation of Abure’s suspension from the party, were on Monday attacked. The attack against the protesters were carried out by an angry mob suspected to be thugs loyal to the National Chairman of the Labour Party (LP), Abure. The protesters, it was gathered were Labour Party supporters from the Edo State chapter, who were at the party secretariat to demand Abure’s removal. Commotion broke out when the anti- Abure protesters stormed the party headquarters in several vehicles holding placards and chanting solidarity songs. As soon as the protesters stepped out of the vehicles, the suspected thugs loyal to Abure swooped on the vehicles with sticks and other objects forcing the drivers to zoom off. A detachment of armed policemen and operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS), however, intervened when the thugs started throwing stones into the nearby Secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, in pursuit of reporters who were convering the fracas. The intervention of the security officials prevented the situation from further degenerating. A police vehicle is currently stationed in between the warring factions. Earlier, leaders of the group of protesters, distributed copies of a letter written to the National Executive Committee (NEC), of the Labour Party by the Edo State Chairman, Com. Ogbaloi K.S.E State Chairman and Secretary, Com. Akhere Frederick, notifying the national body of the confirmation of Abure’s suspension from the party. The letter dated: 24 May, 2024, with reference number: LP/ESO/LP.NEC/2024-351, titled: Ratification of Suspension from the membership of Ward 3, Arue, Uromi, Esan North East LGA, Edo State, reads, “here forwarded to you and for your notification, the ratification of the suspension of Comr Barr. Julius Abure from the membership of Ward 3, Arue, Uromi, Esan North East LGA. Edo State. “The State Executive Council, Labour Party, Edo State, comprising of the State Working Committee, the 18 Local Government Chairmen and the 18 Local Government Secretaries met on the 24′′ of May, 2024, at about 11:00pm, to consider the matters presented on the suspension of Comr. Barr. Julius Abure by his Ward in Arue, Uromi, Esan North East LGA, and the upholding of the suspension by the LGA Excos. “After clinical analysis of the accusation, the Council found them weighty and further ratified and upheld the suspension.”",

Last year, Google introduced a new Play Store policy where developers of any app that allows users to create an account also need to provide the option to delete it (both in-app and online). The company announced that these data deletion practices would appear in Play Store listings early this year. According to a report by Android Authority, this new badge has already started showing the Data Safety section of some app listings for a few testers. Apps that will include this new badge will allow users to submit a request to the developer to delete the account and the data associated with the same. Google has been asking developers to include information about app account deletion in their Play Store listings since December 2023. The company has also announced that developers need to comply with the new policy by May 31 or face penalties like app removal. The company’s data deletion policy mandates that developers offer data and account deletion options both within their apps and online. This will ensure that users don’t have to reinstall an app to delete their data or account. Developers also need to disclose if they need to retain certain data for legitimate reasons, such as regulatory compliance. As the enforcement deadline approaches and data deletion badges start showing for some apps, developers should not expect any further extensions. Meanwhile, for the first time in over eight years, Google has increased the maximum price of an app in the Play Store. Announced at Google I/O 2024, developers can now price their apps up to $999.99. However, it is unlikely that many apps will reach this new price ceiling.",

Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Ash Rose Published: 18:53, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:16, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments A young Manchester United fan got the surprise of his life, when he came face-to-face with his favourite player's family at Saturday's FA Cup Final. The Red Devils put a disappointing season behind them at Wembley by impressively dispatching of Premier League champions and rivals Manchester City and winning the FA Cup. First half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo were enough to see United lift their thirteenth FA Cup and secure European football for next season. Yet, United's victory may not have been the best part of one young fan's FA Cup Final day, after a heartwarming meeting with the match winner's family on the Wembley escalator. In a video shared on social media, it shows the fan wearing the shirt of Mainoo, only to be standing in front of both the Man United midfielder's father and brother. Dad and son are shocked to learn that they are standing with Kobbie Mainoo's family The little fan proceeds to stop eating his crisps to shake the hand of Mainoo's father The Man United midfielder was the club's FA Cup match winner in their 2-1 win over Man City The moment occurred as father and son were travelling down one of Wembley's escalators, and the boy was asked if the player on the back of his shirt was his favourite player. Once the child turns round, the voice behind the camera reveals that Mainoo is his son, much to the total amazement of the father and his son. They are the introduced to the England star's big brother, who can be heard laughing at the response after revealing they are Mainoo's family. The interaction immediately sees the dad ask his lad to 'say hello', at which point he stops eating his crisps, wipes his hands on his jeans and shakes the hand of Mainoo's father. Mainoo rounded off a well-worked Man United mood to put United on their way to victory i It would have been a proud day for Mainoo's father and brother, as they witnessed a sublime performance from the teenage sensation. The midfielder was on hand to finish off a sweeping United move in the first half, putting the finishing touch to Bruno Fernandes' no-look pass to put the Red Devils 2-0 up. The goal proved to be the difference after Jeremy Doku's last consolation, and Mainoo was rewarded by being named man of the match.

        "content": "Shocking moment Leeds United fans brawl with Southampton supporters after their team's 1-0 loss at Wembley in the Championship play-off final By Arthur Parashar Published: 13:53 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:28 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments This is the shocking moment Leeds United and Southampton fans clashed in ugly scenes at Wembley Stadium after the Championship play-off final on Sunday. Just moments after Southampton secured their return to the Premier League with a 1-0 victory, a mass brawl broke out between the two sets of fans as they spilled out on to Wembley Way. The riled up supporters were filmed fighting as they exited the iconic stadium and walked towards Wembley Park Tube Station at about 7pm. It was clear tensions were running high in the aftermath of what is regarded as football's most lucrative fixture. Adam Armstrong's strike secured a tense victory for Southampton and crucially earned them an unparalleled £180million payday. In the video, a pair of fans are seen coming to blows as others watch on in shock. One of the men tries to throw a punch but does not make a connection as the rival fan ducks out of the way. The video starts with one fan trying to land a massive punch on a rival but the supporter is able to evade contact In ugly scenes, a football fan was kicked to the floor and left cowering as supporters closed in on him The fan in white was seen trying to calm things down but another tussle broke out beside him The pair then run towards another tussle which has broken out beside them. This time, another fan is dragged to the ground and struck while trapped on the floor. Another group of lads then come over to intervene by dragging the attacker away and punching him in the stomach. Other witnesses - including women - attempted to stop the brawls between the fans seen wearing club colours. One said: 'Stop, stop, stop. Don't do it.' But moments later, another fan strolls up to a rival supporter and punches him in the back of the head. He then sets his sights on another fan and kicks them to the ground. As he is falling to the ground, a second attacker kicks him again, leaving him sprawled out on the floor covering his head for protection. The man filming the 39-second video said: 'This is Wembley for you man? 'F***ing hell mate.' Southampton's Adam Armstrong (right) celebrates after scoring the all-important goal at Wembley Southampton fans, some with their tops off, go wild at Wembley after the Saints were promoted to the Premier League Southampton's captain Jack Stephens holds the trophy aloft after the play-off final on Sunday One onlooker shouts: 'Grow up.' The mood between the two sets of fans could not have been more different after the game. Southampton fans were celebrating after returning to the Premier League following their relegation from the top flight last season. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, a Southampton fan, congratulated the Saints after they secured promotion. Following the victory, Mr Sunak wrote on X: 'We're back' before adding three 'clapping hands' emojis. Leeds United will now remain in the Championship next season after narrowly missing out on a lucrative promotion. The ugly brawl came just 24 hours after Manchester United and Manchester City fans clashed in the streets of London ahead of the FA Cup final on Saturday. Rival Manchester United and Manchester City fans brawled in the street in Harrow, London ahead of Saturday afternoon's FA Cup final at Wembley One shirtless supporter was left sprawled out in the road after fighting with a rival fan Dozens of fans piled in, with kicks and punches thrown and bottles smashed on the road The scrap spilled over the road at a bus stop in Harrow ahead of the Wembley showpiece Video footage posted on X showed a group clashing near a bus stop in Station Road, Harrow in the lead-up to the Wembley match, which United went on to triumph in 2-1. One shirtless fan was seen grappling on the floor at a bus stop with traffic at a standstill before more men pile in. Kicks and punches were thrown - and bottles thrown - during the shocking scenes in the hours ahead of the eagerly-anticipated final. Chants of 'United, United' can be heard in the background during the scrap which continued right across the road as horrified shoppers watched on. The Met Police has been approached for comment.

The seven-time Super Bowl winner played the role of doting dad Monday as he took his two youngest children, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11, for a spin out on the water. The former quarterback, 46, shared a video on Instagram of the trio's activities as they made a splash, while Post Malone and Morgan Wallen 's summer hit, 'I had some help,' plays in the background.

'You guys okay if we get summer started? Hope everyone is having a great MDW!,' Brady captioned the post. The New England Patriots legend also shares an older son, Jack, 16, with ex-girlfriend, actress Bridget Moynahan, 53, but the budding high school football player didn't appear to be in the clip. The Memorial Day bonding session comes two weeks after Brady admitted that he had some regrets over participating in his Netflix roast. Brady was roasted by a number of high-profile figures - including stand-up comedians, celebrities and ex-teammates - in a live Netflix show earlier this month. A lot of the ruthless material contained jokes about his divorce from Bundchen after 13 years of marriage, which he has admitted didn't go down too well back at home. He revealed that some of the quips 'affected' his kids during an episode of 'The Pivot' with Fred Taylor, Ryan Clark and Channing Crowder. 'I loved when the jokes were about me. I thought they were so fun,' he said. 'I didn't like the way they affected my kids.

'It makes you in some ways a better parent going through it because sometimes you're naïve.' The former quarterback's children weren't the only ones upset with the roast with Bundchen said to be furious about being the source of the relentless taunting. According to People , B undchen was left fuming at the jokes about her and Brady's former marriage during the special, saying she 'was deeply disappointed by the disrespectful portrayal of her family on Sunday evening's roast show'. 'As always, [Bundchen's] priority is to support her children who were affected by the irresponsible content that was broadcasted,' the insider went on.

        "content": "It’s been several years since the finale of The Big Bang Theory, but fans still can’t get over how the series decided to end Penny’s storyline compared to the series. Throughout the sitcom, , free-spirited, and knew what she wanted. It was no surprise that she fell in love with Leonard and their relationship continued up until the final season. But the finale flipped the script with Penny’s overall stance on not having kids. In “The Procreation Calculation,” Penny tells Leonard she has no desire to have kids, which upsets . She also doesn’t have a problem with him being a sperm donor for Zack. But as the finale approaches, her mindset changes, and she ends up pregnant. Yet, after all of these years, fans still don’t take to this storyline very well. On Reddit, a fan on how the sitcom built up Penny’s strong stance on not having kids, only to chuck it away in the finale. “Anyone else find it odd that they spent a good amount of time establishing Penny simply didn’t want to have children, and then in the finale, she becomes pregnant and all we get for her motivation is Leonard saying ‘yeh well now she does’ – kind of a missed opportunity there to even explore penny’s decision making,” they explained. “Seems weird they did devote a lot of time to Penny not wanting children to then just have Leonard speak for her. Literally, she says nothing about why she decided on having a child.” Another fan was angered by the fact that Penny’s pregnancy storyline wasn’t the first instance in The Big Bang Theory. Bernadette also didn’t want kids but then changed her mind. The same thing happened to Penny. It wasn’t only fans who felt the use of the storyline wasn’t well done. Kaley Cuoco, the actress who played the character, once expressed that . A fan on Reddit explained that the sitcom creators did recognize the rushed storyline. Related: “The writers acknowledge this in the tell-all book. Ultimately what happened was they were trying to fulfill Leonard’s line from episode 1 about them having beautiful and smart babies. But they acknowledged they rushed it and her being pregnant was an ‘unearned’ moment in the show,” they chimed in. In the finale, Sheldon is giving his Nobel Peace Prize speech. He recounts how Leonard said he and Penny would have beautiful and smart children the first day they met. Sheldon’s change of heart causes Penny to shed a tear.

        "content": "AMBALA: Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) Ambala seat candidate Advocate Gurpreet Singh violated the secrecy of the election process by posting a video while voting at EVM compartment on his Facebook. Haryana voted on May 25 in the sixth phase of 18th Lok Sabha elections . The video was posted on Election Day on May 25 at 15:31 pm. The video was posted from a Facebook account named Advocate Sardar Gurpreet Singh Sahota, with display photo of INLD Ambala candidate. In his video post, Gurpreet Singh wrote, “ .” (Ambala is going to make history! With their son Gupreet) It is seen in the video of 17 seconds that a person approaches EVM machine keeping the mobile camera on video recording mode and records the video while vote is being polled to INLD candidate Gupreet Singh at second number on the list on machine. The person who recorded the video shows pressing the EVM button to cast vote in front of Gurpreet Singh’s photo, INLD election symbol spectacles and the display of the same on the VVPAT machine. As per the time of the posting the video, Gurpreet Singh committed the violation of the fair and transparent elections, while the election process was ongoing (7 am to 6 pm). However, during the round of several polling booths in Ambala, it was observed that the district police administration had made tight security arrangements and the voters were asked to deposit their phones at the entrance. However, in the case of an INLD candidate, it seems, a voter managed to enter the polling booth with a mobile and recorded the video of the election process. The bar code number visible on the VVPAT machine recorded in the video is “BVTEQ30053”, which can probably help the administration to identify the polling booth. The video was shared with Ambala returning officer-cum-deputy commissioner (DC) Shaleen, however, the response is yet awaited. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in similar cases of violation of election secrecy, Ambala police had booked Vikram Singh and Vivek Chaudhary of Lalana village, spokesperson of Jannayak Janata Party, under Section 136 of the Representation of the People Act and Section 171-F (punishment for undue influence or impersonation at an election), and Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code at Ambala Sadar police station.",

        "content": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Nine Egyptian men cleared by a Greek court of involvement in a migrant shipwreck disaster remain unfairly held in administrative detention days after they were freed from jail, their lawyers said Monday. A judge in the southern town of Nafplio on Tuesday is expected to hear a legal appeal for their release, the lawyers told a press conference in Athens. “The decision for their detention is not legal, and has no justification,” said Effie Dousi, one of the lawyers. The nine men were among the 104 survivors of an overcrowded fishing trawler that sank in international waters off southwestern Greece on June 14, 2023, en route from Libya to Italy. A total 82 bodies were recovered, but hundreds more people are feared lost in migrant shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea. Greek authorities of being among the trawler’s crew — something the defense denied — and brought criminal charges against them including for people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck. But last week a judge in the southern city of Kalamata after a prosecutor argued that Greece lacked jurisdiction as the trawler sank outside its waters. Greece’s coast guard was widely criticized for failing to prevent the sinking, despite having a vessel close by, and some survivors claimed the trawler foundered after the coast guard tried to tow it. The coast guard strongly denied that. A separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the coast guard’s actions is still underway. Dousi said the nine, who have applied for asylum in Greece, had already spent 11 months in pre-trial detention and should now be at liberty. “These are survivors of a shipwreck,” she said, adding that if the Nafplio court rules against their release, the nine will take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Lawyers said the Egyptians are being held in police cells in Nafplio and Athens, and in a migrant detention center in Corinth, southern Greece. They said police ordered their administrative detention because they have no given address in Greece, lack identity papers and allegedly pose a flight risk. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at",

        "content": "Russia's most modern tank suffers 'disco head' glitch that sees its turret spinning out of control while under fire By Taryn Pedler Published: 18:52, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 19:08, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Russia 's most modern tank has been seen suffering a 'disco head' glitch that sends its turrets spinning out of control while on the battlefield under fire. The bizarre fault has struck the T-90 tank - a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world.' But the impressive machine has been hit with an embarrassing bug, 'spinning turret syndrome', where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat. The worst example of the flaw came during a battle in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region when Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s. The Bradley's hit the Russian tank with rapid 25mm cannon fire which was expected to cause little damage to the T-90s due to their heavy frontal armour. The Russian T-90 tank was seen spinning out of control due to a bug dubbed 'spinning turret syndrome' Ukrainian troops in two US-supplied M2 Bradley fighting vehicles came face-to-face with one of the Russian T-90s (pictured) before it malfunctioned Another piece of footage captured the moment another T-90 began spinning out of control The machine crashed into a tree which stopped the rotating However, after a few hots the tank's turret started rapidly spinning in a clockwise direction meaning the Russian's had no chance of accurately returning fire. In footage of the humiliating incident, the turret was seen rotating in a frenzy without any end in sight until the gun barrel ultimately slammed into a tree which stopped the spinning. Unable to return any fire to the Ukrainian's, the tank's crew fled on foot before the tank was demolished by a Ukrainian first-person view attack drone. The 'spinning turret syndrome' was also seen on another occasion on May 10 after a T-90 came under attack by a series of FPV kamikazes. When the second one hits, the turret begins spinning clockwise before pausing briefly as the crew attempt to get it under control. But to no avail, the rotating starts again and continues until the tank halts and the engine appears to be switched off. In recent weeks, several abandoned T-90Ms have been destroyed by grenades dropped from Ukrainian drones. One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls. This theory says the position of the levers to control the turret mean that someone pitching on to them always causes clockwise rotation. A second theory shared online is that the issue is related to the first control system. The impressive T-90 has been hit with an embarrassing bug where any minor damage causes the turret to begin rotating uncontrollably, making it incapable of any further combat One theory behind the mysterious flaw is that minor hits are penetrating the turret and killing or injuring an operator who then ends up slumping forward over the controls The T-90 tank is a third-generation Russian main battle vehicle that has been dubbed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as the 'best tank in the world' Similar to other modern tanks, the T-90's gun has automated aiming which rotates the turret to keep the gun locked on to a target. The theory suggests that the damage to the optics sends a false signal to the fire control system, causing the turret to spin uncontrollably. A third explanation revolves around the tank's defensive suite as the tank has a laser warning receiver which sounds an alarm when the tank is illuminated by a laser on the battlefield. As well as the alarm, the system automatically twists the turret around so the gun is facing the threat and shoots off special flares to confuse laser guidance. But as the sensors are external, any incoming damage may cause a false signal leading to the turrets spinning. A former British Army tank commander, Hamish de Bretton-Gordan told The Telegraph , however, that the problem likely lies with inexperienced crews and poor electronics. He added: 'It's very easy for inexperienced people to become very disoriented in a tank because a tank's hull can move in one direction, the turret could be in another direction and the commander's sight could be in a completely other direction, which is why we get the term 'disco head' because people can easily become disoriented and the tank spins out of control. 'It could also be an electronics failure. Western tanks have a quite sophisticated fire control system, and the Russians don't appear to have got it right'.

        "content": "Kaduna State Governor Uba Sani has flagged off the distribution of farm inputs to 40,000 smallholder farmers under his ‘A Koma Gona’, across the 23 local government areas of the state. Addressing the farming community at the event today (Monday), the governor who expressed delight to be with the farmers said, “agriculture remains the backbone of our economy, providing employment and sustaining livelihoods. Kaduna State is blessed with huge agricultural potential. “Consequently, our administration has come up with programmes and policies to further boost the sector and attract the needed investment for its growth and development. We are taking steps to address key challenges in the sector in order to restore the glory of farming and the joy of rural living. “Smallholder farmers and small-scale agro-processors have been facing difficulties due to the current economic challenges in the country. This category of farmers are very critical in our quest to ensure food security. “It is for this reason that our administration has come up with an innovative programnes “Tallafin Noma – A Koma Noma” as part of our “Sustainable Livelihoods Through Social Interventions and Economic Empowerment” initiative. Under this “A Koma Gona” (Get Back to Farm) component, the Ministry of Agriculture is mandated to target a minimum of 40,000 smallholder farmers and farmers’ cooperatives across the 23 LGAs. “The Tallafin Noma programme includes the distribution of inputs for crop and livestock production. For crop production, improved Maize Seed, Agrochemicals, NPK and Urea Fertilizers are distributed. “Meanwhile, for livestock production (poultry), 30-day-old chicks (broilers) with 4 bags of feeds and drugs are distributed, while 50 jumbo juveniles (catfish) with 2 bags of feeds and drugs are distributed for fisheries. “To boost micro-mechanization of the agriculture sector in the state, power tillers with all the necessary equipment and accessories are distributed to farmer cooperative groups. This is a crucial step towards increasing production and productivity in our farms “Knapsack sprayers with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) are also shared with individuals for agrochemical and liquid fertilizer application in their farms. For the agro-processors, vegetable grinders are distributed to individuals, while hammer mills, hauliers and threshers are distributed to cooperative groups as group assets. “These processing machines will add value to our agricultural produce and improve the livelihoods of individuals and groups involved in agro-processing activities,” he said. The Governor therefore called on the benefiting smallholder farmers and small-scale agro-processors to make effective use of the equipment and inputs, saying that the efforts were parts of the administration’s commitment to revitalizing the agricultural sector. Earlier in his welcome address, Commissioner of Agriculture, Murtala Dabo said the Governor’s initiative will not only boost food security in Kaduna and Nigeria, it will also contribute greatly to the Governor’s desire to revitalise the rural economy. Chairman Ikara local government area, Sadiq Ibrahim Salihu expressed profound gratitude to the Governor, saying that, his unwavering commitment to the welfare and prosperity of farmers and agro-entrepreneurs has been a beacon of hope and progress for the people of Ikara and other local governments in the zone. “Under your visionary leadership, initiatives like the Tallafin Noma (A Koma Gona) are making a tangible difference in the lives of our people. Today, as you flag off the distribution of farm inputs, farm implements and agro-processing equipment for the entire Zone 1, the entire nation bears witness once again to your dedication to enhancing agricultural productivity, rural economic resilience and the transformation of the rural communities in the state.” ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

The 35-year-old Hot Man actor got candid about his work stating how he “ruined” a take as he watched a rough cut for the first time. In his appearance on the Therapuss with Jake Shane podcast, Powell revealed he \"puked in the bushes\" after seeing his performance as the famous astronaut, John Glenn, in Hidden Figures , a 2016 historical drama. \"I remember watching Hidden Figures for the first time on the Fox lot ... and this was before all the effects were done, the music was in, the sound design ... and I literally left the movie and I puked in the bushes,\" Powell said on the podcast. Appreciating his movie stars, Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monáe, he continued, \"I was like, 'All these women put in these great performances,' and it's like, the legacy of these women. I was like, 'I literally ruined this movie.'\" Glen Powell how the rough cut took a toll, saying, \"It does get in your own head. People forget that when you're watching the rough cut of a movie, it's probably like watching the footage of yourself that you're having to edit, right? So you sit there and you're like, 'I hate myself.'\"",

The AEW Champion defended his title against Christian Cage in one of the main events of the show. Despite interference from The Patriarchy , he fought off attacks from Nick Wayne and Killswtch to retain his title. After the match, Swerve Strickland celebrated in the crowd. One of the people there was Floyd Mayweather. The undefeated boxing legend has previously wrestled at WrestleMania 24 against The Big Show. Speaking at the Double or Nothing 2024 post-show scrum , Swerve Strickland explained how Mayweather’s appearance came about. He revealed that the boxer is a friend of Flash Garments, the company that Swerve recently collaborated with on his signature shoe . Because of this, Mayweather gets free tickets for AEW shows. Swerve has been trying to get him involved for the past two years, and he finally appeared at last night’s show. “Floyd has been a friend of ours, my man Flash Garments over here. He gets a free pass every time he comes to All Elite Wrestling because once again, we’re here to grow to this company and we’re here to bring something to All Elite Wrestling, not just take. We want to give, like if we have opportunities and connections, we’re going to bring them here every single time. And we want to blow this place up, and we want to be the catalysts of it.” “So that’s how Floyd came here. We’ve actually been talking to Floyd for like two years now, like his whole family trying to have him come every time we’re in Vegas. So finally, he was like, ‘Alright. This is the day we’re pulling up.’ So he pulled up and made it to the match. We pulled out a banger in front of him, he’s like, ‘I’m in.’” Two Champs! @FloydMayweather and @swerveconfident ! pic.twitter.com/o5qrnhWpbe This article first appeared on Wrestlezone and was syndicated with permission.",

Kennedy Jr. and nominated activist Chase Oliver for their presidential nominee, according to a party announcement. The nomination comes after the former president and each gave speeches before the crowd at the national convention, making their cases for Libertarian support. Oliver secured the nomination in the seventh round of voting, received nearly 60 percent of the vote, according to . The delegates have selected Chase Oliver as the Libertarian Party’s presidential candidate. — Libertarian Party (@LPNational) “I will continue to bring a hopeful and positive message of liberty to both those who consider themselves libertarian and those who don’t know they are libertarian yet,” Oliver said in his victory address, Fox News reported. Oliver told the Daily Caller that he is “proud to be the voice for liberty as the Libertarian Party’s candidate for president.” He said he and his running mate, Mike ter Maat, “will bring a unifying message of true freedom and liberty to all 50 states, especially to the Gen Z and millennial generations who are exceedingly dissatisfied with the broken two-party system.” The newly-minted presidential contender previously supported Democrats and President campaign, The Guardian .

He’s why I left the Democrats to find an antiwar party. — Chase Oliver (@ChaseForLiberty) Oliver has been criticized for his stance on issues. He explained his approach to the issue to the Daily Caller. “As with any medical issue, I support autonomy from the government in making personal decisions. I prefer individuals decide the healthcare that is right for them in consultation with a doctor if they so choose, and not leave those decisions to boards of bureaucrats or the politicians who enable them,” he said. The candidate’s platform includes ending involvement in and funding of wars, an Ellis Island approach to in which people without a criminal record would be allowed entry into the country, repealing gun control laws, abolishing the Patriot Act and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 and lessening government in the economy to promote a robust free market, according to his .",

        "content": "2024 will see the NFL’s first game played in Brazil as the league continues to explore new foreign markets. A number of other host countries are also receiving consideration with notable expansion on that front potentially on the horizon. Dublin and Paris are on the league’s radar, Henry Hodgson recently confirmed. Hodgson serves as the general manager of the NFL’s UK office, one of the departments playing a key role in evaluating new venues and hosts for NFL games. France had previously been named as a potential host country in the near future, but the same was not true of Ireland. “There’s a feasibility study, as we would call it, in a number of different European cities and Dublin is one of those,” Hodgson said ( via Laura Colgan of The Irish Times ). “Looking at the stadiums, taking local meetings... we’ll take away all of that information, digest it and determine what the next steps are.” The league has followed a similar process in the past , and that led to agreements with Sao Paulo and Madrid to host regular season games. Croke Park and Aviva Stadium are the venues under consideration in Dublin at this time. The former was the venue for a preseason contest between the Steelers and Bears in 1997, and it has a capacity of over 82,000. The Steelers, a team that has a formal partnership in place with the Gaelic Athletic Association, are among those in the NFL with international marketing rights in Ireland and Northern Ireland. That is also the case for the Jaguars, while the Jets added Ireland this offseason. At least one of those teams would likely take part in a game held there in the future. As of now, the Saints are the only team with marketing rights in France. They would represent a logical candidate to play a game in Paris, one of several sites being considered in some capacity. Sweden and Australia have also been floated as possibilities, although logistics in the latter country in particular are a notable challenge that would need to be overcome relative to those of playing in South America or Europe. “We continue to look at and have interest in all the major cities across Europe,” Hodgson added. “For now, Paris, Dublin – obviously we’re heading into Madrid in 2025 – those are the ones we’re most focused on in Europe.” This article first appeared on Pro Football Rumors and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDollarama (DOL.TO), Emcor Group (EME), and Comfort Systems USA (FIX) are the top three growth stocks for patient investors to buy in 2024.The post Hidden Gems: 3 Growth Stocks That Will Reward Patient Investors Handsomely appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Identifying the best growth stocks for patient investors is a worthy cause. These stocks are typically characterized by their potential to grow at an above-average rate compared to the broader market. While growth stocks can offer enticing long-term growth prospects, it’s crucial to remember that true growth takes time and patience. Moreover, it’s essential to evaluate factors such as revenue growth, profit margins, and cash flows to position these companies for future success. For investors willing to adopt a long-term perspective, growth stocks can be a rewarding addition to a diversified portfolio. Let’s discover the three best growth stocks for patient investors to snap up in May! Dollarama (DOL) Dollarama (TSE: DOL.TO ), a Canadian discount retailer, has carved a niche by offering a wide range of products at competitive prices. The company has thrived since the pandemic as consumers battle inflation and higher interest rates. One of the key factors contributing to Dollarama’s success is its sufficient supply chain management and low prices. The company’s direct sourcing model allows it to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers, ensuring competitive prices for its consumers. Furthermore, over the last decade, the company has offered a more comprehensive range of products, allowing it to compete with big box retailers and grocery stores. In FY24 , Dollarama saw record revenue of $5.86 billion. Comparable sales grew 12.6%, driven by strong operations execution. Additionally, EPS increased 29% YOY to $3.56 per share, with FCF and net income surpassing $1 billion for the first time. Their business model and the compelling, valuable proposition are resonating with customers. This makes DOL stock one of the top growth stocks for patient investors in 2024. Emcor Group (EME) Emcor Group (NYSE: EME ) is a leading provider of mechanical and electrical construction services in a market with significant growth potential. Its expertise in these vital services makes it one of the most compelling growth stocks for patient investors to buy now. Emcor Group has been on an absolute tear over the last five years. The stock has significantly outperformed the broader market, rising 394% as compared to the S&P 500’s 101%. Investors anticipate growth to continue, driven by strong demand for infrastructure projects in the healthcare and technology sectors. Moreover, the company’s growing revenue, earnings, and cash flows are another positive sign for the future. In FY23 , revenue increased 13.6% YOY to $12.58 billion. EPS skyrocketed 64.7% YOY to a record $13.3 per share while generating $711 million in FCF. Management has also initiated strong forward guidance for the 2024 fiscal year. Emcor’s acquisition strategy is working, expanding its geographical reach and enhancing its long-term growth prospects. Comfort Systems USA (FIX) Comfort Systems USA (NYSE: FIX ) is revving up for another strong year in 2024. Their expertise in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) services makes them well-positioned to benefit from the rise in global infrastructure spending. Comfort Systems started off as an extremely small company that only started to hit its stride during the pandemic. The company has seen an acceleration in revenue growth and profitability as demand for HVAC services has increased substantially. Thankfully, their expertise in the fragmented HVAC market and strong brand reputation have led to repeat business. This is something that the company prides itself on, and its focus on energy-efficient HVAC solutions gives it a competitive advantage. In the 2023 fiscal year , revenue increased 26% YOY to $5.2 billion. EPS swelled 32% YOY to $9.02 per share as strong operational execution drove profitability. As demand for sustainable HVAC services continues to increase, FIX stock remains one of the best growth stocks for patient investors to buy in May.

        "content": "CUSTOMERS are reacting to self-checkout being removed in busy locations, leaving many to wait in long lines for exorbitant times. Target , which recently put in place a strict 10 items or less policy for self-checkout , has recently decided to pull the plug on that experience in one of its most populated locations in the country . Target in Emeryville, California - which serves a majority of the East Bay area , announced early this week that they were removing access to self-checkout altogether, citing a massive increase over the past few years in shoplifting . This is the only nearby Target, for many shoppers in the Oakland area, with the nearest locations being in Albany, Alameda, and Berkeley. Some shoppers, as expected, were not happy with the change and are worried that this will further impact their experience in the store. \"Target be like: we want the checkout experience to be 4 times longer,\" commented one user under the news on X, formerly Twitter. \"Still only gonna have 2 registers open at peak times,\" wrote another. \"We all know damn well there’s still gonna only be one single register open anyway,\" someone else complained . Although there are no official numbers available for this specific Target, the chain did report an overall increase of theft by 120% in the first half of 2023, compared to the same time a year prior. One customer commented that \"the honor system doesn’t work in Emeryville.\" But another user responded that he believes \"the honor system doesn't work in America, period.\" Another suggested that corporations like Target \"have lost their honor.\" \"Why should we be expected to maintain ours?,\" he asks in the post. One person joked that maybe if people keep stealing, it would actually create more available jobs in retail. But others disagreed. \"Nah,\" one replied , \"they’ll still have 2 people running registers while 30 people wait in line.\" Over the last two years, Target cut over 35,000 jobs , or almost 8% of its total national workforce, according to company records. This cut has resulted in a major downsizing in the number of available cashiers in any location Since this change, customers have been complaining all over social media about being forced to wait in long lines with even longer wait times, frustrating those who may only have a few items in the absence of self-checkout. The chain also announced this month that prices of over 5,000 everyday items would be lowered in the store. This decision has led many customers to speculate on social media that Target has been actively price gouging. \"Alternative headline: Target confesses to blatantly price gouging millions of consumers, no penalties expected,\" one viral post said . \"Target was price gouging you to hell while claiming inflation pressure and lost a s**t ton of customers,\" another post read. \"So they’ll return prices to normal and pretend they’re giving you a deal.\" Target has not responded to the U.S. Sun's request for comment.",

        "content": "THANE: Following the announcement of Abhijit Panse as the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) candidate for the Konkan Graduate Constituency , Panse launched a scathing critique of the BJP, accusing the party of failing to deliver constructive projects for graduates. The MNS's decision to field Panse against the BJP is expected to escalate the political contest in the region. The BJP is preparing to field Niranjan Davkhare, the current Member of Legislative Council (MLC), for the same seat. This move by MNS leader Raj Thackeray is seen as a strategic effort to bolster the party's presence in the region and challenge the BJP's dominance. Panse alleged that no significant projects benefiting graduates have been undertaken in the last 12 years. He criticised the BJP for the constituency's lack of development and announced that, rather than a traditional manifesto, the MNS would present a detailed, job-oriented manifesto tailored to the specific needs of the constituency. When asked about the potential for supporting the BJP in this election, Panse stressed that the MNS follows Raj Thackeray's directives. He noted that any decisions regarding alliances would be made by Thackeray himself. MNS Thane Palghar District President Avinash Jadhav confirmed that there have been no discussions between the MNS and the BJP regarding this election.",

        "content": "Former Dallas Cowboys' second round pick Kelvin Joseph will be remembered as one of the biggest draft busts the front office has recently had after he was considered a second-round steal when the team made the pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. At the time, Joseph was considered one of the best athletes of his class but discipline concerns led to him falling into Day 2, where the Cowboys used their usual approach of making high-upside gambles on players with discipline or injury concerns. Fast forward to 2023, Joseph was traded from the team after he failed to level up amid injuries and off-the-field issues, including being a passenger on a car from which fatal shots were fired during the spring of 2022. After being moved to the Miami Dolphins, Joseph was released in November and eventually landed with the Seattle Seahawks as a practice squad member. These days, Joseph is a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, having signed a futures/reserve deal with the team in January. Fortunately for him, it seems like things are going well and he might just resurrect his playing career with the league's top contender. Below is an excerpt from a recent story from our very own Charles Goldman, which details how Joseph has been turning heads at practice for the reigning NFL champions: On Wednesday's first play of 7-on-7 during practice, Joseph caught Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes pushing the limits. The play resulted in an interception for Joseph, who has worked almost exclusively with the second-team defense to this point of the offseason. However, it's important to remember that workouts are voluntary at this point and players often jump around based on who is in attendance. Still, there was a lot of positive buzz about Joseph coming out of the lone day of practice media have been able to attend thus far. Chiefs team reporter Matt McMullen mentioned his interception in his post-practice observations. KSHB-TV's Nick Jacobs and Chiefs Digest's Matt Derrick also discussed Joseph as a standout during practice on their \"41 Is The Mic\" podcast. \"A very sneaky-good player was Kelvin Joseph,\" Jacobs said. \"Like the guy was all over all over 7-on-7 and team, and he had a lot of deflections and was in good position a lot of the times. And he made that interception on Mahomes.\" Joseph could find his way into the 53-man roster of the team to beat in the NFL. One of his biggest calling cards is the value he provides on special teams and that'll surely go a long way as he competes for a spot on the AFC contender. Watching him play for defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo would be quite interesting as he doesn't shy away from man coverage, which Joseph is built for thanks to his length and physicality.

The 37-year-old Spaniard lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev at the French Open and afterwards said his priority was the Olympics back in Paris. Asked if he would play Wimbledon, an event he has won twice, he replied: 'Looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but for me now looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having Olympics again on clay. 'I cannot confirm anything. I need to talk with my team. I need to analyze so many facts. 'But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay, no? Rafael Nadal has admitted he may skip Wimbledon this year to avoid transitioning to grass Nadal, 37, was knocked out of the French Open after losing to Alex Zverev in the first round The all-time great says he is being wary of overexertion after suffering numerous injuries 'Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feelings is even if I am booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.' Nadal has won two Wimbledon titles among his tally of 22 Grand Slams, having triumphed in 2008 and 2010. He last competed in SW19 in 2022. After reaching the semi-finals, Nadal was forced to withdraw from his match against Nick Kyrgios due to an untimely injury and has not returned since. His latest announcement may mean that Nadal's storied career at Wimbledon is over - with the all-time legend admitting he may be in the midst of his final year on tour. Speaking after his defeat by Zverev, Nadal told the crowd: 'I don't know if it'll be the last time I'm going to be here in front of you. If it is, I have enjoyed it. 'The crowd have been amazing the whole week. 'For me it's so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.'

        "content": "LONDON – Southampton clinched promotion back to the Premier League after a one-year exile as Adam Armstrong sealed a 1-0 win against Leeds in the Championship play-off final on Sunday. Armstrong’s first-half strike at Wembley ensured Southampton erased the bitter taste of last year’s relegation from the top-flight with an immediate return. Victory in football’s single richest match will give Southampton an estimated $178 million windfall due to the increases in matchday, broadcast and commercial revenue for clubs who reach the Premier League. Financial experts Deloitte say Southampton could eventually bank £305 million if they avoid relegation next season. While the cash prize is a huge bonus, it is the prestige of competing with Manchester City and Arsenal, rather than second-tier minnows like Plymouth and Oxford, that fuelled Southampton’s hunger to regain their Premier League status after a year in purgatory. Southampton, whose only major honour is the 1976 FA Cup, had spent 11 years in the Premier League prior to their relegation. In their first ever play-off final, Southampton made it three wins over Leeds this term despite finishing three points behind the Elland Road club in the regular season. Saints boss Russell Martin has become widely admired for his purist passing principles and this was the 38-year-old’s crowning glory. Martin was managing in League One with Milton Keynes Dons just three years ago, but he has transformed Southampton in his first season in charge, to such an extent that they boasted more possession than any team in Europe’s top five leagues this season. “I’m so pleased for the board because I was not an exciting appointment for them. I finished 10th at Swansea, but we had a really clear way of doing things at MK (Dons) and here, so for them to take me on was really brave,” Martin said. “The team have been so brave. I’m really grateful and proud of them. They deserve it.” Securing promotion at Leeds boss Daniel Farke’s expense was a sweet moment for Martin after his Norwich contract was terminated by the German during their time together at Carrow Road in 2018. Defeat was a bitter blow for Farke and Leeds, who were relegated alongside Southampton last season. On the 35th anniversary of the death of their legendary manager Don Revie, Leeds were well below their best in the club’s fourth play-off final loss. After losing their grip on an automatic promotion place that went instead to Ipswich, the three-time English champions remain without a win at Wembley since 1992. Leeds made a fast start but Southampton weathered the storm and snatched the lead in the 24th minute. Armstrong had scored twice in the play-off semi-final win over West Brom and the striker showcased his predatory instincts again with his 24th goal this season. Cleverly eluding the Leeds offside trap with a well-timed run, Armstrong met Will Smallbone’s pass with a superb strike into the far corner from 12 yards. Leeds were rocked and Armstrong nearly struck again from another instinctive shot from Smallbone’s quick free-kick, but this time Illan Meslier was able to parry his close-range effort. Early in the second half, Leeds defender Joe Rodon embarked on a rampaging run that looked certain to end in a goal until Taylor Harwood-Bellis threw himself into a last-ditch block. Leeds pushed hard for an equaliser, but Daniel James’ blast cannoned back off the bar before the winger was denied by Alex McCarthy’s stoppage-time save as Southampton celebrated their return to the promised land.",

(AP Photo/Thanassis Stavrakis) ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Nine Egyptian men cleared by a Greek court of involvement in a migrant shipwreck disaster remain unfairly held in administrative detention days after they were freed from jail , their lawyers said Monday. A judge in the southern town of Nafplio on Tuesday is expected to hear a legal appeal for their release, the lawyers told a press conference in Athens. “The decision for their detention is not legal, and has no justification,” said Effie Dousi, one of the lawyers. The nine men were among the 104 survivors of an overcrowded fishing trawler that sank in international waters off southwestern Greece on June 14, 2023, en route from Libya to Italy. A total 82 bodies were recovered, but hundreds more people are feared lost in one of the worst migrant shipwrecks in the Mediterranean Sea. Greek authorities accused the nine of being among the trawler’s crew — something the defense denied — and brought criminal charges against them including for people smuggling and causing a deadly shipwreck. But last week a judge in the southern city of Kalamata dismissed the case after a prosecutor argued that Greece lacked jurisdiction as the trawler sank outside its waters. Greece’s coast guard was widely criticized for failing to prevent the sinking, despite having a vessel close by, and some survivors claimed the trawler foundered after the coast guard tried to tow it. The coast guard strongly denied that. A separate Naval Court investigation into the sinking and the coast guard’s actions is still underway. Dousi said the nine, who have applied for asylum in Greece, had already spent 11 months in pre-trial detention and should now be at liberty. “These are survivors of a shipwreck,” she said, adding that if the Nafplio court rules against their release, the nine will take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Lawyers said the Egyptians are being held in police cells in Nafplio and Athens, and in a migrant detention center in Corinth, southern Greece. They said police ordered their administrative detention because they have no given address in Greece, lack identity papers and allegedly pose a flight risk. ___ Follow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

        "content": "A female American soldier was found murdered inside a locked bedroom in her apartment off the Army base where she served. The body of Private First Class Katia Duenas-Aguilar, 23, was discovered in her residence in Clarksville, Tennessee, by her friend, WTVF reported. Clarkesville detectives who responded to the residence near the border with Kentucky on May 18 ruled her death a homicide. Duenas-Aguilar was stationed at Fort Campbell in Kentucky and assigned to the 101st Airborne Division’s Combat Aviation Brigade. ‘We are stunned by the death of Pfc Duenas-Aguilar,’ 101st Airborne Division spokesman Lt Col Tony Hoefler told Military.com . ‘In the meantime, we will continue to cooperate with Army and local investigative authorities on this matter.’ Duenas-Aguilar, of Mesquite, Texas, was the single mother of a four-year-old boy. She shared the apartment with another person and was the only victim, police said. ‘We want to know what happened, who did it and we want to make sure that person or people are brought to justice,’ stated her family, according to CBS News . On Saturday, Duenas-Aguilar’s family begged for the public’s help and along with the League of United Latin American Citizens announced a doubling of the reward amount to $55,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.

Duenas-Aguilar joined the US Army in 2018 and received her training at Fort Eisenhower. She was awarded two Army Achievement Medals, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Army Service Ribbon. ‘We want to believe that it’s a nightmare that we can wake up and she will still be there,’ Ruiz-Aguilar said. Duenas-Aguilar’ death comes after after three US Marines were found dead inside a parked car at a gas station near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina where they were stationed.

Walton, survived by his wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris, was a two-time NBA champion, winning one title with the Portland Trail Blazers and another with the Boston Celtics . He is also one of the greatest college basketball players of all time, winning three consecutive national college player of the year awards between 1972 and 1974 and two NCAA titles with the UCLA Bruins. Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, both on the court and off. After retiring, Walton overcame a stutter to thrive on the microphone, winning a Sports Emmy in 1991 and being named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all-time in 2009. NBA hall of fame center Bill Walton has died at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer Walton is survived by his wife Lori (above) and his four sons Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris Walton was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers and won his first NBA championship in Oregon Walton (far right) with Celtics teammates Danny Ainge, Rick Carlisle and Larry Bird in 1986 Walton (left) overcame a stutter to thrive on the microphone, winning a Sports Emmy in 1991 'Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. 'As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. 'Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. 'But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. 'I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. 'As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him. My heartfelt condolences to Bill's wife, Lori; his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris; and his many friends and colleagues.' His NBA career - disrupted by chronic foot injuries - lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. Walton's NBA career lasted only 468 games because he struggled with chronic foot injuries NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Walton 'was truly one of a kind' in an emotional statement Walton was selected with the No. 1 pic in the 1974 NBA draft, and won his first NBA Championship with the Trail Blazers three years later. After struggling with those foot problems, Walton's career took off again when he signed with the Celtics in 1985 for two seasons. Alongside Larry Bird, Walton collected his second NBA Championship in 1986. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. 'Bill Walton,' NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, 'was truly one of a kind.' 'It ́s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA ́s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,' UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. 'Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it ́s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. 'As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. 'For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It ́s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.' More to follow.

        "content": "The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, SAN, has urged members of the National Assembly not pass the Bill mandating the country to revert to the old National Anthem through legislative fiat. LEADERSHIP reports both chambers of the National Assembly had last week expeditiously pass a Bill for an Act to revert to the old Nigeria’s National Anthem – ‘Nigeria, We Hail Thee..’ But, Fagbemi warned that such an important Bill on the national anthem should not be done by legislative fiat. Speaking at the public hearing on the Bill organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters in Abuja on Monday, AGF Fagbemi warned that the issue of National Anthem should not be treated with legislative fiat without giving Nigerians a say. He said as commendable as the move by both chambers of the National Assembly may be, on enacting law on the National Anthem or replacing the current one with the old one, Nigerians must be carried along for their required “buy-in”. The AGF said: “In some cases, the national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration. “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions. “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone. “Consequently, it is my considered view that the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.” In his submission at the public hearing, the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, recommended that the scope should be expanded to include a robust issue on national identity rather than limiting it to mere change of national anthem. The Minister, who was represented by the Director-General of National Orientation Agency (NOA), Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem being advocated by the lawmakers, do not make a complete meaning. “The issue of the national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not value national identity, of which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning it and imbibing it,” he said. Also cautioning the National Assembly on the expeditious passage of the Bill into law, renowned lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever National Anthem is proposed and buy into it. According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an Act for general acceptability. He, however, supported the move to replace the current “Arise O Compatriots” anthem with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee” version, which the country started with at independence in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current National Anthem adopted in 1978, does not have the required gravitas and is not inspirational to fire the passion and zeal for nationhood among Nigerians. Nigeria, according to him, will not be the first country in the world to replace its National Anthem with the old one as over 20 countries like Russia, Austria, Chile, France, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq etc, have done so at different times in the past. Other stakeholders in their submissions spoke in preference for the old National Anthem against the current one.",

        "content": "KC Navarro recently wrestled for TNA Wrestling at Under Siege, as he was a last minute replacement for Rich Swann. The lineup for the show had been changed due to an injury to Alex Hammerstone, who was set to face Jake Something. Swann was put against Something in his place, with Navarro taking Swann’s place against Laredo Kid. In an interview with Fightful ), Navarro spoke about his last minute appearance on the show. He said: “ Oh man, it was great. I mean, originally, you know, I wasn’t even supposed to be a part of that man. I wasn’t going to go. I wrestled Ali. Ali kind of was like, oh, maybe you should come. I was like, oh, maybe, you know, I wrestle like a lot that weekend too. Like I have like a show that following Saturday and the Sunday as well. So I was like, oh, you know, maybe, you know, I’m tired. Cause I’ve been on the go since the last week of February. So like my body, you know, it’s catching up. I’m feeling it. I wanted to be, I want to be a hundred percent for Super Strong Style. You know, I knew it was the pay-per-view that day. So I was like, ah, you know, most of the time it’s pay-per-view. There’s a high chance you’re not doing anything. You know what I mean? Unless you’re doing like a backstage thing. But I know it kind of at this point, it’s kind of hard to make me do a backstage thing with my hair. We showed up late. We showed up late, you know, because we were just going to watch and see everybody. We left to get food for two hours. I walked back in and they’re telling me, get your stuff. You’re wrestling Laredo in the main event of the countdown. I’m like, I just ain’t doing it. I wish somebody told me. But, like, that’s that, like, hey, man, something told me to bring my gear anyway. You should always bring your gear. And I just brought it just because. I mean, I would have never expected wrestling on the pay-per-view that day. Never, never, never. But I had to be ready. The doors are opening in an hour. You know, card’s subject to change. They said it on commentary. You never know. I was there. I was ready. Put my stuff on. Let’s go. I’m fighting for a title. I’ll add another one. Let’s go. I’ll take it. ”",

Faith won’t always stop you from hurting, but it will help you heal, and it will help you deal. “God never said the weapons wouldn’t form, He promised that they wouldn’t prosper. He never said the enemy wouldn’t come... He promised that when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of God would raise a standard against him. “Posting this testimony to encourage anyone out there who is going through a challenge. It might seem bigger than you, but greater is He that is in you than anything you will face in this world. “Grateful for my wife, family, friends, and Pastors for their love, prayers, and support. Thanking God for my health and trusting that this latest victory is final in Jesus’ name. “Appreciating the gifted hands and minds of my doctors, Dr. Onyewu of the Center for Advanced Specialty Surgery, and Dr. Adenuga of Euracare and the teams that support them. “We have the victory yet again. Now and forever, in Jesus’ name. “And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.” – Romans 8:28′′",

        "content": "NEW YORK, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of securities of AST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) between November 14, 2023 and April 1, 2024, both dates inclusive (the Class Period), of the important June 17, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline . SO WHAT: If you purchased AST SpaceMobile securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the AST SpaceMobile class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24272 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 17, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) production of AST SpaceMobile's five Block 1 BlueBird satellites had been negatively impacted by two suppliers of key subsystems; (2) as a result, AST SpaceMobile had not substantially completed the production of the Block 1 BlueBird satellites; (3) as a result, AST SpaceMobile's five Block 1 BlueBird satellites were not on track to launch in the first quarter of 2024; and (4) as a result of the foregoing, defendants' positive statements about AST SpaceMobile's business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the AST SpaceMobile class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24272 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

        "content": "Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has signed a new five-year contract with the club after taking them into next season’s Champions League. The 52-year-old Spaniard has turned Villa around since arriving from Villarreal in October 2022 with the club sitting 17th in the Premier League. Emery led them to seventh place in his first season in charge and fourth in this campaign. “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club,” said Emery, whose existing deal still had another three years to run. “There’s a great chemistry in Aston Villa. And the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. “We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams,” he said. Emery also took Villa, the 1982 European Cup champions, to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League this season in their first European campaign for 13 years. The club’s Chairman Nassef Sawiris said, “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core, and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Aston Villa undoubtedly want to bolster their squad this summer after the superb achievement of reaching the Champions League – but the news that manager Unai Emery has agreed a new five-year contract means they have already captured the most vital signature of all. Emery extended his current deal until 2027 in April but this was always with the intention of a longer-term extension once the season finished. Villa have wasted no time in tying up their inspirational manager for the future. The Spaniard has overseen a stunning rejuvenation of Villa since succeeding the sacked Steven Gerrard in October 2022. Emery’s new contract is a sign of ambition from Villa’s owners but also an indication of the faith he has in them, in partnership with his long-time associate, Villa’s president of football operations Monchi. The fact that Emery has taken them into the Champions League was beyond fans’ most optimistic expectations this season. Emery has put Villa ahead of schedule but there will be no complaints as they mix with the Champions League big names for the first time. They will feel confident of making an impact under a manager with such pedigree in the European environment, one who already has four second-tier Europa League titles to his name. He has already assumed hero status at Villa Park and it will be a source of joy to everyone at the club that Emery has now signed up until 2029.",

        "description": "Minister of State for Northern Ireland Steve Baker has been accused of a “lack of effort” after a leaked memo from Conservative Campaign Headquarters appeared to criticise his decision to continue his holiday in Greece during parliamentary recess.",
        "content": "Mr Baker, who is the MP for Wycombe, has been Northern Ireland Minister since September 2022. His name was just one of several listed in a leaked memo obtained by The Times, which criticised several Tory MPs and their activities following Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s snap election announcement last week. Mr Baker is currently in Greece where he told the Daily Mirror he will be doing his “campaign work”. “The Prime Minister told everyone we could go on holiday and then called a snap election,” he told the Mirror from Vasiliki. “So I’ve chosen to do my campaign work in Greece.” The Wycombe MP added: “I’ve been campaigning for months and my wife deserves to have her husband go away for a much needed break. It’s the only holiday we’ve got planned for the summer.” The memo said a “key theme” was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign in the election announcement. Cheadle MP Mary Robinson was also referred to as being “away for seven days on holiday” during the campaign, the memo revealed and that the seat of veterans’ minister Johnny Mercer “had an issue” with the Conservative Campaign Headquarters. Asked why CCHQ was blaming MPs, Mr Sunak dodged the question: “What I’m doing is talking to people everywhere, about the choice of this election, and I was very clear that I’ve got a clear plan that I’m working through and you can see that that is happening with the economy.” The criticism of MPs comes as Mr Baker revealed the decision to create a mandatory national service policy from the PM which has been widely criticised and mocked “I don’t like to be pedantic but a government policy would have been developed by ministers on the advice of officials and collectively agreed,” he posted on X, formerly Twitter, in response to an opinion piece written by the Belfast Telegraph’s Allison Morris. “I would have had a say on behalf of [Northern Ireland]. But this proposal was developed by a political adviser or advisers and sprung on candidates, some of whom are relevant ministers.” He later defended his remarks in a post on his website writing he is standing for his constituents in Wycombe: “I am for liberty under the rule of law and Parliamentary democracy. \"History has proven time and time again that liberty under law – not compulsion and planning – is the surest road to peace and prosperity.”",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer mocked Rishi Sunak’s plan to revive national service for young Britons if his Conservatives cling to power, as the rivals used a UK bank holiday to campaign in two areas that underscored the very different challenges they face in the July 4 election. Starmer, whose party has held a lead of about 20 points in the polls for well over a year, used a speech in Lancing on England’s southern coast to urge voters to trust Labour on the economy and national security. He promised to fix what he called the “chaos\" of 14 years of Tory government and said Sunak’s national service idea is emblematic of his habit of sudden policy shifts. “A sort of teenage Dad’s Army,\" was Starmer’s description, a reference to a British sitcom from the 1970s about a bumbling group of volunteers in the Home Guard, a citizen military group during World War II. Starmer was delivering his first keynote speech of the general election, and his destination choice was telling. The East Worthing and Shoring constituency has been held by the Conservatives since the parliamentary seat was created in 1997, but outgoing Tory MP Tim Loughton’s victory margin of 14% five years ago makes it a target for Starmer’s party as it chases a majority in Parliament. It’s why Starmer focused largely on Britain’s undecided voters in his speech, a type of introduction about his upbringing and political beliefs. He said he’s changed Labour since taking over from his socialist predecessor Jeremy Corbyn, who led the party to an historic defeat in 2019. “Elections are about more than individual changes and policies, but about values, temperament, character,\" Starmer said. He accused Sunak of “desperation\" over the national service plan, which the premier has not made a priority so far in office. Starmer said the Tories would pay for it of taking funding out of communities and the National Health Service. Sunak hit back as he campaigned in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, saying his policy would boost security and make British society “more cohesive.\" He repeated his stock attack on Starmer having “no idea, no plan.\" “It is bold, but that’s the kind of leadership I offer,\" Sunak said. But the policy and Sunak’s choice of campaign venue underscore that the prime minister doesn’t speak from a position of strength. Conservative MPs including Steve Baker have spoken out already about a plan which appears aimed at stopping the leak of votes from the Tory right flank to the populist Reform UK. Polls show that any support that does exist for reintroducing national service is concentrated among older voters, who the Conservatives consider their core support. Tory MPs have spent months warning that a resurgent Reform UK could cost the Conservative Party dozens of seats by splitting the right-leaning vote. At the same time, Sunak’s appearance in Buckinghamshire showed that along with the Reform threat on the Tory right, the Conservatives face a fight in their traditional Blue Wall heartland from the centrist Liberal Democrats. Chesham and Amersham had been held by the Tories since it was created in 1974 before it unexpectedly switched to the Liberal Democrats in a special election in 2021, a seismic political upset that came to be seen as an early warning sign of then Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s subsequent downfall. Sunak was brought in as leader in large part to fix the Tories’ slide in the polls that began under Johnson and went into freefall under Liz Truss. He’s failed to do so, and that’s left the prime minister forced to try to shore up support in what should be safe territory just days into the campaign. The Liberal Democrats are targeting Tory strongholds in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire to the northwest and north of the capital, in Surrey to the south, as well as in areas where they have been previously been strong in southwest England. That has left senior Tories, many in Liberal Democrat-facing areas, worried about starring in a new “Portillo\" moment on election night, the nickname for a when a Tory big beast loses a safe seat after Cabinet Minister Michael Portillo lost Enfield Southgate in the Tony Blair-led Labour whitewash of 1997. Many including Michael Gove have decided not to risk it, and Sunak has battled a slew of Tory resignations that have undermined the start of his campaign. Just as he has since taking office in October 2022, the prime minister is now trying to find political messaging that works for the political right and center. He suffered another setback in Telford, central England, when outgoing Conservative MP Lucy Allan said she planned to support Reform UK’s candidate in the seat. Sunak’s party responded by kicking her out of the Tory party. The opening campaign days have so far proved smoother for Starmer, who made light of Tory attacks about his age and stamina overnight. “I’ve had a smile on my face since January 1, 2024 because I knew this was going to be an election year,\" Starmer, 61, said in Lancing. “I’ve wasted nine years of my life in opposition. I’ve worked four-and-a-half years to change this Labour Party, and now I’ve got the chance to take that to the country.\" More stories like this are available on ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

        "content": "What your BELLY BUTTON reveals about your health, according to experts READ MORE: Doctors warn why you should clean inside your belly button By Emily Joshu Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 18:39, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:55, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Most of us probably don't give our belly button a second thought. However, this small fold of skin could be a host for infections , cysts, and even hernias, experts suggest. Dr Dan Baumgardt, a neuroscientist and physiologist at the University of Bristol in the UK, wrote for The Conversation that the belly button - known medically as the navel - 'has more depth to it than just a few millimeters.' The belly button is a remnant of the umbilical cord, which connects a fetus to its mother during pregnancy. There are many variations, but the two main groups are 'outies' and 'innies.' Roughly 10 percent of people around the world have an outie, meaning their belly button is protruding, while the remainder have an innie. Most people have an 'innie,' belly button, meaning that the flap of skin folds in rather than protrouding out While the belly button has no function after birth, subtle changes to the way it appears could be an indicator that something is wrong with our health. One of these, Dr Baumgardt notes, is an umbilical hernia, which occurs when part of the intestine bulges through the belly button. This causes swelling or a bulge coming out of the navel. These are usually harmless and mainly affect infants, though they are also the second most common hernia in adults. Being overweight or having multiple pregnancies can increase the risk of adults developing an umbilical hernia. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: health@dailymail.com Advertisement Most of the time, no treatment is needed, though the hernia may need to be surgically removed if it causes pain or blocks the intestine. Dr Baumgardt also pointed to a rare complication called Sister Mary Joseph's nodule, which is named after a nun who discovered that many patients with late-stage cancer had swelling or a nodule near their belly button. This can be a sign that patient's cancer has spread or become more advanced. 'It’s not seen as commonly these days, since more cancers are now diagnosed earlier before extensive spreading occurs,' Dr Baumgardt writes. Another unusual condition of caput medusae, or Medusa's head. Also called a palm tree sign, this is a network of painless, swollen veins around the belly button. From a distance, it also looks like a black or blue bruise. This is caused by portal hypertension, which is high pressure in the portal vein. The portal vein carried blood to the liver from the intestines, gall bladder, pancreas, and spleen. The liver then processes nutrients in the blood and sends it to the heart. Medusa's head (left) and Sister Mary Joseph nodule (right) are two rare conditions that form in or around the belly button Medusa's head on its own is not a disease, though it is usually a sign of liver scarring, also called cirrhosis. The scarring makes it harder for blood to flow through the liver's veins, causing it to build up in the portal vein and flow to nearby veins near the belly button. This enlarges those blood vessels into a Medusa-like pattern. The belly button can also harbor infections, especially if you have an innie. This fold can trap moisture and debris, and warm environments like this are prime environments for bacteria to grow. Signs of an infection in the belly button include redness, pain, swelling, foul smell, and pus or other fluids leaking out.

        "content": "The management of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo town in Oyo State on Monday, declared a three-day mourning period with fasting and prayers over the death a student, Akor Alex who was killed by his colleagues on Friday. Alex, a 22-year-old 200-level Mechanical Engineering student was killed in the hostel by his colleagues for allegedly stealing a phone. The Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Professor Timothy Adebayo disclosed this while addressing journalists at the Council Chamber of the school in company of other principal officers of the faith-based university. “I sympathise with the family. We don’t pray for such to happen. We are sad over the development. The university has declared a three-way mourning starting from Wednesday to Friday, with fasting and prayer every night against a recurrence such as a sad incident. In those days, it is lecture-free to mourn the departed student,” Prof Adebayo said. The Vice-Chancellor also disclosed that he wept for two days over the incident. He said, ”As the vice chancellor, I wept throughout Sunday and Monday. Even while conveying the message to the staff, I wept. I didn’t know I would be able to address this press conference. Adebayo also disclosed that 16 persons were already in police custody over the incident. “Twelve students are in the police net over Ajayi Crowther varsity’s student killing. Eighteen (18) were initially apprehended but the Police screened them to 12, including a porter who was taken to Iyaganku Police Station, Ibadan,” he said. The deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Muyiwa Popoola, also confirmed the VC’s statement, saying: “We wept bitterly.” He also reiterated the university’s stance against cultism and bullying, saying: “We have learnt our lessons in a hard way. We have zero tolerance for bullying, and cultism. There is no cultism. We have worked in different schools, cultists need bushes to operate. “There is no sign of cultism and bullying here. There are no bushes here. Cultists need bushes to operate. We always ask our students not to stay alone and in obscure places. We rusticate anyone involved in bullying.” The VC further added that security had been beefed up to guide against a recurrence of the incident. He said, “We have a monitoring team that moves around. We have a security team. The Management moves round to check that things are in order to ensure that students comply with the mechanism put in place. “We will increase the number of security operatives and porters. We will keep on beefing up security in our hostels. We will work on every other aspect of observed inadequacies,” Prof. Adebayo said. He further assured that the Ajayi Crowther University is safe, saying, “We raise students with Godly characters. We are telling the parents now that their children are in safe hands here.”",

        "content": "In a significant move to enhance law enforcement in KwaZulu-Natal and Mthatha in the Eastern Cape , additional Public Order Policing (POP) units are being deployed to bolster existing crime combatting efforts. This initiative was highlighted during a send-off parade in Harrismith, where the National Commissioner of the South African Police Service (SAPS), General Fannie Masemola, addressed over 700 POP officers. Maintaining a safe and secure environment for the upcoming elections General Masemola emphasised the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment for the upcoming elections. He tasked the officers with preventing and combating criminal activities while ensuring that South Africans can exercise their right to vote in peace. “We are sending you off to maintain law and order. No disruptions and acts of criminality should take place under your watch. We are sending you out there to protect the constitutional right of South Africans and the integrity of the election process,” said General Masemola. Aim of the police deployment in these regions The deployment aims to enhance the capacity of the current law enforcement presence in these regions. This comes in response to recent tensions in Mthatha , where roadblocks have been a significant issue. General Masemola confirmed that police forces have been fully mobilised to address these challenges, and five individuals have been arrested for attempting to block roads leading to Mthatha Airport. Lieutenant General Tebello Mosikili, Co-chair of the National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (NATJOINTS), also participated in the send-off parade. She urged the officers to perform their duties within the legal framework, underscoring the importance of lawful conduct during these operations. Earlier reports indicated a tense situation in Mthatha, which caused several roads to be closed. At around 9:00, five suspects were arrested following an altercation where shots were fired at POP and Mthatha Vispol members. Two suspects were injured, and two firearms were confiscated. Authorities have opened cases of attempted murder and illegal possession of firearms for further investigation. According to Jacaranda FM , by Monday afternoon, Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane said that he had asked President Cyril Ramaphosa to send the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to Mthatha to help maintain order and restore calm. Additionally, Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nomthetheleli Mene issued a stern warning against the circulation of videos and messages inciting unrest. “Such actions are not only irresponsible but also illegal. We will take strict action against anyone found to be engaging in activities that threaten the safety and security of the public and the integrity of the election process,” she stated.",

        "content": "The federal government has said it is committed to establishing 24 skills and innovation hubs and entrepreneurship centres across the country. President Bola Tinubu disclosed this on Monday in Abuja, during the commemoration of this year’s Children’s Day celebration, with the theme “Enhancing the Total Wellbeing of the Nigerian Child through Quality Education and Skills Development.” He said the administration under his watch has embarked on key transformative policies to create a conducive learning environment across the country. Tinubu, who was represented by the FCT Minister of State, Dr Mariya Mahmoud, re-affirmed his administration’s commitment to all matters relating to the total well-being and development of the Nigerian child. He said that the federal government had established the National Education Data System, approved skill development for all levels of education, and trained teachers in digital skills. He said, “The government is committed to establishing 24 skills and innovation hubs and entrepreneurship centres across the country. “Also, the FG is set to inaugurate private sector Innovation Enterprise Centres across the country to deliver on the skills acquisition programme of the government. “The government is also building 91 vocational centres in secondary schools across the country to ensure that all levels of education enjoy the impact of our policy. “We are also working with the State Commissioners of Women Affairs and the State Ministries of Education, the State Universal Basic Education Board, and civil society organisations to ensure quality education and skills development for Nigerian children,” Tinubu said. Similarly, the Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs. Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye, assured the children that their rights would be protected. Kennedy-Ohanenye said, “When it comes to fighting for your rights, I shall always be there for you because, as Mr. President said, the poor shall breathe and the children are one of the vulnerable.” Mrs Adedayo Benjamin-Laniyi, Mandate Secretary, Women Affairs Secretariat, FCT Administration, explained that the FCT, under Nyesom Wike, was working to ensure that every child in the FCT has access to quality education and skills development for them to excel in life. Earlier, the Children’s Parliament, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), via its Speaker, Rahama Waziri, demanded the empowerment of children with education and skills for sustainable growth and development of the country. She said, “Education is the bedrock of any progressive society. It is the tool that empowers individuals to transcend the limitations of their circumstances and achieve their full potential. “For the Nigerian child, quality education is not just a right but a necessity. It is the gateway to opportunities, the key to breaking the cycle of poverty, and the foundation for a prosperous and equitable society.” ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "content": "(Adds details on VNB Margin, shareholder's fund transfer) By Nikunj Ohri and Nishit Navin BENGALURU, May 27 (Reuters) - Life Insurance Corp of India, the country's biggest insurer, reported on Monday a drop in its new business margin in the fourth quarter, while its profit rose slightly. Value of new-business margin (VNB), a measure of the profit margin of new premiums earned, fell to 17.2% for the quarter-ended March 31, from 19% a year earlier. Mumbai-based Life Insurance Corp (LIC) said its VNB margins were curtailed by weakness in group business. LIC's total group business premium for the year-ended March 31 was down 5.5%. It did not report business premium earned for the quarter. Group insurance covers a group of people in the same contract. It is generally taken by companies to provide insurance cover for their employees. LIC posted a 2.5% year-on-year rise in its fourth-quarter profit to 137.63 billion rupees($1.66 billion) even as it reported a one-time gain by transferring funds of around 80 billion rupees to a shareholders' account and a tax reversal of 76.93 billion rupees. The premium LIC collects from non-par policies is parked in a non-participating fund. Since 2022, the company has been transferring some of this premium every quarter to a shareholders' fund, aiding its profit and shoring up its solvency ratio. LIC's solvency ratio, the measure of an insurer's ability to meet its long-term debt obligations, rose to 1.98 in the quarter from 1.87 a year ago. LIC had transferred 72.99 billion rupees to the shareholders fund in the same quarter last year. LIC said its profit was reduced during the quarter as it started making provisions for a 119.60 billion rupees pension liability. During the quarter, LIC's net premium income rose 15.6%, and it expects premium income to grow by double digits in fiscal year 2025. LIC’s board also approved a 6 rupees per share dividend.

LIC had transferred 72.99 billion rupees to the shareholders fund in the same quarter last year. LIC said its profit was reduced during the quarter as it started making provisions for a 119.60 billion rupees pension liability. During the quarter, LIC's net premium income rose 15.6%, and it expects premium income to grow by double digits in fiscal year 2025. LIC’s board also approved a 6 rupees per share dividend.

        "description": "Chase Oliver, who has won the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, was overheard comparing drag artists to The Wiggles.",
        "content": "A Libertarian presidential candidate's comments about drag queens and drag shows sparked criticism from many on social media. Over the weekend, won the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, making him the latest figure to enter the for the White House. However, many conservative social media users spoke out against Oliver this week after he was heard speaking about and comparing them to the children's musical group The Wiggles. \"Libertarian nominee Chase Oliver: 99% of drag queen story hours are fine for kids. If he had children, he says he'd bring them to one and leave them there,\" End Wokeness wrote on X, formerly , sharing a video of Oliver's comments. \"'It's just like the Wiggles.'\" In the video, Oliver can be heard saying that he thinks drag queens are \"performance artists\" and that \"they want to be able to have different levels of the performance art. It's the same reason why the Wiggles sing to children—because they want to have a marketplace to kids.\" \"A man in a dress or a woman in a suit. That is what drag is,\" Oliver said. \"That is not inherently sexual. There is inherently sexual drag...there absolutely it but there's also the ability to perform as a man in a wig without being sexual.\" Oliver went on to say that he attended a drag event himself and noted that \"nothing sexual was going on.\" reached out to Oliver's campaign via email for comment. The comments by Oliver went viral on social media, prompting many conservative users to criticize the Libertarian candidate. In recent months, many Republicans have taken aim at drag shows, with some saying that they expose children to sexual themes. The backlash against drag shows has been going hand in hand with attacks by conservatives across the country. Some Republican-led states such as Tennessee, have sought to ban drag shows in public spaces that can be accessed by minors. Robby Starbuck, a filmmaker and former congressional candidate from Tennessee, wrote on X, \"The Libertarian Party selected a left wing libertarian to be their Presidential candidate. @ChaseForLiberty supports drag shows for kids, transitioning kids, bringing in people from Gaza to live here, funding Planned Parenthood with tax $$$ and open borders.\" \"Terrible candidate. Hopefully all the right wing libertarians (which is the majority of the voters but not delegates), see how terrible this is and do the right thing by voting Trump in 2024,\" Starbuck added. X user @Travis_4_Trump said, \"The Libertarian party just made a joke of themselves on the national stage. Instead of taking Trump's offer for cabinet positions, they nominated a guy who believes minors can transition and police shouldn't be allowed to detain and deport illegals who commit crimes. Good luck recruiting future generations to your cause.\" Another X user, @Mayoralpodcast, wrote, \"The Libertarian Party nominee is an open border advocate, pro trans youth, pro drag queen story hour, pro choice & a 'former' democrat. Meet Chase Oliver!\" X user @amuse wrote, \"LIBERTARIANS: The LP presidential nominee Chase Oliver promotes drag queen story hours for kids? The libertarian party has been captured by the left.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "In the run-up to the final adoption of Georgia’s “foreign agents” law, the United States prepared to on members of the Georgian Dream party responsible for promoting it and obstructing the country’s Euro-Atlantic integration. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department that it was introducing a new visa restriction policy against a wide range of Georgian officials and their family members, as well as those who participated in the use of violence against protesters on the streets of Tbilisi. The visa restrictions are only the first stage of sanctions pressure on sub-sanctioned persons, which is typically followed by freezing of assets in U.S. jurisdictions and restrictions on financial transactions. Each of these measures requires additional explanation, if only because some representatives of the Georgian Dream claim that and even ask to be in the “honorary register of patriots,” apparently believing that they will cause only minor harm to them and their families. In order to understand the effect of sanctions, it would be useful for the members of Georgian Dream to refer to the long experience of Russian individuals on the sanctions lists. This measure applies to property and property rights, including cash, securities, interests in companies and other property located in the U.S. jurisdiction. This means that a house, apartment, car, or business asset located in the U.S., as well as a current account, deposit, or bank card opened in a U.S. bank, may be subject to the freeze. For example, shortly after the U.K. froze the assets of Russian oligarch and billionaire Mikhail Fridman, he that he did not know how to pay for even small expenses, such as cleaning his house abroad. Another sanctioned Russian billionaire, Pyotr Aven, he did not understand how to survive because “everything we have built over 30 years is now completely destroyed.” The American jurisdiction has a much broader scope than the British one, so a person caught under the asset freeze can say goodbye to his financial assets and property located in Western countries, as well as forget about the possibility of building and developing any business there. This ban not only prevents the sanctioned person from entering the United States, but also results in the suspension of visas issued to family members, for example to study at a U.S. university. For example, if a visa ban is imposed on Irakli Garibashvili, the chairman of Georgian Dream, it is likely that he will not be able to visit his son who is studying at the University of Pennsylvania. Since this measure will also apply to his family members, it is likely that Garibashvili’s son will also be forced to suspend his studies there. It should be noted separately that if visas are banned for such Georgian Dream deputies as Aluda Gudushauri, Beka Odisharia or Irakli Chikovani, their US-born and US-citizen children will be directly affected by the very harsh US sanctions legislation, which provides for criminal liability for violations of the sanctions regime. The deputies themselves and their families will no longer be able to visit the United States, even for tourism. In the context of visa restrictions, it will be useful for Georgian Dream members to familiarize themselves with the experience of another Russian oligarch and billionaire, Oleg Deripaska. Although he was subject to US sanctions in 2018, he nevertheless to circumvent them in order to organize the birth of his two children on US territory, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. But the machinations were exposed, and Deripaska and his associates, including the arrested , were charged with conspiracy to evade sanctions, which carries up to 20 years in prison. It is noteworthy that in 2022, for violating or circumventing sanctions imposed on Russia. It is also worth recalling that last year the USA imposed on four high-ranking and their families, which became the first case of application of the sanctions mechanism in the history of Georgian-American relations. The measure was so painful for the ruling party that some members of Georgian Dream the U.S. decision and even categorically demanded that it be lifted. At the same time, the parliamentary majority, despite its confidence in the independence and impartiality of the Georgian judiciary, prevented the establishment of a temporary investigative commission to investigate corruption in the judiciary. This measure denies a sanctioned person access to a significant part of the international financial system. For example, he/she cannot use bank cards that use the U.S. payment systems Visa or Mastercard are blocked, and his/her ability to conduct banking and financial transactions in U.S. dollars is suspended. In addition, because Georgia does not have its own payment system, such as Russia’s MIR or China’s UnionPay, the sanctioned person will not be able to use Visa or Mastercard bank cards, even those issued by Georgian banks, and will face restrictions on accessing bank assets and conducting transactions in Georgia itself. The painfulness of this measure for the Georgian authorities can be judged by the scandalous story of the imposition of in September 2023 against the “Georgian-Russian oligarch”, citizen of Georgia and General of the country . Shortly after the sanctions were imposed against him, the National Bank of Georgia denied Partskhaladze access to accounts and banking operations in the country. The next day, however, the bank’s acting president, Natia Turnava, single-handedly her decision under the alleged pressure from the then-leader of Georgian Dream. Top managers who disagreed with the decision resigned from the bank, and major Georgian commercial banks refused to obey the decision and continued to comply with the sanctions regime. Partskhaladze, in turn, with the assistance of the Georgian Ministry of Justice, expedited the transfer of his Georgian assets (12 properties, including land, residential and commercial premises, and the family church) , after which the Ministry revoked his Georgian citizenship to reduce sanctions risks for Georgia. It is difficult to assess the financial cost of sanctions, as each case is different. One year after the sanctions were imposed, Deripaska his losses at $7.5 billion, while Fridman recently $15.8 billion for the freezing of his assets in Luxembourg. *** Being under US sanctions has another very important consequence: huge majority of Western countries, including EU countries, Canada, the UK, South Korea, Japan and a number of others, are traditionally US allies. So we can expect them to share data on the activities of sanctioned individuals in their countries with their U.S. counterparts, and possibly seek to add those individuals to their own sanctions lists. Cases of lifting sanctions are isolated, such as the case of banker Oleg Tinkov, who his Russian citizenship, and are possible only when sanctioned individuals clearly distance themselves from the ruling party and go through complicated court procedures. Nevertheless, Georgian Dream seems to have decided that it had calculated all these risks well, and faced with the dilemma of refusing to adopt the law on “foreign agents” and being placed on the U.S. sanctions lists, it chose the latter, hoping to retain its power at the cost of into authoritarianism and Russia’s orbit. However, judging by the of the leaders of Georgian Dream to the position of Georgia’s strategic partners – the EU and the U.S., their comments on the Venice Commission’s remarks and against the European Commissioner Varhely, and other similar actions, the ruling party is calculating its moves by no more than one step ahead.

The ED and the CAPF personnel came under attack when the probe agency officials went to Shahjahan’s residence at Sandeshkhali in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district to conduct a raid. In the chargesheet filed at a Special PMLA in Kolkata, the ED has accused Shahjahan of collecting Rs 261 crore through illegal land grabbing in Sandeshkhali. On Monday, an ED counsel informed the court that so far the central agency officials have identified 180 bighas (59.5 acres) of land which was illegally grabbed by Shahjahan at Sandeshkhali. Besides Shahjahan, his brother Sheikh Alamgir and his close associates Didar Bux Molla and Siboprasad Hazra have been named as accused in the chargesheet. The ED has so far confiscated assets and property worth Rs 27 crore owned by Shahajahan. It has been learnt that the ED has provided details of the assets and property attached by its officials in the chargesheet filed on Monday. Sources aware of the development said that the chargesheet filed on Monday has been drafted in such a manner that it has become almost impossible for Shahjahan to get bail in the matter.",

        "content": "On Monday at 1:43 p.m. the National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch in effect until 9 p.m. for Berks, Bucks, Carbon, Chester, Delaware, Lehigh, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton and Philadelphia counties. Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To guarantee your safety in the midst of a thunderstorm, take into account the following recommendations: 1. Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors. 2. Indoors safety measures: Once you're indoors, avoid using corded phones, electrical devices, plumbing fixtures, and stay away from windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. 3. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors with no access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. While water and metal don't attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. When heavy rain sets in, the risk of flooding and hazardous driving conditions rises. Whether it's prolonged rainfall or rapid runoff, being prepared is essential. Here are some valuable safety tips from the weather service to ensure you stay safe in heavy rain: Beware of swollen waterways: During heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk. Maintain safe driving distances: Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness. Slow down and drive with care: On wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes. Prioritize visibility Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by turning on your headlights. Watch out for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them. Watch out for slippery roads: Be extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Heavy rain can overload the wiper blades. When visibility is so limited that the edges of the road or other vehicles cannot be seen at a safe distance, it is time to pull over and wait for the rain to ease up. It is best to stop at rest areas or other protected areas. When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

        "content": "On Monday at 1:43 p.m. the National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm warning in effect until 2:30 p.m. for Bradford and Susquehanna counties. Residents should be prepared for wind gusts of up to 60 mph. \"At 1:43 p.m., severe thunderstorms were located along a line extending from near Newark Valley to Herrickville, moving northeast at 25 mph,\" according to the weather service. \"Expect damage to roofs, siding, and trees.\" Locations impacted by the warning include Binghamton, Vestal, Johnson City, Endicott, Maine, Rush, Nanticoke, Port Dickinson, Whitney Point and Herrick. The weather service states, \"Remain alert for a possible tornado! Tornadoes can develop quickly from severe thunderstorms. If you spot a tornado go at once into the basement or small central room in a sturdy structure. For your protection move to an interior room on the lowest floor of a building.\" Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To ensure your safety during a thunderstorm, consider the following recommendations: 1. Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning. Stay vigilant by monitoring the sky for ominous signs and listening for the telltale sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's a clear indication of nearby lightning. Seek shelter promptly in a safe location, preferably indoors. 2. Indoors safety measures: Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. 3. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. Lightning can strike even when a storm has seemingly passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, which expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're with a group, ensure individuals are spread out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, vigilance and preparedness are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the chances of lightning-related accidents and prioritize your safety. Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall: Beware of swollen waterways: In heavy rain, refrain from parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a grave danger. Maintain safe driving distances: The two-second rule for following distance is your ally in heavy rain. Extend it to four seconds to ensure safe spacing in adverse conditions. Slow down and drive with care: On wet roads, reducing your speed is crucial. Ease off the gas pedal gradually and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stick to the middle lanes to minimize the risk of hydroplaning. Outer lanes are more prone to accumulating water. Prioritize visibility Turn on your headlights and be careful of other vehicles to the rear and in blind spot areas as they are especially difficult to see through rain-spattered windows. Watch out for slippery roads: The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely limits your sight, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or protected spots. When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. By following these safety measures, you can significantly reduce risks and ensure your well-being when heavy rain pours down. Stay informed about weather conditions and heed advice from local authorities to make your journey safe and sound.

        "content": "Delhi’s Tis Hazari Court on Monday dismissed the bail plea of Delhi Chief Minister’s aide Bibhav Kumar in connection with the alleged assault of Aam Aadmi Party MP Swati Maliwal. The court said that the investigation is at an initial stage and that the chances of influencing witnesses and tampering with evidence cannot be ruled out. Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sushil Anuj Tyagi said, “The investigation is still at the nascent stage and the apprehension of influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence cannot be ruled out. Keeping in view the allegations made against the applicant, at this stage, no ground for bail is made out.” “The allegations raised by the victim have to be taken on their face value and cannot be swiped away. The mere delay in registering the FIR would not have much impact on the case as the injuries are apparent in the MLC after four days. There seems to be no pre-meditation on the part of the victim as if it would have been so, then the FIR would have been registered on the same day,” ASJ Tyagi said in the order passed on May 27. The court while dismissing the bail plea noted that the victim is a sitting Member of Parliament from the Aam Aadmi Party and as per her allegations, she has been brutally beaten up at the CM’s house by the applicant. The applicant was present at the CM’s house even after his employment was terminated, the court further observed. The investigating agency has also reported that the applicant has formatted his mobile phone and has not provided the password for opening his mobile phone. The CCTV footage collected from the CM’s camp office is also stated to be blank, the court noted in the order. The judge said that it has come on record that the complainant was medically examined on May 16, 2024, at AIIMS Hospital. Her statement under section 164 CrPC was recorded by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. Her version as mentioned in the complaint finds corroboration from the MLC and her statement recorded under section 164 CrPC. The court stated that the applicant (Bibhav Kumar) was joined in the investigation, but as per the investigation officer, he did not cooperate in the investigation and was arrested to prevent him from tampering with crucial evidence. During the arguments, the counsel for the complainant argued that the victim is the sitting MP of the Aam Aadmi Party and earlier also, she has gone to meet the CM and she cannot be termed as a trespasser, rather it was the applicant/accused who was present in the CM office without any authority. It was further contended that no one reported the matter to the police from the CM office and it was the complainant who made the complaint to the police from the spot itself. It was also argued that the magnitude of the injuries was such that they were present even after four days when the medical examination was done. He contended that the complainant has an association with the CM since past nine years and she was brutally assaulted. She went to the police station but due to trauma, she did not lodge a complaint. It was further contended that the applicant made a complaint on May 17, 2024, at 3.34 pm through e-mail when the complainant had already reported the matter to the police. It was also contended that the complainant is receiving threats of death and rape through vulgar messages on social media. It was contended that the applicant is not simply a PA of CM but he is a very influential person with whom the complainant is apprehending danger. It is therefore prayed that bail cannot be granted to the applicant",

Lately they have certainly been stable, even if not that high. Despite the recent death of Iran’s president and the escalating war in Gaza, prices of Brent crude, the global benchmark, have stayed within $2 of $82 a barrel since the start of May. Part of the reason why OPEC is failing to keep prices high is because its members are failing to keep to their output targets. In March the group’s leaders and Russia extended production cuts, vowing a reduction of 2.2m barrels a day (b/d), or 2% of global supply, until the end of June, on top of 3.7m b/d of previously agreed cuts for 2024. Yet the cartel is now overproducing so much that its daily output in 2024 is little changed from the last quarter of 2023. This will create tensions when members get together to decide their strategy at OPEC ’s ministerial meeting on June 2nd.

Podcast By Tum Balogun Published: 13:48 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 14:30 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Chris Sutton believes that 'show pony' Antony has let Erik ten Hag down with his performances for Manchester United . The Brazilian, who had joined his old Ajax boss at Old Trafford for a £85.5million fee in 2022, managed only three goals and two assists in a dismal campaign that also saw him lose his place in the starting line-up. On Mail Sport's It's All Kicking Off! podcast, Sutton insisted that the Red Devils winger was the biggest underperformer of the 2023-24 season. '[Antony] actually made me look value for money,' the former Blues striker Sutton joked. 'For the outlay on him, in terms of goals and assists they just simply haven't been there. He is a show pony. That's what he is and I think he's let Erik ten Hag down.' However, Sutton's IAKO co-host Ian Ladyman disagreed and instead opted for Chelsea midfielder Moises Caicedo as his flop of the campaign. The 22-year-old was at the centre a high-profile tussle between Liverpool and Chelsea last summer before he eventually completed a move to Stamford Bridge for a British record £115million fee. Additionally, Sutton and Ladyman also revealed their choices for the biggest overachievers - which happened to involve two players with Chelsea connections.

        "description": "The Philadelphia 76ers are entering one of the most pivotal offseasons in franchise history.",
        "content": "The Philadelphia 76ers are entering one of the most pivotal offseasons in franchise history. They've yet to capitalize on the presence of Joel Embiid and are coming off another deflating early playoff exit. But they are flush with cap space and roster flexibility as they look to finally figure out the equation and try to win their first title since 1983. On Monday, The Ringer's Kevin O'Connor provided a glimpse into how Philadelphia plans to use its $55.5M in projected practical cap space this offseason, the second-most among teams. According to O'Connor, Philadelphia has \"a real chance of signing\" Clippers star Paul George this summer to form a “Big Three” with 2023 MVP Embiid and All-Star guard Tyrese Maxey. George played in 74 games this season, his most appearances since 2018-19, averaging 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.5 assists while shooting 47.1% from the floor and 41.3% from beyond the arc. George and the Clippers have been discussing a contract extension for some time. However, Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer recently reported that Los Angeles is \"unwilling to offer George more than the three-year, $152.3 million extension it gave to Kawhi Leonard,\" which could lead to the nine-time All-Star's departure in free agency. Despite the fact that George is 34 and would likely command a max contract from Philadelphia, there's no denying his two-way capabilities would make him an ideal fit alongside Embiid and Maxey. Philadelphia wouldn't have much leverage in negotiations, but it cannot afford to continue wasting the prime of Embiid's career. If the Sixers strike out in a potential George pursuit, they should have a number of alternative options to target. However, despite rumors of Philadelphia eyeing stars like LeBron James , DeMar DeRozan and OG Anunoby, O'Connor adds that New Orleans Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram would be its \"primary fallback plan.\" \"Aside from the pipe dream that Kevin Durant or Jimmy Butler would ask to be dealt directly to Philly, sources familiar with the Sixers’ thinking say that Brandon Ingram is the primary fallback plan,\" O'Connor wrote. \"Ingram would have to be acquired in a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans since he’s under contract for $36 million with a 15 percent trade kicker through the 2024-25 season.\" Ingram, a one-time All-Star, is expected to be on the move this offseason following another disappointing and injury-plagued season in New Orleans. The 26-year-old's struggles were heightened during the Pelicans' first-round playoff loss to Oklahoma City, during which he averaged 14.3 points while shooting 34.5% from the field and 25% from three-point range. Additionally, Ingram and Pelicans HC Willie Green \"had a minor exchange\" in the locker room during the team's Game 2 loss to the Thunder, per The Athletic's Shams Charania . While Ingram wouldn't be an ideal fit due to his injury concerns and inconsistent play, he's only under contract for next season, so Philadelphia wouldn't be mortgaging its future if it acquired him. Even so, Philadelphia might be better off bolstering its bench with the $36M it would have to pay Ingram next season.",

        "description": "U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Cohen told 'The West Block' host Mercedes Stephenson that Canada’s military spending lags plans from others amid a more hostile world stage.",
        "content": "Defence Minister Bill Blair maintains Canada remains committed to reaching NATO ‘s target of members spending two per cent of GDP on defence after the U.S. ambassador called Canada “the outlier” in the alliance due to not having a path to reach that target. In response to a question at the defence committee by Conservative defence critic James Bezan, Blair said initiatives in the recently published defence policy update and budget will increase military spending by 27 per cent next year. “It brings us much closer to that two per cent. The things I’ve articulated in these estimates, under the Strong, Secure, Engaged project and now in the new defence policy update, brings us to 1.76 (per cent of GDP),” Blair told the committee. The minister then added that initiatives laid out in the defence policy update are fully costed, while he continues to look into additional potential purchases of submarines and missile defence systems. Story continues below advertisement When talking about these future plans, Blair said he and his team are still researching these purchases before bringing a spending plan to cabinet for approval. The defence policy update lays out a roughly $8-billion increase in military spending over the next five years. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “We know that most of the funding in your (defence policy update) is backloaded for the future government, it’s not going to be for this government,” Bezan said at committee, before asking about plans to increase the military housing stock. Blair responded by saying that Canada has “doubled” defence spending since the Liberals took power in 2015 and criticized Bezan for voting against government spending efforts. 1:20 Canada has ‘work to do’ beyond defence policy update to meet military needs: Bill Blair In an interview with The West Block that aired Sunday, U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Cohen told host Mercedes Stephenson that Canada’s military spending lags plans from other allies aimed at facing a more hostile world stage. Story continues below advertisement “At the end of 2024, the way projections are looking, Canada will be the only country in NATO that is not spending at least two per cent of its GDP on defence and does not have a plan to get there,” Cohen said in that interview. “Canada has moved within NATO from being a bit of an outlier to being the outlier in the entire alliance.” This also followed a bipartisan letter last week signed by 23 American senators calling on Canada to establish a plan to reach the two per cent NATO target.

Earlier this month, Blair made his first official visit to the U.S. as defence minister, where he met with Defense Secretary Gen. Lloyd Austin. Blair told the committee that his impression is the Americans are “encouraged” by Canada’s plans to increase defence spending. “We acknowledged in our own defence policy update, we’re doing a great deal, we have more to do, we’re going to do more. But when you’re spending taxpayer dollars, you’ve got to do it right,” Blair said. Advertisement",

        "content": "YouTuber turned WWE superstar Logan Paul has revealed he planned his viral WWE Frog Splash drone shot for over a year. The 29-year-old wowed fans at on May 25 with his mind-blowing ‘Frog Splash,’ which was captured in a with a drone. However, a lot more went into the shot according to the YouTube star, who revealed he thought of the idea over a year ago. “I’ve been dreaming of that shot for a year,” , sharing a conversation with his boss back in May 2023 where he first suggested the stunt. “Wanted to run this idea by y’all as we approach our next two PLE’s... I pitched this for WrestleMania but apparently had some venue issues. I think there’s crazy cool opportunity to hire an FPV drone flyer to capture a high flying jump(s) of mine through the table or any crazy stunt,” ‘s text read. The Prime co-founder added: “Just another cool way to capture a frog splash that has never been done before. Creatively pushing media boundaries.” It’s fair to say fans were impressed by the stunt. “Logan wrestles like he’s a veteran it’s wild how good he is,” one commented. “Now that’s great camera work. What a shot,” another praised. One fan even went as far as to say the drone shot is the “future of the .” Although he may be one of the most despised wrestlers in the WWE, has quickly made a name for himself, and even landed himself a belt .",

        "content": "Lagos State Government said a total of 3,748 youths have benefited from creative skill training carried out by it in the last year in partnership with film industries, including Del-York Film Academy, GIDI Creative Academy, Ebony Life Creative Academy, and African Film Academy. The State Commissioner for Tourism, Arts, and Culture, Mrs Toke Benson-Awoyinka, disclosed this during the ongoing ministerial press briefing, which took place at Bagauda Kalto Press Centre, Alausa, Ikeja, to mark the first year of the second term in office of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The commissioner said the gesture by the government was informed by the need to bridge the identified skill gap in the creative sector and to position residents of the state who were in the creative field to compete globally with their contemporaries in film production. “The state government is currently in partnership with four different creative academies to enhance the capacities of young creative practitioners in Lagos State. “As of today, 3,748 Lagos youths have benefited from the training. The academies, in partnership with the state government, for this training programme are Del-York Film Academy, GIDI Creative Academy, Ebony Life Creative Academy, and African Film Academy. “This gesture by the government is informed by the need to bridge the identified skill gap in the creative sector and to position residents of the state who are in the creative field to compete globally with their contemporaries when it comes to film production,” the commissioner stated. Benson-Awoyinka noted the testimonials of the beneficiaries were, however, very encouraging, stressing that the training and capacity building was at no cost to the participants. This was just as she further disclosed that Governor Sanwo-Olu had further approved the training of over 5,000 young men and women to run for the next three years. “The testimonials of the beneficiaries are very encouraging. It should be stressed that this training and capacity building, which ordinarily would have cost the beneficiaries several millions of naira, is at no cost to the participants. “I am pleased to announce that Mr Governor has further approved the training of over 5,000 young men and women to run for the next three years,” Benson-Awoyinka said. Speaking further, the commissioner said her ministry, being in charge of managing all museums and monuments erected by the state government, had restored and reerected a bronze statue of the late MKO Abiola at Opebi Sheraton Junction and repaired the damaged artwork (the sekere dancing drum) at Old Toll Gate, Lagos. “Apart from the above, the ministry is expected to deliver the ongoing construction of the late Alhaji Lateef Jakande’s statue before the end of next month, June 2024. “Also, the ministry is reconstructing and redeveloping the Agia Tree Cenotaph in Badagry, a historical monument to the first place Christianity was preached in Nigeria,” she revealed.

        "content": "The management of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo town in Oyo State on Monday, declared a three-day mourning period with fasting and prayers over the death a student, Akor Alex who was killed by his colleagues on Friday. Alex, a 22-year-old 200-level Mechanical Engineering student was killed in the hostel by his colleagues for allegedly stealing a phone. The Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Professor Timothy Adebayo disclosed this while addressing journalists at the Council Chamber of the school in company of other principal officers of the faith-based university. “I sympathise with the family. We don’t pray for such to happen. We are sad over the development. The university has declared a three-way mourning starting from Wednesday to Friday, with fasting and prayer every night against a recurrence such as a sad incident. In those days, it is lecture-free to mourn the departed student,” Prof Adebayo said. The Vice-Chancellor also disclosed that he wept for two days over the incident. He said, ”As the vice chancellor, I wept throughout Sunday and Monday. Even while conveying the message to the staff, I wept. I didn’t know I would be able to address this press conference. Adebayo also disclosed that 16 persons were already in police custody over the incident. “Twelve students are in the police net over Ajayi Crowther varsity’s student killing. Eighteen (18) were initially apprehended but the Police screened them to 12, including a porter who was taken to Iyaganku Police Station, Ibadan,” he said. The deputy vice-chancellor, Professor Muyiwa Popoola, also confirmed the VC’s statement, saying: “We wept bitterly.” He also reiterated the university’s stance against cultism and bullying, saying: “We have learnt our lessons in a hard way. We have zero tolerance for bullying, and cultism. There is no cultism. We have worked in different schools, cultists need bushes to operate. “There is no sign of cultism and bullying here. There are no bushes here. Cultists need bushes to operate. We always ask our students not to stay alone and in obscure places. We rusticate anyone involved in bullying.” The VC further added that security had been beefed up to guide against a recurrence of the incident. He said, “We have a monitoring team that moves around. We have a security team. The Management moves round to check that things are in order to ensure that students comply with the mechanism put in place. “We will increase the number of security operatives and porters. We will keep on beefing up security in our hostels. We will work on every other aspect of observed inadequacies,” Prof. Adebayo said. He further assured that the Ajayi Crowther University is safe, saying, “We raise students with Godly characters. We are telling the parents now that their children are in safe hands here.”",

        "content": "(CNS): A Caymanian woman who worked for a floor covering company has admitted stealing $42,000 from her former employer, Randolph Stanford, using over a dozen forged cheques between November 2021 and March 2022. Samantha Angella McLaughlin has pleaded guilty to 16 charges of theft and forgery and has been bailed until an expected sentencing hearing in July. McLaughlin appeared in Grand Court on Friday and admitted a long list of charges. The crown had accepted a dispute over one cheque she allegedly forged, which reduced the original amount of the theft from $49,000 to $42,000. The court ordered a social inquiry report, and McLaughlin was bailed to appear for her sentencing hearing on 26 July.",

        "content": "The NHL has levied yet another supplemental discipline penalty against New York Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba. This time, the light slap on the wrist was for his blatant elbow attempt on Florida Panthers forward Evan Rodrigues in the second period of Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Final Sunday night. The NHL issued the maximum fine of $5000 Monday afternoon. Trouba, who has delivered more chicken wings than Buffalo’s Anchor Bar, lunged at Rodrigues with his elbow clearly extended in an effort to make high contact with the former Pittsburgh Penguins forward . Rodrigues saw Trouba and narrowly avoided the worst of the collision, though Trouba did connect with some parts of Rodrigues’s neck and back shoulder. Rodrigues had to briefly leave the game after falling to the ice. Slo-mo of Jacob Trouba’s elbow on Evan Rodrigues pic.twitter.com/2OZVW3FQf4 — Brady Trettenero (@BradyTrett) May 26, 2024 It is the third time this season that Trouba has received extra discipline from the league. On Nov. 25, he was fined $5000 for high-sticking Boston Bruins forward Trent Frederic . He was also suspended for two games on Jan. 26 for elbowing Vegas Golden Knights rookie Pavel Dorofeyev. The suspension cost him over $83,000. However, all fines are paid to the Players’ Emergency Assistance Fund Trouba, who has delivered and attempted to deliver more headshots than a Hollywood talent agency, also famously delivered an “accidental” elbow to Penguins’ captain Sidney Crosby while the Penguins led what could have been a series-deciding Game 5 in Round One in 2022. Crosby was concussed, and the Rangers rallied to win the game and the series. In Round One, Trouba tried to elbow Carolina Hurricanes Martin Necas, who deftly ducked under Trouba as the defender launched himself face-first toward the boards.

        "description": "At UCLA, Walton was a three-time National Player of the Year. In the NBA, he won the MVP in the 1977-78 season, and was a two-time champion.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. This story will be updated.",

(AP Photo/Michael Owen Baker) JUSTICEPHOTO.COM Bill Walton at ROTH Conference Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. This story will be updated.",

        "content": "Novak Djokovic was seen walking out of Rafael Nadal’s French Open match against Alexander Zverev on Monday after just the second set. Djokovic was among a number of famous faces on Philippe-Chatrier to see Nadal play Roland-Garros for possibly the last time before he hangs up his racket . The world No.1 Serbian was pictured in the crowd, while fellow tennis stars Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were also in attendance, as was Manchester City’s Rodri. The atmosphere on Philippe-Chatrier was electric with almost everyone there passionately supporting Nadal, who has won 14 French Open men’s singles titles. It was a stark contrast to the hostile reception Djokovic got at last year’s Wimbledon final, with the Serbian loudly booed and goading spectators . Like Nadal and the French Open, Djokovic has become almost synonymous with Wimbledon due to his dominance at the grass-court Grand Slam. But he does not seem to be as loved as his fellow tennis legend and it is possible that Djokovic grew tired with the Nadal love-in as he decided to leave the court. Djokovic is watching too ð #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/vcJAaWQIf9 ‘Djokovic and Swiatek left after the 2nd set,’ @josemorgado posted on X. ‘But Carlos Alcaraz is still here on Chatrier with his dad and agent.’ Djokovic plays his first-round match at the French Open on Tuesday as he faces French wildcard Pierre-Hugues Herbert. The 24-time Grand Slam champion hasn’t been in the best form in the build-up to Roland-Garros and has been coy about his chances of defending his title.

You know, I almost feel a bit embarrassed to say what my expectations are. ‘You know, anything but a title for me is not satisfactory, you know. So it always has been like that. I know, you know, it might sound arrogant to a lot of people, but I think I have the career that backs it up. ‘In a way, me playing still at this highest level, one of the major reasons is trying to write more history of the sport and win the biggest titles that, you know, Paris is definitely one of them. So that’s why my hopes and goals are always the same, but I have to lower the expectations.’ MORE : Rafael Nadal suffers French Open first-round heartbreak to controversial rival MORE : Enzo Maresca and Kieran McKenna show clubs promoted to Premier League face fight to keep managers MORE : Andy Murray proud of French Open legacy despite ‘issue’ with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic",

        "content": "Report Sparks fly in the damp to maintain unbeaten run against winless Diamonds Eve Jones seals 11-over chase with nerveless 26 not out to make it three from three ECB Reporters Network 27-May-2024 • 1 hr ago Eve Jones flays through the off side • Getty Images Central Sparks 81 for 7 (E Jones 26\", Slater 2-10) beat Northern Diamonds 80 for 9 (Burns 30, Potts 3-15) by three wickets Central Sparks made it three wins from three in the Charlotte Edwards Cup with a three-wicket victory from the final ball over winless Northern Diamonds in a rain-reduced match at Headingley. Despite losing wickets with regularity, Diamonds posted a competitive target of 81 from 11 overs thanks largely to Erin Burns ' impressive 30. And the hosts looked set to clinch their first win but Sparks captain Eve Jones' nerveless unbeaten 26 saw her side home, with Georgia Davis striking two from the final delivery to clinch the victory. Heavy rain in the morning followed by frequent short showers delayed the start from the scheduled 2.30pm, with play eventually getting under way at 4.45pm and the match reduced to 11 overs-a-side. After winning the toss, Sparks were straight into their stride with the ball, taking wickets in each of the first four overs. Leah Dobson and Lauren Winfield-Hill were caught for a duck and five respectively looking for early momentum before Em Arlott claimed her second wicket by having Hollie Armitage caught behind for nought. Katie George bowled Bess Heath for three to leave Diamonds 23 for four in the fourth over. Erin Burns injected life into the innings with three early boundaries and Sterre Kalis started well to lift Diamonds to 44 for four after six overs. Davis had Kalis stumped for 17 and bowled Emma Marlow for seven but Burns continued to be aggressive in playing a lone hand for Diamonds. Her dismissal on 30, well held by Arlott running in from the deep off the bowling of Grace Potts, was key for Sparks. Grace Hall and Katie Levick came and went quickly but Katherine Fraser delivered late momentum with a four and a six from the final two balls to post 80 for nine. Davis claimed three for 23. Sparks started their chase strongly, easing to 16 without loss after two overs. Levick's introduction brought the breakthrough as Chloe Brewer was trapped lbw for 14. Rachel Slater then piled the pressure on Sparks with two wickets in the fourth over, bowling Perrin for five and having Abbey Freeborn stumped for six to leave Sparks 26 for three. Courtney Webb's dismissal by Burns for two in the next over had Diamonds on top and then Dobson claimed a brilliant boundary catch off Hall to remove George for nine, leaving Sparks 44 for five, needing another 37 from four overs. Sparks captain Eve Jones, who was dropped on four by Grace Hall, set about eating into that target as 13 runs came from the ninth over, leaving 15 required from the final two. Burns caught and bowled Charis Pavely for five and Sparks needed five from the final over, bowled by Levick. Arlott fell and new batter Davis needed two from the final ball, which she achieved with a chip down the ground to make it three wins from three for Sparks.

With his future at the club beyond June 2025 now uncertain, have reported that the Citizens have earmarked Girona boss Michel as the man to replace their current manager. It has been suggested that the Sky Blues' hierarchy admire the LALIGA coach's tactical prowess, as well as his ability to nurture young talent. It is believed they feel those characteristics are key to helping the club maintain what Guardiola has already put in place. Michel took over at Girona in 2021, and guided them to promotion from the Spanish second tier in his first season. The following campaign, the side finished 10th in LALIGA with 49 points. Most recently, in the 2023/24 season, he led them to a third-place finish with 81 points, four behind Barcelona and 14 behind eventual league winners Real Madrid. While the 48-year-old has reportedly caught the eye of those at the Etihad, there are other candidates who have been shortlisted as potential Guardiola replacements, with the list believed to also include former Brighton & Hove Albion boss Roberto De Zerbi, Germany's Julian Nagelsmann, and Bayer Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso.",

        "description": "Former Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder Linda Buthelezi says the club’s recent success proved that money can buy love.",
        "content": "On Saturday, Sundowns finally got their hands of the DStv Premiership title, making it seven straight season as champions and 14 since the inception of the Premier Soccer League in 1996. The 1-0 loss to Cape Town City at Loftus Versfeld on the weekend was coach Rulani Mokwena's first-ever league defeat this season and also ended the team's hopes of finishing the league campaign unbeaten. Prior to the defeat to the Eric Tinkler's men, Sundowns last experienced a defeat in a league match against Tshwane rivals SuperSport United in 2022. \"Sundowns is forever on our lips because they've done a lot of great things, which we are happy to see,\" Buthelezi tells \"What Patrice Motsepe wanted is becoming a reality. First of all, for me, it proves money can buy love. \"That shows with the way Sundowns have been making us as former players happy. \"It's nice to see the boys winning and at the same time making money. The boys proved that the sky is the limit if a club owner respects his players. \"There are club owners that don't respect their players, hence they are not progressing. \"We must thank Patrice Motsepe for turning Sundowns into what it is today. They had a great season Sundowns, they also did well in continental football this season. \"Fatigue is what prevented them from reaching the CAF Champions League final, it was my wish to see them playing in the final.\"",

        "content": "The RAF has grounded a fleet of Spitfire planes after the death of a pilot over the weekend, raising the prospect of the legendary aircraft being absent from the 80th anniversary of the D-day landings next month. Sqn Ldr Mark Long – a Typhoon pilot based at RAF Coningsby – was killed in a crash while flying a Spitfire belonging to the Battle of Britain Memorial Fleet as part of a memorial event. He had been a pilot with the BBMF for the last four years and had been due to take over the event next year. “Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight,” an RAF spokesperson said. The air force announcement raises questions about the legendary single-seat fighter aircraft’s participation in the D-day celebrations. They were due to take part in a national commemorative event in Portsmouth on 5 June to mark 80 years since Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy in northern France, turning the tide of the second world war away from Nazi Germany. It is not known when the RAF’s investigation will be complete or when a decision will be made on whether the vintage planes will fly again. King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales will join world leaders – including Joe Biden, the US president, Emmanual Macron, the French president, and Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor – in Normandy for the memorial celebrations. Sign up to First Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The BBMF is a collection of wartime fighter and bomber aircraft that take part in air shows and memorial displays. A few dozen airworthy Spitfires remain, including six based at RAF Coningsby. Paying tribute to Long, Gp Capt Robbie Lees, commander of the Display Air Wing, said on Sunday: “It is with great sorrow that I must confirm the death of Sqn Ldr Mark Long. “Mark was a Typhoon pilot here at RAF Coningsby and for the last four years he has been a pilot with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. A great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator, he will be sorely missed by all who knew him.” “An investigation into the cause of this tragic event has now begun.” The Prince and Princess of Wales led tributes to Long, writing on social media: “Our thoughts ... are with the pilot’s loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family. W & C.”",

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked preprint trusted source proofread by Laurence Tognetti, Universe Today How can sunlight reflecting off SpaceX's Starlink satellites interfere with ground-based operations? This is what a study recently posted to the arXiv preprint server hopes to address as a pair of researchers investigate how Starlink satellites appear brighter—which the researchers also refer to as flaring—to observers on Earth when the sun is at certain angles, along with discussing past incidents of how this brightness has influenced aerial operations on Earth. This study holds the potential to help spacecraft manufacturers design and develop specific methods to prevent increased brightness levels, which would help alleviate confusion for observers on Earth regarding the source of the brightness and the objects in question. Here, Universe Today discusses this research with Anthony Mallama of the IAU—Center for the Protection of Dark and Quiet Skies from Satellite Constellation Interference regarding the motivation behind the study, significant results, potential follow-up studies, importance of studying Starlink satellite brightness, and implications for managing satellite constellations in the future. So, what was the motivation behind this study? \"I study the brightness of Starlink satellites under all circumstances,\" Mallama tells Universe Today. \"That includes their operational phase at 550 km [342 mi] altitude, when they are rising from the initial orbit around 300 km [186 mi] to operation height, ordinary flares which occur frequently but have small amplitudes and these extreme flares.\" For the study, the researchers conducted a geometrical analysis of the brightness of Starlink satellites based on the sun's location and angle in the sky. This comes despite SpaceX taking steps to mitigate reflectivity off Starlink satellites, which only decreases reflectivity when the satellites are directly overhead. The study also discussed how reflectivity from Starlink satellites has affected aerial operations, specifically with commercial airline pilots. What were the most significant results from this study? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"This study demonstrated that Starlinks can be exceedingly bright under certain conditions. In one instance they were reported as Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon (UAP) by pilots on two commercial aircraft.\" Regarding potential follow-up studies, Mallama tells Universe Today, \"I am characterizing the brightness of other satellite constellations including Amazon's Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile's BlueWalker/BlueBirds and Planet's Pelicans.\" The study mentions how the UAP incidents occurred in 2022 and was recently discussed in Buettner et al (2024) with the pilots' reporting brightness magnitudes (also called stellar magnitude or apparent magnitude) of -4 to -5. For context, a stellar magnitude of -5 is equivalent to the planet Venus at its brightest, which is known for being observed before sunrise or after sunset periodically throughout the year. The apparent magnitude scale ranges from -30 to 30 with higher numbers corresponding to decreasing brightness. Buettner et al (2024) was recently presented at the 4th IAA Conference on Space Situational Awareness ( ICSSA ). That paper discussed how the incident occurred on August 10, 2022, and was observed by five pilots aboard two separate commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean, which resulted in two photographs obtained by the pilot's cell phones. After analyzing a series of simulations and additional data, the researchers determined these UAPs were Starlink satellites launched earlier that day, which were designated as Starlink Group 4-26. Given this incident, what is the importance of studying Starlink brightness/flaring? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"The importance of studying Starlink brightness is that the satellites interfere with astronomical research if they are brighter than magnitude 7. Furthermore, casual sky watchers, such as amateur astronomers and naturalists, are distracted by those brighter than magnitude 6 because they are visible to the unaided eye.\" This study comes as SpaceX's Starlink constellation continues to grow on a regular basis, with the number of current Starlink satellites in orbit having reached more than 5,600 with almost 6,000 having been launched by SpaceX as of this writing. As noted by both the study and Mallama, sunlight reflectivity off Starlink satellites causes issues with both aerial operations on Earth and astronomical observing, with Mallama also conducting research on satellite constellation brightness for Amazon, AST SpaceMobile, and Planet Labs. Therefore, with the number of satellites in orbit rapidly increasing due to constellations, what implications could this study have on managing satellite constellations in the future? Mallama tells Universe Today, \"One approach to reducing satellite brightness is to reflect sunlight into space rather than allowing it to scatter diffusively toward observers on the ground. That works very well most of the time. However, there are certain sun-satellite-observer geometries where it fails and observers see a mirror-like reflection of the sun.\" Mallam published a 2023 article with Sky & Telescope discussing how SpaceX's second-generation of Starlink satellites are fainter than their predecessors. Mallama credits his co-author, Richard Cole, as playing a \"crucial role\" in this study, noting how Cole \"predicted the extreme flares based on his numerical model of Starlink satellite brightness.\" How will sunlight reflectivity off Starlink satellites influence ground operations in the coming years and decades, and what steps can be taken to mitigate this activity? Only time will tell. More information: Anthony Mallama et al, Extreme Flaring of Starlink Satellites, arXiv (2024).

        "content": "U.Today - Veteran Trader Peter Brandt recently shared insights into his trading strategy, highlighting four trades he is currently involved in, including Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved applications to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the price of Ethereum in the past week, potentially clearing the way for the products to begin trading later this year. Ethereum rose over the weekend, buoyed by increased optimism following the approval of U.S. Ethereum ETF applications. At the time of writing, ETH was up 2.38% in the previous 24 hours to $3,905, having reached a high of $3,950. Brandt's strategy is rooted in classical charting principles, a methodology he has honed over his 40-year trading career. As a swing trader who meticulously draws lines on charts to identify and act on pattern breakouts, Brandt has disclosed that he is currently long on ETH on the spot market. Swing trading is a strategy that aims to capture gains in a financial instrument within an intermediate time frame, which can range from days to weeks. Brandt's approach to swing trading involves a thorough analysis of price charts to identify critical support and resistance levels and use trend lines to predict probable breakouts or breakdowns in patterns. Brandt primarily uses technical analysis to find potential entry and exit points, as well as defined chart patterns. In his recent tweet, Brandt posted an Ethereum chart highlighting a breakout with a target of $4,083. Brandt's current position — being long on ETH — indicates his expectation that the price of Ethereum might rise. This stance seems to have been informed by his analysis of Ethereum's price movements and broader market trends. Despite having a 55% hit rate in his trades, Brandt never overlooks the importance of risk management, frequently emphasizing the use of stop-loss orders. This disciplined approach ensures that even if the market moves against his position, the loss will be contained within an acceptable range. This article was originally published on U.Today",

        "content": "MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbekistan leader Shavkat Mirziyoyev held talks on Monday and signed a number of agreements aimed at deepening bilateral relations, including one that envisions Moscow building a small nuclear power plant in the Central Asian country. Mirziyoyev hailed the project as ''vital'' in a statement relayed through his press service after the talks, noting that Uzbekistan has ''its own large reserves of uranium.'' Putin, in turn, vowed to ''do everything in order to work effectively on Uzbekistan's (nuclear energy) market.'' If the agreement is implemented, the plant will become the first in Central Asia, further increasing Russia's influence in the region. Putin also promised to increase gas deliveries to Uzbekistan. The talks between Putin and Mirziyoyev took place in the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, where the Russian leader traveled on Sunday in his third foreign trip since being inaugurated for a fifth presidential term earlier this month. He first went to China, where he expressed appreciation for China's proposals for talks to end the Ukraine conflict, and later to Belarus where Russia has deployed tactical nuclear weapons. The trips reflect the Kremlin's ongoing effort to shore up support amid unabating tensions with the West over the conflict in Ukraine.",

        "content": "Home Improvement fans who were wondering why the popular series ended after eight seasons may finally be getting an answer, after star Patricia Richardson revealed she wanted out and demanded a higher salary to get her way. The series ended its run on ABC in 1999, and since then, the cast has managed to see their careers take different paths, with Zachery Ty Bryan, who portrayed son Brad Taylor, making headlines after not only interesting investments but also legal troubles like fraud, domestic violence and DUI. However, Richardson, who has steadily worked in a series of guest arcs on television shows and in movies, has stayed quiet–but is now revealing the way she forced the show’s hand. Zachary Ty Bryan's history of domestic vioence and fraud before DUI arrest Zachery Ty Bryan has huge net worth after jumping on surprising investment trend Speaking in a new interview, she revealed she wanted out of the show, and couldn’t be persuaded otherwise. As such, she used the large pay gap between her and costar Tim Allen to her advantage. “I told everybody, ‘There’s not enough money in the world to get me to do a ninth year,’” she told the Los Angeles Times . “This show is over. It needs to end.” She shared she was offered $1 million per episode to Allen’s $2 million per episode for a 25-episode ninth season a few months before production was set to end on the show’s eighth season. Richardson rejected the deal because she wanted more time with her family, going back to the network with a counter-offer that she receive the same money as Allen and get an executive producer credit. “I knew that Disney would in no way pay me that much,” she said. “That was my way to say ‘no’ and was a little bit of a flip-off to Disney. I’d been there all this time, and they never even paid me a third of what Tim was making, and I was working my a– off. I was a big reason why women were watching. Don't miss: Home Improvement star Zachery Ty Bryan charged with felony DUI [LATEST] The Big Bang Theory cast's biggest roles since leaving CBS show [UPDATE] Friends cast breaks silence on Matthew Perry's tragic death in joint tribute [INSIGHT] Richardson shared that since the proposal was rejected and she refused the other offer, the show came to its ultimate end. Salary negotiations since have proven to be a success for casts who banded together to demand more. The cast of Friends famously negotiated a salary increase together for the final two seasons of the show, earning $1 million each. The cast of The Big Bang Theory did a similar deal for the original five cast members–Kaley Cuoco, Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar years later. They successfully renegotiated a second time to take pay cuts in order to get Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch new contracts, with all seven stars then being paid equally.",

After marking an emphatic victory over the Pat Cummins-led SRH, KKR became the second-most successful franchise in the history of the IPL by clinching their third-ever title. During an interaction with the KKR media team, Russell was asked the viral question back from his Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) side, Duronto Dhaka's triumph in the 2023 season -\" Final match your perform what happening?\". The video became an instant hit amongst cricket fans around the world in no time. In a video uploaded by KKR's social media handles, the side's media personnel went around the team's stars like Sunil Narine and Russel about their experience of winning the IPL 2024 title. At the end of the video, the two were asked the viral question, which left them comically surprised. In the video from BPL 2023, Russell was left troubled about understanding the question from the interviewer, and that ultimately went on to become a widely used meme all over social media.

However, this was a first IPL final for the 36-year-old, after having missed out on the IPL 2014 final for his side due to an injury.

        "description": "Like most people, you may not have given the shape of the soda can a second thought. It turns out there's advanced engineering behind this design.",
        "content": "When it comes to beverage fun facts, perhaps you're familiar with , but do you know why it comes in cylindrical cans? Determining how the packaging was designed for a product is something most consumers probably don't deeply consider. After all, most people who enjoy soda today have never experienced a world in which this package wasn't the primary option (an outcome perhaps in part thanks to ). The soda can's development was in part inspired by why other shapes weren't up for the job. The two other main options — spheres and cuboids (or circles and squares, from a 2D perspective) — each had enough downsides that they were ruled out. Enter the cylinder, which had some of the same strengths as the other two options, along with it's own upsides. For those engineers ideating on how to best sell and serve soda, there seems to have been an evaluation of those three main entries, and understanding how they arrived at the iconic can shape is a little bit of an engineering Goldilocks tale. Considerations and contenders There are many considerations when creating food packaging. From preservation of quality, to convenience (both for producer and consumer), economics of transportation, ease of sale, and of course, aesthetics. The considerations for soda also include the pressure of carbonation (which is different from, say, juice or water). The sphere had some benefits in terms of even distribution of pressure, and a lot less susceptibility to damage thanks to the fact that there were no corners or edges. It also used the least amount of material, which would be good news for the bottom line (making them also lighter and less expensive to transport). The bad news? Well, for one thing, a sphere of liquid isn't going to sit still on the table when you set it down, or stack up beautifully for a grocery store display. Additionally, when filling a shipping box with balls, there's an awful lot of wasted space in between (almost a full 1⁄4 of the box's volume). On the opposite end of the spectrum, consider the cuboid, which can't be beat in terms of packaging (there is literally zero wasted space, as they can stack neatly like building blocks). They're also not going anywhere when you set them down on a table or a store shelf, because the bottom is conveniently flat and stable. Unfortunately, corners, protrusions, and edges are subject to vulnerability. So, another no-go. The clear winner The cylinder? Now that was just right for soda — a hybrid model between the sphere and the cuboid. It reached a happy medium in terms of its ability to be stacked and also packed more efficiently (only about 10% of a shipping package of cylinders will be empty), and lacked the severe vulnerability of the edgy cuboid. Another consideration was ease of production, and in that respect, the cylinder was a clear winner in its quick and innovative process. Of course, there are so many additional awe-inspiring decisions that make the can we know today. It needed a lining that can stand up to carbonic acid (which could corrode the inside walls), the pull-tab that makes it simple for us to open without an extra tool, and the seam that keeps the whole thing stitched together. Soda can engineers didn't rest on their laurels either, they've continued to innovate, improve, and streamline (which is part of ) as technology has become available. The vessel as we know it today is the result of evaluation and compromise, ingenuity and evolution.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

        "content": "U.Today - Veteran Trader Peter Brandt recently shared insights into his trading strategy, highlighting four trades he is currently involved in, including Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved applications to list exchange-traded funds (ETFs) linked to the price of Ethereum in the past week, potentially clearing the way for the products to begin trading later this year. Ethereum rose over the weekend, buoyed by increased optimism following the approval of U.S. Ethereum ETF applications. At the time of writing, ETH was up 2.38% in the previous 24 hours to $3,905, having reached a high of $3,950. Brandt's strategy is rooted in classical charting principles, a methodology he has honed over his 40-year trading career. As a swing trader who meticulously draws lines on charts to identify and act on pattern breakouts, Brandt has disclosed that he is currently long on ETH on the spot market. Swing trading is a strategy that aims to capture gains in a financial instrument within an intermediate time frame, which can range from days to weeks. Brandt's approach to swing trading involves a thorough analysis of price charts to identify critical support and resistance levels and use trend lines to predict probable breakouts or breakdowns in patterns. Brandt primarily uses technical analysis to find potential entry and exit points, as well as defined chart patterns. In his recent tweet, Brandt posted an Ethereum chart highlighting a breakout with a target of $4,083. Brandt's current position — being long on ETH — indicates his expectation that the price of Ethereum might rise. This stance seems to have been informed by his analysis of Ethereum's price movements and broader market trends. Despite having a 55% hit rate in his trades, Brandt never overlooks the importance of risk management, frequently emphasizing the use of stop-loss orders. This disciplined approach ensures that even if the market moves against his position, the loss will be contained within an acceptable range. This content was originally published on U.Today",

        "content": "U.Today - Michael Saylor, the head of MicroStrategy and a well-known advocate for Bitcoin , recently highlighted a significant milestone in the cryptocurrency world. According to Saylor, spot Bitcoin ETFs now collectively hold approximately 1 Nakamoto of Bitcoin, a symbolic reference to 1 million BTC. This milestone was reached just over four months after the inception of Bitcoin ETFs on Jan. 10 this year. Thus, more than four months later, the volume of accumulated Bitcoin issuers has exceeded the 1 million BTC mark. It is that mark that Saylor referred to as 1 Nakamoto. The fact is that, according to unconfirmed data, Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious creator of Bitcoin, holds more than 1 million BTC in thousands of his wallets. However, there is no more precise data, but this symbolic mark was enough for Saylor to call it 1 Nakamoto. The top three Bitcoin holders among ETF issuers were BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) with 287,168 BTC, Fidelity with 161,538 BTC and ARK Invest with 48,503 BTC. As for Saylor and MicroStrategy itself, the company now has 214,400 BTC worth $14.66 billion on its balance sheet, according to the latest data. The average buying price is $35,180, which brings the profit of Saylor and MicroStrategy to 94.43%, or $7.12 billion. This milestone of reaching \"1 Nakamoto\" underscores the growing influence of Bitcoin ETFs and the increasing institutional adoption of the main cryptocurrency. As Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream acceptance, the accumulation of BTC by ETFs and major companies like MicroStrategy signals an interesting future for the digital asset.

The extension will consist of three new classrooms to provide a special class for children with special needs, two special education rooms for one-to-one teaching or group working and three general classrooms. Welcoming the announcement from the Department of Education, Donegal minister, Charlie McConalogue said: “This is great news for the Twin Towns, and for the staff, students and parents of Finn Valley College. “I’d like to acknowledge the efforts of Minister Norma Foley in relation to getting the extension to construction stage and thank Cllr Patrick McGowan for his ongoing work with this project.” Minister McConalogue also welcomed confirmation from the Department of Education that it has granted approval for the reconfiguration of an existing classroom to be used as a science lab and prep area at Crana College in Buncrana to go to tender. “Cllr Rena Donaghy and local election candidate, Fionán Bradley have been to the fore in helping advance this application. “They are also giving strong support towards the delivery of the three-school campus at Crana College,” the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine added.",
