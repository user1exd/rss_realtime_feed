        "content": "Netanyahu acknowledges 'tragic mistake' after Rafah strike kills dozens of Palestinians TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged that a “tragic mistake” was made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians. Local officials say at least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike. It only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel’s military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. At least 21 dead in Memorial Day weekend storms that devastated several US states A series of powerful storms in the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend has killed at least 21 people as they left a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The destructive storms caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coat later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Biden says each generation has to 'earn' freedom, in solemn Memorial Day remarks WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is marking Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden says each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. Says Biden: “Freedom has never been guaranteed. Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. North Korean rocket carrying its 2nd spy satellite explodes in mid-air SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea says its attempt to put another spy satellite into orbit has failed. North Korea’s state media say a rocket carrying the spy satellite exploded midair on Monday evening. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. At least 2,000 feared dead in Papua New Guinea landslide. These are some challenges rescuers face BANGKOK (AP) — The Papua New Guinea government said more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive in a landslide in the South Pacific island nation. The disaster struck after the side of a mountain came down in the early hours of Friday morning when the village of Yambali was asleep. The settlement is located in a restive and remote area in the interior of the poor, rural nation off the northern coast of Australia, making search and rescue efforts complicated and hazardous. Relations between EU and Israel plummet as Spain, Ireland prepare to recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel are in a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. The EU’s foreign policy chief has thrown his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including Hamas leaders. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance.",

        "content": "By: PTI Geneva May 28, 2024 00:30 IST Follow Us Facebook Twitter whatsapp World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday referred to the Global Traditional Medicine Centre set up in India and the first global summit on traditional medicine hosted by the country as he underlined that the year 2023 was a productive one in the UN health agency's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We also established the Global Traditional Medicine Centre in India, and hosted the first global summit on traditional medicine,\" Ghebreyesus said in his remarks as he presented his report to the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva. In March 2022, the Government of India and the UN health agency had signed an agreement to establish the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine. This global knowledge centre for traditional medicine, supported by an investment of USD 250 million from India, aims to harness the potential of traditional medicine from across the world through modern science and technology to improve the health of people and the planet, the UN health agency had said in a press release at the time. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said the agreement between the Ministry of Ayush and WHO to establish the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) - world's first - at Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a commendable initiative. He laid the foundation stone of WHO-GCTM in Jamnagar in April 2022. Speaking on the occasion, Modi had said that the WHO-GCTM is recognition of India's contribution and potential in this field. \"India's traditional medicine system is not limited only to treatment. It is a holistic science of life. India takes this partnership as a huge responsibility for serving the entire humanity.” WHO had convened the Traditional Medicine Global Summit in August last year in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. The summit was co-hosted by India, which held the G20 presidency in 2023. It was held alongside the G20 Health Ministerial meeting. The summit explored the role of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine in addressing pressing health challenges and driving progress in global health and sustainable development. Ghebreyesus had arrived in Gujarat to attend the global summit on traditional medicine and was accorded a warm welcome. Praising India for its \"rich history\" of traditional medicine like Ayurveda and yoga, Ghebreyesus had stressed the need to integrate this ancient medicinal knowledge into the national health system of countries. \"India has a rich history of traditional medicine through Ayurveda, including yoga, which has been shown to be effective in alleviating pain. The Gujarat Declaration, the main outcome of this summit, will focus on integration of traditional medicines in national health systems, and help unlock the power of traditional medicine through science,\" the WHO chief had said. In his address to the World Health Assembly Monday, Ghebreyesus said 2023 was a year of many challenges, but also of many achievements. He said the year 2023 was a productive one in WHO's work supporting access to medicines and other health products. \"We prequalified 120 medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and other products last year for HIV, malaria, multidrug-resistant TB, Ebola, polio and Covid-19, as well as the first long-acting insulin analogues,” he said. He noted that one of the biggest disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic was to routine immunization programmes in many countries, resulting in backsliding coverage and outbreaks of measles, diphtheria, polio, yellow fever and more. \"In April last year, we launched 'The Big Catch Up' with UNICEF and Gavi, to support countries to shut down outbreaks and restore immunization programmes at least to pre-pandemic levels,” he said. In May last year, the WHO chief had declared an end to both Covid-19 and mpox as global health emergencies. “We continue to call on all countries to maintain and reinforce the capacities for surveillance, detection and response that they built during the pandemic. These investments must not go to waste.” © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd First uploaded on: 28-05-2024 at 00:30 IST Here’s Your Exclusive Pass To Premium Stories CLAIM NOW Deepak Tijori on not asking Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan for help Entertainment May 16, 2024 08:01 IST Deepak Tijori, a veteran actor and filmmaker, spoke about his 30-year journey in the industry and the challenges faced by independent producers.

        "content": "After suffering his earliest-ever defeat at the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, Rafael Nadal said it is unlikely for him to play at Wimbledon next month, even as he eyes a chance to turn out at the Olympics, taking place at his beloved Roland Garros later this year, one last time. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart (to play Wimbledon) after everything my body has been through,” he was quoted as saying by AFP at his post-match press conference. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games.” Nadal, hoping to be competitive in his first round against an in-form opponent, showed invariable signs of rustiness after playing only 15 matches since the start of 2023. He bowed out 3-6, 6-7(5), 3-6 to in-form fourth seed Alexander Zverev. The Spaniard was competitive, especially in the second set which he served for before slumping in the tie-breaker, but Zverev’s shotmaking, fitness and power proved too much to handle. Advertisement READ | French Open: Clay god Rafael Nadal’s exit starts end of unprecedented Roland Garros stronghold Nadal said his body had been through the wringer in recent times. “My body has been a jungle for two years. It has been a big fight, waking up as if a snake or a tiger had bitten me. I need to prepare myself and clear my ideas about a calendar. My main goal is to prepare for the Olympics and to prepare well to be healthy here,” he said, per tennismajors.com, at the press conference. The soon-to-be-38-year-old said he takes positives from Monday’s loss to the German. “My feeling is that I wasn’t that far. I was at a good level (in the match),” Nadal added. “If it was the last time I played here, I would be at peace with myself. I tried to do everything I could to play here. At least I did. Even if I lost, that’s part of the business... I don’t know what’s going to happen in the next few months.” Nadal also had the unusual experience of being watched by active players, in competition at the French Open this year, who were in attendance at Court Philippe Chatrier to bear witness to his potentially final outing. “Happy that it happens, it means that I have a positive legacy here,” he said.",

        "content": "A series of powerful storms swept over the central and southern U.S. over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, killing at least 21 people and leaving a wide trail of destroyed homes, businesses and power outages. The caused deaths in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kentucky and were just north of an oppressive, early season heat wave setting records from south Texas to Florida. Forecasters said the severe weather could shift to the East Coast later Monday and warned millions of people outdoors for the holiday to watch the skies. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who earlier declared a state of emergency, said at a Monday press conference that four people had died in four different counties. The death toll of 21 also included seven deaths in from a Saturday tornado that tore through a mobile home park, officials said, and eight deaths across Arkansas. Two people died in Mayes County, Oklahoma, which is east of Tulsa, authorities said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. The latest community left with shattered homes and no power was the tiny Kentucky community of Charleston, which took a direct hit Sunday night from a tornado that the governor said appeared to be on the ground for 40 miles (64 kilometers). “It’s a big mess,” said Rob Linton, who lives in Charleston and is the fire chief of nearby Dawson Springs, hit by a tornado in 2021. “Trees down everywhere. Houses moved. Power lines are down. No utilities whatsoever – no water, no power.” Further east, some rural areas of Hopkins County hit by the 2021 tornado around the community of Barnsley were damaged again Sunday night, said county Emergency Management Director Nick Bailey. “There were a lot of people that were just getting their lives put back together and then this,” Bailey said. “Almost the same spot, the same houses and everything.\" Beshear has traveled to the area where several times for ceremonies where people who lost everything were given the keys to their new homes. The visits came after a series of tornadoes on a terrifying night in December 2021 in Kentucky. “It could have been much worse,” Beshear said of the Memorial Day weekend storms. “The people of Kentucky are very weather aware with everything we’ve been through.” More than 500,000 customers across the eastern U.S. were Monday afternoon, including about 170,000 in Kentucky. Twelve states reported at least 10,000 outages, according to . The area on highest alert for severe weather Monday is a broad swath of the eastern U.S., from Alabama to New York. President Joe Biden sent condolences to the families who had people killed. He said the Federal Emergency Management Agency is on the ground conducting damage assessments and he has contacted governors to see what federal support they might need.. It's been a grim month of tornadoes and severe weather in the nation’s midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left and dozens injured. Storms earlier this month. The severe thunderstorms and deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes, at a time when contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the on record in the country. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. That warm moist air is at the northern edge of a heat dome bringing temperatures typically seen at the height of summer to late May. The heat index — a combination of air temperature and humidity to indicate how the heat feels to the human body — is expected to reach 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) in parts of south Texas on Monday. Record highs are forecast for Brownsville, San Antonio and Dallas. Miami set a record high of 96 F (35.5 C) on Sunday. For more information on recent tornado reports, see The Associated Press .

        "content": "The Maharashtra government will not proceed with all the recommendations from the recently proposed Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework for School Education, said State Education Minister Deepak Kesarkar. The framework had stirred a controversy for using lines from Manusmriti as reference in one of the chapters in the draft, a move that Kesarkar clarified had not received governmental or the steering committee’s approval before being made public. Speaking at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, Kesarkar expressed regret in excluding Marathi as a compulsory language. “It happened because the draft was made public without following the proper procedure,” he said. Advertisement Kesarkar also said that the exclusion of English as a compulsory language for Class 11 and 12 was “because the government is working to offer higher education in regional languages, including technical education”. After the minister’s clarification, the SCERT issued a press release late Monday stating that Marathi and English language would be compulsory from Class 1 to 10. It also clarified that Hindi, Sanskrit and other Indian and foreign languages are being offered from Class 6, while Classes 11 and 12 students will have to learn two languages — one Indian and the other foreign. Last week, the State Council of Educational Research and Training unveiled the new Maharashtra State Curriculum Framework (SCF), advocating the integration of Indian Knowledge System (IKS) into School Education (SE). It proposed including texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Manache Shlok — a composition by Samarth Ramdas Swami — for memorisation enhancement through recitation competitions. A chapter on “value education and disposition” from SCF, which aimed at character-building for students, sparked controversy as it began with a Sanskrit verse from Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text describing the social system. This inclusion drew criticism from various quarters regarding the intent behind the decision. Advertisement Kesarkar addressed the issue, stating, “It was an error on the part of the steering committee that placed the draft in public domain without state government approval. The people involved have expressed regret for this. Let me make it clear, the government does not want to propagate any text and will not include any of this in textbooks.” After the matter came to light, several educationists questioned the decision to the Manusmriti reference. “There are numerous Sanskrit verses conveying similar meanings, yet the draft selects one from Manusmriti. This decision appears either politically naive or intentionally provocative, potentially offending certain segments of the society,” said a renowned educationist. While language policy for Classes 3 to 10 lacked clarity; for Classes 11 and 12, English was categorised as foreign language. Chhagan Bhujbal, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister, also expressed concerns, saying the inclusion of Manusmriti in the curriculum could send a wrong signal among Dalits and OBCs. “Such actions could impact us electorally. This initiative must be halted. Though seemingly insignificant now, it could pose future challenges,” Bhujbal said.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA:",

Small island states across the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean, with negligible emissions, are particularly vulnerable to economic crises and rising temperatures due to their exposure to natural disasters, high debt and reliance on imports and tourism. The Atlantic hurricane season, starting in June is expected to be more active than usual due to near-record warm Atlantic Ocean temperatures and cooler surface water in the Pacific.",

        "content": "SALT LAKE CITY ( ABC4 ) — The mother of a young southern Utah boy who nearly drowned last week provided another update over the weekend on her son’s condition and the decisions her family will have to make moving forward. Kallie Wright posted to Facebook on Sunday that the days since her son, Levi, was pulled unresponsive from a swift-moving creek have been a “rollercoaster” experience. “We are taking it day by day,” she said in the most recent post. On the evening of May 21, Levi was playing on his toy tractor when he fell into a creek in Beaver County. Emergency crews found the child in the water roughly a mile downstream. Levi, the son of rodeo star Spencer Wright , is currently receiving care at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City. Days after the accident, Levi briefly woke up , bringing hope for a recovery. Yet, his mother noted in a follow-up social media post that the child wasn’t fully coherent or talking in that moment, only that he opened his eyes for a short period of time and “wiggled with purpose.” On Friday, an MRI brought more difficult news for the family. Still, Kallie wrote that they were trying to get as many neurologists as possible to view her son’s brain scan. In her most recent post on Sunday, the mother noted that the term “brain injury” is broad, with different ranges and severities, and that recovery varies depending on the specific injury. “We are exploring the therapies that have been mentioned, engaging with those we feel can be of support for us and getting as many professional eyes on this as possible,” Kallie Wright wrote. She added: “We still just need the prayers. We will need them for years to come as I fear we haven’t even reached the hardest part of this.”",

        "description": "The District Court of Noord-Holland handed down convictions against six men who were involved in a series of extremely violent robberies in 2020 and 2021.",
        "content": "The District Court of Noord-Holland handed down convictions against six men who were involved in a series of extremely violent robberies in 2020 and 2021. One person was killed in the violence, and two others suffered life-threatening injuries due to the use of a gun. The harshest sentence was nearly 30 years in prison, and the lowest sentence was closer to four years. The verdict and sentences were read by the court at the Schiphol judicial complex in Haarlemmermeer on Monday. Seven of the robberies took place in Noord-Holland, and the other was in Dreumel, Gelderland. The most severe sentence was given to 31-year-old Glenn V. from Noord-Scharwoude. Prosecutors had called for a life sentence against him, but the court said that was \"not appropriate\" in his case. The court took into consideration that he was not out to kill people, and that he is still relatively young. V., who has a long criminal record, received the maximum prison sentence allowable short of a life sentence. After his imprisonment, he will be placed under supervision due to the risk of recurrence. Just as the Public Prosecution Service did, the court holds him responsible for the violence committed with firearms. According to the court, he shot 72-year-old Sjaak Groot during a robbery in Berkhou. He was also convicted of shooting two victims in the neck and chest during robberies in Avenhorn and Noord-Scharwoude. His co-defendants include Rotterdam resident Ruviëni M., 39, who was handed a 27-year prison sentence. Deniz R., a 28-year-old from Obdam, was ordered to serve 25 years in prison. Mark V., 31 and from Opmeer, was handed 20 years in prison. M. and R. were given sentences slightly lower than what prosecutors demanded, partly because the court did not believe the evidence they were involved in the shootings was strong enough. Mark V. had a permanent role as the crew's driver. The court spoke of a sustained and structured collaboration between the four men, who were also guilty of participation in a criminal organization. The four, previously described by the Public Prosecution Service as a core group, were involved in almost all robberies. Two men who each participated in one home robbery, former Alkmaar resident Dut M. (30) and Martijn G. (28) from Heerhugowaard, received prison sentences of 6.5 years and three years and nine months respectively. The Public Prosecution Service had also demanded that M. spend time in mandatory psychiatric treatment at a TBS facility, but the court did not see justification in imposing the measure. All suspects except M. were present at the verdict reading, in which the court paid separate attention to the enormous impact the robberies had. Many victims still suffer from physical and psychological complaints, and suffer from nightmares and flashbacks. Some have even moved away.

        "content": "No spectators will be allowed in the stands at FC Utrecht's next home football match in the Eredivisie. Mayor Sharon Dijksma decided to impose the measure in response to rioting by the team's supporters on Sunday when the FC Utrecht was lost out on the chance to play in European football next season. \"I am aware that this is unique, but given the situation last Sunday, this is an appropriate measure. Also, I will not hesitate to disallow an audience at other matches if this situation repeats itself,\" Dijksma wrote on Monday in a letter to the City Council. According to the mayor, FC Utrecht understands the reason for the decision. Additionally, nets must be hung on the sides of the away section in the FC Utrecht stadium. These should prevent them from throwing fireworks and other items back and forth. Dijksma is considering measures against a café near the stadium where a group of rioters are said to have gathered. Just outside the stadium is a slate plateau. Those stones will be removed because the rioters took them from the street to throw as weapons. The municipality wants to recover the costs. FC Utrecht lost to Go Ahead Eagles on Sunday, and therefore did not qualify for the preliminary round of the Conference League. There was unrest in the stadium during the match, and riots broke out outside afterwards. According to the mayor, Utrecht supporters threw a variety of objects at riot police, like \"large rocks, manhole covers, gutters, bicycles, fireworks and all the material that was available on the street.\" Two people from the Utrecht region have been arrested. One officer ended up in a hospital after losing consciousness, according to Dijksma. The mayor says she met with officers on Sunday. \"The pressure on our officers has been enormous for weeks and the sum of the physical and verbal violence they constantly have to deal with is taking a very heavy toll on them.\" Dijksma has therefore appealed for calm. \"It is really essential to find calmer waters together, because this situation is no longer sustainable. We can no longer sustain this together.\" It is not yet known when FC Utrecht will play its first home match and who the opponent will be. The first round of the Eredivisie will take place on August 9, 10 and 11, with the second round a week later.",

        "content": "The Financial Market Authority (AFM) received over 20 percent more reports and questions about fraud and scams in the first quarter of this year. The regulator has also noticed that scammers find new ways to take people's money. The AFM now wants to use a website to better educate the Dutch about how fraudsters and scammers work. The AFM receives reports via the Financial Markets Complaint Desk. This often involves investment fraud, where people are tricked into investing money. Fraudsters also place fake advertisements that look like Dutch celebrities are giving investment advice. According to the AFM, the hotline has also recently received signals about new scamming methods. These include fraudsters posing as AFM employees and scamming their victims again. Due to the increasing number of reports, the supervisory authority has set up the website . There, Dutch people can learn more about the different types of fraud and how they can protect themselves against them. They can also check whether a company they are contacting is known to the AFM.",

        "description": "The family-friendly pizza restaurant has had its first major refurbishment since opening in 1994, adding a new ice cream and churro bar.",
        "content": "I introduced the third generation of the family to Di Maggio’s East Kilbride when we took the kids for dinner at the revamped restaurant. I’m old enough to remember being taken here by my parents when the pizza and pasta restaurant opened here in 1994. The first Di Maggio’s restaurant was established when Mario Gizzi went into partnership with his uncle Giuseppe “Joe” Conetta, opening in 1984 in the West End. Themed around American baseball legend Joe Di Maggio, there was an American Italian menu of pizza, pasta, burgers and ribs. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to GlasgowWorld, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. It was during the 1990s that Joe’s son, Tony, joined his cousin in the family business. They went on to launch Cafe Andaluz, Amarone and turned Glasgow’s oldest Italian restaurant, La Ariosto, into the Barolo Grill. The group now has 19 restaurants of various hues and plans for expansion. What's the Story? The East Kilbride restaurant has had a major reimagining, kitted out with a churro bar and gelateria, Churissimo. Tony Conetta said: “We’ve been serving the community of East Kilbride for more than 30 years and this is a huge moment in our history in the town. A tremendous amount of love and care has gone into the refurbishment, and we’re sure the introduction of EK’s first authentic churro bar will go down a treat. “We love being a part of East Kilbride, we’ve welcomed thousands of families through our doors, and we look forward to thousands more. It’s also about playing a part in bringing new people to the town, and we hope the new-look Di Maggio’s East Kilbride and Churissimo will achieve that for the next 30 years.” On the Menu Churros and ice cream If you grew up in and around Glasgow then you are probably familiar with Di Maggio’s Glaswegian approximation of a New York pizza. What’s new here is the steady supply of freshly made churros - there’s bite sized portions for the kits, churros dusted with sugar and cinnamon for the adults or filled with white chocolate, Nutella or salted caramel. Advertisement Advertisement Dips include Belgian chocolate or biscoff bueno flavour. There’s 12 ice cream flavours like chocolate fudge brownie, strawberry cheesecake or raspberry ripple. It’s a modern take on the classic Italian cafe with some Iberian sweet treats on top, a nod to the group’s success with Spanish tapas at Cafe Andaluz. Atmosphere There’s space for 220 customers here, it’s a big dining room but there’s plenty of space between tables which helps when wee ones are going back and forth to the compact soft play area tucked away in the corner. The renovation has created a smart space with plenty of tables and booths to suit different sizes of parties, some allusions to art deco and vintage prints on the wall. We went early on a Thursday night and the place was busy with other families and couples meeting up after work. Verdict Our seven-year-old, an expert on pizza Margherita was impressed with his cheese-laden main course which disappeared quickly. It was really a prelude to the main event and he gave a 10/10 review for the chocolate fudge brownie ice cream topped with mini marshmallows and churros bites with Nutella dipping sauce that we shared. Our toddler chewed on chunks of garlic bread and ate individual bits of macaroni cheese before trying a couple of spoonfuls of ice cream. Battered fish goujons, grilled chicken with mashed potato and spaghetti with tomato sauce are popular on the kids menu. Advertisement Advertisement After starters of bruschetta and mozzarella cubes, I had pepperoni pizza that reminded me of takeaways from here in my student days. It’s comfort food that arrives promptly, a quality that’s treasured when dining out with the whole family. My wife had pizza diavola with melted mozzarella, red chilli and smoked paprika chicken fillets. I hadn’t been back since I moved away from East Kilbride 20 years ago, not for any reason other than there were more convenient options when I lived in Dublin, Edinburgh, Dennistoun and Partick. The revamped restaurant has the added attraction of the dessert bar and has been kitted out to continue to cater to the next generation of EK families. It will continue to be a local favourite.",

        "description": "Authorities continue to ask for help in gathering any information about what may have happened to Carla Beth Anderson, who disappeared in 1987",
        "content": "WADENA, Minn. — On the night of Friday the 13th in November 1987, deer hunters were gearing up for the opening weekend, a fire burned in a swamp on the edge of town, an unremarkable brown car was stolen and the employee of the month at the local Hardee's vanished without a trace. Those events are either coincidental, or the keys to solving a three-decadee mystery that has yielded many theories and tips, but no answers. Despite countless leads, sightings, psychic visions and rumors, Carla Beth Anderson, who became the subject of an intensive search in the Wadena, Minnesota area, has never been found. Local authorities, though several generations have now held the case in their hands, continue to say the case is at the forefront of their minds. Carla is a white female who was just 23 at the time of her disappearance. She had blonde hair, blue eyes, and a half inch scar above her right eye. She was petite, just under 5 foot tall and just 80 pounds. Last seen, she was wearing a brown and orange Hardee’s jacket, a white Pepsi and Mountain Dew sweatshirt with three bears on it, blue jeans and pink sneakers. Carla was mildly mentally disabled. Carla was well liked by her Hardee’s manager at the time, Wayne Wolden, who went on to become the mayor of Wadena. \"She was a fantastic employee. Wonderful personality, lighthearted, smiling a lot,\" Wolden said in a previous interview. \"I used to call her 'spud' because she was like a little potato ... She was probably 4-foot-10 inches tall, maybe, on a good day, on heels.\" He added that she was kind and hard working. She was known to volunteer to come work at her job on days she wasn’t assigned to work. She had an innocence about her that makes this case even more disheartening. The sweet memories of the girl remain as current investigators continue to search for her. Anderson's loved ones stated local people sometimes harassed her or attempted to take advantage of her. Although she's mildly mentally disabled, she tried to lead as normal a life as possible and was proud of being independent and having a job, her own home and a boyfriend. Anderson lived at Greenwood Apartments in Wadena, just a couple blocks from her place of work, so she was able to walk to work easily. She was expected to have her photo taken the following Monday for the Employee of the Month display. It was one of many things that would go unfulfilled with her disappearance. Looking back at that Friday, Nov. 13, Anderson just found out she had been named employee of the month at work. She and her mother and stepfather went out to eat at Taco John's that evening to celebrate the honor. After dinner, between 7:30 and 8 p.m., Anderson's mother and stepfather picked up some movies for her to watch, then dropped her off at her apartment at Greenwood Apartments. Anderson got safely inside her apartment that evening. She had been carrying a cup full of soda when her parents dropped her off. The empty cup was found in her apartment, and one of the videos she had gotten to watch was found in her VCR. Anderson did not show up for her morning work shift on Saturday, Nov. 14, which was uncharacteristic of her, as she was known as an exemplary employee. She has never been heard from again. Nothing appeared to be amiss in Anderson's apartment and the only thing missing were her keys and her light jacket, with the Hardee’s logo on it. Her purse remained on the table. The apartment door was locked from the outside. The building itself had a security door, but the door had been propped open that night by other tenants who were moving in. On the night of Anderson's disappearance, there was a fire burning in a swamp on the outskirts of Wadena. She would have been able to view the fire from her window, according to the investigator at the time, Lane Waldahl. Waldahl has his suspicions about who started the fire that night, but no evidence. Authorities theorized she left home to look at the fire up close, and someone attacked her. There is no evidence to support this theory, however. That same evening, a brown Plymouth Horizon was stolen a couple of blocks from Anderson's apartment building and was never recovered. It is unknown whether the stolen car has any connection to her case but many believe this to be too much of a coincidence. “They’ve got to be related, but we just can’t prove or disprove it, yet,” Wadena Chief of Police Naomi Plautz said. “The one thing that has always stuck with me, that vehicle has never been located,” Wadena County Sheriff Michael Carr Jr. said. “If you were to find that vehicle, you would probably find her.” Carr remembers Carla going missing while he was a sophomore in high school. \"Still in the back of my mind there is a connection between that car and Carla,\" Waldahl said. They searched for the car across the region and combed other states. Wadena Sgt. Brandon Pearson reflected on all the stolen vehicles that they deal with now. Eventually they are found. But decades later, this one has not been found. Waldahl suspects it's in a lake or buried in a gravel pit. Police searches, intense media coverage, state and federal investigations — nothing revealed what happened to Anderson. The police followed every tip. Four three ring binders are filled with the tips, the hunches and the interviews. The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension also has a copy of all the details. A search committee went out looking to find Carla about five days after she went missing. A WCCO helicopter was used to search from the air. The Civil Air Patrol lent their eyes from the skies. It was deer hunting weekend when Carla disappeared, and hunters were alerted to be on the lookout for the girl. Carr said authorities acted fast as the ground was bare at the time of her disappearance. They knew snow would soon arrive and cover up any disturbed ground. Within days of their searches, it did snow, Carr said. Waldahl said the combined efforts of local, regional, state and federal law enforcement agencies was impressive and he feels they left no stone unturned. Years later he recalls speaking again with BCA and FBI profilers interested in taking a fresh look at the cold case. That again turned up no solid evidence to follow. Suspected serial killer Floyd Todd Tapson was considered a possible suspect in Anderson's disappearance for a time, but he was cleared from that case after being interviewed by investigators. He apparently had a solid alibi putting him elsewhere that night. All the members of Anderson's family have been ruled out as suspects in her case, as was her boyfriend. They were given a polygraph test and passed. Foul play is suspected in her disappearance, but little evidence is available as to her fate. A psychic who said she knew where Carla was came to town but brought up another dead end. Anderson was placed on playing cards in 2008 among a list of the top 52 cold cases in the state. The card decks have been distributed to all 515 Minnesota police departments and sheriff offices, plus 75 county jail and annex facilities. In addition, over 10,000 decks have been supplied to Minnesota state prison inmates. While the cards have been effective in some of those cold cases, no solid tips in Carla's case have come from that effort. In the days after the disappearance, volunteers including the Wadena Pioneer Journal newspaper staff worked to create 5,000 posters with Carla Beth Anderson on them, pleading with people to call if they had seen her. The posters were plastered all over north and central Minnesota. They even made it to the Metrodome as the local Verndale Pirates football team were playing at the Prep Bowl. Much has changed over the last three decades The former Hardee's is a Burger King, the Taco John's location is a parking lot, and all the police working at the time of Anderson's disappearance have moved on, retired or died. Anderson’s parents died months apart in 2008: Verne Wells on Feb. 9, and Roberta Wells on June 3. What hasn't changed is a concerted effort to solve this bizarre case. “Anytime we get a lead or tip, we look into it,” Plautz said. There’s been about a half dozen tips in Plautz’ 23 years working in Wadena. They continue to search and most of all are looking for honesty from those involved. “We’re still diligently working on it, she has not been forgotten,” Sgt. Pearson said. At this time, they are running down a tip which they believe may be valuable in finding Carla. “We’re still very much in investigation mode.” The police department puts out a reminder of the disappearance every November hoping someone will talk. They know that someone knows. “The reminders ... it just gets people talking,” Plautz said. “If someone is just too afraid to say something, maybe the next year they’ll get enough courage to say something.” “The guilty conscience weighs heavily on people as the years go on,” Pearson said. “We’re hoping to appeal to that, to anyone who knows something,” Plautz said. Plautz promises anonymity for those looking to share information. Police say Carla has extended family in the Brainerd area that would very much like to see this resolved. Anyone that knew Carla would like to see her found. The community of Wadena has been hanging on to hope. “It’s one of Minnesota’s most predominant cold cases just because of how she vanished and was never heard of again,” Pearson said. Plautz shared one difference with this cold case is that Anderson was such an innocent girl. “The most innocent among us, and to not be able to come up with the answers that everybody wants ...” Pearson said, talking about the difficult case. Carla was that picture of innocence. Her child-like 23-year-old face is one the community cannot forget. Waldahl, who had just been named investigator about two months before this all began, regrets that he was unable to solve the case while Carla’s parents were still alive. He continued the search until his retirement in 2002. Beyond that, he keeps an interest in the case and still gets people asking him if he followed this lead or that. \"It's never gone away. It's always there,\" Waldahl said. \"I hope someone finds her before I go.\" Details about Anderson's case are posted to various missing person sites including: The Wadena Police Department is the investigating agency. If you know any additional information or can provide tips regarding Anderson contact the Wadena Police Department at 218-631-7700. The BCA can be contacted at 1-877-996-6222, email bca.coldcase@state.mn.us, or submit information via the tip form (can be done anonymously).",

        "content": "TEHRAN, May 27: Iran’s acting President Mohammad Mokhber addressed the country’s new parliament Monday in his first public speech since last week’s helicopter crash that killed his predecessor and seven others. His speech comes as Iran prepares for a presidential election to replace the late Ebrahim Raisi in just a month, a vote that could see the previously behind-the-scenes bureaucrat potentially run alongside others. Meanwhile, Iran’s new hard-line parliament is expected to select its new speaker Tuesday. In his remarks, Mokhber praised Raisi’s time in office, noting that Iran’s crude oil production- a key source of hard currency for the country – climbed to more than 3.6 million barrels a day. That comes after Oil Minister Javad Owji said Sunday that Iran was now exporting around 2 million barrels a day, despite Western sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic. Mokhber also asserted that the country’s economy remained stable under Raisi when Iran took military actions in Iraq, Israel and Pakistan in recent months. “Three countries were hit. We hit Israel, people find that figures and indexes are the same in the morning when they wake up, price of hard currency is the same, inflation is the same, liquidity is the same and the market is full of people’s needs,” Mokhber claimed. “This strength, this settlement and this power is not a usual thing, they all were because of guidance by the supreme leader and the sincere efforts of Ayatollah Raisi.” The Iranian rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Today, it stands around 580,000 to $1 in the wake of the U.S.’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord and a series of attacks on shipping in the Mideast, first attributed to Iran and later involving Yemen’s Houthi rebels as Israel’s war against Hamas on the Gaza Strip began over seven months ago. On May 20, rescuers recovered the bodies of Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian and others in a mountainous region in northwestern Iran following a fatal helicopter crash. Iran will hold presidential elections on June 28 to replace Raisi. On Thursday, a five-day registration period for candidates will open. Analysts have suggested that Mokhber could be one of those to register. Meanwhile, on Monday marked the first day for Iran’s newly elected parliament, following a March election that saw the country’s lowest turnout since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Of those elected to the 290-seat body, hard-liners hold over 230 seats, according to an Associated Press survey. Iran’s parliament plays a secondary role in governing the country, though it can intensify pressure on a presidential administration when deciding on the annual budget and other important bills. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 85, has the final say in all important state matters. (AP)",

        "content": "The Bombay High Court on Monday asked CIDCO to stall its move to remove the hoarding concerned and instead suggested they come up with a policy or regime for hoardings located within their jurisdiction or area. The court was hearing a plea by advertisement agencies challenging the notices issued by City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) to remove alleged illegal hoardings in Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area (NAINA). A vacation bench of Justices NR Borkar and Somasekhar Sundaresan also remarked that civic authorities said nothing to the advertising firms until the Ghatkopar hoarding collapse incident. Firms including Devangi Outdoor Advertising and Harmesh Dilip Tanna, proprietor of Gargee Graphics, had approached the High Court stating that CIDCO did not have the jurisdiction to send such notices. The petitioners claimed they had erected the hoardings legally after obtaining necessary permissions from authorities. Advertisement Despite this, they said they have received notices for removal of hoardings within 24 hours or face action under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (MRTP). As per petitioners, the authorities have warned them that if hoardings were not removed, they would dismantle them and recover costs from the owner. The notices by CIDCO come in wake of the collapse of a hoarding on a petrol pump in Ghatkopar on May 13, which killed 17 people. CIDCO purportedly issued notices to several hoarding owners after the unfortunate incident. Advocate for the petitioner firms, Mohsin Khan, argued that the notices were issued without a show-cause notice, which violated the principles of natural justice. Khan also claimed that authorities failed to verify the structural stability of the hoardings before issuing the notice, hence the action amounted to being arbitrary and ex-facie illegal. However, CIDCO’s lawyer submitted that the authority had issued notices to several owners of hoardings after discovering they had been installed without requisite permissions. The lawyer claimed that the same exercise was crucial as it was within the Navi Mumbai airport region. The corporation also claimed that the hoardings erected since 2018–19 had applied for permission in 2023, including those by the petitioners. Advertisement The bench sought to know if the authority had conducted any structural audit of all hoardings within its domain, and whether the authority was planning to bring a regime or policy in place for illegal hoardings within its area. These hoardings are not brought back to CIDCO, the bench said, and until the Ghatkopar incident, nobody said anything. In these circumstances, the bench asked if the corporation should at least not study whether the hoardings pose any danger, instead of bringing them down? “Have a reasonable policy view, otherwise case by case people will come. If you decide to demolish everything, that is also different. We are placing this on May 30. Till next date, if it is not pulled down, we are asking you to hold it,” the bench said.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

        "content": "CARGOTEC CORPORATION, STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE, 27 MAY 2024 AT 9:30 PM EEST Cargotec publishes new long term financial targets for Hiab business area and information on planned management for standalone Hiab Cargotec publishes new long term financial targets for its Hiab business area and information on planned management for Cargotec as a standalone Hiab company ahead of the capital markets day, which will be held on 28 May 2024 starting at 2:30 pm (EEST). As announced earlier, Cargotec is carrying out a structure change where there would be three separate businesses emerging from the current Cargotec group. Kalmar is planned to be demerged to form a separate listed company as from 1 July 2024, and Cargotec is looking for a solution for MacGregor during 2024. If the planned actions are completed, current Cargotec would comprise of Hiab as a standalone business. Cargotec announced in conjunction with its January–March 2024 interim report that due to the high certainty of standalone listing of its business area Kalmar by means of a partial demerger, the combined financial targets set in November 2022 for Kalmar and Hiab are no longer valid. Therefore, separate long term targets have been set for Hiab and Kalmar. Kalmar’s new long term targets were published on 22 May 2024 when the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority approved the prospectus concerning the proposed partial demerger of Cargotec and listing of Kalmar’s class B shares. Cargotec’s Board of Directors has set the following financial targets for Hiab to measure success by 2028: Annual sales growth over seven percent over the cycle Comparable operating profit 18 percent (1 Return on capital employed over 25 percent (2 1) as business area of Cargotec 2) as business area of Cargotec, defined as (Operating profit / Operative capital employed) In addition to the Hiab-specific long term targets, Cargotec’s climate target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in all three emission scopes by at least 50 percent by 2030 compared to a 2019 baseline remains valid. The target is validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In its planned standalone future after the solution for MacGregor has been found, Cargotec (future Hiab) is planning to publish a new climate target and applying its validation from SBTi. Cargotec also aims for a growing dividend of 30–50 percent of EPS and to keep gearing below 50 percent. “Hiab has a strong track record of profitable growth. We aim to reach even higher with our new strategy, which our new targets demonstrate. We continue to shape the essential industries we serve with our innovative lifting and delivery solutions and increase customer’s productivity, safety and sustainability. Setting our own financial targets is also a major milestone on our journey to become a standalone company,” says Scott Phillips, President Hiab. If the planned demerger of Kalmar is completed and a solution to MacGregor is found so that MacGregor would not thereafter be part of the Cargotec group, Cargotec’s Board of Directors is planning to propose to Cargotec’s General Meeting of shareholders that the company’s name would be changed from Cargotec to Hiab. Should such actions be carried out as planned in the leadership of the current President and CEO of Cargotec, Casimir Lindholm has announced his intention to step down as President and CEO at such point. The Board of Directors would then appoint the President of the Hiab business Scott Phillips as the President and CEO of the renamed company being the current Cargotec. Cargotec currently estimates that these changes to transform into standalone Hiab could take place during 2025. Current Cargotec CFO Mikko Puolakka would continue as CFO of standalone Hiab. More detailed information on the new financial targets will be provided at the Capital Markets Day which can be followed online at https://cargotec.videosync.fi/hiab-cmd-2024 , starting at 2:30 pm (EEST) on 28 May 2024. Questions can be submitted during the presentations. The presentation material will be available at Cargotec’s website www.cargotec.com/cmd24 .

        "content": "Who says a burger needs meat? Bengaluru-based food blogger Vijayalakshmi Vikram says plant-based patties can be just as juicy, flavourful, and satisfying as their classic counterparts. “In addition, they’re healthier and great for the environment. It’s a win-win,” she said, as she whipped up some vegan burger patties with Bangalore Times for International Burger Day. When making vegan burgers, mushrooms and beans, are an excellent alternative, she tells us. “Honestly, there are plant-based alternatives for almost anything these days, so as a vegan I never feel like I'm missing out on anything in life.” “Being vegan for over seven years is more than just a diet for me, it's a lifestyle choice built on kindness to animals and a commitment to living compassionately.” BLACK BEAN AND MUSHROOM BURGER WITH THE MAGIC OF PEANUTS RECIPE INGREDIENTS: For the patty (makes six): 400 gms button mushroom 3 large potatoes 100 gms panko bread crumbs 100 gms tofu 1 full cup cooked black bean or kidney beans 3 tbsp chilli flakes, 1 tbsp soya sauce, 1 tbsp each of onion and garlic powder, salt to taste For the spicy burger spread: 2 red capsicum 1 tbsp garlic powder 400 gms of peanut curds (hung) Salt to taste 1 tbsp chilli flakes Veggies for the burger: Lettuce Siced onions Cucumber Tomato Jalapenos METHOD Prep work for patty: Wash and clean 350-400 gms of button mushrooms. Shred the mushrooms Boil 3 large potatoes. Peel and set aside Pressure cook 1/2 cup black beans. Remove the water and towel try. The beans should be cooked well. Use kidney beans if you don’t have black beans Prep work for red capsicum & peanut hung curd spread: Hang 400 gms of peanut curd in a muslin cloth/ bag for 4-6 hours Roast 2 red capsicums (sliced into halves) in a preheated oven at 175 degrees for 45 min For the patty: Heat 3 tbsp oil in a pan. Add the mushroom (don’t worry about the water) Add 1 tbsp soya sauce, 1 tbsp onion powder, 3 tbsp chilli flakes, salt, 1 tbsp garlic powder Add 100 gms of finely shredded tofu. Sauté the above well until all the water is evaporated. Add mashed boiled potato. Mix well Grind 1/2 cup roasted peanuts and the black beans (don’t purée this mixture). Mix this with sautéed mushroom and potato mixture Transfer the above to a mixing bowl. Add 75 to 100 gms of panko or ordinary bread crumbs Make into patties and keep in the refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour. This is an important step After an hour, shallow fry on low flame with a generous amount of oil For making the spread: Blend the roasted capsicum, the hung (thick portion) of the peanut curds in the bag, 1/2 tbsp garlic powder, and salt to a thick paste. If this is runny, don’t worry, throw in a boiled potato or handful of cashew nuts Blend to a fine paste and set aside Assembling the burger: Tawa heat the burger buns Place the patty, lettuce leaves, onion, tomato, cucumber slices Add a generous amount of the spread Burger is ready to bite into",

Transcript Oscar Pulido: Welcome to The Bid, where we break down what's happening in the markets and explore the forces changing the economy and finance. I'm Oscar Pulido. The world remains a buzz over artificial intelligence, but rapid advancement and adoption of the technology is poised to drive a significant increase in power, demand, and this demand could redefine energy consumption as we know it today, we ask the critical question. Is the energy sector equipped for the AI power revolution? Today I'm joined by Will Sue from BlackRock's Fundamental Equities team. Will is one of BlackRock's leading voices on all things energy. He'll walk us through the sector's pivotal role in the build out and future of AI, as well as dig into the potential investment opportunities and challenges Will, thank you for joining us on The Bid. Will Su: Thank you, Oscar. Great to be here. Oscar Pulido: So, Will, we've talked about artificial intelligence on the podcast a lot, and it seems like there's no limits to the growth of this technology except the fact that it consumes a lot of energy and maybe that's the constraint. Tell us a little bit about why AI consumes so much power. Will Su: The simple answer to that extremely complicated question is that information processing is energy, and we are processing more information today than we've ever thought of, even from just a few years ago. At its most fundamental level, computations are just moving electrons around a semiconductor chip, but when you multiply that very small electric current by trillions of calculations, the energy demand adds up very, very quickly. I think Rob Goldstein mentioned this the concept of AI is not really anything new. The MIT AI lab was started in the late 1950s, we did have a breakthrough moment in 2017 when a team of researchers wrote a paper about the transformer, which then became the architecture for today's large language models or LLMs. Now, these models are being trained on trillions of parameters and tokens that make them high quality, high capacity, and able to contextualize the questions that they're being asked. And just to give you an idea of how big the computational power we're talking about is here. ChatGPT4 was trained on about 70,000 Zetta flops of compute power. That's 70 trillion trillion operations per second. Mind bending numbers. And as that number grows over time, that's why we're seeing this recent interest in meeting the power demand of AI. Oscar Pulido: Did you say Zetta flops? 'Cause I'm going to need a glossary. I think as we talk more about artificial intelligence, it feels like the terminology is new to a lot of people. And when you talk about power and the quantity, help us understand like, how much are we talking about on a global scale? Will Su: So as anyone who tried to model this out can tell you it's very hard to have a lot of confidence for 10, 20 years down the road when you're looking at something with such exponential growth. That being said, we did build our own model because as they say, all models are wrong, but some are useful. In building this model, it's helped us understand what the key variables are and maybe how the shape of that future power demand might look like. And the punchline is, we think there could be up to 1000 terrawatt hours of incremental electricity demand for AI by 2030, and that would be about 3% of global electricity. And keep in mind that the internet today already consumes 2 to 3% of global electricity for things like data centers, networking transmissions and increasingly for blockchains. In aggregate you could see total internet demand, including AI, make up 6 to 7% of global electricity demand by 2030. Oscar Pulido: And how is the world going to manage that power demand because it's incremental on top of what is already the demand for power, right? Will Su: Right. I think we can first dig a little bit into what is driving that AI demand. There's really three roughly equal buckets in our 2030 outlook. One is for training. So that's the power that it takes to train these very large models. And again, just to give you an idea of the scale in 2022 Chat GPT-3 came out. It was trained on 175 billion parameters and 300 billion tokens. And the amount of energy it took to train could power about 90,000 US homes for a year. Now you fast forward to 2023 when Chat GPT-4 came out, that model was reportedly trained on 1.8 trillion parameters and 13 trillion tokens. And the energy it took to train that could power 2.5 million U.S. homes for a year, and these models are getting bigger by the day. And the good news there is with each generation of semiconductors, each generation becomes about 50% more power efficient. So, it takes half the amount of power for one calculation. It's not enough to offset just how quickly the models are getting bigger, and then remember, more players are entering this game, globally, not just in the US but also in Europe and Asia. So, you add it all together and training really represents the bulk of the power growth that we see for AI in the coming few years. The second bucket for demand is something called querying. So that's when consumers, businesses, and other computers start to ask questions to these trained large language models. And in our model, we think you could see up to 30 billion AI queries per day by 2030. For comparison today, we make about 10 billion internet searches per day. But you have to remember that not all queries are created equally, right? A text-based query takes about the same amount of power as an internet search, but an AI generated photo takes up to 30 times more power, and a 60 second AI generated video takes up to 7,000 times more power than a text query. And video is big, it's 57% of all internet traffic today. So how the consumer adapts to AI video is really one of the key variables that'll determine just how much energy we're going to require to power AI. And then the third bucket is really for data center operations, mainly for cooling, because when you're doing trillions of calculations per second, these chips run really hot. So yes, 1000 terrawatt hours by 2030. That is a big number. I think it's a challenging task to meet that demand, but not an impossible one. Oscar Pulido: And maybe you can expand there because you shared a lot of numbers. you said the word trillions a couple times. the percentage increases that you've cited, particularly when you talked about how we use artificial intelligence to query, was quite large. So, what role do renewables play in this energy demand? I'm thinking about things like wind solar, are they the major component or are there other, sources of energy that we're going to rely on? Will Su: So, renewables are by far the fastest growing source of power generation. In the last 20 years. They've gone from almost nothing to 13% of global power generation. And they will continue to grow at a very fast pace. Without a doubt, renewables are going to play a big part, in powering AI, but also in powering this overall theme of electrification of our energy systems. Now renewables have one really big drawback when it comes to powering AI, which is intermittency. Right? Let's zoom into the Ercot grid in Texas, which is the largest wind market and the second largest solar market in the U.S. So, it has a lot of renewables, and if you just zoom in on a typical day, the solar power tends to peak out between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM when the sun's shining. And the wind peaks when the wind speeds are the highest, which is usually from midnight to 7:00 AM when you wake up. Peak demand really happens in the hours of 8:00 PM to midnight. That's when people are at home relaxing, watching TV, streaming, checking their social media. And you'll see that during that period, natural gas demand really increases to meet that gap that can't be met by wind and solar. And this is probably a good time to talk about nuclear, which people don't think of a lot, but it's actually today the largest source of carbon free power generation. It makes up about 9% of global power. But I think as governments around the world start to realize how much electricity growth there's going to be, there's starting to be a change in thinking. And in countries like South Korea, Japan, Italy, and here in the U.S. you're seeing regulators extending previously planned shutdowns of nuclear plans, and even in some cases, allowing them to restart after they've already been shut. So definitely don't count nuclear out in this low carbon way to power AI going forward. Oscar Pulido: So, it sounds like the, the demand is so significant that it is causing even some sources of energy that in the past that felt like, were becoming less of a priority to reenter the focus. Ultimately what you've said is there's a lot of different sources of energy that are going to help, power the AI demand. You mentioned nuclear gas, but also renewables. And if I could focus you on the US for just a second, artificial intelligence is not just the US topic, but it is the part of the world where the build out is really gaining a lot of momentum and therefore, how is the U.S. thinking about the power supply for artificial intelligence? Will Su: we really should talk about one of the biggest unsung triumphs in the energy transition so far, which is the U.S. Power grid has decarbonized itself by a third. Over the last 20 years, and about 60% of that came in the form of cheap and abundant natural gas as a result of the shale revolution that allowed us to substitute out much more polluting coal. You saw a coal share in the last 20 years drop from 50% to 16%. Natural gas went up from 19% of U.S. Power generation to 42. The other 60, the other 40% came from renewables. So, renewables, again, grew from almost nothing 20 years ago to 14% of the US power grid today. So, there's already a really strong track record of partnerships between natural gas and renewables to combine and help us decarbonize. Now, when you think about AI, and you think about data centers. The U.S. has about one third of the total data center capacity in the world, and I'm very confident that share will grow over time because we have the leading technology companies that are leading this AI revolution. And then we are also blessed with abundant resources, both traditional and renewable. If you look at a map of where these data centers are located in the U.S., you'll see that they're mostly in these big clusters that are located close to population centers. So almost half of all data centers in the U.S. are in Virginia. They're almost all in this six square mile tiny area called Data Center Alley near Arlington. There's other big clusters like Hillsborough, near Portland, Oregon. there's also growing clusters around Ohio, and you'll see a problem if you juxtapose that map onto one where the renewable resources are best in this country. The source of greatest solar radiation is in the southwest U.S., so that's places like Southern California, Nevada, New Mexico, and where the wind speeds are the highest are down the middle of the U.S. In the windy corridor that goes from the Dakotas down to Northern Texas. And they don't really overlap with where the data centers are located today and where the most growth is likely to happen in the coming years. And then to make matters worse, this country's really falling behind in making long distance transmission investments. We're making one eighth the mileage of new transmission lines than we did 10 years ago. That's a result of a number of regulatory and economic challenges with interstate infrastructure, and this is where natural gas is going to come in. It's a proven, mature technology. It's much cleaner than coal. It plugs easily into different grids, so it shapes my view that I think at least half, if not more of the incremental power for AI in the U.S. will come from natural gas and the balance will mostly be met by new renewable developments. Oscar Pulido: Data Center Alley doesn't sound as glamorous as like Silicon Valley, but it seems like it's also very important. Let's come back to your role as an investor. You spend your day thinking about companies to invest in, and if you follow the markets over the last couple years, it's been all about technology. But we're having a discussion about the energy space, and so presumably that means there's investment opportunities in the energy sector. Where are those? Will Su: Absolutely. So, as a value minded income investor, I have thought for a long time that energy is an undervalued sector because the market under appreciates both the volume and the duration for which the world needs oil and gas for the decades to come. And I think this recent focus on how do we power AI just shines yet another spotlight on how power hungry our world really is. And over time, I think that will help this sector rerate higher. Now, aside from that, I think the energy sector actually might be one of the most underappreciated beneficiaries for all the technological gangs that'll come with better generative AI. Some of the world's largest supercomputers are actually owned by large energy companies. Why? Because they perform a number of very computationally intensive tasks. Things like asset optimization, algorithmic trading, four D seismic imaging for new resource discoveries. And I'll give you one specific example, which is the industry is using more and more of what's called a digital twin. So, this is like a virtual replica of a real-world asset, something like a refinery or an offshore platform. It's just got so much data inside of it that you can do a lot of really interesting and exciting things. Things like predictive maintenance, fixing things before they break, things like stress, testing them for severe weather events or identifying methane leaks and reducing emissions that way. So, I think there's more than one way to win with energy when it comes to the theme of AI that's greatly underappreciated by the market today. I think the other sector that deserves some airtime here is utilities. So, utilities are a yield driven high dividend paying sector that's been somewhat out of favor in the last few years in a rising rate environment. But as the U.S. Grid goes from not having much growth for the last 20 years to needing to grow one to 2% per year going forward, there's a big opportunity for these utilities. It'll come after an initial period of heavy investments now, which utilities will win depends very strongly on what regulatory regime and what geography they operate in. Oscar Pulido: And it's interesting just to hear you talk about energy and utilities. I'm reminded we spoke to your colleague Carrie King, who reminded us that while it has been a very tech-driven market, in the last couple of years, there are opportunities that are starting to appear. And you're zooming in on the energy and utility sector as a function of artificial intelligence and power demand. But for an investor who is looking at this space, what should they be considering as they think about investing? Will Su: The energy sector contributes about 10% of the S&P 500's net income, but it makes up less than 4% of the index by market cap. And I think that valuation disconnect is driven by this persistent, and in my view, misplaced fear that this sector has no long-term growth. Because I think as we sit here talking about breakthrough technologies like generative AI, it is important for us to remember that there's many different poles for incremental energy demand in this world, and all or nothing approach to energy just isn't going to work. We have to find ways to help the traditional energy sources become cleaner and more responsibly sourced. At the same time, we scale up our renewables portfolio together, and only together will they be able to power the world forward in a pragmatic energy transition. Oscar Pulido: Right, the world is evolving, where the demand for energy will come from is changing. With the number of statistics that you've been able to cite about the energy sector and artificial intelligence, where does this passion come from? How did you get interested in this space? Will Su: Oscar, I'm having flashbacks to 16 years ago when I started my career at a large investment bank in the equity research department, and my recruiter said, you can either join the internet team or the energy team. And I had no hesitation. I said, energy, it's supply-demand driven. It's quantitative. The world needs this stuff. And you fast forward to today, and I think the internet index has outperformed energy by about 1,100%. But if you gave me a time machine to go back, I will make the same choice over again. This job has taken me to really exciting places all over the world. Offshore Norway, the Permian Basin in Texas, the Bakken in North Dakota, or deep into the Amazon jungle in Guyana. That's a country that's going to go from the second poorest in South America to having the same GDP per capita as Brazil in less than a decade because of their resource development. So, it's been a really thrilling ride so far, and I look forward to more of what's to come. Oscar Pulido: We're glad you made that decision 16 years ago and that you would make it again, if you went back in time. Thanks for sharing all this insight on the energy sector, on artificial intelligence, and thank you for doing it here on The Bid.

        "content": "President Biden recently raised taxes on American consumers and businesses and may have hastened the end of the dollar’s world reserve currency status. President Biden did this by increasing tariffs on Chinese imports. Specifically, President Biden raised tariffs on products including Chinese-produced steel and aluminum and many components imported from China for use in manufacturing electric vehicle batteries. Tariffs on Chinese-made semiconductors are rising from 25 to 50 percent while tariffs on Chinese-made electronic vehicles are rising from 25 percent to an astounding 100 percent. Of course, the costs of these tariffs will be borne by Americans wishing to purchase electric cars and American electric car manufacturers that use material imported from China. These new tariffs thus undercut Biden’s goal of getting more Americans to drive electric cars. The tariffs on Chinese goods give China even greater Inventive to challenge the dollar’s world reserve currency status. The same week Biden imposed these tariffs, China President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced they were strengthening their alliance in order to better challenge US military and economic hegemony. This is a reaction to US foreign policy of the post-Cold War era which has reversed the Richard Nixon-Henry Kissinger strategy of pursuing good relations with China. A part of the announcement recognized use of the Chinese yuan and Russian ruble for over 90 percent of the trade between the two countries. This is only the latest challenge to the dollar’s world reserve currency status. China’s share of the global economy has more than doubled in the last twenty years from 8.9 percent to 18.5 percent while the US share of the global economy has fallen from 20.1 percent to 15.5 percent. China’s rise is one reason why the US currency held by foreign central banks has dropped from over 70 percent in the early 2000s to under 60 percent today. Last year, China and Saudi Arabia agreed to expand their use of their own currencies in trade between the two countries. This is the first time the Saudis have agreed to use a currency other than the dollar for the oil trade since Henry Kissinger negotiated a deal where the Saudis would trade exclusively in dollars in return for US support for the Saudi regime. The “petrodollar” is a major reason why the dollar retained the world reserve currency status after President Nixon severed the last link between the dollar and gold.

It would also reduce other countries’ interest in purchasing US debt instruments. This would increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt, creating more price inflation and leading to a major economic crisis. This will not just end the US military and financial empire abroad. It will also end the welfare state at home. Since both major presidential candidates and most Congress members are not serious about making the changes in foreign, domestic, and monetary policy necessary to avoid the crisis, America will likely face hard times in the near future. However, the end result may be a return to limited, constitutional government and a political class that realizes that Ronald Regan was correct when he told me that no nation has ever abandoned gold and remained great.

        "description": "He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Famer for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced on behalf of his family. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Story continues below advertisement Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game.

If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candour that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Story continues below advertisement Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents. He sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Story continues below advertisement “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "content": "A browser homepage is the website that appears when you open your browser and when you click the home button. Most browsers, including the popular Google Chrome, allow users to set up separate home pages. In Google Chrome 's default settings, there is no homepage. Instead, the browser opens a startup page, and you won’t see a home button next to the omnibox unless you adjust the settings. However, you can change the startup page in Chrome and set a default homepage. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do it: Google Chrome has the same user interface on both Windows and Mac. Both Mac and Windows users can follow the same steps to change the startup page in Google Chrome: 1. Launch Google Chrome on the desktop 2. Click the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner to open the drop-down menu. 3. Select Settings from the drop-down menu. A new tab displaying the settings menu in Google Chrome will open. 4. Select On Startup from the left sidebar. 5. Choose the third option which says: “Open a specific page or set of pages” 6. Select add a new page. 7. Enter the URL for the desired startup page, then click “Add”. 8. Repeat steps 5 and 6 to add more startup pages. This will help you to successfully change the pages that Google Chrome opens every time. When you close and reopen Chrome, each page you listed will open in a separate tab. Unlike the desktop version, the Android version of Google Chrome treats the homepage and the startup page as the same. Changing the homepage setting changes the website you visit by tapping the home button, and it changes the page that opens every time you launch the app. Here’s how to set it: 1. “Open Google Chrome” and tap the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner to open the drop-down menu. 2. \"Select Settings\" from the drop-down menu. 3. Scroll down to \"Advanced settings\", then select \"Homepage\". 4. If the homepage button is turned off, tap it to turn it on. 5. Select \"Chrome's homepage\" or enter a custom web address. Select \"Enter custom web address\". This may be filled in with another web address. Either way, select the second option. 6. \"Type or paste the desired web address\" into the field. Your new custom homepage will load when you start the Chrome app or tap the home button.",

        "description": "‘Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,’ Israeli PM Netanyahu said on Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament.",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged on Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night’s attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and non-combatants in its tally. “We are actively engaging the IDF and partners on the ground to assess what happened,” a US National Security Council spokesman said on Monday. “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” the spokesman said. 04:23 GEN-Z VS GENOCIDE: HOPE FOR HUMANITY? Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state”. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. “A few hours ago, a shooting incident occurred on the Egyptian border. The incident is under review and discussions are being held with the Egyptians,” the Israeli military said in a statement. Egypt warned against compromising the security and safety of its security forces following the shooting, a high-level source told Egypt’s state-linked Al-Qahera news on Monday. Preliminary investigations showed that Egyptian security staff had reacted to an exchange of gunfire “between Israeli forces and members of the Palestinian resistance, which led to shooting in several directions”, the source said, adding that Egypt would take necessary measures to prevent the incident from recurring. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people – about half of Gaza’s population – displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks. Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and that it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally.",

        "content": "The Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) commenced the Continuous Voter Registration exercise in Edo State on Monday. The exercise aims to capture would-be voters who have yet to register ahead of the governorship election in Edo on September 21. Naija News gathered that the CVR and the PVC collection would be a 10-day exercise from May 27 to June 5, 2024, from 9 am to 3 pm daily, including weekends. Despite a call from the state acting chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Jarret Tenebe, on Friday, to cancel the exercise due to the damage to its secretariat, materials, and equipment meant for CVR, it proceeded as scheduled. In response to the call, Edo INEC’s head of Voters Education and Publicity, Timidi Wariowei, expressed dissatisfaction, stating that it is unjust to accuse the electoral body in this manner. The CVR exercise, monitored in Oredo, Egor, and Ikpoba-Okha local governments, indicated that PVC collection was also progressing alongside the continuous voter registration exercise. At the registration site in Ikpoba-Okha, Rhoda Gumus, the INEC National Commissioner overseeing Edo, Delta, and Cross River, expressed contentment with the ongoing exercise and urged registrants to wait patiently as their registrations were processed. Gumus said, “ We have been to Oredo, and we are here at the Ikpoba-Okha registration area, which we are using as our state head office registration centre because of the flood disaster that happened at our head office on Friday. “We are in touch with other registration areas within and outside Benin, and the exercise is going on smoothly. As you can see, we have registered some people, and others are still waiting. The process just started today. It is impressive and commendable . “ The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, Anugbum Onuoha, affirmed that INEC was adequately prepared for the exercise, emphasizing that the flood disaster, which damaged some of the commission’s equipment, would not hinder the operation. Onuoha said, “ We thank God for the enablement to begin this exercise, having in mind the flood disaster that destroyed some of our equipment on Friday. Due to the flood disaster, we moved our head office registration area to the INEC office at Ikpoba-Okha local government. “We are here and witnessing a large turnout of people who are here as either new registrants or to transfer their registration or for PVC collection. INEC is prepared for this exercise and nothing will make us fail. People expected us to discontinue the exercise but we were prepared even before the flood disaster happened. “Yes, we had some initial network problems, but it has been resolved, and the exercise is going on smoothly, and by the grace of God, the exercise will be successful .”",

It is understood that the Brazilian is set to leave Spurs over the next few months, and Milan, who are in the market for a right-back, have been now. The North London club are planning to continue with Pedro Porro as their first-choice right-back, which would leave Emerson with a lack of consistent first-team game time.

        "content": "The Nigeria Police, Lagos State Command, has confirmed the arrest of an online blogger, identified as Stanley Okoruwa for allegedly defaming a businessman, Emeka Okonkwo, popularly known as “E-Money”. The suspect, who was paraded before newsmen on Monday, confessed to the crime and claimed to have used the offending video to boost his followership online. Okoruwa in the said video accused the businessman of having illicit affairs with the wife of the late Nollywood star, John Odonwodo, aka Junior Pope. He also accused the businessman of being responsible for the death of the late Nollywood star, who died in a boat accident. The spokesperson of the command, Benjamin Hundeyin, told newsmen that the suspect would be prosecuted for cyberbullying and defamation of character. ALSO READ: Junior Pope’s wife: E-money confirms arrest of ‘man who defamed him’ He said that the suspect was arrested in Uromi, Delta State, following a petition from the businessman. Hundeyin said, “He is going to be prosecuted because the things he engaged in were criminal in nature. He has allegedly defamed E-Money and he is going to be prosecuted. “We are not prosecuting the suspect because of the personality involved, but because he has allegedly committed a crime, the personality goes through the normal channel by reporting the case to the police and we investigated and arrested the suspect.” Hundeyin warned social media users against content that is injurious to other people’s personalities, stressing that action may be taken against them if reports of their content were found offensive by anyone. The suspect, while speaking with newsmen, said “I did a video about E-Money. I said a lot of things that are not true in that video, that is why the police arrested me.” He added, “I said something regarding a video I saw online about a woman – saying that Sir E-Money is responsible for the things that happened to Nollywood Actor, John Odonwodo, aka Junior Pope’s case. “I said something like that, I also said that Sir E-Money was also having an affair with Junior Pope’s wife. I have never in my life met E-Money. Everything I made in that video was not true.” Continuing, he said, ” I made the video out of trying to boost my page traffic level, I never knew it would go viral the way it went. I don’t have a bad intention to spoil Sir E-Money’s name. I was just making the video, I didn’t know it would go such wide.” “I know the contents of the video were wrong of me to have made. I don’t know the video will escalate to that extent,” the suspect added. Stanley stated, ” I saw that the video was already going viral, I thought pulling it down will not make sense. I decided to leave it. I have not reached out to E-Money to apologise, because I don’t have his contact to do so. “I was already planning to make an apology video, that was when I was arrested by the police. I have been praying to have this opportunity to apologize to him. I am very sorry Sir E-Money, I don’t mean to tarnish his image, I didn’t mean to spoil his name online.”",

        "content": "World leaders were swift to condemn Israeli strikes on a tent camp in Rafah late Sunday, which killed at least 45 people and injured dozens, according to Gaza health authorities — focusing further scrutiny on Israel’s controversial offensive in the south. French President Emmanuel Macron said he was “outraged by the Israeli strikes that have killed many displaced persons” and called for “an immediate cease-fire.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he was “horrified” by the news from Rafah. “There is no safe place in Gaza,” he said. “These attacks must stop immediately.” Borrell said the attack underscored the “dilemma” facing the international community over how to enforce Friday’s ruling from the International Court of Justice, which ordered an immediate halt to Israel’s offensive in Rafah. Israel dismissed the order and said its military operations would continue. In an address to parliament Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the Rafah strike a “tragic accident” but vowed to gain “absolute victory” in Gaza. GET CAUGHT UP Summarized stories to quickly stay informed “The devastating images following an IDF strike in Rafah last night that killed dozens of innocent Palestinians are heartbreaking,” a White House National Security Council Spokesperson said in a statement Monday afternoon, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. “Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians. But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.” Qatar expressed concern that the bombardment would “complicate ongoing mediation efforts and thwart reaching an agreement for an immediate and permanent cease-fire,” as well as the release of Israeli hostages. Israel’s military confirmed it carried out an airstrike in northwestern Rafah on Sunday night based on “precise intelligence.” The strike killed two senior Hamas officials, it added, including Yassin Rabia, the commander of the group’s operations in the West Bank. A Hamas official confirmed to The Post that two of members of the group had been killed. The IDF said in a statement Monday there were “many measures taken before the attack to minimize harm to non-involved people, including using precision weaponry. Based on these measures, no harm was expected to non-involved civilians.” The incident was being investigated by an “independent body responsible for examining unusual incidents in combat,” the IDF added. The United Nations’ Middle East envoy, Tor Wennesland, called on Israel to carry out a “thorough and transparent” investigation. Video posted by local journalists in the immediate aftermath late Sunday showed charred bodies being pulled from the flaming wreckage of the densely packed encampment in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood. An Israeli strike on a camp for displaced Palestinians killed dozens in Rafah on May 26. (Video: Julie Yoon/The Washington Post) Muhammad Al-Mughair, a civil defense official in Gaza, told The Post that the makeshift camp was inside Block 2371, which he said was an Israeli-designated humanitarian safe zone for displaced Palestinians. Residents in the block were not ordered to evacuate ahead of the strikes, and there was confusion on the ground as to whether Israel had designated it a humanitarian zone. Gazans told The Post that Arabic-language pamphlets previously dropped by the Israel Defense Forces over Gaza about safe zones — a key source of information for people there — were imprecisely phrased. Al-Mughair said it was his understanding that the block was included. Tal al-Sultan tent camp as of May 24 Tal al-Sultan tent camp as of May 24 The area was not pictured in a map of humanitarian zones provided by the IDF online and in recent announcements. In its statement, the IDF said “the attack did not take place in the humanitarian area in Al Mawasi, where the IDF called for evacuations.” At least 800,00 Palestinians have been displaced by Israel’s military campaign in Rafah in recent weeks, and many have fled to Mawasi. But new arrivals have told The Post the area is desolate and devoid of even the most basic services. Of the 45 people killed in the Rafah strike, about half were women and children, the Gaza Health Ministry reported. “We are horrified by this deadly event, which shows once again that nowhere is safe,” Doctors Without Borders wrote on X. The medical organization said more than 15 of the dead and dozens of the injured were brought to a trauma stabilization center that it supports. “The images of charred bodies, including children ... are unbearable,” read a statement from the foreign office in Germany, which has been one of Israel’s strongest supporters in Europe. “The civilian population in Gaza must urgently be better protected.” European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell accused Israel of pushing forward with “military action that has been asked to stop” after Rafah strikes. (Video: Reuters) Egypt’s armed forces said it was investigating a shooting incident at the Rafah border area Monday that killed a member of its security forces. The IDF confirmed a “shooting incident at the Egyptian border” Monday, which it said it was also investigating. “A dialogue is underway with the Egyptians,” the IDF added. A former Egyptian official told the Post that details of the incident could be outlined by a joint committee as early as Tuesday, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive issue. The IDF said that eight rockets were launched from Rafah toward central Israel on Sunday and that its Iron Dome defense system intercepted a number of them. Hamas’s military arm, the al-Qassam Brigades, said it had launched projectiles toward Tel Aviv, stating that the move was in response to “massacres perpetrated on civilians.” Far-right Israeli settlers have stepped up attacks on aid trucks passing through the West Bank, using a web of publicly accessible WhatsApp groups to track the trucks and coordinate attacks, The Post reported. It comes as humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza resumed Sunday via Israel’s Kerem Shalom border crossing. A U.S. congressional delegation visited Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi on Monday, according to the government’s State Information Service. The cross-party delegation was led by Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). “The members noted Egypt’s great contribution as a pillar of regional stability,” the statement said and “they expressed their appreciation for the Egyptian efforts to establish peace and security in the region, highlighting the key Egyptian role in promoting efforts aimed at achieving a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip.” The IDF said it expanded its operations into eastern Jabalya over the past few days. It said in a Monday statement that its troops in northern Gaza killed militants in close-quarters combat, located large amounts of weaponry, and dismantled an explosives manufacturing facility and tunnel shafts. The Israel Air Force also struck a launch site in Jabalya, the IDF said, from which attacks had been launched toward the Israeli city of Ashkelon during the war. The death toll in Gaza has surpassed 36,000 since the war began , according to the Gaza Health Ministry on Monday. At least 36,050 people have been killed and 81,026 injured in Gaza since the war started, the ministry said, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority of the dead are women and children. Israel estimates about 1,200 people were killed in Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack, including more than 300 soldiers, and it says 282 soldiers have been killed since the launch of its military operations in Gaza.

        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The police recreated the mayor-KSRTC driver feud according to the complaint about the KSRTC bus driver not allowing the Mayor’s car to pass through. The complaint also alleged that the driver showed obscene gestures at the family members. The trip was recreated four days ago to confirm the allegations against driver Yadhu. On the 25th, the police travelled from Plamoodu to PMG by driving a bus, followed by a car at the same time. The cantonment assistant commissioner confirmed receiving strong evidence to support the mayor's complaint. The police found that the person in the back seat of the car could see the driver making obscene gestures. The Cantonment Police had registered a case against Yadhu for insulting women. The Assistant Commissioner stated that it is customary to record mahazar in such cases. Apart from the mayor, her husband Sachin Dev MLA, Arya's brother and sister-in-law were also in the car. Their car, which was returning after the wedding reception, was not given space by the KSRTC bus. The mayor’s car then blocked the bus in front of the Palayam shopping complex and she alleged the driver of reckless driving and also making obscene gestures. Passengers stated that Sachin Dev boarded the bus during an argument with the bus driver. The conductor's trip sheet also says that Sachin boarded the bus. However, Sachin told the police that he did not board the bus and did not disrupt the service.",

        "content": "Stock image (Image: Justin Kernoghan/Belfast Live) Police are appealing for information following criminal damage to a number of buildings in the Cookstown area. Graffiti has been noted in several areas of the Co Tyrone town, including James Street, Burn Road and Loy Street, and is being investigated as a racially-motivated hate crime. The graffiti depicts nazi symbols and uses aggressive racist language. Local policing Inspector Ross said: \"I want to assure the public that we take all reports of hate crime extremely seriously. There is no place in our society for such behaviour. Enquiries are ongoing and anyone with any information is asked to call 101, quoting reference number 1255 of 27/05/24.” Read more: Man 'covered in blood' arrested on suspicion of attempted murder READ MORE: Teenager left unconscious after group attack in park SDLP Mid Ulster candidate Cllr Denise Johnston has condemned the appearance of racist graffiti in Cookstown, some of it outside a local school. Cllr Denise Johnston said: “This graffiti is absolutely disgusting. It has no place here and it doesn’t represent people in Cookstown. I’ve been here this morning talking to people, everyone is shocked and horrified at the naked and aggressive hate that has been put on display. “I would appeal to anyone who knows anything about this to come forward to police. The recent raise in hate incidents is a serious problem and it underscores how urgently we need new legislation to deal with people who think that they can attack others in our community and get away with it. I will be writing to the Justice Minister seeking an urgent update on her promised hate crime law. “We have been in touch with the council to make sure this graffiti is removed as soon as possible.” Join our Belfast Live breaking news service on WhatsApp Click this link or scan the QR code to receive breaking news and top stories from Belfast Live.

This development followed Governor Agbu Kefas’ recent suspension of the general manager of the station. Inaugurating the committee mandated to carry out the investigation, the Taraba State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Yakubu Maikasuwa, urged its members to adhere strictly to the stated terms of reference. He also charged them to distance themselves from witch-hunting any person, urging them to be just and fair in their assignment. The committee’s terms of reference include investigating the station’s revenue inflows from advertisements and other revenue streams. The members of the committee were also urged to assess the sustainability strategies used to ensure debt reduction and savings at the station. Apart from examining the reasons behind why the station has been off the air for quite a while, the committee members are also to investigate the alleged insubordination and lack of adherence to the directive to use part of the monthly overhead to reduce debt. Overall, they have also been directed to recommend whether the station should pursue full or partial commercialisation for self-sustainability. Headed by Justice Hamidu Audu, the five-man committee, through its secretary, Liberty Andrew, has called for the submission of memoranda from the public, staff of the station and other professional unions.

        "content": "PARIS Hilton has shown off her growing babies while on a family vacation in Hawai'i. The reality star and socialite was joined by her rarely seen brother, Barron, and his own wife and kids. Paris and Barron reunited for a relaxing vacation at the Grand Wailea resort in Maui . The 43-year-old shared a series of photos and videos from her trip to her Instagram. Paris smiled as she relaxed on a pink bed, in pink loungewear, while cuddling with her kids . She shares two children with husband Carter Reum - a son named Phoenix and a daughter London . She is also step-mom to Carter's older daughter, Evie, from his previous relationship with Laura Bellizzi. Joining them on the trip, and appearing in a family photo, was brother Barron, his wife, Tessa, and their kids. \"Reliving my childhood and carrying on our family vacation tradition at the @GrandWailea with my beautiful family,\" Paris captioned the collection. In the comments section, fans lauded the hotel heiress and her children. \"Most beautiful family,\" one person commented, as another echoed, \"I cannot handle the cuteness.\" \"Being a mom is by far your greatest look,\" a third noted. While a fourth gushed, \"London is SO CUTE!!!! I don’t have enough available brain cells to process.\" As one person complimented, \"I am so happy for Paris because she got everything she ever wished for.\" Paris better enjoy her vacations while she can, because she will soon be getting back to work on a new reality show. Being a mom is by far your greatest look.\" And she'll do so with Nicole Richie , 42, more than 20 years after their first paired outing. The iconic duo previously worked together from 2003 to 2007 on The Simple Life . Paris teased her reality return on Instagram, posting a video of a classic television broadcasting static noise. Suddenly, Paris and Nicole's voices could be heard singing, and then yelling their personal theme song, Sanasa. \"New Era. Same Besties,\" she captioned. \"Coming soon to Peacock.\" Earlier this month, Paris and Nicole teased something was in the works when they posted a collage of different milestone events throughout their friendship, including early 2000s selfies and childhood snaps. \"From Day 1: Sill and Bill,\" they captioned their posts, referring to the nicknames they gave one another on The Simple Life. Once the news was official , fans online went wild. \"A pop culture renaissance!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" one person exclaimed. \"The OGs of reality show!!\" another declared. \"The real celebrities we love!! Yaaaas!! Can’t wait queens. \"So f**king excited!,\" a third added. \"I have no words but Slivin. That’s Hot!\" Paris and Nicole became household names, and punchlines, nearly two decades ago, as their reality show, The Simple Life followed the two high-end celebs experiencing life outside their bubble by working low-paying jobs . The first season aired in 2003, and documented Paris and Nicole's one-month stay in Arkansas with a farm family. A year later, the besties headed out in a pink pickup truck where they participated in many different jobs, including fishing and working as maids, for Season 2. During Season 3, the iconic duo worked several different internships across the United States , and in Season 4, they took on the role of being wives in a family. In the final season, Paris and Nicole worked at a summer camp as counselors.",

        "content": "Tom King ( James Chase ) reached another shocking low in Monday’s (May 27) episode of Emmerdale as he prepared to poison Piper the dog. Tom is currently on his own in the village due to Belle ( Eden Taylor-Draper ) spending time in a mental health unit. This development happened last week, when Belle spoke to a nurse and said she knows her mental health is struggling, and is worried about what may happen next. We know that Belle’s difficulties with her mental health are being exacerbated as a result of Tom’s abusive behaviour. During Tom’s latest plan of making it seem as though Belle was the one with anger problems, he wound her up so much, Belle pushed him to the floor in front of Rhona (Zoe Henry), Marlon (Mark Charnock) and Vanessa ( Michelle Hardwick ). To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Discovering Belle’s decision to spend time away from the Dales left Tom terrified. He had no choice but to say goodbye to Belle, fully aware she would be surrounded by people who want to help her and that she could say anything. In tonight’s episode of the ITV soap, Tom spent time with Lydia (Karen Blick). As they chatted about Belle, Tom learnt that his wife had asked Lydia to visit her. Lydia tried to tell Tom that Belle probably didn’t want him to see her in a dark place. Out of control, Tom had to come up with another plan – and it was horrific.

        "content": "Belle Dingle ( Eden Taylor-Draper ) had a meeting with her therapist in Monday’s (May 27) episode of Emmerdale. Last week, Belle decided to check into a mental health unit. As a result of Tom’s ( James Chase ) abusive behaviour, poor Belle is now struggling and decided time away from the village would be safer for her. Watching Belle drive away was challenging for Tom – and not because he found it difficult to see his wife in a dark place. All alone and surrounded by professionals who want to help her, Belle could end up telling someone about her abusive relationship – and an out of control Tom knew he had to do something about it. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Unable to visit Belle because she asked Lydia (Karen Blick) to see her instead, Tom developed a plan in the hope his wife would return home – and it involved poisoning Piper the dog. Meanwhile, in the mental health unit, Belle was speaking with her therapist. Belle started the session feeling a little puzzled. She said how in the past, when she experienced problems with her mental health, she would hear voices in her head – and that isn’t happening this time. Continuing to open up, it became apparent that Belle believed every recent thing she’d been through with Tom were all her fault. She said she makes Tom feel like he isn’t good enough and thought he had to prove himself just so they could share a house together. Belle’s therapist then put forward the theory her relapses happen as a result of triggers within relationships. ‘You think Tom’s the problem?’, Belle asked. ‘Do you think he is?’, the therapist responded. At this point, a fearful and anxious Belle said no, but then ‘I don’t know’ immediately after.

        "content": "It’s been confirmed that Ruby Fox-Miligan ( Beth Cordingly ) and Rose Jackson (Christine Tremarco) are working together in Emmerdale to destroy Kim Tate ( Claire King ). Up until Monday’s (May 27) episode, we’ve known Rose as simply Dawn’s ( Olivia Bromley ) estranged mother – and someone who is annoying Kim a great deal. All she’s been doing for the past few weeks is trying to develop a connection with Dawn and enjoying Kim’s posh drinks tray – but it seems that’s all set to change from here on in. After a brief interaction between Rose and Ruby in the pub, which established they know each other somehow, they then met up at the graveyard. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a webbrowser that supports HTML5video Rose alluded to the fact she didn’t want to be a part of Ruby’s plan anymore, because Dawn’s son Evan is poorly and it was making her feel terrible. Ruby told her friend that once their revenge is complete, she’ll be able to be a mum to Dawn – something she’s always wanted. So, what’s the plan? Split Kim and Will (Dean Andrews) up, let Ruby take Home Farm (something Caleb (William Ash) believes belongs to them anyway) and allow Rose to emotionally support Dawn when everything falls apart. It appears Ruby has been secretly developing quite the plot on behalf of her husband, who’s own plan to destroy Kim Tate failed spectacularly last year. But will it work this time?

        "description": "\"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement.",
        "content": "Bill Walton's long, strange trip Bill Walton's long, strange trip 04:30 Bill Walton, the dominant college big man who won a pair of NBA championships and later enjoyed a successful broadcasting career, has died, the NBA announced on Monday. He was 71. Walton died after a prolonged battle with cancer, the league said. He was surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, and he led the team to their only NBA title in 1977. Named the league MVP in 1978, the 6-foot-11 Walton won another title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he earned the Sixth Man of the Year award. Bill Walton attends a basketball game between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Phoenix Suns at Crypto.com Arena on April 20, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. / Getty Images But that season proved to be his last hurrah. Walton, who battled injuries throughout his career, would play just 22 more games between the regular season and playoffs before retiring in 1988, according to CBS Sports . Before his pro career, Walton earned a legendary status at UCLA, leading the Bruins to titles in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. His 44 points in the national championship game in 1973 remain a record. Walton was also a three-time national player of the year at UCLA while playing for iconic coach John Wooden. \"On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men's basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton's passing,\" UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said in a statement , adding: \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\" After his playing career, Walton overcame a pronounced stutter to become a successful sportscaster known for his color commentary, which often included catchphrases and hyperbole. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" A self-professed \"Deadhead,\" Walston sometimes appeared on TV wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts. He was also known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts while delivering his tangent-filled commentary, which could be equal parts entertaining and bewildering. Bill Walton watches the action during the second half of the college basketball game between the Arizona Wildcats and the New Mexico Lobos at McKale Center on December 20, 2016 in Tucson, Arizona. Chris Coduto/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. He is survived by his wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke, a former NBA player and now an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. More from CBS News Richard M.

        "content": "The National Treasury has invited views from the public on the Draft Government Owned Enterprises Bill 2024. Members of the public have been asked to submit written comments or memoranda before close of business on June 14, 2024. Further, members of the public have been invited to attend in-person public consultations on the Bill in Embu on June 11 at the Kenya School of Government, Eldoret at Sirikwa Hotel and Mombasa at the School of Government. The National Treasury will collect views in Kisumu on June 13 at the Tom Mboya Labour College. The exercise will be conducted in Nairobi at the Bomas of Kenya and Garissa at Government Guest House on June 14. Members of the public are expected to give their opinions on policy priorities in the reform of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs). The government is moving to reform struggling SOEs in line with agreements arrived at with multilateral lenders. The reform of State Owned Enterprises has been a key part of the ongoing US$4.43 billion (Sh586 billion) programme between Kenya and the IMF. The new policy reforms seek to accelerate privatisation processes of State Owned Enterprises and put in place more streamlined governance structures with clear roles and responsibilities among the entity stakeholders (boards, management, employees). Other priorities are efficient utilisation of budgetary resources, better management of fiscal risks and enhanced accountability. The government introduced the draft policy proposals as it seeks to merge struggling parastatals. The World Bank said the mergers will be focused on most vulnerable SOEs and those with overlapping/duplicated mandates. An Executive Order dated May 24, 2024, said some 25 SOEs would be wound up and their roles channeled back to parent ministries. Prior to this, the government had in November 2023 released a list of 11 loss-making parastatals it said would be privitised The are Kenya Literature Bureau, Kenyatta International Convention Centre, National Oil Corporation, Kenya Seed Company Ltd, Mwea Rice Mills, Western Kenya Rice Mills Ltd , Kenya Pipeline Co, New Kenya Cooperative Creameries, Kenya Vehicle Manufacturers Ltd, Rivatex East Africa Ltd and Numerical Machining Complex. The government is also developing a Management Information System for the National Treasury and Economic Planning to help strengthen its capacity to monitor and analyse SOEs. The latest update on the restructuring of State Owned Enterprises was made public on April 30, 2024. It said 25 SOEs were proposed for closure and transfered back to the parent ministry or relevant state corporations, 25 others earmarked for privitisation while 41 SOEs with overlapping/duplicated were proposed to be merged. The government indicated that only 158 startegic state corporations would be retained.",

        "content": "Mumbai: The alignment work of Andheri's Gopal Krishna Gokhale bridge with CD Barfiwala flyover is on schedule and expected to be completed within a month. So, the BMC is planning to open the northern arm of the flyover for traffic movement by the end of June, said a senior civic official. The one arm of the newly constructed east-west connector, Gokhale Bridge, was opened on February 26. However, due to the height gap of nearly six feet between the Gokhale and Barfiwala flyover, the motorists are facing inconvenience. After facing severe criticism for the blunder, the BMC undertook the alignment work of both the structures from April 14. \"The disparity between both structures, previously around 1350 mm, has been significantly reduced to just 100 mm as of last week. The work is expected to be completed in the next 2- 3 days. All the work is expected to be completed by June 5, after which the remaining work involves casting and curating,\" said a senior civic official. The work is carried out under the supervision of experts from the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT- B) and Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute (VJTI). Meanwhile, the launching of girders and completion of work including surfacing of the railway portion on the southern arm of the Andheri's Gopal Krishna Gokhale bridge has been pushed back to November 15. The civic body has allowed the extension of five and half months for the contractor on Monday. So, the entire Gokhale bridge will now be open for traffic only by March 31, 2025. However, the BMC has also imposed a penalty of Rs. 3 crore on the concerned contractor for the delay.",

        "content": "Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said on Monday that India has progressed rapidly under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last 10 years and that today Indian Army has become more powerful than ever before. Adressing a public meeting in favour of BJP candidate from Anandpur Sahib parliamentary constituency, Subhash Sharma, at Jujhar Nagar in Punjab’s Mohali, CM Dhami said, “Give strength to PM Modi by ensuring victory of BJP candidate Subhash Sharma from Anandpur Sahib. Every vote of the public will strengthen the hands of PM Modi”. He also highlighted achievements of the PM Modi-led BJP government in last ten years. “PM Modi is serving the country by considering the whole country as his family. In the last 10 years, India has progressed rapidly under the leadership of the PM Modi. Today, India’s voice is heard seriously in the world. India has made its mark on the world map. Today the construction work of IIT, IIM, AIIMS, airports, highways, expressways is going on. India has become the fifth largest economy in the world,” CM added. The Chief Minister said, “On June 1, unite and vote for the lotus button”. All the 13 Lok Sabha constituencies of Punjab will go to polling on June 1 in the seventh and final phase of voting. The CM added: “The resolution of a developed India will lead to all-round development. G20 was successfully organized in the country. We have a Prime Minister in the form of Modi Ji who lives, works and thinks only for the national interest. Today the Indian Army has become more powerful than ever before. Today the army knows how to answer bullets with bullets,” CM Dhami said. He also referred to the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, abrogation of Article 370 and construction of Ram Mandir. The BJP has promised to implement the Uniform Civil Code on the lines of Uttarakhand in the entire country (If it comes to power), he said. The Chief Minister said that under the leadership of the PM Modi, the Kartarpur Sahib Corridor has been constructed. Veer Bal Diwas is being celebrated in the name of the four Sahibzadas of Guru Govind Singh Ji. Their history has been brought before India and the world. Under the leadership of Modi ji, in August 2021, three sacred copies of the holy Guru Granth Sahib of Sikhism were brought to India from Afghanistan with full respect, CM Dhami said. He said that there are also big places of Sikhism in Uttarakhand. The doors of Hemkund Sahib have opened in Uttarakhand. Hemkund Yatra is very difficult. To simplify the Hemkund Sahib Yatra, PM Modi ji has laid the foundation stone of ropeway there. Ropeway work has also started for Kedarnath, CM Dhami said. “Before 2014, scams used to come to the fore every day. The opposition is only doing the politics of appeasement. Congress has started the work of snatching the reservation of Other Backward Classes and giving it to a particular class. Aam Aadmi Party has left Congress behind in corruption. The head of their party himself has gone to jail, its people just want to cheat others. Congress and AAP are working together to cheat the countrymen,” CM Dhami said. He said that in Haryana, Congress and AAP are contesting elections together and in Punjab, “These people are fighting among themselves. The condition of Punjab is worse than ever under the rule of AAP”",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Mbah inaugurate 8th Traditional Rulers Council, charges them on community security Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Mbah inaugurate 8th Traditional Rulers Council, charges them on community security Published on May 27, 2024 By Emmanuel Ugwueze Enugu State governor, Dr. Peter Mbah, has inaugurated the 8th Council of the Enugu State Traditional Rulers Council, charging royal fathers to take charge of the security of their respective communities through partnership with the government across all levels. This was even as the Chairman of the Council, Igwe Samuel Asadu, the traditional ruler of Edem-Ani Autonomous Community in Nsukka Local Government Area of the state, assured that traditional rulers in the state would key into the administration’s vision, mobilize against insecurity and ensure the success of the government. Governor Mbah, who inaugurated the council on Monday at the House of Chiefs Chamber of the Enugu State House of Assembly Complex, Enugu, stressed that the functions of the traditional institution go beyond being custodias of culture and tradition to fostering peace and unity as well as serving as the eyes and ears of the government. “We are also taking this opportunity to remind ourselves that beyond being the custodians of our tradition and culture, you are also the ears and eyes of the government in your various communities so that when we talk about security challenges we are having in communities, we expect to work with you in partnership to address those security challenges,” he said. The governor further enjoined the royal fathers to work closely with the government and their subjects, serving as agents of positive change in the communication process in a way that their subjects would understand and appreciate the policies and programmes of the government on education, infrastructure, healthcare, security, and their general wellbeing. Highlighting some of the impactful projects the administration was executing across communities in the state, Governor Mbah explained that the government was taking deliberate steps to ensure that no child of learning age is denied quality education through the 260 smart green schools across the 260 electoral wards, adding that education, training of youths on skills acquisition and human capacity building that the state had already embarked were serving as the greatest weapons against insecurity. He said the robust programmes of the administration would be difficult to accomplish if traditional rulers continue to live outside their communities since they are the eyes and ears of the government who have roles to play in community development. While congratulating the new council, the State Commissioner for Chieftaincy Matters, Hon. Okey Ogbodo explained that the process leading to the selection of the council was based on fidelity, integrity and commitment to the robust development programmes of the government to the people, saying the criteria was in line with section 3(1) of the state traditional rulers law. Reacting, the Chairman of the council pledged not to disappoint the state as they would continue to ensure the success of the administration. Igwe Asadu, while describing the governor as an agent of positive change whose landmark achievements cut across communities, said the first state-financed project in the history of their community was instituted by the Mbah administration. “The governor said he would provide water in Enugu within 180 days, and he made it happen. He talked about roads, you can see it happening everywhere. He talked about smart schools. I’m very honoured that, that was the first time my town received anything from the government,” he further disclosed.

        "content": "Sport | Football Transfer news LIVE! Arsenal are keen to strengthen in attack, as they prepare for another busy summer transfer window. The Gunners are reportedly in a battle with Bayern Munich and Barcelona for £43m-rated Nico Williams, while Newcastle star Alexander Isak has been linked too. It is also claimed they will contend too with Tottenham and Manchester United for French starlet Desire Doue. United are eyeing defensive reinforcements, with Chelsea ’s Levi Colwill said to be on the shortlist. Chelsea are hoping to sign both Crystal Palace winger Michael Olise and Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford, though need a new manager first as they close in on top target Enzo Maresca of Leicester in the race to succeed Mauricio Pochettino, who, along with Thomas Frank, has been sounded out to potentially replace Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford with a decision over the Dutchman’s future expected this week following an end-of-season review. Kieran McKenna is now understood to be out of the race , but Roberto De Zerbi is an option. Tottenham are said to be lining up the likes of Ivan Toney, Jarrad Branthwaite and Evanilson as part of ambitious summer plans, while Liverpool could look to make either Leny Yoro or Leeds winger Crysencio Summerville their first signing under new boss Arne Slot. Follow all the latest transfer news, rumours and gossip live below! Latest transfer news and rumours Live updates Ivan Toney is available for between £30-40million this summer. That’s according to TEAMtalk, with it claimed that Brentford have been forced to lower their valuation as the striker enters the final 12 months of his contract. Ange Postecoglou is believed to have urged Tottenham to sign a striker this window, with Toney high on the wishlist, and a reduced asking price has significantly improved Spurs’ hopes of getting their man. Barcelona and Bayern Munich are among the clubs interested in a summer move for Nico Williams. Recent reports have suggested Arsenal are very keen on the 21-year-old, who plays for Athletic Bilbao and is believed to have a release clause of around £43m. However, according to Relevo, Bayern are eyeing Williams and will monitor him at the Euros, while Barcelona have long admired the winger. Levi Colwill is among the centre-backs being considered by Manchester United. The Daily Star claim that United are refusing to meet Everton’s £80m asking price for Jarrad Branthwaite, and will be on if it is not lowered to around £60m. It’s suggested that other targets being lined up are Chelsea’s Colwill, Marc Guehi and Juventus defender Gleison Bremer. One manager not on the move this summer is Unai Emery. The Aston Villa boss has signed a new five-year contract, after leading the club into the Champions League. His time in England with Arsenal didn’t work out, but Emery is evidently loving life at Villa, committing his future through to 2029. Sofyan Amrabat has indicated that he could yet stay at Manchester United this summer. The Moroccan midfielder has endured a difficult season-long loan spell at Old Trafford from Serie A side Fiorentina, starting only 10 matches in the Premier League and limited to a lot of substitute cameos under Erik ten Hag. However, Amrabat’s influence grew as he showed signs of improvement during the final stages of the season, starting the last three Premier League matches and also Saturday’s surprise 2-1 victory over champions Manchester City in a memorable FA Cup final triumph at Wembley that guaranteed Europa League qualification for next term. Amrabat’s previous struggles to convince during a season that resulted in an eighth-place Premier League finish - their worst league position for 34 years - had led many to believe that there was very little chance of United exercising their €25million (£21m) option to sign him on a permanent basis this summer, having already spent €10m (£8m) on the initial loan deal. However, his recent resurgence could have changed minds. \"Do I already know what I’m going to do next year? No. We are going to talk,\" he told Dutch outlet Ziggo Sport. \"Staying is certainly an option. Look, I think it has been a very difficult season. For Manchester United it needs to be much better, and also for me personally.\" Read more on that here! The manager fun continues... Graham Potter has been out of management since he was sacked by Chelsea, after what proved to be a disastrous move from Brighton. The Guardian report that Potter is now in contention for a Premier League return... with Brighton. The Seagulls are on the hunt for a new manager after Roberto De Zerbi’s departure, and Potter is being considered Kieran McKenna is increasingly likely to remain at Ipswich. The Athletic report that McKenna is now expected to sign a long-term contract, ensuring he will lead the club in the Premier League next season. Chelsea have already moved on, but McKenna was still a target for Manchester United and Brighton. Newcastle are considering a move for Burnley goalkeeper James Trafford. Recent reports have suggested Chelsea are keen on Trafford, who was recently named in England’s pre-Euro 2024 training squad and is believed to be valued at around £20m. However, the Mail report that Newcastle are also now considering a move, after refusing to meet Arsenal’s £30m asking price for Aaron Ramsdale. Kevin De Bruyne, Ederson and Bernardo Silva all face uncertain futures at Manchester City. The Times report that Ederson and De Bruyne are both attracting interest from clubs in Saudi Arabia. Ederson in particular could be persuaded to make the move, it is suggested, while De Bruyne is a target as he enters the final 12 months of his current contract. Silva will be allowed to leave this summer if City receive a £50m offer. PSG and Barcelona are both keen, but the Spanish side are unlikely to be able to afford the fee. Over to the latest on Manchester United’s managerial situation now. We know that Erik ten Hag’s Old Trafford future will be determined this week during an end-of-season review by the club, with speculation that he is still likely to be removed despite Saturday’s FA Cup success at Wembley making it an obviously more difficult decision. However, the Manchester Evening News now report that United are actually considering keeping Ten Hag for next season, informing the representatives of potential new managerial candidates that they have not ruled out retaining their current boss. Ten Hag has one year left to run on the three-year contract he signed after swapping Ajax for United in the summer of 2022, with the Red Devils possessing the option to trigger a further 12 months beyond that. The plot thickens... Have your say...",

CM Arvind Kejriwal said, “Home Minister Amit Shah has challenged 3 crore people of Punjab yesterday. He said after June 4 they are going dismiss the elected government of Punjab. This is dictatorship. People of the country will not accept it. I have come to ask all 13 seats from you. I assure that only the voice of Punjab will echo inside Lok Sabha. In the last 10 years whoever you elected has not raised your concerns. We will raise issues of Punjab in Lok Sabha and find out solution to all the issues which are pending with the centre.” He further said that there is no use voting for BJP, Akali Dal or the Congress. “If you vote for the BJP or Akali Dal then it is of no use. If you vote for Congress they will start quarrelling against us. Give all the 13 seats to AAP we will work together,” he added. AAP’s Pawan Kumar Tinu, INDIA alliance’s Charanjit Singh Channi, NDA’s Sushil Kumar Rinku, and Akali Dal’s Mohinder Singh Kaypee will contest elections from Jalandhar Lok Sabha seat. Earlier Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday targeted the AAP for not living up to the promises assured to Punjab and criticised Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for making the state a hub of corruption. Slamming the government of AAP, Amit Shah claimed that AAP is a government that is known for breaking promises. “This is the government of the AAP party, it is a government which breaks promises. Rs 1000 were not given to every mother and sister, Punjab was not made drug-free in a month, and 16 medical colleges were not opened up in the state,” Shah said. All 13 Lok Sabha seats of Punjab to go for polls in the 7th phase of the Lok Sabha elections on June 1. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP’s) Lok Sabha candidate from Jalandhar Pawan Kumar Tinu and Punjab Minister Balkar Singh were also present",

The accelerator speeds up electrons to create the ultrabright light researchers use to study materials. Officials said that the replacement started Monday and will continue over the next six months to move, refurbish and install several systems and devices. “It will substantially improve reliability and will keep our facility operating at high availability along with the world’s best synchrotrons for the next decade and beyond,” said Mark Boland, CLS Machine director.

        "content": "A kitchen fire that broke out over the weekend has forced the closure of a popular Clinton Township diner. The fire at Ken’s Country Kitchen in the Amore Plaza shopping center on Hayes Road was reported after 3 p.m. Sunday, a short time after the employees had left the building for the day, the owner says. Zef Camaj, who co-owns the restaurant with Alex Gjelaj, said before workers left, they had thoroughly cleaned the kitchen. He suspects one worker may have accidentally knocked a pilot on a grill, which eventually sparked the blaze. “The thing is, we recently completed a remodeling of the building, completely revamped it,” Camaj said. “We couldn’t make it better than it was.” Clinton Township Fire Department administrators were not available to comment Monday because of the holiday. The diner was known for its breakfast dishes, Camaj said. Ken’s Country Kitchen was a consistent winner in the Macomb Daily’s annual reader’s choice contest, and had also won similar contests with the Detroit Free Press and WDIV-TV (Channel 4). “The lucky part is, no one was inside when this happened, so nobody was injured. We are happy about that,” Camaj added. Ken’s Country Kitchen had originally opened in the 1990s at the Clinton Township location. In recent years, the partner decided to venture out to the northern part of the county, and opened one on Main Street, north of Division Road (32 Mile Road) in Richmond. The owners say they are offering some of the 20 employees work at the Richmond location until the Clinton Township one is refurbished. When that will be obviously isn’t known at this point. The eatery must deal with its insurance carrier on the damage and related details before it can plan on repairing the facility. “Hello, we will be closed until further notice,” the owner posted on his Facebook page. “We will keep you updated as soon as we know more details.” Camaj also urges Clinton Township customers to drive out to Richmond to enjoy the home cooking they have come to enjoy. “I can tell you this: We will reopen and when we do, we will be better than ever,” he said.",

        "content": "The move by the National Assembly to replace the current national anthem with the former one through an expeditious legislative process suffered a setback on Monday. Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Lateef Fagbemi, who attended a public hearing on the matter organized by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, warned that the issue of the National Anthem, should not be treated with legislative fiat. He said as commendable as the move by both Chambers of the National Assembly may be, enacting a law on National Anthem or replacing the current with the old demands that, Nigerians are carried along. Fagbemi said: “In some cases, national anthem emerges from open national competition among interested citizens. In other instances, the proposed national anthem is subjected to plebiscite or referendum, before its eventual adoption or declaration. He argued that “The essence of the foregoing is to secure the buy-in and confidence of the people and to ensure that the anthem meets their collective aspirations and suits their contemporary socio-political conditions.” “Against the background of the foregoing, I am of the considered opinion that the revered issue of choice of a national item should not come into being only by legislative fiat, or presidential proclamation alone. According to him, “the decision to change Nigeria’s National Anthem whether by replacing it with the old one or a new one, should be subjected to a wider process of citizen participation through zonal public hearings, resolutions of the Federal Executive Council, Council of State, National and State Assemblies, etc. “The outcome of this process is bound to be a true reflection of the wishes of the generality or majority of Nigerians.” Former minority leader of the Senate, Eyinnaya Abaribe, said he was totally against the move because the second stanza of the National Anthem is the country’s national prayer. He also revealed that his senatorial district was totally against the move, as there are more pressing issues that require the attention of the Federal Government. He said: “While we support the efforts of the Federal Government under President Bola A. Tinubu to ameliorate the difficulties that Nigerians face today of biting inflation, crippling unemployment and widespread insecurity, we do not feel that it is a priority to embark on a homegrown National Anthem 46 years after its adoption by Nigerians. “The reasons given for such unseemly haste to revert back to the colonial era anthem ark rather nebulous and mostly self-serving. “Reverting to an anthem that harks back to our troubled past as a nation does not enhance unity. Rather it reminds us all of nomenclatures such as ‘Tribes, Tongues’, Natives’ which divides us as a nation and which led to the unfortunate civil war. “The present anthem has a second stanza that is used as our National Prayer. Thus, going back to the old anthem will make the nation be put even further apart as it will mean we will not have a National Prayer. The lawmaker contended that the present National Anthem was accompanied by a pledge which all children and patriots recite at official functions. “Will reverting back to the old anthem not mean abrogation of the pledge since they go together? He queried. “The peoples of Abia South Senatorial District are desirous of policies and plans to reduce the pump price of petrol from the present 1.000 naira per litre in Aba, the 224 naira per kWh of electricity, the more than 100% increase in food prices than going back to an anthem written by a colonial citizen of Britain and bequeathed to Nigerians at our independence in 1960. Therefore, the people of Abia South Senatorial District in their entirety reject the bill to revert back to the old anthem.” In his submission at the public hearing , the Minister of Information and National Orientation, Alhaji Mohammed Idris Malagi, recommended that the scope should be expanded to include a robust issue on national identity rather than limiting it to change of national anthem. The Minister who was represented by the Director-General of National Orientation Agency ( NOA) , Mr Lanre Issa-Onilu, noted that some lines in the old national anthem does not make a complete meaning. “The issue of national anthem is just a sub-sect. What we should be looking at is the National Identity Act. “The challenge we have today is that we do not have a value national identity which the national anthem is one of them. It is not about singing in schools, it is about learning it and imbibing it.” Also cautioning the National Assembly on expeditious passage of the bill, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), called for wider consultations for Nigerians to accept whatever National Anthem is proposed and buy into it . According to him, the National Assembly should widen the scope of participation in the process of coming up with such an Act for general acceptability . He however supported the move to replace the current “Arise O Compatriots National Anthem” with the “Nigeria, We Hail Thee”, the country started with, in October 1960. He said such a move was long overdue since the current National Anthem adopted in 1978 , does not have the required gravitas and not inspirational to fire the passion and zeal for Nationhood among Nigerians. Nigeria, according to him, will not be the first country in the world to replace current National Anthem with the old one as over 20 countries like Russia, Austria, Chile, France, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil, Iran, Iraq etc, have done so at different times in the past.

        "content": "The 33rd edition of the COMEX Global Technology Show opened in Muscat on Monday heralding significant technological advancements and investment pledges exceeding RO60mn on the first day. The event, presided over by H H Sayyid Theyazin bin Haitham al Said, Minister of Culture, Sports and Youth, is seeing the participation of over 100 local and international tech institutions. Organised by OITE in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology (MTCIT), the exhibition – running until May 30 – aims to foster digital investments, as it displays cutting-edge technologies and electronic services. H E Dr Ali bin Amer al Shidhani, Undersecretary for Communications and Information Technology in MTCIT, highlighted the National Programme for Digital Economy’s objective to increase the digital economy’s GDP contribution from 2% to 10% by 2040. This ambitious goal is supported by eight executive programmes for sectors such as digital industry, artificial intelligence, e-commerce and cybersecurity, the undersecretary informed. “Since the launch of the National Programme for Digital Economy in October 2021, the information and communications technology sector has seen investments of over RO1bn (US$2.5bn),” stated H E Shidhani. He noted that these investments have primarily enhanced communications technologies, data processing, and cybersecurity. He also underlined the significant increase in the value of agreements and projects announced at this year’s COMEX compared to the previous year, with new initiatives aimed at developing technical infrastructure and supporting the digital economy through the Omani Investment Authority. The opening ceremony was marked by several key agreements that will boost Oman’s digital infrastructure. These agreements include the establishment of the largest national data centre by Oman Data Park and Middle East Information Systems Company at US$25mn in the first phase; a strategic partnership between Omantel and Google to set up a regional centre for edge cloud services at RO2mn; and another significant agreement with Amazon Cloud Services to create a sovereign cloud service centre and an integrated e-commerce platform in Oman at a cost of RO24mn. An agreement was also signed among MTCIT, ITHCA Group and Nortal Company, to develop and design the Unified National Portal for electronic government services. H E Shidhani informed that MTCIT is set to launch several high-value projects, including the Omani Linguistic Model and the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum. Additional initiatives include the Unified National Portal for Government Services and the Special Technology Zone for Startups. Amr Baabood, CEO of OITE Group, appreciated the role that the COMEX exhibition was playing in showcasing contemporary digital transformation opportunities for over three decades. “This event plays a crucial role in enhancing understanding of rapid global technological advancements and their impact on economic diversification,” Baabood said.",

There's no discernible reception, and no staff to be seen, so for a few minutes I can kid myself that I am popping in to pick something up before returning to the huge garden. Sunlight streams into the art filled, comfortable living room (to the right of the front door) and snug seating area (to the left of the front door). The newly opened Dining Room can be glimpsed straight ahead, next to which the winding staircase leads up to the nine en suite bedrooms. This listed Georgian mansion was once home to a Michelin Star restaurant, but was bought in 2022 by Cabin Studio (the team behind London's Sessions Arts Club). They've been running the Garden Cafe, situated within the home's 20 acres, since last year and have only just reopened the Dining Room. Situated in what was once the grand house's breakfast parlour, The Dining Room's menus utilise the home grown produce wherever possible, venturing further afield around Scotland only when necessary.

        "content": "New data from Visit Scotland has shown a growth in popularity of Scotland's farm shops, with more than a fifth of holidaymakers visiting a farm shop or farmers' market during a trip to Scotland. The Scotland Visitor Survey 2023, one of the biggest undertaken by the national tourism organisation found 22% of visitors said they spent time at a farm shop or farmers' market. The activity was particularly popular with visitors from Australasia with almost a third (30%) highlighting the experience.

There are also delicious home-made soups, sandwiches and cakes to tuck into.

        "content": "They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I'm more in the 'get your own bloomin' ideas, pal', camp. When I saw that this place was opening, I was stoked. I genuinely thought the Glasgow restaurant, Sugo, which is owned by the people behind west coast pizza restaurant Paesano, was coming to the Capital. The branding and concept was so similar that my brain short-wired when it came to the actual name. We spread the word. My husband's Sicilian colleague was ebullient. He couldn't wait. Then we did a double take. Oops. Our mistake. Anyway, I still thought I'd pay it a visit, though they'd got my hackles up. Everyone wants a restaurant to be 'authentic', even if that's just an expertly cultivated illusion. If you think someone has cynically copied a successful formula, that idea is shattered. But, you know, maybe it's all an accident. They're not identical, after all. Unlike Sugo, Ragu, which is owned by the people behind Salerno Pizza at St James Quarter, has got someone making pasta in the window, as if George Street is a wholesome version of Amsterdam's De Wallen. They also haven't gone for a communal seating arrangement. That's a point in their favour, as I'm not into being the meat in a stranger sandwich. We bagged a comfortable green leatherette booth, in this vaguely... Gaby Soutar",

        "content": "Was Johnny Wactor Married? Wife, Family Details and Cause of Death Revealed By Johnny Wactor’s death has left many deeply shocked. The talented actor was most well known for his role in General Hospital and many fans are curious about the actor’s personal life in the wake of his sudden death. Here are all the details of his personal life and what happened to him. Did Johnny Wactor have a wife? No, John Wactor wasn’t married and didn’t have a wife. Wactor had always kept his personal life away from the public eye, making fans curious whether he was in a relationship or not. As per , in 2022, he was allegedly linked with Kaitlin Sullivan, following their posted close moments on his social media handle. The two never openly confirmed their low-key relationship. Their shared images also now seem to be deleted, indicating that they might have parted ways earlier. Moreover, it was reportedly known that he was single and was focused on his acting career before his untimely death. Johnny Wactor cause of death As per , Johnny Wactor died when he was shot by one of the three suspects who came to rob a vehicle’s catalytic converter on Saturday near Pica Boulevard and Hope Street. Wactor’s mother Scarlett spoke with and gave out details on what happened to her son. She revealed that he and his co-worker were returning from their bartending duties at a rooftop bar around 3 am or 3:30 am. That’s when they saw three men whom he thought were towing his car. However, when Wactor interrupted them, a masked man shot him. Wactor was quickly taken to a local hospital. However, it was too late by then and he didn’t survive. Johnny Wactor’s death was confirmed by his agent David Shaul in an official statement, released by Variety, where he shared his kind words. “Johnny Wactor was a spectacular human being. Not just a talented actor who was committed to his craft but a real moral example to everyone who knew him. Standing for hard work, tenacity and a never give up attitude. In the highs and lows of a challenging profession he always kept his chin up and kept striving for the best he could be. Our time with Johnny was a privilege we would wish on everyone. He would literally give you the shirt off his back. After over a decade together, he will leave a hole in our hearts forever,” Shaul said. The police have opened an investigation and are on the search for the three suspects, who ran away from the crime scene. Shazmeen is a writer, entertainment journalist, and movie aficionado at core. She holds a degree in multimedia and mass communication, specializing in advertising, but her ardor for cinema led her into entertainment journalism. While her cinematic preferences know no bounds, she specifically has fondness for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, psychological thrillers, horror, and films with profound philosophical undertones.

        "content": "In short: The federal Department of Parliamentary Services is facing allegations of a toxic culture that silences dissent and covers up problems. Critics say the department has largely been overlooked in the reckoning that happened at Parliament House in recent years. It comes amid reports of a relationship between the two top public servants within the department. It's the government department tasked with protecting Australia's democracy, yet within it bubbles accusations of a toxic culture, the silencing of dissent and the routine cover-up of problems. The department governs Parliament House but some of its staff are so suspicious and fearful of those running it, they regard it as a workplace where \"the walls have eyes\". The ABC has spent months speaking to public servants — past and present — plus politicians and their staff from both sides of the political aisle, as well as people who have worked across a range of professions at Parliament House, all of whom would only speak under the condition of anonymity. Repeatedly and without prompting the word \"toxic\" was offered about the Department of Parliamentary Services (DPS). And yet efforts to scrutinise its operations, its management and practices are practically impossible — by design. That's because DPS has been granted extraordinary and unique isolation from standard methods of scrutiny — and by someone who once promised to meet the public's higher expectations. The department is exempt from Freedom of Information laws — a change Anthony Albanese, as the then leader of the House of Representatives, introduced as an \"interim measure\" more than a decade ago. Rob Stefanic gave evidence about Ms Saunders to senators in February but didn't disclose their relationship. ( AAP: Mick Tsikas ) To its critics, DPS has largely been overlooked in the reckoning that happened at Parliament House in recent years, where a spotlight has been shone on the culture and treatment of staff following Brittany Higgins's...

        "content": "Muttrah, the landmark tourist attraction in Muscat, will soon undergo major transformation with the addition of an iconic Muttrah Square Project, a multi-storey car parking and several cafés around the neighbourhood. The Municipal Council of Muscat on Monday held its fifth meeting of the year, chaired by Sayyid Saud bin Hilal al Busaidi, Governor of Muscat, in the presence of Ahmed al Humaidi, Chairman of Muscat Municipality. On the sidelines of the meeting, Humaidi said, “The municipality is finalising detailed maps for the development of Muttrah, which includes the enhancement of corniche and the establishment of cafés and restaurants in the residential neighbourhoods.” Additionally, the municipality will commence the implementation of the Muttrah Square Project during the third quarter of this year, he informed. “A tender has also been issued for the construction of a multi-storey car park in Muttrah to alleviate traffic congestion.” Muttrah Square Project involves construction of an iconic bridge in the shape of an arch looming over the middle of the square by the sea, which had won the first edition of the Bilarab bin Haitham Award for Architectural Design. Inspired by the sword of Imam al Salt bin Malik al Kharusi, the iconic structure will offer a view of all the famous landmarks of Muttrah. The arched bridge will have a mixed-use plaza, a dancing fountain, retail stores and cafés. During the meeting, the council reviewed the Omran Group’s statement regarding the Sultan Qaboos Port waterfront development project. Omran is leading the redevelopment of the area, projected to be crucial in transforming Muttrah into a premier tourist destination with the highest international standards. The national project aligns with Oman Vision 2040 and the National Tourism Strategy that seek to enhance efforts to create unique tourist destinations and experiences. The multi-use tourism project will adhere to considerations set by the Oman Investment Authority, ensuring it adds value without disrupting the port’s location, historical, and architectural heritage.",

Speaking during the inauguration and swearing-in ceremony of executives, the union chairman, Gbamigboye Aremu said the gesture was to ease the affairs of the residents of the town. He said, “The reason why we donated the generating set was due to the complaint by those working in the maternity centre that they don’t usually get light during the delivery of pregnant women. “After the complaints, we the executives of the union tasked ourselves and get the generator for the maternity to aid their service delivery. “Also, the leadership of the market women came to us that they needed us to renovate their toilets for convenience which we also do. “We also cleared the bushy portion of Imesi to Esa-Oke road which has been abandoned by road users. Motorists are scared to pass the road for fear of being kidnapped but now, we have cleared the road and expanded it and our people can make use of it now.” Aremu appealed to the leadership of the community maternity centre and market to make proper use of the donated equipment and toilet. “I want to appeal to the beneficiaries to make proper use of the donated equipment. We have done our part and we are still aiming to do more but they also have to maintain those things judiciously .” The monarch of the town, Adeyemi Adediran, appreciated the union for their kind gesture, calling on sons and daughters of the community to always give back to their community.

This announcement was made at the opening of the COMEX Show on Monday. During the exhibition, Brigadier Nasser bin Musallam al Ruzaiqi, Director General of Information Technology at ROP, explained that the police department launched several comprehensive new services, including renewal of vehicle registrations through self-service machines, e-linking of the Supreme Judicial Council for marriage registrations and payment of traffic fines using payment portals such as Thawani and Tasdeed. The new service also includes reprinting of lost vehicle licences via self-service kioks after submitting the request through the ROP app, he added. “The Royal Oman Police is making great efforts to contribute to achieving the objectives of Oman Vision 2040 by introducing innovative initiatives, preparing thoughtful plans, qualifying and training human cadres, and harnessing available resources,” Brigadier Ruzaiqi elaborated. He stressed the continued modernisation and development of ROP’s technical system using the latest technological tools and means, such as artificial intelligence. In this context, Brigadier Ruzaiqi added that the ROP mobile app provides a comprehensive platform for inquiry and payment of local or Gulf traffic and municipal fines whether of an individual or a company. “Users can download violation reports, search by service category and period, and view e-payment history.

        "content": "The Minnesota Timberwolves find themselves in a tough spot, trailing 0-3 going into game four vs the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals. With elimination looming, conversations are already shifting towards what next season might hold for this roster. NBA insider, Evan Sidery (Forbes Sports, Sporting News) , shared some interesting insights about the Timberwolves’ plans this offseason, a topic that has been in the back of many minds, given the luxury tax penalties that loom large over the organization. Minnesota Timberwolves running it back in 2024-25? Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels’ new contracts both kick in next season, not to mention a $14 million raise for Karl-Anthony Towns. In total, the Wolves are one of only two teams already projected into the 2nd apron of the league’s luxury tax system, which will cost a projected $50 million tax payment next year. That’s why many are questioning whether or not the Wolves could trade Karl-Anthony Towns and blow up their big three . Some even suggested that Jaden McDaniels could be on the trade block too . But in a somewhat convoluted Twitter post Monday, Sidery tried to put Minnesota Timberwolves fans at ease, writing that the Timberwolves are “very likely to run it back next season”. The Timberwolves will be paying $172.4 million to five players next season: Karl-Anthony Towns = $49.3 million Rudy Gobert = $43.9 million Anthony Edwards = $42.3 million Jaden McDaniels = $22.9 million Naz Reid = $14.0 million Minnesota’s ongoing ownership war featuring Glen... pic.twitter.com/ujFTO0vKiX Minnesota’s ongoing ownership war featuring Glen Taylor vs. Alex Rodriguez and Marc Lore is another interesting wrinkle to their long-term roster decisions. Minnesota will very likely run it back next season, but Rudy Gobert becomes extension-eligible this offseason. If the Timberwolves fork over a lucrative extension to Gobert, what does the immediate future hold for Towns? As we get ready to enter the offseason, there are plenty of uncertainties swirling around the Timberwolves organization. The biggest immediate question surrounds their ability to do the impossible and turn this series around. Then there’s the Tim Connelly opt out , and the ongoing ownership war ... As fans eagerly await answers, it’s clear that significant decisions lie ahead that will shape the trajectory of the franchise. Keeping the core team intact would be an expensive way to show fans that the organization is willing to invest in the club, no matter whose name is on it when this all shakes out.

        "content": "THE Blue Kumuls and FC Genesis clashed in a thrilling encounter that showcased the best of their skills, with both teams refusing to yield in the Port Moresby soccer association men’s premier division match on Saturday. In the end, they had to settle for a hard-fought draw, leaving both sets of fans eagerly anticipating their next showdown. Both teams wasted no time when five minutes from kickoff, Blue Kumuls were awarded a free kick just outside the penalty box. Hans Tapio (15) unleashed a powerful shot that ricocheted off the crossbar. After that, Genesis upped the ante, launching a sustained attack that yielded two successive corner kicks. Unfortunately, they couldn’t capitalise on the opportunities. Play continued in Genesis half of the field with Blue Kumuls midfield team of Steven Inia and Tapio probing the Genesis defence when a sneak pass found Jordan Kaven (11) who shot from within the box right on the 18th minute for Blue Kumuls to lead 1-0. A scramble in the Blue Kumul’s penalty box ten minutes later found Genesis number 16 Ezekiel Vela with a loose ball that he calmly pushed past keeper Baniau to level the scores at 1-1. The game’s intensity increased with the occasional push and shove that drew a couple of yellow cards to both sides. Blue Kumuls Inia occasionally tried using wide balls but was cut off by the defence of Nathan Togs and his company of youthful defenders for Genesis. Three minutes to half-time Genesis number 4, Stanley Kila picked up a missed ball by a Blue Kumuls defender only to miss what could have been the easiest of goals. Genesis came back in the second half all fired up with right winger Kaniyosi making his usual runs let loose a shot that hit the left post much to the delight of the supporters on the sidelines. Midfielders led by Benjamin Kila continued with their threatening runs into Blue Kumuls territory but the strikers time and again could not find the mark with their shots. Number 16 Vela made several attempts at goal but most were wide also. Niebo and Ara also made attempts for Genesis without much success. Ten minutes later a clearance header from a corner to Steven Inia found henchman Tapio who shot unchallenged from the edge of the box to just tip the crossbar. That miss brought deafening sighs to the Blue Kumuls supporters. Inia continued with his through balls when a pass landed in front of teammate Steven Giwibing (2) who fumbled right in the box much to the dismay of the sighing supporters. A minute to time Steven Inia was assisted off-field with an injury with the scores remaining at one all until full-time. Marty Terry of Blue Kumuls commented saying: “ We had our chances but could not finish off well. “And yes both teams played well also’’ Genesis’s Emmanuel Liosi said: “Blue Kumuls is a respected team in the premier division and when you play them you take them seriously. “Yes our youthful team did their best but we did miss a lot of chances also.”",

        "content": "The caravan, which Mr Browne admits he acquired for €1,600 just four weeks ago, was to be intended as a cost-effective alternative to B&Bs and hotels Reporter: Reporter 27 May 2024 7:15 PM A 71-year-old security guard, William Browne, was shocked to discover his caravan, purchased a month prior, was missing from his property after returning from his early morning shift. Speaking to Joe Duffy on RTÉ's Liveline, William, who starts work in Dublin at 5am, was informed one morning last week by his daughter at approximately 10am that the caravan had been taken. It was confirmed that South Dublin County Council's Environmental team removed the caravan following several complaints from local residents. The caravan, which William admits he acquired for €1,600 just four weeks ago, was to be intended as a cost-effective alternative to B&Bs and hotels. Originally from Wexford, now living in Clondalkin, he said that he had planned to use the caravan for visits home, especially during summer when relatives come to visit. Despite words from council staff that the caravan was not an issue as long as it was unoccupied, William was surprised by the action taken against him. It is said that a notice citing the Housing Miscellaneous Provisions Act required him to remove the \"temporary dwelling\" within one day, with warnings of a €1,270 fine. The caravan, which they joked was something from 'Father Ted,' was on a grassy spot until it was seized. \"There's an patch of grass, westbound, at the side of my house and there's surveillance there on the wall, and that's where the carvan was,\" said William. Later, Joe responded: \" What did they think you were doing? Setting up a halting site or something.\" After calling the council's environmental office after receiving a letter regarding the caravan, William received no answer so took to visit the Tallaght-based office. It said that the situation remains unresolved, and the caravan is still seized. William, who also owns a small boat and a jeep which can pull the caravan, was disappointed over the council’s actions. Given previous health struggles which he detailed on the show, including past heart surgery, a stroke, diabetes, and chronic asthma, William told Joe of his worries on his health regarding the stress of the ordeal. South Dublin County Council have been contacted for comment on the matter, but had not replied at time of publication.",

        "content": "Katie Price shared a post detailing 'five reasons the narcissist hates you' months after her split from Carl Woods. The former glamour model, who is currently dating Married At First Sight UK star JJ Slater, was previously engaged to Love Island star Carl. The duo were in an on-ff relationship since they first started dating in 2020. They were believed to have split up again in November last year but sparked reconciliation rumours the following month when they were seen together . Not long after, Katie was seen enjoying cosy nights out with JJ before confirming their relationship on social media. Katie, who doesn't shy away from sharing cryptic posts about her exes, recently took to her social media to share a post about narcissism on her Stories. The post read: \"Five reasons the narcissist hates you: 1. You've stopped falling for their lies 2. They've lost the control they once had over you 3. You've cracked their facade and see them for who they really are 4. You're no longer desperate for their approval 5. Their schemes and tricks don't work on you anymore.\" Katie shared a new post about narcissism on her page ( Image: Instagram/ @katieprice) The duo, who were in an on-off relationship for a few years, split last year ( Image: Getty Images) Back in February, Carl made a few digs about the split as he praised himself for getting himself through the tough period. Carl vowed to keep a 'low profile' and focus on himself after the breakup. Taking to his Instagram stories, the former Love Island star made a number of digs at his ex-fiancée. In one story post, Carl showed off his adorable new puppy as he joked that his new pet pooch was 'doing his head in'. However, he also commended his dog's immense 'loyalty' as he said it was the 'most important thing'. In another story, Carl re-shared an inspirational video which said: \"God knows when to send you exactly what you need. Being private, staying low-key, and not telling everyone everything is self-care. Seek respect, not attention.\" Carl then appeared to reference his split with Katie as he re-shared yet another inspirational video. \"I love you enough to let you go,\" the video started. \"Go find that person that you say is better than me. Everything hurts when you love somebody. I love for real.\" Meanwhile, Carl and Katie's other ex Kieran Hayler united at Silver Leas Polo in Hertfordshire and looked all smiles as they shared a video of their outing on social media. However, one of their mutual pals present couldn't help but point out the meeting was \"awkward\", while jokingly putting a hand to their mouth as the camera panned around. This isn't the first time Kieran and Carl spend time together as they previously celebrated Easter Sunday as a duo - which allegedly left their famous ex furious.

        "content": "Lionel Messi’s annual salary he receives from Inter Miami has been revealed by the press sources. Lionel Messi gets $20.45 million annual net salary from Inter Miami, making him the highest paid player in the American League, according to The Guardian . This is ahead of the whole clubs which do not pay this much amount to their full-player rosters. With $12 million as a basic salary, in addition to various bonuses, the Argentine player joined Inter Miami. As Messi earned 138 million euros in one season during his last contract with Barcelona in 2017, the Argentine player’s salary at Inter Miami does not appear to be the best in his football career. Messi’s Barcelona salary had a value that included more salaries and bonuses before he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in 2021. With a contract extending until the end of 2025, Lionel Messi became part of Inter Miami in July of last year. Moreover, he rejected the idea of ​​​​leaving for the Saudi League, after receiving an astronomical offer from Crescent Moon.",

        "content": "JEOPARDY! has been bashed by fans for overturning an incorrect answer. Fans of the game show said that the contestant's answer was not the same as what the answer was and said host Ken Jennings should have asked him to clarify. Amar Kakirde chose the category \"Date of Birth\" for $400 on the May 24 episode. The question read, \"Jan. 3, 2009, with the mining of the Genesis block.\" Amar's contestant, Has, buzzed in with \"Minecraft,\" which was wrong. Then, Amar buzzed in and said, \"Blockchain.\" \"Also, incorrect,\" Ken, 50, said. Anna Marie did not buzz in by the time the buzzer went off. Ken revealed the answer to be Bitcoin. The game went on as usual and the contestants moved on to different categories. However, when Jeopardy! came back from a commercial break, Ken made an announcement before they continued on with the game. \"First off, we have a little surprise for Amar that does not involve rats or crabs,\" he said. \"Our judges have decided to accept his response of the Blockchain, so that's going to add $800 to his score.\" This pushed Amar into the lead with $4,500. Amar nodded with a slight smile on his face before they started the next round. Although both Bitcoin and Blockchain were invented in 2009, fans pointed out that the idea for Blockchain was thought of at least 20 years before bitcoin. Jeopardy! first aired in 1964 until 1975. Then the nighttime version began in 1974. Since then, spinoffs of the game show have emerged. Here they all are: Jeopardy! - (primetime) 1974 to present, weekdays on ABC at 7pm. Tournament of Champions - 1984 to present, features the top champions who have appeared on the show since the last tournament. Celebrity Jeopardy! - 1992 to present, has celebrities compete against each other to raise money for charity. Jeopardy! Masters - 2023 to present, features six notable recent Jeopardy! champions competing against each other. Jeopardy! National College Championship - 2022 to present, undergraduates from 36 colleges and universities across America compete to win $100,000. Other versions of Jeopardy! have fizzled out throughout the years. Bitcoin is a type of digital currency, which allows users to pay using encryption algorithms. Blockchain is a database that is used to record transactions. Amar went on to win the game . A Reddit user asked if they judges should have overturned Amar's answer because technically they were not the same thing. \"Bitcoin and blockchain are not the same! The clue as it was written unambiguously refers to Bitcoin: the genesis block of the Bitcoin blockchain was mined on Jan. 3, 2009,\" the original user said. \"However, the idea of the blockchain dates back over two decades before Bitcoin. David Chaum, who has done tons of work on digital currency, proposed a blockchain protocol in his PhD dissertation in 1982.\" \"While all blockchains have a genesis block - simply the first block on that respective chain - the use of the definite article ' the genesis block' together with the date in the clue makes the answer 'blockchain' far too general to be ruled correct in my opinion,\" they ended. Many fans agreed and said they weren't sure of the rationalization to overturn it. \"I think if Ken asked him to be more specific instead of outright ruling it incorrect he would’ve gotten the right answer,\" one fan said. \"Agree with this. The opportunity for 'be more specific' was lost,\" a Reddit user replied.",

        "content": "Egypt’s Minister of International Cooperation, Rania Al-Mashat, highlighted the need for a more flexible and inclusive international financial system to accelerate the implementation of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in Africa. She made this statement during the annual meetings of the African Development Bank (AfDB) held in Nairobi, Kenya, under the theme “Africa’s Transformation, the African Development Bank Group and Reforming the Global Financial Architecture”. The meetings, which took place against a backdrop of economic resilience in many African countries, focused on the bank’s commitment to creating a fair financial world to drive sustainable development and climate action. Despite a challenging global economic environment, 15 African countries have recorded production expansions exceeding 5%, and the AfDB’s “African Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook 2024 Report” predicts that Africa will remain the fastest-growing region in the world after Asia. Al-Mashat emphasized that the AfDB meetings were a continuation of global discussions on reforming the global financial structure, which began earlier this year at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. She pointed to reports indicating that Africa needs $1.3 trillion annually to meet its sustainable development needs by 2030, underscoring the necessity for increased financing and a more adaptable financial system. During the meetings, Al-Mashat participated in various discussions and held bilateral meetings with bank officials and development partners such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The role of multilateral development banks in transforming the continent was also a key topic, with the AfDB advocating for better cooperation between these institutions, multi-year strategies, and increased funding. The AfDB is a significant development partner for Egypt, having provided over $7bn in development financing to finance 115 operations, including over $1bn for 24 private sector operations. Al-Mashat’s participation in the AfDB meetings followed her involvement in other international gatherings, such as the annual meetings of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the annual meetings of Arab financial institutions, and the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.",

        "content": "Former cricketer Virender Sehwag fondly reminisced about celebrating the 2007 T20 World Cup victory with Shah Rukh Khan and his nine-year-old son, Aryan Khan . Sehwag recalled keeping young Aryan entertained, leaving a lasting impression on Bollywood's Baadshah. During a Fever FM Beyond The Boundary podcast episode, Sehwag recounted Shah Rukh Khan's arrival at their post-victory party, drawing everyone's attention. Observing Aryan seated alone, Sehwag joined him, engaging in a conversation. Sehwag even shared some advice for Shah Rukh, to which Aryan responded humorously, highlighting their enjoyable interaction. Shah Rukh fondly remembers Sehwag's entertaining company for his son. The interviewer noted Shah Rukh Khan's reputation for entertaining everyone and asked if Sehwag wanted to entertain him for a change. Misunderstanding, Sehwag began singing 'Tu Jaane Na' from 'Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani,' assuming Shah Rukh was featured in the song, which actually stars Ranbir Kapoor and Katrina Kaif. The Khan family's fervor for cricket is renowned, particularly with Shah Rukh Khan co-owning the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). During the IPL 2024 final at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, SRK, accompanied by his wife Gauri Khan and their children—Aryan, Suhana, and AbRam—attended to cheer for their team against the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), ultimately celebrating KKR's triumph.",

        "description": "Coimisiún na Meán’s Online Safety Code is a set of rules that will apply to video-sharing platforms who have their EU Headquarters in Ireland.",
        "content": "AN UPDATED DRAFT Online Safety Code has been criticised for not addressing “toxic” algorithms. Coimisiún na Meán, Ireland’s online and broadcast media regulator, The final code will set binding rules that will apply to video-sharing platforms who have their EU Headquarters in Ireland. Coimisiún na Meán has submitted the Code to the European Commission and once that process is complete, it will be applied later this year. The final Code will be part of Coimisiún na Meán’s overall Online Safety Framework, which aims to make digital services legally accountable for how they protect people, especially children, from harm online. The code will introduce obligations on video-sharing platforms that prohibit uploading or sharing harmful content, including cyberbullying. It will also prohibit the promotion of self-harm or eating disorders, as well as prohibit incitement to hatred or violence. The code will also require platforms to use age verification measures to prevent children from encountering pornography or violent videos. It will also provide parental controls for content which may “impair the physical, mental, or moral development of children under 16”. Coimisiún na Meán said the code will give it the tools to address the root causes of harm online, including the availability of illegal content, and inadequate protections for children on social media services. The Online Safety Commissioner, Niamh Hodnett, said the updated Code “is an important step forward to hold platforms to account for keeping people safe online”. However, the Code has been criticised by CyberSafeKids for not addressing “toxic” algorithms. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) said it is “disappointed that measures to address toxic algorithms have been removed from the Online Safety Code”, and noted that a previous draft included requirements to turn off recommender systems. The recommender system is an algorithm that uses data to suggest items that a social media user might be interested in. An ICCL spokesperson said recommender systems “push hate and extremism into people’s feeds and inject content that glorifies self-harm and suicide into children’s feeds”. ICCL Senior Fellow Dr Johnny Ryan called it a “dangerous U-turn” and added that social media users should be given the “freedom to decide for themselves whether they can be profiled and fed algorithmic content”. And while CyberSafeKids welcomed the Code described it as a “landmark development”, it also expressed concern at “the fact this code does not address the recommender system”. A spokesperson for CyberSafeKids, an Irish charity which works to help children, parents and teachers navigate the online world, said a lot of “harmful content coming through a child’s feed originates from this algorithm”. The spokesperson added that at times, the social media feeds of children and young people are “overwhelmed” by harmful content, and they called for this to be “meaningfully addressed”. The Code also prohibits platforms from processing children’s data for commercial reasons, but CyberSafeKids said it is concerned that video-sharing platforms “will find ways to circumvent this if possible”. And when deciding on a user suspension, a video-sharing platform is obliged by the Code to assess cases in a “timely, diligent and objective manner”. CyberSafeKids said this “lacks the specific parameters we believe are necessary”. Online campaigning platform Uplift also criticised the Code for not addressing “toxic” algorithms. Its director Siobhán O’Donoghue said this was an opportunity to “change to the rules for how suggested content is directed at social media users”. “Turning off recommender systems by default would mean that these profit hungry platforms can’t just decide to flood teenage girls with weight loss content or push porn and gambling content at young men or abusive content targeting election candidates that spreads like wildfire on social media,” said O’Donoghue. She said a move to “force” video-sharing platforms to “stop automatically sending content based on your personal information, and instead giving users the choice to decide what you, would have been a game changer”.",

        "content": "Fatigued, breathless, filled with constant aches and pains in her ribs, and entirely lacking in energy, sales assistant Pritpal Kaur knew she was deeply unwell. “I could have slept all day,” says the 73 year old from Hillingdon, West London, of her symptoms, which began in May 2023. “I was back and forth to my GP surgery telling them about what was happening to me, but they offered no solutions.” Then one morning, things took a dramatic turn. “I couldn’t move at all,” says Pritpal. “I was meant to get up for work but I was in so much agony I was screaming. My daughter Minreet helped me to slowly get out of the bed and took me straight to the GP, who finally saw I was in so much pain that I was sent to A&E.” There, preliminary tests and scans found nothing, so Pritpal was sent home with a referral for an ultrasound to check for gallstones, which also came back clear. “At this point I couldn’t even take a full breath,” she recalls. “Eventually I was sent for a CT scan, which showed a narrowing of one artery, so I was diagnosed with mild angina and given blood thinners, but I continued to feel worse and worse.” Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' \"Cancer really just wasn’t on my radar\" ( Image: COLLECT) Over the next few months, Pritpal developed severe lower back pain and cramps all over her body. “I went back to my GP yet again. This time I was fobbed off with the line that it was all down to old age and arthritis . “That just didn’t make sense to me. A few months before, I had been fit and active. I had run the London Marathon in April that year, so I knew it had to be something more serious.” At her wits’ end, in August Pritpal put in a complaint with PALS (the Patient Advice and Liaison Service), which offers confidential advice, support and information on health-related matters, at her local hospital. After explaining her symptoms once more, and that she felt she was getting worse, the cardiology team assessed her again and confirmed angina wasn’t the root of her issues. Returning to her GP surgery in tears of pain, Pritpal was sent for a blood test that picked up irregularities, while a bone density scan uncovered lesions and holes. An urgent referral to the hospital’s haematology department followed. “Despite all my symptoms, hearing the doctor talking about blood cancer was still a huge shock. I’d never heard of myeloma before. He said they would need to do a bone marrow test to confirm the diagnosis, but I still believed I would be given the all clear,” says Pritpal. “I am such an active person, I eat healthily, I’m a vegetarian and don’t drink. Cancer really just wasn’t on my radar.” There are over 24,000 people living with myeloma in the UK, with about 5,900 people diagnosed each year. According to Myeloma UK, 50 per cent of those with the cancer waited over five months for a diagnosis, with 31 per cent diagnosed via an emergency route such as a trip to A&E. Pritpal with her husband Rajinder ( Image: BBC) These are some of the longest delays out of any cancer in the UK. Pritpal waited over two weeks for her bone marrow results and when they came, in September 2023, the news was not good. “In an instant, my life turned upside down,” she recalls. “I just thought ‘this is the end of my life – how will my husband, Rajinder, cope?’ “I was told that if I didn’t have chemotherapy my bones would crack and I could go into kidney failure and die. If I’m honest, I didn’t want to have the treatment. I was scared because in the Asian community there’s a lot of negativity around chemo, but I spoke to my family and decided it was the best thing to do.” Myeloma is currently an incurable cancer, although treatment can be very effective at controlling the disease. Seven months on, consultants are telling Pritpal she has responded really well. “I hope there is light at the end of the tunnel as I continue on the treatment which is for life,” she says. “I just want to get back to walking and swimming, and be back at work. I miss my colleagues and having some kind of normality.” Unsurprisingly, Pritpal says she is still angry at the delays she experienced in her diagnosis. “I could have been diagnosed much earlier,” she says. “ I now have a hunchback and have lost height because of the damage the cancer has done. I wasn’t checked for myeloma, even though I had all the symptoms.” Pritpal is now campaigning to raise awareness of cancer, particularly among the Asian community where, she says, “It is a taboo – cancer isn’t talked about. “When I told people I had myeloma, some wouldn’t give me a hug and some even stopped talking to me. It’s as if they feel it’s contagious. It has been really hard. People I thought would be there for me didn’t even ask how I was. It’s an isolating place to be. “Cancer is tough to live with, but it’s even harder when you are from a community where there is so little understanding of it. Some won’t tell others if they have it because they feel they will be judged. There are others who mistrust the NHS and put off getting checked for symptoms. I would have left it too if I hadn’t been in so much pain. “We need to speak up more and help others. Raising awareness is so important. I would hate for someone else to be in my position. If something doesn’t feel right, get it checked.” For more information, visit Myeloma UK at myeloma.org.uk, or call their infoline on 0800 980 3332 Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress",

        "content": "PARIS, France, May 27 – Rafael Nadal’s return to the French Open – and possible farewell – ended at the first hurdle as the 14-time champion lost to Alexander Zverev. The 22-time Grand Slam champion was beaten 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 by the in-form German fourth seed. Nadal has become synonymous with Roland Garros but, in front of a partisan crowd, he could not replicate the level which has made him almost unbeatable on the Paris clay. The 37-year-old indicated when he missed last year’s French Open that the 2024 season could be his final one on tour. He has also said he does not know if this will be his final time at the clay-court major – but it remains a “big chance” it will be. Nadal arrived on Court Philippe Chatrier – the scene of many of the finest moments of his career – to a thunderous reception from a packed stadium. While nowhere near his scintillating best, the former world number one showed flashes of the brilliance that has made him so loved, but not enough to stringently test Zverev. It was only Nadal’s fourth defeat in 116 singles matches at Roland Garros and Zverev became the third man – after Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021 – to beat him there. “I don’t know if it’ll be the last time I’m going to be here in front of you. If it is I have enjoyed it,” Nadal said in an on-court speech. “The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt.” With some fans crying in the stands, Nadal departed to another standing ovation as the crowd showed their appreciation for the tournament’s finest champion. Anticipation for Nadal’s return had been frenzied all day, with fans of the iconic champion – easily identified by Spanish red and yellow flags and ‘Gracias Rafa’ T-shirts – milling around the arena as soon as the gates opened. After a dismal defeat by Hubert Hurkacz in Rome last month, Nadal had not even been sure if he would be ready to compete here. Rafael Nadal leaves in possibly his last ever match at teh French Open. PHOTO/Roland Garros/X In a bullish pre-tournament news conference, he said he quickly found the motivation to return and felt his practice session showed he could “play against anyone”. Practice is very different to a match, of course, and Nadal knew that. He also knew he faced a monumental task against Zverev. With the 275th-ranked Nadal unseeded at Roland Garros for the first time, having barely played because of injury in the past 18 months, it left him vulnerable to facing a leading player when the draw was made. Zverev is considered one of the finest players not to have won a major title and, being a strong clay-court athlete, stands a good chance of finally joining the pantheon of Grand Slam winners over the next fortnight. He reached the 2022 French Open semi-finals, retiring against Nadal after a nasty fall which led to a serious ankle injury, and tuned up this year by winning the Rome title earlier this month. The way in which the 27-year-old played against Nadal reiterated why he is among the favourites. Zverev’s performances at Roland Garros will play out alongside a trial over domestic violence allegations. Zverev has denied the charges, with a hearing set to begin on Friday in Germany. An ominous start for Nadal saw Zverev break in the first game of the match, with a poor drop shot into the net and a double fault from the Spaniard heavily contributing. Each mistake by Zverev early on was cheered by the pro-Nadal crowd and, after saving two break points for a 3-1 lead, the German exerted his control before breaking again for the set. Nadal, playing with more aggression and intensity, raised hopes again by moving into a 4-2 second-set lead. But as quickly as belief increased, Zverev took it away. The Olympic champion remained composed, upping his level in the 10th game to break back with some precise ball-striking. The gravitas of the occasion was illustrated by Nadal’s great rival Djokovic, along with defending women’s champion Iga Swiatek and Wimbledon men’s champion Carlos Alcaraz, sitting in the stands to watch. Like the second set, they watched Nadal move a break up in the third before buckling again under more pressure as Zverev stormed back from 2-1 down to 4-3 in front. Nadal, as he has always done in his illustrious career, refused to give up and created two break points in the eighth game, but Zverev came through in a strong finish. “The first round wasn’t the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances,” said Nadal. “But it was not enough against a great player.”",

        "content": "Speaking in a recent interview with , the Newcastle-born footballer was asked which stadium he would love to play in and the Ipswich star responded with “St James’ Park”. Davis continued by saying: “It’s incredible how it’s turned around, everyone up there in Newcastle is so happy at the minute.” When asked if his biggest ambition is to play for the Magpies, the defender responded by saying “Definitely.” Newcastle have been linked with a move for Davis in recent months with stating that the Tyneside club and West Ham are keeping an eye on the 24-year-old as a result of the impressive season he has had at Portman Road. The left-back has featured in 44 matches for Ipswich this season, producing two goals and an eye-catching 21 assists. With a contract expiring in 2025, a big offer could see Ipswich sell the star, and it remains to be seen if Newcastle make the defender’s dreams come true. Newcastle interested in Ipswich Town’s Leif Davis Left-back has been a problematic position for Eddie Howe this season with the Magpies boss often having to play Dan Burn in the role due to a lack of options. Howe began to trust Lewis Hall towards the end of the campaign and the 19-year-old responded positively. The defender is set to join Newcastle permanently from Chelsea this summer and that will hamper any potential deal for Davis. The Tyneside club have no need for the Ipswich star at present unless the full-back is happy to play a support role.",

        "content": "CHENNAI: Mitchell Starc bowled a sensational opening spell to fire Kolkata Knight Riders to their third Indian Premier League title with a eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Sunday final. Kolkata bowled out Hyderabad for IPL’s lowest total of 113 in a final as Australia’s left-arm quick Starc returned figures of 2-14 to live up to his top billing in the world’s most lucrative T20 tournament. Starc went to Kolkata for a record $2.98 million in the December auction and ended the IPL with two stellar performances, including a match-winning 3-34 in the first play-off to hammer the same opponent. Kolkata’s batsmen had it easy and despite Sunil Narine’s early departure, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, who made 39, and Venkatesh Iyer, on 52 not out, helped the team home with 9.3 overs to spare after a partnership of 91. Iyer, a left-handed batsman, reached his 50 in 24 balls and hit the winning runs to trigger celebrations for Kolkata, who remained the most dominant team after they ended top of the table with 20 points in the league phase. Skipper Shreyas Iyer was unbeaten on six, and at the other end, when Kolkata players came rushing on to the pitch and the stadium fireworks went off. “Great night for KKR. What a game, what a season,” player-of-the-match Starc said. “Probably the two most exciting teams in the final. We have had a fantastic squad of bowlers and batters, our staff have been fantastic to get everyone peaking.” On the pressure of his high price tag, 34-year-old Starc said: “There’s been jokes about the money. I am experienced, that’s helped with all the expectations.” Players and national teams now move into the T20 World Cup starting June 1 in the West Indies and the United States. ‘Mom is watching’ Afghanistan’s Gurbaz, who left the tournament midway through to be with his ailing mother back home and returned for the play-offs, said: “My mom is watching from home. “She is feeling good now. I asked mom before the match if she wanted anything. She said just the win,” added the wicket-keeper-batsman. Kolkata’s co-owner and Bollywood superstar actor Shah Rukh Khan was in attendance and congratulated his champion players after he suffered from a heat-related illness in the first qualifier in Ahmedabad. It was Kolkata’s second title triumph at the venue, after they won their first trophy in 2012, and a near-capacity crowd at the 36,000-seater stadium cheered on. Narine, a left-hand batsman and a right-arm spinner, ended as the player of the series with 488 runs as an opener and 17 wickets. Gambhir effect Apart from the big signing of Starc, they got Gautam Gambhir as mentor after the former India batsman led the team to their first two titles, including in 2014. Hyderabad skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bat first and go with his team’s strength of scoring big, after they racked up IPL record totals of 277 and 287 in this year’s edition. Hyderabad took Cummins for $2.5 million in the same auction and made him captain after he led Australia to two titles, including the World Test Championship and the ODI World Cup last year. “So many (positives), the style with which the guys played especially with the bat. Lot of skills to get to 250 three times,” said Cummins. “I loved how brave the guys were. It was a lot of fun, great season.” But it was Starc who took the limelight as he struck in his first over when he bowled in-form Indian batsman Abhishek Sharma, for two, on a delivery that pitched in the middle and caught the top of off stump. Travis Head followed his fellow left-hand opener Abhishek to the dug-out, caught behind for his second duck in three matches off fast bowler Vaibhav Arora. Starc struck again and the opposition top-order was in disarray at 47-4 inside seven overs. Andre Russell took down Aiden Markram for 20 and wickets kept tumbling as fellow South African Heinrich Klaasen fell for 16. Cummins, who was dropped on 10 by Starc, took the team past 100 before falling for 24 off Russell, who ended with figures of 3-19. — AFP",

        "content": "One of Canada’s best track athletes will compete at the Victoria Track Classic at the University of Victoria’s Centennial Stadium on Wednesday, June 12. Lucia Stafford qualified for the Paris Olympics after a strong performance in Los Angeles and will compete in the women’s 800 meters in Victoria. “Lucia recently made Olympic standard in a strong 1500-meter field in Los Angeles with a time of 4:02. That makes her the fastest in Canada at this time as she builds towards Paris,” said Rowan Debues-Stafford, Track Classic Meet Director. The Victoria Track Classic includes men’s 100m, women’s 100m hurdles, men’s and women’s 400m, 800m, and 1500m races, and women’s discus. It is a world-sanctioned event, and competitors can earn points to secure selection for national or Olympic teams. “It’s awesome to be competing in Victoria,” Stafford said. “This is the home track for both my siblings, so it’s like a home meet in some ways.” The Victoria Track Classic was founded in 1988 and has hosted various Canadian Olympians, including Melissa Bishop, Diane Cummins, Angela Chalmers and Debbie Scott, in the 800 and 1500 meters. “The West Coast has been kind to me so far this season, so I’m excited to get back out here, surrounded by the Canadian track community, as I fine-tune ahead of Nationals and Paris,” Stafford said.

        "content": "Relatives of alleged murder victim Kyle Schuiling who might have hoped to see his accused killer left court Monday disappointed. Defence counsel Kirsten Lancee appeared on behalf of accused killer Christopher Stack in connection with the discovery of Schuiling’s body near a burned-out field west of the city in early April. Lancee, appearing as agent for lawyer Andrea Urquhart, said that while Urquhart had received a certificate from Legal Aid to represent Stack, she can’t take the case because of a conflict between the lawyer and Schuiling. As a result, defence counsel Tonii Roulston will be taking over the file and Lancee asked Justice Jim Ogle to adjourn the case for two weeks so the lawyer can review initial disclosure and seek further materials from the Crown. “Ms. Tonii Roulston of our office does not have the same conflict as she does not know the victim,” Lancee said. The Calgary Court of Justice judge ordered Stack detained on the murder charge. Because of his charge Stack can only seek release on bail in Court of King’s Bench. Following the brief court appearance three members of the deceased’s family declined to comment on the case. Stack, 39, was arrested by Mounties earlier this month and charged with first-degree murder in the death of Schuiling. He was on release on other charges, including three counts of possession of stolen property and failing to comply with probation at the time of his arrest. Schuiling’s remains were found April 3 by Tsuut’ina firefighters while battling a grass fire near Hwy. 8 and Range Road 40 in Rocky View County, about 12 kilometres west of Calgary. Schuiling’s Facebook page stated he worked as an oilpatch roughneck, was living in Vancouver and had studied addictions counselling at a Calgary career college. Prior to Stack’s arrest, Schuiling’s family had released a photo of him in the hopes it would assist investigators. A cause of death has not been released. Stack’s case is back in Calgary Court of Justice on June 10. -with files from Steve Jenkinson X: @KMartinCourts",

Allin made the decision to head back to Washington for the Dynamite taping in Everett on May 15 once he heard about Eddie Kingston’s injury, but there was still the matter of getting himself cleared . “I said I will do anything to see if I can get cleared. But right then and there, I just start driving back to Seattle because Dynamite was happening that Wednesday. So I do a 12 hour drive to Seattle. [I’m] so tired, trying to get clearance as I’m heading there,” Allin explained. “Literally, I’m in a boot, a walking boot, as I’m driving still. Me taking the walking boot off as soon as I get to the building was the first time I’d taken the boot off since the injury. I put my foot in a shoe for the first time and it was like, ‘Whoa! Alright, let’s see what happens.’ And I literally got clearance right before that Dynamite.” Darby Allin wasn’t sure how being back in the ring would feel. He also noted how being cleared doesn’t mean he’s 100% better, noting how his nose was in bad shape before returning to TV. “My foot is still so swollen. My nose still feels like insane,” Allin explained. “For a while, [doctors] told me that my nose was like Jello. If you touch it [in the wrong spot], it will just explode.” Check out a full recap of all of the mayhem in the Anarchy In The Arena match here .

Charlie agrees to produce the film, but with a twist – he wants to turn it into an action-packed Middle Eastern espionage adventure. To complicate matters, Charlie lies to the studio, claiming that Bobby, a key person involved in the production, insists on having Deidre, who has been avoiding Charlie, sent to South Africa to help.

        "content": "A DOG groomer has started to notice how some pooches are putting on the pounds. They shared how the two breeds in particular were not only starting to change shape, but also exhibiting bad behaviors. They were taking note on the noticeable changes they had witnessed. \"Anyone else getting big Scotties lately?\" the groomer asked in a post on Pet Groomer Forums . \"For the past several years, the Scotties and Westies have been getting bigger and much heavier bodied,\" they added. And that wasn't the only difference they had noticed in the dogs. They explained how their legs also seemed to be getting shorter and more \"crooked\" in the front. They also blamed the pet parents for at least part of it. \"And then the owners fatten them up,\" they said. \"Almost can't do front legs on them anymore.\" They also had to put up with another pungent problem. \"And they stink - really oily coats and tons of skin problems that are just awful to cure,\" they said. \"Really temperamental, too.\" They were certainly not making their job any easier. \"The Scotties have really big heavy jaws and big teeth,\" they said. \"They don't snap - they really bite hard and will fight the muzzle and thrash their head till they get it off.\" They weren't sure if the modifications were being done purposefully by breeders, but regardless of the reason, they wanted to stay away from these troublesome types. \"I'm scared they will harm themselves or I will hurt it just trying to wrestle it for doing feet,\" they said. \"After grooming one I can't get the stink off of me and everything has to be washed. \"Yuck! Getting turned off Scotties and Westies.\" The Scottish Terrier is a solidly compact canine according to the American Kennel Club . The average Scotty is ten inches tall with males weighing up to 22 pounds and females averaging 18 to 21 pounds. Expert advice from Dr. Sara Ochoa, who has been practicing veterinary medicine for over five years. Ochoa told The U.S. Sun observing a dog's behavior can provide clues that they might act out. “A dog that looks tense all over with its fur sticking up or teeth showing is more likely to snap,\" she said. “Staring real hard without blinking could mean trouble too. \"Growling is also a warning the dog is getting mad.\" She said dogs may tuck their tail between their legs when they feel scared or threatened. “Staying calm and keeping space may help things not to escalate if a dog seems on edge,\" she said. They are described as being known for their short stature and wiry topcoat. These hunters also enjoy brisk walks. Meanwhile, the West Highland White Terrier, known as the Westie, should weigh between 13 and 15 pounds, according to the American Kennel Club . The ideal proportions are 11 inches at the withers for the males and eight inches for the females. They are usually known for their \"good balance.\" Their body between the withers and the root of the tail is slightly shorter than the height at the withers. They are also short-coupled and have a roundish appearance. Another user could relate to their story about one of the breeds. \"I love the Westies, I do, and the three Scotties I see are all really good, but one is huge - 35 pounds last vet visit - and another one has those terrible legs,\" they wrote. \"She had to have metal plates put on both of them because of some weird bone disease,\" they added. The commenter also had beef with another breed - the schnauzer. \"All of them look alike and scream bloody murder if you touch their beards or try and shave their heads or ears,\" they said. \"They all are puppy store purchases and are under a year old so I'm betting on bad breeding. Your situation is probably the same. Greedy people breeding bad quality dogs for profit.\" Yet another shared their own horror tales. \"There was a basset and Scottie mix that used to come into the shop I was at. That thug was like a Scottie on steroids. He was huge and nasty,\" said the commenter. \"Evil, no good dog, unpredictable, big fat teeth, and horrid. I refused to touch him and watched as another groomer went to war with him every time he came in.\"",

        "content": "Following the U.S. imposing tariffs on electric vehicles, Canada might be looking at doing something similar. In an interview with CBC , Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry of Canada François-Philippe Champagne said that the Canadian government isn’t ruling out imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs. Following that, industry leaders from various automotive manufacturing arms in Canada have also expressed a desire for Canada to follow through on this. This may lead to pressure on the cabinet to impose similar tariffs as the U.S. Other parts of the world, like Europe, have seen their auto markets change lately as low-cost EVs made in China hit the market. China has stronger programs and incentives, along with potentially cheaper labour, which has allowed it to expand quickly into the EV space. Since most other automakers are focusing on high-end EVs instead, the market is jumping on the opportunity to go electric for a reasonable price. In a bid to protect its giant auto industry of 39 million workers, the U.S. has imposed stronger tariffs on Chinese EVs to keep prices in line with American-made competition. While Canada’s auto industry is much smaller at 500,000 workers, there is still a precedent from the U.S. that we impose something similar. Source: CBC , Global News",

        "content": "Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts will now profit from another one of his catchphrases: \"Be You. That's Always Enough\" According to Gerber Trademark Library , Hurts currently owns a total of four other trademarks: \"Hurts So Good,\" \"BREEDOF1,\" \"Purpose Before Opinion,\" and \"I Had a Purpose Before Anyone Had an Opinion.\" Jalen Hurts has officially trademarked the phrase: \"Be You. That's Always Enough.\" He now owns 5: - \"Hurts So Good\" - \"BREEDOF1\" - \"Purpose Before Opinion\" - \"I Had a Purpose Before Anyone Had an Opinion\" #Eagles pic.twitter.com/Tsb2XM6D7P Hurts has plans to sell his latest \"Be You. That's Always Enough\" trademark on men's, women's, and children's clothing including shirts, hats, jackets, pants, and more. He used that phrase, replacing \"you\" with \"J. Hurts,\" in a Beats by Dre commercial last August, revealing to the world that his dad is the one who always told him, \"Be J. Hurts. That's always enough.\" Hurts has accomplished a lot over the years from his high school days to college and now with the Eagles. With all of his success, it's clear that he genuinely values this phrase that emphasizes staying true to one's self while on the rise to fame and glory. Despite the Super Bowl loss and battling through last year's downfall with a banged-up knee, Hurts has been as consistent as a coach could hope for in a quarterback. In four NFL seasons so far, Hurts has thrown for 11,764 yards and 67 touchdowns and earned one Pro Bowl nod. With yet another coaching shake-up and new additions to bolster the Eagles' roster, Hurts should only progress in 2024.

        "content": "SAN DIEGO — In the highest-scoring final game in Mountain West Championship history, Fresno State’s offensive explosion at the plate was too much for San Jose State in a 16-11 slugfest on Sunday afternoon at Tony Gwynn Stadium. The Diamond ‘Dogs captured their second MW tournament title in program history and their first since 2019. The Bulldogs (33-27) secured the MW’s automatic bid in the NCAA playoffs with the victory. On Friday, they will face host and No. 14 national seed UC Santa Barbara (42-12) of the Big West in a first-round game. The Bulldogs had to overcome four home runs and seven RBI from Hunter Dorraugh of San Jose State (24-33) to win the title game. It was quite a turnaround for Fresno State, which fell 3-2 in the tournament opener to Air Force on Thursday and extended its losing streak to six straight. The Bulldogs staved off elimination with a 6-1 win over New Mexico on Friday. The next day, they sent regular-season champion Air Force home with a 10-3 win and forced the NCAA-deciding tournament berth rematch with San Jose State by dropping the Spartans 8-5. Sunday’s Bulldog Heroes Tyler Davis and Justin Stransky brought in half of Fresno State’s runs as both went 3-for-5 with four RBIs. Jaykob Acosta got the win, striking out seven and allowing one run in 3 2⁄3 innings in relief of Jake Dixon, who started his second game of the MW tournament. Murf Gray was named the MW Championship Most Valuable Player. The sophomore was 11-for-21 at the plate in five games, driving in seven RBIs and scoring eight runs. Seven of his 11 hits went for extra bases, recording five doubles and two home runs. Gray was joined on the All-Tournament Team by Acosta, Stransky, Noah Beal, Tommy Hopfe, and Jake Riding. The title game box score is . How It Happened The Spartan offense got going early, scoring the first run of the game with a solo home run in the bottom of the first. A double down the left-field line almost allowed the Spartans to score another run, but the relay from Bobby Blanford to Gray to Davis, the catcher, was in time to get the runner out at home. Fresno State’s bats got hot in the third as Michael McKernan doubled down the left-field line with two outs on the board. Ben Newton drove in McKernan, a single to right field, and crossed the plate himself after a two-run bomb from Hopfe. Blandford and Stransky hit back-to-back home runs in the fourth to keep the Diamond ‘Dog offense rolling. San Jose State responded with a solo shot to center field in the bottom of the frame to halve the Bulldogs lead at 6-3. The hits kept coming in the fifth as Grady Morgan doubled to bring in Hopfe. Singles from Davis and Stransky plated another three runs as the advantage grew to eight. Acosta sent the Spartans down in order in the bottom of the fifth, finishing it with back-to-back strikeouts. Fresno State batted around in the sixth. The ‘Dogs loaded the bases with no outs. Eddie Saldivar hit a sacrifice fly to center to bring in McKernan. After Morgan was hit by a pitch, a single from Gray brought in Newton. With a 2-0 count, Davis ripped a shot down the left line to clear the bases. A pitching change did not cool the bats as Blandford singled and Stransky doubled to score Davis. After the Bulldogs were held scoreless in the ninth, Hopfe allowed back-to-back singles to start the bottom of the inning. The senior closer then shut the door with a pair of flyouts bookending a strikeout.",

        "description": "A Mirror poll has revealed the public want rapid action to stop kids accessing harmful content on social media, as Molly Russell's dad says it's a 'matter of life or death'",
        "content": "Social media firms should be forced almost immediately to stop children seeing harmful content, voters have demanded. A Mirror poll has revealed the public want rapid action to prevent algorithms bombarding kids with material relating to suicide and eating disorders. Six in 10 (60%) want this to happen by the end of July, while a further 22% said it should be before the end of this year. Just 2% were against it, according to the survey conducted by Whitestone Insight. Most people are also in favour of forcing online giants to introduce robust age checks on social media, such as requiring photo ID. Some 43% want this by the summer, while 26% believe it should be in place by the end of this year. Only 8% say they’re happy to wait until some point next year. Just 8% were against the proposal. The idea of banning under-16s from having smartphones is not widely supported, however. Some 43% are against, while 36% are in favour. Ofcom has put forward proposals that would require tech firms to stop their algorithms recommending harmful content to children and introduce robust age checks. But the regulator has said its final code may not be published until summer 2025, after which companies will have three months to assess the guidance. Parliament will need to approve the code, which could also take time. The dad of Molly Russell , who took her own life at age 14 in 2017 after being exposed to harmful content online, last night said the issue was a “matter of life or death” as he responded to the poll findings. Molly Russell took her own life at age 14 in 2017 after being exposed to harmful content online ( Image: PA) The Online Safety Act was originally proposed by Theresa May in 2019 but it took years to become law due to political chaos and divisions over the legislation. While it finally became law in October, Ofcom can't use new powers to hold social media firms to account until the end of a lengthy consultation on updating its guidance. Ofcom earlier this month published its draft Children’s Safety Codes of Practice, which sets out more than 40 practical measures tech giants must implement to meet new legal duties. If tech companies fail to comply with the guidance when it is introduced, they could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover or have their services blocked in the UK. The mother of murdered teen Brianna Ghey has warned that more young lives could be lost due to delays to the social media crackdown. Earlier this month, Esther Ghey told the Mirror : “I totally understand Ofcom’s view that we need to cross the Ts and dot the Is, and everything needs to be perfect so social media companies can’t come back and take legal action. But during this time we’re potentially losing more children’s lives. Also, there are children who are struggling with their mental health, there are children who are self-harming and we do need to try to get this done as soon as possible.” Whitestone Insight interviewed 2,024 adults in Britain online on May 15 and 16. 'There is no time to waste,' says dad who lost his daughter The dad of a 14-year-old girl who took her own life after being exposed to harmful content online says it is a “matter of life or death” whether a clampdown on social media takes place urgently. Molly Russell’s father Ian said there is “no time to waste” as he responded to our exclusive poll findings. Molly, from Harrow, in north west London, saw more than 2,000 harmful posts about suicide, self-harm and depression in the last six months of her life. Mr Russell said: “It’s only effective regulation that will finally make big tech address the preventable harm they cause to children and families. The cost of years of industry inaction should be measured in lost young lives, and that’s why getting world-leading regulation in force is nothing less than a matter of life or death.” Molly Russell's dad Ian warned there is no time to waste ( Image: Daily Mirror) The campaigner added: “There is no time to waste to protect young people from harm. Social media companies have consistently put their bottom line before taming toxic algorithms and the results have been devastating. The next Government should commit to new legislation to strengthen the Online Safety Act regime as this will ensure we see the swiftest and most decisive change. Effort wasted on other, hastily conceived policies is unlikely to be as effective and may end up causing more harm than good.” An inquest in 2022 concluded that Molly died from an act of self-harm while suffering depression and the negative effects of online content. Coroner Andrew Walker said the images of self-harm and suicide she viewed \"shouldn't have been available for a child to see\". *If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

        "content": "NBA fans weren't in agreement with Shannon Sharpe's latest opinion on the Boston Celtics. The NFL icon Sharpe, 54, went on a two-minute rant about the Celtics during Monday's edition of ESPN's First Take. The Celtics have a 3-0 lead over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Two of Boston's wins came when Indiana blew two leads, the most recent one coming in Game 3 when the Celtics rallied back after being down 18 points in the third quarter. While alongside Stephen A. Smith in ESPN's Los Angeles studios, Sharpe revealed his thoughts that he thinks the Pacers should not be one loss away from being swept in the ECF. \"The Pacers have been really bad in clutch situations,\" Sharpe said. \"Right now, Stephen A., the Pacers should be up 2-1. \"They gave Game 1 away ... They gave Game 3 away.\" Sharpe acknowledged the Celtics' efforts in coming back in the two games, specifically Jrue Holliday and his 28-point game in the first comeback win as well as his defensive contributions throughout the series. But the NFL Hall of Famer doesn't believe Boston's knack for coming back in games won't be sustainable, especially if they play the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals. \"If you go down 18 to the Dallas Mavericks, you're not coming back,\" Sharpe said. The Mavericks also have a 3-0 series lead in their Conference Finals series and are one win away from making the NBA Finals. On social media, NBA fans raged over Sharpe's lack of credit to the Boston team. \"They’re quite literally running out of things to say,\" one wrote. \"Why do other teams get credit for winning games they were down in, but we get hammered for it?\" a Celtics fan asked \"Give us credit,\" another Celtics fan commented. Sharpe wasn't done with his rant concerning the Celtics as he called their playoff run \"easy\". He cited the Celtics' not playing numerous stars due to injury which include the Miami Heat's Jimmy Butler, Cleveland Cavalier's Donavon Mitchel, and Pacers' Tyrese Haliburton. Sharpe finished his tirade by saying that the Celtics could find it tougher to come back in a potential NBA Finals matchup with the Mavericks due to their play style as well as Dallas' stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving. \"I don't like what I'm seeing because they keep falling behind by 15 and relying on three-point shots to get back in a ballgame,\" Sharpe said. \"I don't know if they'll be able to do this against the Dallas Mavericks.\" The Celtics will play the potential series-clinching Game 4 contest with the Pacers on Monday night in Indiana.",

According to press accounts in Jackson County, Colorado , rancher Mike Morgan was feeding his cattle with hay from his trailer on Saturday when a bolt of lightning killed him and knocked over 100 of the animals, roughly a third of which died. “As best I can tell, it hit him on the trailer. The cattle were bunched up around the trailer and it hit them all,” county coroner George Crocket said, as reported by the Colorado Sun . The outlet noted that Morgan’s father-in-law and wife were both in the vicinity and survived. They had spent the early part of the day branding cattle. By early afternoon storm clouds engulfed the sky as they were feeding the herd. Crocket described the incident as unusually deadly. “I’ve seen horses get killed, but it’s usually one at a time,” he said, according to the Sun . He added that his grandfather once lost seven cattle to a lightning strike. The outlet described Morgan as an outspoken rancher who was vocal about issues stemming from the reintroduction of wolves in the area. “We need to get our way of life out to the people because they don’t understand our livelihood, the emotional impact and the financial impact,” he said in 2022. Elsewhere in the country over the weekend, more than two dozen tornadoes touched down in five states, killing at least 20 people and injuring scores more. Texas was especially impacted, with more than 100 injuries reported and disasters declared in 106 counties, the Associated Press noted . In Cooke County, two young children from the same family were fatally wounded. Deaths were also reported in Oklahoma and Arkansas, with additional twisters sighted in Missouri and Kansas. Arkansas also suffered from a landslide over the weekend that off traffic on some sections of a highway in both directions.",

        "content": "BRITS were hit by Bank Holiday travel chaos today with train cancellations and huge queues on the roads causing massive delays. Passengers were urged not to travel to or from London Euston station after a major signal failure blocked lines. Avanti West Coast said travellers should avoid using its services at the capital station which is one of the busiest in the country. The chaos came on top of pre-planned Network Rail engineering work on the West Coast Main Line route resulting in longer journeys between London and Scotland . It was also a busy day to drive, with the RAC estimating 3.4million motorists took to the roads today. The sheer number of motors on the road coincided with the beginning of half-term for most schools in England and Wales . Traffic queues built up on the A102M Blackwall Tunnel approach in Greenwich, London, as families made their return journeys after the end of the long weekend. And large queues were seen building up on the M25 near Brentwood, Essex. The busy motorway also experienced heavy traffic near Iver, Buckinghamshire, this afternoon. Drivers were urged to check traffic conditions before setting off after the three-day-weekend drew to a close. In London, there was disruption on the Elizabeth line between Paddington and Southall due to a speed restriction imposed over defective track. Meanwhile, Overground trains faced delays due to an object becoming stuck in overhead power cables. There were also problems on Thameslink trains due to a signalling fault between St Albans and West Hampstead. Meanwhile, passengers faced complications on Transport for Wales between Shrewsbury and Wrexham due to an emergency incident. Over the bank holiday weekend, holidaymakers at the Port of Dover reported processing times of two hours at French border controls. In addition, drivers also reported\"gridlock\" in the town itself due to the increased traffic going to the port. One family were still in a queue to get to border control four hours after arriving in Dover. A Port of Dover spokesperson advised that for safety reasons travellers should stay in their vehicles and thanked passengers for their patience. A spokesperson for ferry operator DFDS said: \"We are expecting a busy weekend. \"We highly recommend all customers have a confirmed reservation \"Please allow 120 minutes to complete border and check-in controls on arrival.\" It comes as holidaymakers at Birmingham Airport were forced to queue for hours to get through security in half-term holiday mayhem. Thousands of passengers have been stuck in queues for more than an hour . The airport is reportedly overhauling its security system in time for the summer holidays - sparking half term chaos. Some passengers have reportedly been pulled out of the queues because the gate is closing for their flights. Peterborough mum Hannah Wright said: \"Security is a shambles -anyone can come this far. \"We've been waiting an hour to fly to Majorca. Our son is claustrophobic so it's hard for him. \"It's put a dampener on the start of our holiday. There is nothing in place for children who might struggle in situations like this.\" Earlier this month Border Control e-gates at UK airports including Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester broke down in a \"major incident\". Passengers waited for hours in queues overnight after an airport IT system crashed - sparking \"pandemonium\" for thousands.",

        "content": "As much as running back Saquon Barkley sounds thrilled to be with the Philadelphia Eagles, his new teammates seem just as excited about what the 27-year-old is already offering the club behind the scenes. \"Even in the short time of us having [voluntary organized team activities], you hear about the type of person he is, the type of leader he is in the room, the energy he brings to a room and that's something that I appreciate already -- just us competing in sprints or competing on the squat rack and things like that where we're challenging one another -- those are the things that set the thermostat for what the team is supposed to follow,\" Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts recently said about Barkley, per Tim McManus of ESPN. Hurts became a target of some media members and fans for alleged issues related to his leadership style as the 2023 Eagles experienced a collapse that saw them fall from 10-1 to 11-6 before they suffered a humbling 32-9 wild-card playoff loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Philadelphia then lost center Jason Kelce and defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, so-called \"culture guys,\" to retirement this offseason. As for Barkley, he previously served as a team captain with the New York Giants and was viewed by many as the face of that franchise over the past several seasons. He and the Eagles agreed to a three-year, $37.75M contract after the Giants let him reach free agency in March, and he's already made quite a positive impression with his current employer. \"He's an incredible running back,\" Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown said about Barkley during OTAs. \"I watched him over the years. I'm glad he's on my team. What I saw [during offseason training], him pushing teammates in the weight room, that gets me excited because honestly...if I can get a guy like that who's going to come to work every single day and working hard, that's all that matters.\" During his Giants tenure that ran from the 2018 draft through this past season, Barkley played in one playoff win and two total postseason games in January 2023. As of Monday, DraftKings Sportsbook listed the Eagles tied for third among the betting favorites at +700 odds to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LIX.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsConsider a position in these stocks, each of which looks attractively valued right now and has an affordable share price.The post 3 Cheap Stocks That Could Be Worth a Fortune by Summer appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "Despite the stock market being at an all-time high , plenty of bargains remain to be found for investors. The bull rally that began in autumn 2022 is only now starting to broaden out to include utilities, retailers, industrial stocks and other sectors of the economy. It’s no longer just big tech stocks that are marching higher. So, many stocks are starting to rise. So, this presents an opportunity for investors to buy stocks as they bottom and begin to climb higher. Many well-known companies have stocks that still look cheap in terms of valuation and share price. Catalysts such as strong earnings are starting to move share prices higher. For other stocks, a post-earnings dip is presenting a buying opportunity. However you look at it, bargains abound in the current market. Let’s explore three cheap stocks that could be worth a fortune by summer. Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS) After being in the doldrums for the last five years, things are starting to look up for Canada Goose Holdings (NYSE: GOOS ). The share price jumped 25% higher after the maker of winter parkas beat analyst expectations for its latest financial results. Investors needn’t worry that they’ve missed the move in GOOS stock. Even with the big post-earnings bounce, Canada Goose’s share price is still down 72% over the last five years. Furthermore, GOOS stock still has plenty of room to run, and the move higher may have just begun. After struggling with declining sales coming out of the pandemic, the company finally reported a turnaround . EPS came in at 19 cents compared to 7 cents that was forecast among analysts. Revenue in what was the company’s fiscal Q4 totaled $358 million, beating expectations of $315.5 million. Key to the turnaround were sales in Asia-Pacific, including China, which rose 29.6% during the quarter. In North America, sales rose 24.5% year-over-year ( YOY ) after a 14% decline in the previous quarter. The latest financial results come after Canada Goose announced in March plans to cut 17% of its global workforce as it seeks to realign its business. Chubb Ltd. (CB) News that Chubb Ltd. (NYSE: CB ) was the mystery stock that Warren Buffett had been concealing has lit a fuse under the Swiss insurer’s share price. Buffett has built an astounding $6.7 billion stake in Chubb Ltd., which has sent its stock up nearly 10% in only a few days, hitting a 52-week high in the process. Buffett’s purchase of nearly 26 million shares of the Zurich-based property and casualty insurer is seen as the ultimate vote of confidence in the stock. In fact, CB stock has been a strong performer , having gained 37% over the last 12 months, including a 20% gain this year. However, the valuation still looks attractive, with the shares trading at only 12 times future earnings estimates. And, its quarterly dividend payment of 86 cents per share gives the stock a strong yield of 1.25%. Given the share price appreciation, low price-earnings ratio and decent dividend, it’s easy to understand Buffett’s fondness for CB stock. Now that Buffett has built a stake in Chubb, the share price is likely to continue rising , making it a cheap stock to buy. Airbnb (ABNB) Anyone looking to buy a post-earnings dip should consider Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB ). Shares of the short-term rental company dropped nearly 10% on forward guidance that was below Wall Street estimates, presenting a buy-the-dip opportunity. The guidance obscured what was a solid print from Airbnb. For the first quarter, the company posted EPS of 41 cents, which was well ahead of a consensus estimate of 24 cents. The quarterly profit was up 126% from a year ago and the company’s best first quarter ever. Revenue totaled $2.14 billion , ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.06 billion. Sales were up 18% from a year earlier. Gross bookings came in at $22.90 billion, up 12% YOY, while nights and experiences booked rose 9.5% to $132.6 million. Despite the strong quarter, Airbnb’s guidance fell short of expectations, sending the stock lower. Investors should pick-up the stock on the cheap . Year-to-date ( YTD ), ABNB stock is up only 8%. However, the share price is 15% below its 52-week high and trading at only 19 times future earnings estimates. In time, the stock should rise, especially with the busy summer travel season upon us.

        "content": "Former President Donald Trump marked Memorial Day with a controversial message on Truth Social, targeting his critics. Trump posted a scathing comment directed at those he believes are working against the nation, calling them “Human Scum” and lamenting the state of the country. In a separate post, Trump insisted that his appearance at the Libertarian National Convention on Saturday was a success, despite being met with boos and jeers. He claimed that the crowd’s enthusiasm was palpable and argued that he could have secured the party’s nomination for the White House if he had desired it. Trump also criticized independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., saying, “Only a FOOL would vote for him!” and accusing Kennedy of “destroying everything he’s touched.” Trump’s attempts to appeal to Libertarians were met with mockery and insults. In response, he urged the audience to support him if they wanted to win, saying, “Maybe you don’t want to win, only do that if you want to win. If you want to lose, don’t do that. Keep getting three per cent every four years.” Trump also attended the Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race in Concord, North Carolina, on Sunday. Meanwhile, his criminal hush money trial in New York is set to resume on Tuesday as it enters its final stages. Trump Leads Biden Among Arab and Muslim American Voters A recent New York Times-Siena College poll revealed that Trump leads President Joe Biden 57-25 among Arab and Muslim American voters in five key battleground states, a significant shift from 2020 when these voters largely supported Biden. However, these results may not fully predict the voting trends for the November election, with potential surprises still on the horizon, especially concerning the Gaza conflict, a contentious issue among these voters. Biden’s Democratic campaign has noted a decline in the number of “uncommitted” voters protesting the President in primary elections. An exit poll from Michigan’s presidential primary in February showed 94 percent of Muslim voters casting “uncommitted” ballots in protest of Biden’s support for Israel’s actions in Gaza. This percentage has since decreased in states like Nebraska, Maryland, and West Virginia. Biden secured 90 percent of votes in Nebraska’s primary against challenger Dean Phillips and similarly high support in Maryland. Conversely, Trump dominated West Virginia, capturing 88 percent of the vote there. Trump’s campaign is strategically courting Arab American voters who feel alienated by the Democratic stance on the Middle East. A private meeting in Michigan, attended by Trump’s former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, aimed to rally support from Arab American donors and activists. Grenell, although not formally part of Trump’s campaign, is seen as a potential contender for a high-level national security position should Trump win in November. Other attendees included Michael Boulos, husband of Tiffany Trump, and his father, Massad Boulos, a Lebanese business tycoon. Despite Trump’s efforts, his previous term included policies that were unpopular among Arab Americans, such as immigration restrictions from Muslim-majority countries and cuts to humanitarian aid for Palestinians. Analysts suggest Trump might support the Israeli government even more than Biden if re-elected. Trump Comments on Nikki Haley and Vice Presidential Picks In another development, Trump addressed former GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley’s recent declaration of support for him. During an interview with Long Island’s News 12, Trump expressed appreciation for Haley’s comments and suggested there could be a place for her on his “team.” He described her as a “capable person” despite their contentious primary battle, where he often insulted her intelligence and referred to her as “birdbrain.” Haley, during her first public speaking event since exiting the race, indicated her preference for Trump over Biden, stating, “Trump has not been perfect on these policies. I’ve made that clear many, many times. But Biden has been a catastrophe. So I will be voting for Trump.” Although Trump previously dismissed the idea of Haley as his running mate, he acknowledged her potential role in his campaign. In the same interview, Trump mentioned several other names he is considering for vice president, including Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. JD Vance, and Rep. Elise Stefanik.",

        "content": "Once Jackson Maine, always Jackson Maine. Bradley Cooper channeled his rocker character from “A Star Is Born” while on stage with Eddie Vedder at BottleRock festival in Napa Valley this weekend. On May 25, 2024, Cooper joined the Pearl Jam singer on stage to sing “Maybe It’s Time,” the song Cooper recorded for the 2018 reboot of “A Star Is Born.” The pair was seated for the performance, Vedder strumming an acoustic guitar while he and Cooper traded verses and came together for the chorus. The song’s final line, sung in unison, was met with raucous applause. Cooper and Vedder stood to hug before turning back to the crowd to wave and bow. This isn’t the first time the pair has worked together. In 2018, Bradley called Vedder a friend and said Vedder was pivotal to his process for honing the rockstar persona he channeled to for Jackson Maine in “A Star Is Born.” “I went up to Seattle and spent four or five days with him and I asked him 9,000 questions,” Cooper told Yahoo Entertainment . “And he gave me minor, little things that only musicians know about what to do, just aesthetically and the inner workings.” Though he gave him pointers, Vedder wasn't enthusiastic about the movie, which Cooper also directed. “He thought it was crazy I was going to do this movie,\" Cooper said. In the film, Cooper plays a fading rock star named Jackson Maine. His character sings “Maybe It’s Time” at a drag bar where he first meets Ally played by Lady Gaga. Jason Isbell wrote the song for the film. When Vedder sang the song during a gig in Arizona in 2019, Isbell posted about his appreciation on X, formerly Twitter. “Holy (sh-t) Eddie Vedder sang my Bradley Cooper song in his set tonight,” Isbell wrote. “That is by far the strangest sentence I’ve ever composed but it’s certainly a huge honor. I was 12 when “Ten” came out and by god I learned how to play every song on it.” Since clips of Vedder and Cooper’s performance from this weekend have made their way online, viewers are loving it. “2 superstars. This gave me chills all over my body,” wrote one commenter . “That’s Jackson Maine,” wrote another. “Bradley sounds amazing! Wow blown away,” a fan commented .",

        "content": "The residents of Orihuela Costa have been flooding social networks for several weeks with photographs of containers full of rubbish, a situation that is replicated across many different urbanisations. They claim that the coast “is a landfill,” while describing a “sad and calamitous” situation which they define as “an attack on public health and hygiene due to the critical failures in the refuse collection service.” Tired of the fact that the Council has failed to provide any solutions, AVCRL Asociación de vecinos Cabo Roig y Lomas-Orihuela Costa (AVCRL) has sent a letter to the mayor, Pepe Vegara, in which they warn of legal action “if within a few weeks, before the start of the summer season, the service is not functioning satisfactorily.” They also attached a hundred photos, all taken within the last two months, showing “the serious deficiencies” with which the service is being provided, especially over bank holidays and weekends, with up to four days of delay in the emptying many of the overflowing containers. Thus, they argue that “the City of Orihuela is failing to comply with its obligations under the rules regarding waste collection and road cleaning in Orihuela Costa, generating serious public health and hygiene problems.” But, unfortunately, this is not new. This same situation has been denounced on many previous occasions by residents, “but still the Department of Street Cleaning and MSW has failed to adopt measures to provide the service, comply with its obligations, allocate adequate public resources that residents are charged for with their SUMA.” In April, municipal sources said that “garbage was being collected normally, except for those occasions that were caused by breakdowns of trucks.” Beyond the problems generated by an old fleet, the association’s letter points out that “the service is sadly lacking, poorly planned and does not have the necessary human, technical and material resources,” noting that this in turn “generates a negative impact on the area and decreases the income of commercial and tourist operations, causing loss of profits.” AVCRL insists that the ineffectiveness of the council shows “a clear disregard toward the resolutions handed down and a collective and illegal abandonment of this public service.” Without going further, they continue, “many streets of Orihuela Costa, especially in the interior area, are full of rubble at the moment, illegally deposited and without any control, because the councillor of Road Cleaning and RSU has failed to have them cleared away for more than four months, despite the appeals that the residents have been repeatedly made.” The letter asks the mayor to force the authorities and public officials of the Department of Road Cleaning and RSU and the Councillor of Orihuela Costa to provide the service normally. It also requests , in addition information regarding planning for the financial year 2024 and the list of technical and human resources available – and specifically for the summer period – as well as the recruitment plan.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions that were imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and likely won’t change after last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The IAEA report comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have also carried out direct strikes on each other’s territories for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said Iran now has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. According to the report, Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium at the current moment stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the International Atomic Energy Agency's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has already warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal with world powers, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. In an effort to ensure Iran could not develop atomic weapons, world powers struck a deal with Tehran in 2015 under which it agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. The report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The IAEA report also said that the deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation. Iran has suggested that discussions related to the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran “be continued in Tehran ‘on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon’,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under the deal. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA stated that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "MLA Joe Hargrave at a previous event. (Herald file photo) Prince Albert Carlton will have a new MLA following the next election after Joe Hargrave announced he would not seek re-election. Hargrave made the announcement Monday morning. He was originally acclaimed as the PA Carlton candidate in November 2023. “My family and I have given this a lot of consideration and have decided I just can’t commit to another four years as MLA,” Hargrave said in a statement. “I want to thank my family, friends, and most importantly, the constituents of Prince Albert Carlton for your support over the past eight years. It has been an honour to serve you and to serve with Premier Moe and all my caucus colleagues.” The Saskatchewan Party said it would nominate a new candidate “in the coming weeks.” Hargrave was the owner/operator of Riverside Auto Group in Prince Albert and served as a manager with BMO for 20 years before entering provincial politics. He was first elected in the 2016 provincial election, then re-elected in 2020. Hargrave served in a number of portfolios during his time in office, most recently as Minister of SaskBuilds and Procurement and Minister responsible for the GTH and Provincial Archives of Saskatchewan. He also served as Minister of Highways before resigning the position in 2021 following complaints about a trip he took to California to prepare to sell a piece of property during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Saskatchewan Party has 28 of 48 candidates nominated. Hargrave is the 14th sitting Sask. Party MLA who is not seeking re-election. -Advertisement-",

        "content": "There was nothing that could’ve gotten her to do more “tool time.” Patricia Richardson, who starred in “Home Improvement” as family matriarch Jill Taylor, shared that she used the large pay gap between her and Tim Allen to get out of shooting another season of the hit ABC show. The 73-year-old made it clear at the time that Season 8, which they filmed in 1998, would be her last. “I told everybody, there’s not enough money in the world to get me to do a ninth year. This show is over. It needs to end,” she told the LA Times . According to the outlet, both Richardson and Allen, 70, agreed that it was time to end the beloved show — but ABC made an offer to get them both to come back for a a 25-episode ninth season. The network offered $1 million per episode for Richardson and $2 million per episode for Allen, and, according to Richardson, Allen was all for accepting the offer. Richardson claimed she countered, telling the network that she’d stay if they agreed to pay her the same $2 million per episode that Allen was offered. “I knew that Disney would in no way pay me that much. That was my way to say ‘no’ and was a little bit of a flip-off to Disney,” she said. “I’d been there all this time, and they never even paid me a third of what Tim was making, and I was working my ass off. I was a big reason why women were watching.” As she expected, the offer was turned down, resulting in the show ending in 1999 with Season 8. But this series of events led to tension between her and her co-star. “I was mad at Tim because he was leaving me alone being the only person saying no, which made me feel terrible and like the bad guy,” she said, “and he was upset with me for leaving.” The Post has reached out to Allen’s rep for comment. “Home Improvement” co-creator and executive producer Carmen Finestra, meanwhile, told the LA Times that he couldn’t “remember one discussion” about continuing the show without Richardson. “It just couldn’t have worked,” he said. Executive producer Elliot Shoenman added, “Without her, it just didn’t make any sense.” Allen and Richardson reportedly don’t keep in touch, but the pair reunited in 2015 to film two episodes of his series “Last Man Standing.” She praised his talent to the Times and said she “never stopped loving working with him.” Richardson also recently responded to Allen’s claims that the entire “Home Improvement” cast was on board for a reboot, saying she was never asked about the possibility. “It was so weird. I would hear he was coming out publicly and saying this stuff about everyone was on board to do a ‘Home Improvement’ reunion, but he never asked me and he never asked [series co-star] Jonathan [Taylor Thomas],” Richardson said on an episode of the “Back to the Best” podcast. “I called Jonathan one day and said, ‘Has he asked you about this?’ He went, ‘No,’ ” she said of Thomas, who played her son Randy on the sitcom. “So why is he saying everyone is on board when he hasn’t talked to you or me?” Richardson said about her conversation with Thomas.",

        "content": "The are one win away from the after taking a commanding 3-0 series lead in the Western Conference Finals. Less than a week ago, hit a massive game-winning triple to sink the in Game 2 of the series. Even though he has hit game-winners in the playoffs before, he reserved the title, \" ,\" for his backcourt teammate, . \"Unbelievable... That's why they call him 'Mr. fourth quarter.' It's amazing. He's born for this situation. He's born for the clutch situations, so we just give the ball to him.\" Irving and Dončić both scored 33 points in Game 3, but the former saved his best for when the lights shined the brightest down the final stretch. Kyrie Irving Fourth Quarter Game 3 Stats Points 14 FG 5-7 3FG 1-1 Dončić was not too shabby himself, knocking down all three of his shots in the final frame for seven points. Throughout the series, Irving averages 10.3 points on 50 percent shooting from the field, while Dončić puts up nine points on 64.3 percent. This star backcourt has two of the best closers in the NBA, and they are putting on a show in the 2024 playoffs. In Game 2, Irving missed two key free throws inside the final two minutes. Instead of feeling sorry for letting the team down, he from the left corner to make it a one-possession game. Even if Irving makes a mistake, his mentality allows him to recover quickly in the most clutch moments. Irving and Dončić's Leadership Helps Young Mavericks No team has ever lost a playoff matchup after being up 3-0. However, Irving says the Mavericks cannot focus on statistics. They need to come out in Game 4 with the same mentality as the first three contests of the series. When Irving won a championship with the in 2016, was the leader and best player on the squad. The former Duke University guard learned what it took to lead on and off the court from one of the greatest players ever. Now, even though Dončić is the number one option, he and other Dallas players acknowledge throughout their deep playoff run. The Mavericks' stars display humble qualities towards each other. Dončić gave Irving the \"Mr. Fourth Quarter\" title after the former hit a game-winning shot in the previous contest. In an interview on the , Mark Cuban described Irving's perspective regarding Dončić being the first option. Their chemistry is only getting stronger each game they play. Now, Irving and Dončić sit five wins away from an NBA title.",

        "content": "New York Rangers captain and defenseman Jacob Trouba will pay for his elbow to the head of the Florida Panthers' Evan Rodrigues during Sunday's Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Final. The National Hockey League announced on Monday that Trouba will be fined $5K, the maximum allowed by the collective bargaining agreement, for the infraction. Jacob Trouba has been fined $5,000 for elbowing Evan Rodrigues, per @NHLPlayerSafety . pic.twitter.com/q0ogrcvnl2 It occurred late in the second period of the Rangers' 5-4 overtime win when Rodrigues cut to the net and Trouba hammered him with an elbow to the head. The elbow knocked Rodrigues to the ice, and he lay there, face down, for a few minutes before getting up and heading for the dressing room to be checked out. It was actually the second penalty that was called on Trouba in that sequence. There was already his delayed penalty for slashing Sam Bennett that was in the process of being called with Panthers' goalie Sergei Bobrovsky pulled for the extra attacker. Trouba got a two-minute minor for each infraction, and Florida had a four-minute power play. But Barclay Goodrow scored a shorthanded goal 39 seconds into the power play to stretch the Rangers' lead to 4-2 at that point. Rodrigues returned to the game and had one assist in 16:29 of ice time. Trouba had two assists in 23:05. New York leads the series 2-1, and Game 4 is Tuesday at Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida, at 8 p.m. ET.",

        "content": "Mandleshwar (Madhya Pradesh): Amidst the state-wide CBI investigation into the nursing college scam, the patience of students from Sujas Nursing College in Mandleshwar tehsil of Khargone district has finally broken. On Monday morning, BSc Nursing and GNM students of Sujas Nursing College staged a protest at the SDM office. The students presented a memorandum to SDM Anil Kumar Jain, highlighting various issues related to the college. The students demanded that the college management be called to the SDM office to resolve their issues. In response, SDM Jain summoned the college management representatives, Sushma Yadav and Vinayak Yadav, for a discussion with the students. During the discussions, Vinayak Yadav reportedly made inappropriate remarks, adding to the students' frustration. IRREGULARITIES IN COLLEGE: The students made several allegations against the college management, with the main issue being the college building. Until three months ago, the college operated out of a private lodge in Maheshwar. It has since moved to a private engineering college building on Choli Road, where the CBI investigation took place. However, the college management is now reluctant to acknowledge this building as theirs. According to the norms of the MPNRC, a nursing college must have a 100-bedded hospital to gain recognition, but Sujas Nursing College only has a 50-bedded hospital. The college management admitted to several other irregularities. STUDENTS' DEMANDS: For the 2022-23 session, about 40 GNM students complained to SDM Jain about the college's lack of recognition and insufficient facilities. The students, who have been enrolled for two years, expressed concerns about their enrolment status and the college's recognition. They also highlighted basic issues such as the lack of water in the college building located in Maheshwar. MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSE: The college management assured SDM Jain in writing that they would return the original documents of the students within the next 10 working days. They also assured to address all facilities issues within this period. SDM Jain stated that the college management's written assurance had been communicated to the students. He warned that if the students' demands were not met within the stipulated time, he would take appropriate action.",

        "content": "A group representing educators in Waterloo Region gathered last week to discuss the results of a survey on classroom violence. It asked the region’s teachers and education assistants about their experiences, and the findings are concerning. Over 1,100 educators responded and almost all, 99 per cent, said they had experienced violence in the classroom. More than half said they felt unsafe at school and over 70 per cent said they don’t believe children feel safe at school. The survey was conducted by the unions that represent educators at both local school boards, which shows the issues are widespread. The overwhelming takeaway was that chronic underfunding has forced school boards to eliminate many mechanisms to support kids with mental health or complex needs. The lack of those supports, along with the continuing effects of the pandemic has led to the situation the education system finds itself in. “I know in our board, we’ve seen a lot of cuts in the last few years,” said Jeff Pelich, President of the , while speaking to . “I think one of the biggest challenges that we face is that there is a lot of closing of the external resources that students had access to in the past. And we’ve heard about the long waitlists for support.” He added. “The services are no-longer available outside of school. And then we have students coming to school with unique challenges and then the services are cut within the school as well. It creates a perfect storm.” Pelich believes the only way to truly address the rise in classroom violence is for the province to step-up and actually provide adequate funding to ensure every school has the proper supports in place. He believes not only will that lead to improved outcomes for the students, it would address many of the issues leading to a lack of teachers. It would make the profession attractive option to post secondary students again.",

        "content": "A CAR expert who specialises in modern classics has acquired an iconic set of wheels that he believes is the \"best-kept example in the UK.\" A gorgeously yellow Lotus Elise, described as looking like a \"friendly-faced wasp\", can be bought for less than £30,000 from The Motor Grid - and it's well worth every penny. James Russell, founder of The Motor Grid, a dealership packed full of the very best modern classics , has recently picked up a stunning Lotus Elise S. James, who previously told Sun Motors that the Elise S2 model is an \"underappreciated \" modern classic, believes this example is the best he's ever laid eyes on. Speaking exlusively to us again, he said: \"This isn’t just any Lotus; this is potentially peak Lotus. \"The S2 generation is a masterclass in evolution, taking the already brilliant S1 and refining it to near perfection. \"It’s easier to get into, though still a nightmare to get out of – imagine a car trying to give birth to a human, and you’ll get the idea.\" Despite its almost go-kart-like size and tiny interior, which for some drivers might make it somewhat impractical, James describes the S2 as \"magnificent in every conceivable way.\" He added: \"Under the hood, you’ll find the Toyota VVTL-i engine, a marvel of engineering that combines silkiness with a punch that could floor a heavyweight boxer. \"And the paintwork – oh, the paintwork – it’s a crisp yellow with black accents, making it look like a friendly-faced wasp, ready to sting the dullness out of your life.\" This 111S model, which first came out in 2002 and ran until 2011, packs 156 bhp and can reach a top speed of 130 mph. But to James, this motor is about more than just speed and good looks. He said: \" Driving this S2 isn’t just a pleasure because it’s an Elise S2; it’s a joy because it’ss a time capsule. \"This car feels like it’s been cryogenically frozen and then woken up as a sprightly teenager.\" This might be the best-kept Elise in the UK, I never thought I’d find one, but here it is. According to James, the 15-year-old motor boasts just 23,000 miles on the clock and has barely seen a drop of road water - having been kept in pristine condition. James added: \"It’s barely been run in and hasn’t seen a single drop of road water, doesn’t know what winter feels like, having been coddled away more securely than a hibernating hamster. \"The condition? Immaculate doesn’t even begin to cover it; this might be the best-kept Elise in the UK. “I never thought I’d find one, but here it is. “The steering and gearbox feel as tight and fresh as the day it left the factory. “The power ? All the horses are still firmly in the stable, ready to bolt. “Cosmetically, it’s perfect – no sill damage, no osmosis on the paint. It’s baffling why the previous owner didn’t drive it more.\" James has previously urged Sun Motors readers to check out two other modern classics that can be bought for just £10,000 and under - including an iconic Audi model And elsewhere, a much-loved 80s icon that was bought for less than £4,000 by Wheeler Dealers’ host Mike Brewer in a classic episode is now worth eye-watering amount.",

        "content": "Food · Posted 1 minute ago There Are More Than 300 KitKat Flavors In Japan — Here Are The Top 19 You Absolutely Must Try At Least Once Green Tea KitKats are a must. by Jen Shiori Adams BuzzFeed Contributor Link Facebook Pinterest Twitter Mail Japan is one of the biggest food capitals in the world, so it makes sense that they'd have over 300 varieties of KitKats sold in stores across the country. I know that choosing from 300 different flavors might sound a bit overwhelming, so I've tried my best to narrow it down for you. As someone who has tried dozens of KitKat flavors, here are my recommendations for the 19 you need to try at least once: 1. Otona no Amasa Nestlé / Oyatsu Cafe / Via youtube.com It felt necessary to start this list by mentioning that Japan has a line of KitKats that is catered to the mature palettes of grownups. Otona no Amasa literally translates to \"sweetness for adults,\" and it's basically a lower sugar version of the classic KitKats. What's unique about this collection is there are several flavors offered, including dark chocolate, strawberry, matcha, white chocolate, raspberry, and caramel, so if you're not a fan of super sweet chocolates, look no further. 2. Strawberry Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com If you love sweet, fruity candies, you'll love these KitKats. The strawberry flavor tastes exactly like the bits you would find in a cereal like Cap'n Crunch's Crunch Berries. The photo above is part of the Otona no Amasa collection so it's a less sweet version, but the classic strawberry flavor is sold in most stores across the country. 3. Sake Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com I'll admit I was a little hesitant to try sake-flavored KitKats, but they were surprisingly pretty good. The taste of sake is present yet subtle, so even those who don't like the distinct flavor of the rice wine would enjoy it. Plus, the uniqueness of this flavor makes for a great gift to bring back to your friends. 4. Gold Jen Adams Gold KitKats are a combination of the original milk chocolate and caramel-flavored KitKats. Both flavors are already good on their own, but something truly magical happens when you eat the two of them together. 5. Strawberry Short Cake Jen Adams Fun fact: Strawberry short cake is a really popular dessert in Japan because it's red and white, like the Japanese flag. Interesting, right? These KitKats are made of white chocolate swirled with freeze-dried strawberry bits, sandwiched in between wafers and a layer of sweet cream. Compared to the classic strawberry-flavored KitKats, they're a little more tart (from the freeze-dried strawberry pieces). But don't worry, the tartness balances out perfectly from the sweetness of the white chocolate. 6. Chocolate Orange Jen Adams Whoever invented chocolate orange-flavored KitKats needs an immediate raise because these are delicious. I was honestly a little shocked at how much I liked these; chocolate and oranges don't really sound like the best combination. But apparently, these KitKats taste like Terry's chocolate orange candies that are sold in the UK, although I've never tried those, so I can't confirm or deny. 7. Cookies & Cream Nestlé / Yami Buy / Via yamibuy.com If you've ever tried a Hershey's Cookies 'n' Creme Bar , you'll know how delicious the flavors of white chocolate and cookies can be. Now, imagine that with an added wafer in the middle, and you have a Cookies & Cream KitKat. Definitely a must-try for those who love chocolates on the sweeter side. 8. Ume Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com Ume-flavored KitKats are a seasonal spring treat. If you aren't familiar with Ume, it's a Japanese plum that's usually pickled, dried, or fermented before eating. I'll admit, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I tried these for the first time, but they had an interesting flavor for sure. They're sweet, tangy, and just one of those weird flavors you have to try at least once. 9. Apple Pie Nestlé / Japan Candy Store / Via japancandystore.com Another seasonal flavor that's only available in the fall is apple pie. Think of the dessert's cinnamon-y sweetness, and now imagine that in chocolate form. It's amazing. 10. Café Latte Nestlé / Rocket Fizz Lancaster / Via rocketfizzlancasterca.com If you used to be obsessed with mocha Frappucinos like I was, you have to try these. 11. Lucky Red & White Jen Adams Lucky Red & Whites are a combination of white chocolate and milk chocolate KitKats. While that might not sound super exciting or relevant to their name, here's a quick ✨sociology lesson✨: In the late '90s, KitKat Japan gained popularity with students after branding themselves as the \"antidote\" to stress and anxiety during final exam season. So, from a consumer perspective, these little chocolates have been associated with good luck for a long time. Plus, the Japanese pronunciation of KitKat (Kittokatto) sounds almost identical to a Kyushu dialect term, Kittokatsutoo, meaning \"you will definitely win.\" These things prompted KitKat to come out with the Lucky Red & White KitKats. There's a little red and white knot symbol on its packaging, which symbolizes good luck in Japanese culture. Each of these individually wrapped KitKats have a different good luck omen on them, so they make for a special snack. 12. Hojicha Tea Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com If you love the taste of Matcha KitKats, I would highly recommend giving the Hojicha-flavored ones a try. Hojicha and matcha are both green teas, but their preparation styles are different, which gives them their own distinct flavors. Hojicha tastes a lot nuttier, so it tastes really nice as a KitKat. 13. Wasabi Nestlé / Tokyo Lens / Via youtube.com Wasabi-flavored KitKats might not be the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to dessert, but — as the saying goes — don't knock it 'til you try it. The spiciness of the Wasabi is only subtle and definitely not potent enough to clear your sinuses. 14. Matcha Tiramisu Nestlé / Grub Exotic / Giphy / Via giphy.com I've personally never actually tried this flavor, but I have no doubts that this KitKat would heal something in me. The description calls out the perfectly balanced flavors of mascarpone cheese and bittersweet matcha, which sounds amazing. BRB, filing this under my list of reasons I need to go to Japan this summer. 15. Rum Raisin Nestlé / TheJapanChannelDCom / Via youtube.com Like Rum Raisin ice cream , but in chocolate form. 16. Whole Wheat Biscuit Nestlé / PapiEats / Via youtube.com If you take anything away from this list, let it be about how underrated this flavor is. Whole Wheat Biscuit KitKats are inspired by the taste of English digestive biscuits, and they're coated with a sweet white chocolate. The wafers are made from whole wheat flour and toasted grains. What's interesting is this flavor was created to encourage more healthy grains into people's diets. 17. Milk Tea Jen Adams Another British-inspired flavor, Milk Tea KitKats are the perfect dessert to bring to your next tea party. The black tea extract and white chocolate really balance each other out, so you get a nice, subtle tea flavor. 18. Sweet Potato Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com These KitKats are inspired by Yaki-imo (roasted sweet potato), which is a pretty common snack in Japan. They kind of remind me of the taste of roasted chestnuts; they're a little nutty yet still pretty sweet. Definitely worth a try. 19. And finally, Umeshu (Plum Wine) Nestlé / KitKat Japan / Via kitkatjapan.com Last but not least, we have Umeshu, or plum wine. Yes, they're a little similar to the Ume KitKats mentioned earlier, but the plum flavor is more mellow in this. Both flavors are good, but this one is better for those who aren't fans of strong fruity flavors.

        "description": "Three people will receive honorary degrees, and two others will be named Fellows of the University at convocation ceremonies this week.",
        "content": "THUNDER BAY — When Lakehead University marks the achievements of nearly 2,000 graduates at its Thunder Bay campus later this week, it will also recognize five individuals for their unique contributions to their fields and to their communities. Lakehead announced Monday that it will confer honorary degrees on Rosie Mosquito, Dr. Samantha Nutt and Patricia Ningewance Nadeau, and will name two other people Fellows of the University. Honorary degree recipients: Rosie Mosquito, a member of Bearskin Lake First Nation, has devoted her life to community development, political advocacy and the advancement of Indigenous rights. In 1986, she became the first female chief in the western part of Nishnawbe Aski Nation. The university stated in its announcement that she has navigated the intricacies of government throughout her career, leveraging her expertise to champion Indigenous causes. She served as executive director of NAN from 1994 to 1996, and has held other pivotal roles including senior policy advisor to the Ontario Regional Chief and executive director of Oshki Wenjack Education Training Institute from 2004 to 2018. One of her proudest accomplishments is the passing of the Indigenous Institutes Act in 2017, provincial legislation that was negotiated during the nine years she chaired the Indigenous Institute Consortium. Mosquito remains an active participant in NAN, with the Chiefs of Ontario and with the Assembly of First Nations. Dr. Samantha Nutt is an award-winning humanitarian, bestselling author and founder and president of War Child U.S.A. and War Child Canada. The university said she has worked for over two decades with children and their families on the frontlines of many international crises, including in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone and Darfur, Sudan. Dr. Nutt is a leading authority on public health, war, international aid and foreign policy, and is an acclaimed public speaker in North America. She is also a staff physician at Women's College Hospital in Toronto, and an assistant professor at the University of Toronto. She previously received the Order of Canada, the country's highest civilian honour. The university stated that her international work has benefited millions of war-affected children. Patricia Ningewance Nadeau (Waabibizhikiikwe) is Bear Clan from Lac Seul First Nation and a survivor of the residential school system. She is a translator, Ojibwe author, and teacher, and her company – Mazinaate – has been publishing Indigenous books and resources since 1998. An assistant professor at the University of Manitoba, she is actively involved in promoting and preserving the Ojibwe language. According to the university, her grandson speaks and teaches Ojibwe, while her son is director of operations at Dakota Ojibwe Tribal Council, and is a producer of the Ojibwe language version for the Star Wars film A New Hope . Her husband is a former lawyer and a future fluent speaker of Ojibwe. Patricia Ningewance Nadeau was honoured with the Order of Canada in 2022. Fellows of the University: Walberg has been an ambassador for Lakehead University for over two decades, including eight years as a member of the Board of Governors. The university said his most recent efforts include shaping Lakehead's future capital campaign and successfully championing the internationalization of the university. Dr. Kotalik is a physician-bioethicist, and chair and founding director of the Centre for Health Care Ethics at Lakehead. According to Lakehead, his experience as a practising oncologist and CEO of Thunder Bay Regional Cancer Centre informed his vision to establish a firm grounding in health-care ethics in local academic and health-care institutions. Convocation ceremonies are scheduled for May 30 and 31.",

        "description": "PARIS (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. Read full story",
        "content": "PARIS (Reuters) - Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the U.S. Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.

        "content": "KOCHI: On the 30th, the High Court will again consider the case filed by the former employees of the State Warehousing Corporation demanding their rightful pension. The case is being considered for the 100th time. The petitioners, aged up to 85 years, have been in a legal battle for 23 years. A petition filed in the High Court in 2001, seeking pension payment received a favourable response only when the case was considered in 2010. The corporation approached the Supreme Court against this with a petition but was dismissed in 2017. However, the court order remained unimplemented. At this stage, the pensioners filed a contempt petition in the Supreme Court. The petition was withdrawn after the corporation announced that the court verdict would be implemented immediately, but the pension hike was still not implemented. The pensioners then approached the Supreme Court but the petition was referred to the High Court. The High Court ruled that a minimum of Rs 5,000 and a maximum of Rs 15,500 including dearness allowance till April 1, 2018, should be paid. The court back then also ordered the corporation to complete all dues till then within three months. The High Court will now consider the appeal filed in the Corporation Division Bench and the petition of the pensioners. 45 pensioners died during the legal battle while 603 are still hoping for a favorable result.",

        "description": "97 bar licenses were issued after the second Pinarayi government came to power. UDF had shut down all but 29 five-star hotels in 2016 before leaving.",
        "content": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Efforts to reduce the availability of alcohol in the state on one side. Measures to increase the number of bars on the other. 801 bars at present. 14 new applications in various districts under scrutiny. 97 bar licenses were issued after the second Pinarayi government came to power. UDF had shut down all but 29 five-star hotels in 2016 before leaving. Four-star bars among the closed bars were allowed to function as per the decision of the left government. 200 new licenses were also granted. By the end of the Left government's term in 2021, the number of bars reached 671. Now there are 801 bars, including those licensed by raising the classification and new ones. High profit business The constant argument of the bar owners is that there is no loss-making business like the bar business. However, even a normal bar has an average daily sales of Rs.1.5 to Rs.2 lakh. Depending on the quality of the bar and the speciality of the location, it can go up to five or six lakhs. 15 to 20 percent of the sale goes to the owner's pocket after all expenses including the share of license fee. Common man's favourite Jawan rum is priced at Rs 640 per litre at Bevco Shop. Jawan rum is sold at bars at peg rate. Rs 65 per peg is the minimum rate. One litre is 16.5 pegs. A litre of Jawan rum is sold for Rs 1072.50. Profit from this is Rs.432. Depending on the quality of the bars, the peg rate can increase and so can the profit. A typical bar sells 750 to 850 pegs of Jawan rum a day. As the price of liquor increases, the peg rate and profit will rise. Burden of donation Owners get amazing profits but donation is a burden. Bar owners have to donate huge sums of money to major political parties during elections. The amount determined will be collected from each bar and handed over by the owners association. Earlier it was up to 25,000, 50,000, now it has become lakhs. Contribution to local leaders is on top of this.",

The government counsel argued that the crime was not serious and that the petitioner might have filed the plea considering the importance of those involved in the case. The counsel also informed the court that several cases have been registered with the Cantonment Police on the grounds of obstruction of official duty and a similar investigation is going on in this case as well. The court dismissed the petition after considering the police report.",

The disciplinary action against Sabu is amid his retirement from the police force on May 31. Thammanam Faizal organized the feast on May 26 at his residence in Puliyanam in Angamaly. Faizal's house and premises were under the surveillance of cops. After receiving intel, Rural Police chief Vaibhav Saxena instruced Angamaly SI to check out the place. The sub inspector reached the place while Sabu was feasting with Faizal. On seeing the official, Sabu hid in a bathroom. Faizal told the SI that the other two cops are his workers. All three were taken to the police station, where it was revealed that the other two with Faizal are cops and they came with the DySP. However, Sabu told the Alappuzha police chief that he was at his residence during this time. On checking the call details of the police officers, it became clear that didn't contact Faizal, who testified that the said DySP didn't come and there was no feast. Jollymon, a driver of Alappuzha Police special branch, and CK Deepak, a CPO, were suspended for visiting the goonda leader's house.",

        "content": "After Tajinder Bagga, the National Secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), claimed that Punjab Cabinet Minister Balkar Singh compelled a 21-year-old girl to strip naked over a video call, the National Commission for Women (NCW) condemned the incident and demanded urgent intervention from Punjab Police. Taking to its official X handle, NCW posted, “The National Commission for Women is gravely disturbed by Twitter post allegations against Punjab MLA Balkar Singh. The reported acts, if substantiated, constitute serious violations under IPC sections 354 and 354B, directly affronting a woman’s dignity.” It added further, “Rekha Sharma, NCW Chairperson, vehemently condemns such behaviour and calls for urgent intervention from Director General of Police, Punjab to ensure a prompt and impartial investigation. A comprehensive report to be submitted in three days.” Meanwhile, NCW Chief Rekha Sharma issued notice to DG Punjab Gaurav Yadav regarding the matter of Balkar Singh. In the notice, NCW said, “The National Commission for Women has come across a distressing Twitter post of Tajinder Bagga enclosing a video of Punjab’s Cabinet Minister Balkar Singh allegedly masturbating on a video call with a 21-year-old girl compelling her to strip naked on the pretext to provide her with a job.” The Commission further added it has prima facie observed that the reported incident attracts the following provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which are enumerated: Section 354 of the IPC (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty); Section 354-B of the IPC (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe or compelling her to be naked). Citing the incident as outrageous to the dignity of a woman, NCW said, “The Commission strongly condemns the unwarranted and lascivious behaviour of Balkar Singh. Therefore, you (Gaurav Yadav) are required to personally intervene and ensure a fair and swift investigation in the matter... If the allegations levelled are found to be true, the accused person should be arrested at the earliest and the detailed action taken report along with a copy of the FIR should be communicated to the Commission within three days.” (ANI)",
