        "content": "WhatsApp , the globally recognized messaging app, is reportedly working on a new facility that will enable users to personalize their chat themes and accent colors. This feature is currently being fine-tuned in the WhatsApp beta for iOS 24.11.10.70 version. It will provide users with the option to customize their chat bubble colors as well as wallpapers, moving away from the company's traditional green theme that has been a constant since its inception. Four additional chat themes coming to WhatsApp According to a report from WABetaInfo , WhatsApp plans to introduce four additional chat theme options in an upcoming update. This new feature was discovered during the TestFlight beta program and is currently under development. Users will be able to choose from five themes - the default green, as well as blue, gray, red, and purple. The selection of a new chat theme will automatically adjust the user's wallpaper and bubble color, to align with the chosen theme's color palette. WhatsApp to enable accent color customization In addition to chat themes, WhatsApp is also developing a facility that will allow iOS users to modify the app's accent color. This customization will impact the look of in-app buttons and will be restricted to the same color choices as the chat themes. Another feature spotted in a recent beta update for Android version 2.24.11.17 is an AI image generator for profile pictures, which creates personalized images based on user-provided text prompts.",

        "content": "Astronomers have made a groundbreaking discovery, finding strong evidence of a vast ocean of liquid water hidden beneath the icy surface of Pluto. The research, published in the scientific journal Icarus , offers new insights into the composition of this distant celestial body. The study was led by Alex Nguyen, a graduate student in Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. Unraveling Pluto's subsurface ocean using NASA's images Nguyen's team employed mathematical models and images from NASA 's New Horizons spacecraft to investigate Pluto's subsurface ocean. The study, co-authored by Patrick McGovern of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, sheds light on a long-standing debate about the existence of liquid water on Pluto. This research marks a significant step forward in understanding the dwarf planet's composition. Pluto's hidden ocean: A closer look Nguyen and McGovern further explored the properties of Pluto's hidden ocean. They created mathematical models to explain the cracks and bulges in the ice covering the Sputnik Platina Basin. This massive basin, formed by a meteor impact billions of years ago, suggests an ocean below. Their models indicate this ocean is shielded by a 40-to-80-kilometer-thick shell of water ice. Estimating the density of Pluto's hidden ocean By analyzing surface fractures, the researchers were able to estimate the ocean's potential density or salinity. According to Nguyen, they determined a zone similar to Goldilocks, where the density and shell thickness find an optimal equilibrium. The findings suggest that Pluto's ocean is about 8% denser than Earth's seawater, comparable to Utah's Great Salt Lake. If humans could somehow reach Pluto's ocean, they would effortlessly float. Facts about Pluto Discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was initially hailed as the ninth planet in our solar system. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified it as a dwarf planet. Pluto traverses its orbit around the Sun at an average distance of 5.9 billion kilometers, requiring roughly 248 Earth years to complete a single revolution. Measuring approximately 2,372 kilometers in diameter, it is smaller than Earth's moon.",

        "content": "West Indies and USA will co-host the 2024 edition of the ICC T20 World Cup . The ninth edition of the global tournament will get underway on June 1. 20 teams will feature in the competition. Meanwhile, England will enter as defending champions, having tasted glory in 2022. Here we present the notable records from the 2022 edition, which took place in Australia. Kohli becomes the highest run-getter in T20 WC history Indian ace Virat Kohli displaced Mahela Jayawardene (1,016) as the highest run-scorer in T20 WC history. The former now has 1,141 runs in 27 games at an average of 81.50. Kohli also became the first batter to score 250+ runs in a T20 WC edition thrice (2014, 2016, and 2022). The tournament also saw Kohli become the first player to complete 4,000 T20I runs. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan's stellar partnership record During the New Zealand vs Pakistan semi-final, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan became the first pair to record three century partnerships in T20 WCs. While the duo added 105 runs against the Black Caps, they recorded scores of 152* and 113 against India and Namibia in 2021, respectively. Their tally of 636 runs is also the highest for any pair in the tournament's history. Two hat-tricks in the tournament UAE's Karthik Meiyappan became the first associate-team bowler to scalp a hat-trick in T20 WC, against Sri Lanka. Ireland pacer Joshua Little was the other bowler with a hat-trick in the tournament, against NZ. Little's feat made Ireland the only team to have two bowlers with T20 WC hat-tricks. Curtis Campher took four wickets off as many balls against Netherlands in 2021. Player of the Tournament - Sam Curran England's Sam Curran was named both the Player of the Match in the final and the Player of the Tournament. He recorded 3/12 against Pakistan in the summit clash. Overall, the left-arm pacer finished as the joint-second-highest wicket-taker with 13 wickets in six games. Curran, who conceded runs at 6.41, was the only bowler to claim a five-fer in the tournament, 5/10 vs Afghanistan﻿. Most runs - Virat Kohli Kohli finished the tournament as the highest run-scorer, having scored 296 runs. While his average was just under 100, he struck at 136.41 in the competition. Kohli's tally of four fifties was also the highest in the competition. Netherlands' Max O'Dowd (242), India's Suryakumar Yadav (239), England's Jos Buttler (225), and Sri Lanka 's Kusal Mendis (223) were the others with 220-plus runs. Most wickets - Wanindu Hasaranga Wanindu Hasaranga once again finished the tournament as the highest wicket-taker, having scalped 15 wickets in eight games. While the Sri Lankan leg-spinner conceded runs at a paltry rate of 6.41, his strike rate was 12.4. Curran and Netherlands's Bas de Leede were the joint-second-highest wicket-takers with 13 scalps apiece. Zimbabwe's Blessing Muzarabani is next on the list with 12 scalps. Here are the other notable records Kohli became the first player to score 300 runs against a team in T20 WC, 308 vs Pakistan. Rohit Sharma became the most capped player in T20 WC, having played 39 games. Ireland's Campher became the first all-rounder with a fifty and hat-trick in T20 WCs. Scotaland's Michael Jones recorded the highest score by an Associate player in T20 WCs, 86 versus Ireland. Two centurions in the competition SA's Rilee Rossouw was the first centurion of the competition. He mustered 109 off 56 balls against Bangladesh. The only other century that year came from NZ's Glenn Phillips 's blade. He made 104 off 64 balls against SL. Meanwhile, SA's 205/5 against Bangladesh was the highest team total that year. NZ were the only other side to touch the 200-run mark, 200/3 versus Australia.",

He reiterated, \"We take security seriously and that's why we end-to-end encrypt your messages. They don't get sent to us every night or exported to us.\" Cathcart clarifies WhatsApp's stance on user data backup Cathcart further clarified WhatsApp's policy regarding user data, particularly message backups. He stated that if users wish to backup their messages, they can use their cloud provider and even apply end-to-end encryption for the same. The ongoing public feud between Musk and Meta (WhatsApp's parent company) has been a topic of discussion since Musk took over X in 2022. Musk reignites cage fight challenge amid Meta rivalry The rivalry between Musk and Meta has been escalating, especially after the launch of Meta's Threads app, which directly competes with X. The tension heightened when Musk challenged Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight, a proposition that Zuckerberg dismissed as not serious. Recently, however, Musk reignited the cage fight talks on X by stating, \"I'm ready to fight Zuck anywhere, anytime with any rules. LFG!!!\"",

        "content": "The film Hamare Baarah , starring Annu Kapoor , Ashwini Kalsekar, Manoj Joshi , and Parth Samthaan among others, has stirred controversy due to its provocative teasers. The movie's depiction of a specific religion has been met with disapproval from a section of society, allegedly resulting in death threats against the team. In response to these threats, veteran actor Kapoor released a video message urging viewers to watch the film before forming their opinions. Why does this story matter? Initially titled Hum Do Humare Baraah , the film was renamed following a directive from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The drama was first announced in 2022, and since then, it has created an uproar online for its alleged Islamophobia. Makers, including director Kamal Chandra, have claimed that the movie doesn't target any one community but highlights \"the most important and crucial problem of our country,\" population explosion. 'The film advocates women's empowerment...' Kapoor addressed the threats in a video message, emphasizing their seriousness and calling for police protection for the film team. He urged viewers to watch the film before lambasting it, stating, \"The film advocates women's empowerment and talks about the rights of women. First, watch the film and then give your verdict.\" Kapoor clarified that the movie's intention was not to offend any caste or community but to discuss women's empowerment and population boom. Kapoor urges audiences to reserve judgment, engage with story Kapoor revealed people were giving death threats on social media and via calls. \"Please don't abuse, don't give us threats because we are not afraid. I request Maharashtra Police and the Home Ministry to perform their duty and provide protection to every member of the team who's getting death threats. The seasoned actor concluded his message by saying, \"If you try to disrupt the peace, then we will also not sit silently.\" Hamare Baarah will be released on June 7.

        "content": "Fashion and art have long been intertwined, reflecting the cultural zeitgeist and individual creativity. This article explores how to translate iconic art movements into everyday wear, offering a fresh perspective on personal style. By understanding the essence of each movement, you can curate outfits that are not only stylish but also carry a deeper artistic significance. Impressionism in apparel To embody the essence of Impressionism in your wardrobe, choose garments in soft pastels and incorporate lightweight fabrics that feature dappled prints.

Aim to replicate the movement's delicate brushstrokes and nuanced play of light through your clothing selections, embracing the artistry in everyday fashion. Cubist couture To channel Cubism's essence in your wardrobe, select structured garments that feature bold, angular patterns. A jacket with pronounced shoulders or accessories adorned with cube or pyramid motifs can reflect Cubist influences. Additionally, combining different textures in your outfit can mimic the collage techniques prominent in Cubism, offering a modern twist on this art movement's distinctive style. Surrealist statements Surrealism's dream-like quality translates into whimsical accessories and unexpected combinations in fashion. Incorporate Salvador Dali-inspired elements, like melting clocks on a handbag or shoes adorned with optical illusions. This approach adds a surprising element to your outfit, sparking conversations. It's about embracing the surrealists' vision by integrating the extraordinary into everyday wear, making each piece a statement of artistic expression and individuality. Pop art popularity Embrace Pop Art's essence with vibrant colors and bold graphics. Opt for attire featuring comic prints or iconic pop culture imagery, like a Warhol-esque T-shirt. When paired with solid-colored pants, this combination becomes an eye-catching ensemble that pays homage to Pop Art's explosive movement. This approach brings the dynamic visual style of Pop Art into everyday fashion, celebrating this iconic art movement. Minimalist mode For those drawn to Minimalism, focus on monochromatic outfits, clean lines, and simple silhouettes. Quality over quantity is crucial; invest in well-crafted basics that last. This approach reflects the minimalist art movement's emphasis on simplicity and longevity. By choosing pieces that embody these principles, you create a wardrobe that mirrors the timeless elegance of minimalist art.",

        "description": "The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart, Tasmania, is set to publicly debut the \"only\" physical copy of Wu-Tang Clan's album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin.",
        "content": "The Museum of Old and New Art (Mona) in Hobart, Tasmania , is set to publicly debut the \"only\" physical copy of Wu-Tang Clan's album Once Upon a Time in Shaolin . This rare album was secretly recorded between 2006 and 2013 and was previously owned by pharmaceutical entrepreneur Martin Shkreli. It is now on loan from digital art collective Pleasr for Mona's upcoming exhibition Namedropping , which explores status, celebrity, and notoriety. Know more about the group Established in 1992, Wu-Tang Clan stands as a legendary American hip-hop collective. Comprising iconic figures like RZA, GZA, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa, alongside the late Ol' Dirty Bastard until 2004, they reshaped the landscape of East Coast hip-hop. Renowned for their influence and innovation, Wu-Tang Clan is hailed as one of the greatest hip-hop groups of all time. What makes the album unique? Often referred to as the \"most valuable ever made due to its rarity,\" the album features contributions from all surviving members of the Wu-Tang Clan group and includes two appearances from songstress Cher. It is housed in an ornate silver box and was intended as a statement about the impact of streaming and piracy on the value of music. Producers Cilvaringz and RZA described it as \"400-year-old Renaissance-style approach to music\"—aiming to inspire urgent debates about the future of music. Album cannot be used for commercial purposes until 2103 A single two-CD copy of the album was pressed in 2015, with all digital master files subsequently \"deleted.\" A unique legal agreement stipulates that the album cannot be used for any commercial purpose until 2103 or 88 years after its creation. RZA explained that this number was chosen because there were eight original Wu-Tang Clan members—the numbers of the year 2015 added up to eight, and a rotated eight is the symbol for infinity. Album's journey from Shkreli to Pleasr and Mona Museum In 2015, a 13-minute medley of the album was played at New York's MoMa to about 150 art experts, rap fans, and prospective buyers. Shkreli later attempted to sell the album on eBay where bidding reached $1.2M—but failed to complete a sale. After his conviction for securities fraud in 2018, Shkreli was forced to surrender the album along with other assets totaling $7.4M. In 2021, Pleasr acquired it from the US Department of Justice for $4M to cover Shkreli's debts. Public debut of Wu-Tang Clan's album at Mona Museum Mona will hold free ticketed listening sessions from June 15-24 where attendees can hear a curated 30-minute mix of the album played from a personalized Wu-Tang PlayStation 1 inside Mona's recording studio, Frying Pan. This marks the first time that this unique album has been loaned to a museum since its original sale. \" Once Upon a Time in Shaolin is more than just an album, so... I knew I had to get it into this exhibition,\" said Mona director.",

        "content": "Kaftans, celebrated for their flowing elegance and comfort, have crossed borders to become a global fashion staple. Originating from ancient Mesopotamia, these garments have been embraced by various cultures and continue to evolve in contemporary fashion. This article aims to explore accessorizing kaftans for a chic and personalized look, highlighting their versatility and enduring appeal across different fashion landscapes. The art of accessorizing Accessorizing is crucial for elevating the simple elegance of a kaftan into a statement outfit. The correct selection of accessories can highlight the kaftan's unique features, enhancing its design while adding sophistication. From selecting the right belts to choosing complementary jewelry, each accessory plays an essential role in crafting an ensemble that reflects personal style and elegance. Choose complementary jewelry Jewelry must enhance the kaftan without dominating it. For patterned kaftans, select simple jewelry like delicate chains or stud earrings. Solid-colored kaftans invite bolder choices, such as chunky necklaces or layered bracelets, adding texture and interest. Always consider the kaftan's neckline when selecting neckpieces to ensure the jewelry complements the outfit appropriately, maintaining a balanced and elegant look. Define your waistline Belts can be transformative when paired with kaftans, as they define your waistline and add structure to the garment. Opt for a thin belt in a matching color for a subtle approach. For a bolder statement, choose a wide belt or one adorned with embellishments. It's crucial to balance proportions to maintain an elegant silhouette, ensuring the belt complements rather than overwhelms the kaftan. Footwear matters The choice of footwear significantly influences your outfit's overall vibe. Sandals bring a casual ease, perfect for a laid-back look, while heels can elevate the ensemble, making it suitable for more formal occasions. For those donning longer kaftans, opting for strappy sandals or peep-toe heels is advisable. This choice helps to avoid a cumbersome appearance and maintains an airy, elegant feel throughout. Finishing touches with bags Complete your accessorized kaftan look with the right bag choice. A clutch is perfect for evening affairs, adding elegance, while tote bags fit daytime outings, offering practicality. Consider the texture and color—woven bags introduce rustic charm, and metallic clutches inject glamour. It's vital to ensure your bag complements other accessories for a cohesive and stylish ensemble, maintaining the outfit's overall elegance and personal flair.",

Fortunately, no injuries were reported as everyone present was safely evacuated from the premises. An official from Delhi Fire Services stated that six fire tenders have been pressed into service to douse the flames. 2 days after fire at children's hospital This comes just two days after the fire at a private children's hospital in east Delhi's Vivek Vihar, which led to the death of seven newborns.

        "content": "The Mexican elote bowl is a vibrant, vegetarian dish inspired by traditional elote—grilled corn slathered in mayonnaise, cheese, and spices. This bowl adaptation offers these classic flavors in a hearty, healthy meal for vegetarians. It's an ideal choice for anyone looking to experience the essence of Mexican culture at their dining table. Let's begin cooking this colorful and nutritious meal. Gather the following ingredients For this dish, gather two cups cooked quinoa, four ears fresh corn, one cup rinsed and drained black beans, one sliced large avocado, one cup halved cherry tomatoes, half a cup finely chopped red onion, and a quarter cup chopped fresh cilantro. Dressing requires three tablespoons vegan mayonnaise, two tablespoons lime juice, one teaspoon paprika, and salt to taste. Prepare your ingredients Start by cooking your quinoa according to package instructions; this usually involves rinsing it thoroughly before boiling in water for about 15 minutes until it becomes fluffy. While the quinoa cooks, grill or broil your corn until slightly charred on all sides. Once cool enough to handle, cut the kernels off the cob and set aside. Assemble your elote bowl Begin assembling your elote bowl by placing a base layer of quinoa in individual bowls or a large serving dish. Next, evenly distribute the grilled corn kernels on top of the quinoa. Continue with the black beans, then add slices of avocado and halves of cherry tomatoes on top. Finish by sprinkling finely chopped red onion and fresh cilantro over the entire assembly. Prepare the dressing In a small bowl, whisk vegan mayonnaise and lime juice until smooth. Add paprika, blending for color and flavor, then season with salt to taste. This dressing combines all elements with its creamy, tangy, and spicy profile, perfectly complementing the elote bowl's ingredients. It's designed to bring a harmonious flavor to every bite, making the dish both vibrant and delicious. Final touches Before serving, lavishly drizzle the prepared dressing over each bowl to infuse every bite with flavor. For an extra dimension of taste and texture, adding crumbled vegan cheese or a dash of chili powder as optional garnishes is recommended. These additions not only elevate the dish's flavor but also its visual appeal, ensuring a delightful and comprehensive eating experience with every spoonful.",

        "content": "Milos, a volcanic island in the Cyclades, offers an array of stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters. Unlike its more famous neighbors, Milos retains a laid-back charm and unspoiled landscapes. It's the perfect destination for travelers seeking tranquility and natural beauty. The island's unique geological formations create breathtaking coastal scenery, making it an ideal spot for beach lovers. Sarakiniko Beach: Moon on Earth Sarakiniko Beach is famed for its moon-like landscape, with white volcanic rocks curving around a turquoise bay. This otherworldly scene provides not just a beach day but an experience unlike any other. The smooth, bone-white rocks are perfect for sunbathing or exploring small coves. Early morning or late afternoon visits offer softer light for photography and cooler temperatures for exploring. Kleftiko Caves: Nature's artwork Accessible only by boat, the Kleftiko Caves are a must-visit in Milos. Once a hideout for pirates, these sea caves and rock formations rise majestically from the emerald waters. Swimming or kayaking through the caves reveals hidden beaches and snorkeling spots teeming with marine life. Boat tours often include stories of pirate lore, adding a layer of intrigue to the natural beauty. Firiplaka Beach: A colorful retreat Firiplaka is one of Milos' most picturesque beaches, characterized by its towering cliffs and vibrant turquoise waters contrasted against soft white sands. The beach is partly organized with sunbeds and umbrellas but retains much of its natural charm with unspoiled sections ideal for relaxation. Its shallow waters make it perfect for families or those looking to wade into the Aegean without venturing too deep. Tsigrado Beach: An adventurous escape Tsigrado Beach offers an adventure before you even touch the sand—access involves descending a ladder and rope through a narrow cliff opening. This secluded cove rewards your efforts with crystal-clear waters surrounded by dramatic cliffs. Its remote nature means fewer crowds, providing a peaceful haven for swimming and soaking up the sun in relative solitude, making it a unique escape.",

        "content": "Rome , a city deeply rooted in history, is renowned not only for its ancient ruins and art masterpieces but also as a sanctuary for food enthusiasts. Many travelers, however, arrive with misconceptions regarding what constitutes authentic Roman cuisine. This guide is dedicated to dispelling prevalent culinary myths and directing you toward the true delicacies of Roman culinary tradition. Espresso etiquette in Rome Visitors often think that Italians drink their espresso any time of day. While it's true that coffee is a beloved beverage here, ordering a cappuccino after 11 a.m. might earn you some raised eyebrows. Romans typically enjoy milky coffees in the morning and stick to espresso or caffe normale post-lunch or dinner for its digestive properties. Pizza perceptions The myth that all Italian pizza resembles the thick-crusted American variety couldn't be further from the truth when it comes to Rome. Roman pizza is thin-crust and crispy, almost cracker-like in texture. It's baked quickly at high temperatures, resulting in a light base perfect for simple yet flavorful toppings like tomato, mozzarella, basil (pizza Margherita), or just olive oil and rosemary (pizza bianca). Gelato guidelines Many believe brighter gelato means better flavor. However, in Rome, the reality is different. Authentic gelato prioritizes natural ingredients over artificial colors or flavors. Seek out gelaterias where the gelato has muted colors. This usually means they're made with real fruits and natural ingredients, signaling quality. In Rome, this authenticity in gelato is a true sign of excellence.",

        "content": "Utility wear has evolved beyond gender-specific boundaries, heralding the rise of unisex fashion . This movement signifies a shift toward clothing that emphasizes both function and comfort for everyone, regardless of gender. Through this article, we delve into the emergence of unisex utility wear, highlighting its primary features and offering insights on seamlessly integrating it into your daily routine for improved efficiency. The rise of unisex fashion Unisex clothing has been around for decades, but its mainstream acceptance is recent. This shift, driven by desires for equality and practicality, has led designers to create garments that challenge traditional gender norms. This movement aligns with societal trends toward inclusivity and versatility in fashion, reflecting a significant change in how apparel is viewed and designed. Defining utility wear Utility wear is clothing designed for practicality, featuring multiple pockets, durable fabrics, and adjustable features. It marries form with function, creating garments that serve the wearer's needs without sacrificing style. This fashion is for those who value both efficiency and elegance, proving that clothes can be both functional and fashionable, working as hard as the wearer does. How to style utility pieces Styling unisex utility wear focuses on balance. Combine robust items like cargo pants or a utility vest with simple, basic garments such as plain tees or sweaters. For footwear, choose sneakers or boots that enhance the functional aesthetic. The aim is to achieve effortless efficiency, allowing the utility elements to stand out as the main feature of your outfit. Sustainability meets function Unisex utility wear transcends mere practicality, emerging as a sustainable fashion choice. By prioritizing durable quality over fleeting quantity and versatile design over momentary trends, these garments foster reduced consumption and encourage the cultivation of more deliberate, thoughtful wardrobes. This approach not only benefits your daily efficiency but also significantly contributes to environmental sustainability—a dual victory for personal convenience and global health. Cross-cultural appeal Utility wear's global appeal crosses cultural boundaries with its adaptability and practicality. From Tokyo 's streets to Toronto 's urban landscapes, utility pieces integrate into local styles while maintaining core functionality. This universal appeal shows practical fashion knows no limits, resonating across cultures worldwide. It proves utility wear's versatility and ease of use, making it a truly borderless fashion choice.",

        "content": "Saag paneer is a celebrated vegetarian dish from the Indian subcontinent, known for its creamy texture and rich flavors. It features paneer , fresh cheese, and saag , usually mustard leaves or spinach. This dish is significant in Indian culture, often served during festivals and special occasions. Deeply rooted in tradition, saag paneer is favored for its taste and nutritional benefits. Let's get cooking! Gather the following ingredients To prepare this delightful dish, you will need 250 grams of paneer (cubed), 500 grams of spinach (washed and chopped), two tablespoons of vegetable oil, one large onion (finely chopped), one tablespoon ginger-garlic paste, two green chilies (chopped), one teaspoon cumin seeds, half a teaspoon turmeric powder, one teaspoon coriander powder, half a teaspoon garam masala powder, salt to taste, and one cup water. Preparing the spinach puree Begin by blanching the spinach in boiling water for two minutes to preserve its vibrant green color. Immediately after, transfer it to ice-cold water to stop the cooking process, ensuring nutrients and color are retained. After cooling in cold water for about five minutes, thoroughly drain the spinach. Then, use a blender or food processor to blend it into a smooth puree. Cooking the base gravy Heat oil in a pan over medium flame. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding chopped onions. Saute until golden brown, then mix in ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Cook until the raw smell fades, about three minutes. Finally, stir in turmeric and coriander powder, blending them well into the mixture. Adding spinach puree and paneer Add the spinach puree to the pan with your base gravy and season with salt to taste. Allow this mix to simmer on low heat for 10 minutes, enabling the flavors to blend well. If necessary, incorporate up to one cup of water to adjust the consistency as preferred, ensuring the mixture achieves a smooth and desirable texture. Final touches and serving suggestions Gently add the cubed paneer to the simmering saag mixture, cooking for five minutes. Avoid a vigorous boil to prevent the paneer from hardening. Sprinkle garam masala over the dish before turning off the heat. Carefully mix, ensuring not to break the paneer cubes too much. This step ensures flavors meld without compromising the paneer 's texture.",

        "content": "The 2024 ICC T20 World Cup is set to begin on June 1. Like the recently-concluded Indian Premier League (IPL) season, batters will be looking to cash in during the mega ICC tournament. However, slow and dry pitches in the Caribbean might give them a run for the money. Here are the batters with most fifty-plus scores in a T20 WC edition. Virat Kohli: 14 Virat Kohli holds the record for scoring the most runs in T20 World Cup history. He owns 1,141 runs from 27 games at an incredible average of 81.50. Notably, Kohli remains the only player with more than 10 fifty-plus scores in the tournament. He has recorded 14 such scores as of now. Notably, three of those half-centuries have come in the semi-finals. Chris Gayle: 9 West Indies veteran batter Chris Gayle has nine 50+ scores in the T20 World Cup. Universe Boss Gayle is the only player to have scored multiplte centuries in the tournament (2). His tally also includes seven fifties. Gayle has slammed 965 runs from 33 T20 World Cup games at 34.46. He has a strike-rate of 142.75 in the tournament. Rohit Sharma: 9 Like Gayle, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma owns nine fifty-plus scores in the T20 World Cup. However, he is yet to score a century in this regard. Rohit has scored 963 runs from 39 T20 WC encounters at an average of 34.39. However, his strike-rate of 127.88 is on the lower side. His highest score of 79* came against Australia at Bridgetown in 2010. Mahela Jayawardene: 7 Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene remains the only other batter with more than six fifty-plus scores in the T20 World Cup. He owns seven such scores. The former batter guided Sri Lanka to 21 wins, also tallying a ton. Notably, Jayawardene also starred in Sri Lanka's title-winning run in 2014. Overall, he owns 1,016 runs at 39.07 in the T20 World Cup.",

        "content": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday criticized the opposition's handling of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir . In an interview with news agency ANI , PM Modi claimed that the article was not an issue for the people of Jammu and Kashmir or India, but was manipulated for the benefit of a select few. \"Article 370 was the agenda of only 4-5 families,\" Modi stated, taking a veiled jibe at the opposition. Modi highlights unity post Article 370 abrogation Modi further stated that the removal of Article 370 has fostered a greater sense of unity and belonging among the people of Kashmir. Article 370...was neither the agenda of the people of Kashmir nor the agenda of the people of the country...Today it has become true that after the removal of 370, there is a feeling of more unity. The feeling of belongingness is increasing among the people of Kashmir...its direct result is also visible in elections, tourism,\" he said. Record voter turnouts post Article 370 abrogation According to reports, following the abrogation of Article 370 by Modi's government in August 2019, record voter turnouts were observed in several parliamentary constituencies during the Lok Sabha polls held earlier this month. Srinagar , Baramulla , and Anantnag-Rajouri recorded polling percentages of 38.49%, 59.1%, and 51.35% respectively—the highest rates since 1989. \"When the common man votes there, it is not just to make someone win, voting means that the voter accepts the Constitution of India,\" he said. Modi's statement on voter turnout in Kashmir \"As a result, voting records of 40 years have been broken. It is a matter of greatest satisfaction for me that my brothers and sisters from Kashmir came forward to vote with great enthusiasm,\" PM Modi said. \"By voting, they have given a message to the world and to those who used to have doubts,\" he further said. 'Decision of government always for good cause' The PM added that the decisions of his government were always for a good cause. I would like to pray to the justice system of our country that if...government wants to do any work, they have a...strategy to do that work...Sometimes I had to shut down the internet...Some NGO went to court and it became a big issue in the court...but today the children there proudly say...we have been getting all the facilities for the last 5 years,\" he said.",

        "content": "Edinburgh , the picturesque capital of Scotland , is steeped in history and charm. It's also famously known as the birthplace of the Harry Potter series, where J.K. Rowling penned much of her early work. For fans of the series or those curious about its origins, a tour around Edinburgh's historic Harry Potter landmarks offers a unique and enchanting experience. The birthplace of Harry Potter The Elephant House Cafe claims fame as the spot where J.K. Rowling spent many hours writing over cups of coffee. With views overlooking Edinburgh Castle, it's easy to see where she might have found some of her inspiration for Hogwarts. Visitors can enjoy a warm beverage and soak in the atmosphere that helped birth one of the most beloved book series in history. A real-life Diagon Alley Just a short walk from the cafe is Victoria Street, widely believed to be the inspiration for Diagon Alley. This colorful and winding street is lined with independent shops that could easily belong in the wizarding world. From boutiques selling quirky items to specialty food stores, it's a must-visit for anyone wanting to step into a real-life magical shopping street. Where Tom Riddle rests Greyfairs Kirkyard is not just any cemetery; it serves as the resting place for Thomas Riddell's grave. Fans widely speculate that this inspired the name of Rowling's character, Tom Riddle. A walk through this historic graveyard does more than connect visitors with Edinburgh's ancient past; it also provides a tangible link to one of Harry Potter's most notorious characters, enriching the experience. Hogwarts' inspiration George Heriot's School, with its four distinctive towers and central courtyard, strikingly resembles Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is not open for public tours on a daily basis as it remains an operational school. However, the exterior view still captivates fans and onlookers from a distance, igniting imaginations about the mysteries that lie within its walls, much like the fictional Hogwarts.",

        "content": "Under Rohit Sharma 's leadership, India will fight for their second title in the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup . The Men in Blue have been placed in Group A alongside arch-rivals Pakistan, hosts USA, Ireland, and Canada. Notably, India have been away from the glory since lifting the trophy in the inaugural edition in 2007. Here we decode India's worst T20 WC campaigns. Super 8 ouster in 2009 Defending champions India endured a forgettable campaign in the 2009 edition in England. They comfortably advanced to the Super 8 stage after defeating Ireland and Bangladesh in the league round. However, MS Dhoni's were eliminated after losing all their three Super 8 matches, against South Africa, West Indies, and England. The team would have been gutted as all three games were pretty close. Another terrible show in 2010 India's campaign in the 2010 competition was no better. They again won both their league matches, against South Africa and Afghanistan. The SA game saw Suresh Raina score a stunning hundred. However, Dhoni's men yet again lost all their three Super 8 fixtures. While they couldn't compete much against Australia and hosts West Indies, Sri Lanka beat them in a last-ball thriller. Missed semi-final berth in 2012 India's 2012 T20 WC campaign was an interesting one. The Men in Blue thrashed England and Afghanistan in the league round. They even defeated Pakistan and SA in the Super 8 stage. However, India's only defeat in the competition cost them. Australia severely dented their NRR by chasing down 141 against them in 14.5 overs. India hence missed the semi-final berth. Forgettable campaign in 2021 Virat Kohli 's only T20 WC campaign as a captain was a forgettable one. India's tournament opener saw Pakistan beat them for the first time in a WC match. They further lost their next fixture against New Zealand. The two successive defeats virtually knocked India out as they missed out on a semi-final berth despite beating Afghanistan, Namibia, and Scotland in their remaining league games.",

        "content": "A three-year collaborative research project between US scientists and the University of Cape Town in South Africa has revealed that the rate of plastic degradation is color-dependent. The study, spearheaded by the University of Leicester , discovered that red, blue, and green plastics become \"very brittle and fragmented\" over time. Conversely, black, white, and silver plastics were found to remain \"largely unaffected.\" Retailers are advised against using brightly colored plastics In light of these findings, retailers are now being encouraged to avoid using brightly colored plastics for everyday items such as drinks bottles, outdoor furniture, and toys. This advice stems from the research conclusion that colored plastics break down into microplastics faster than their less vibrant counterparts. Microplastics have been found in various environments, including human testicles, where they have been potentially linked to declining sperm counts. Research methodology and findings across continents The study involved US researchers placing bottle lids of various colors on a university rooftop for three years to expose them to sun and weather. Simultaneously, scientists in South Africa examined plastic items found on a remote beach. Both studies revealed significant differences in microplastic formation based on the color of the plastic. Dr. Sarah Key, who led the project, found it amazing that samples from a Leicester rooftop and a windy beach in Africa showed similar results. Brightly colored plastics: A concern for short-lived products Key added that even in a relatively cool and cloudy environment for only three years, significant differences can be seen in microplastic formation. This pioneering field study suggests that retailers and manufacturers should reconsider using brightly colored plastics, particularly for short-lived products. The results have been published in the journal Environmental Pollution . Co-author of the study, Professor Sarah Gabbott, shared her curiosity about why microplastics in beach sand frequently exhibit a rainbow of colors. Colored plastics: A barrier to recycling Initially, Gabbott believed she was noticing more colorful microplastics due to their visibility, but she later discovered that brightly colored microplastics are genuinely more common. This is due to red, green, and blue pigmented plastic items being more susceptible to fragmentation into millions of tiny yet colorful microplastic particles. Adam Herriott from Wrap, an anti-waste charity organization explained that colored plastics have traditionally been used to make products stand out. However, Wrap now advises manufacturers to avoid using pigments. Why do colored plastics degrade more quickly? The study unveiled that black, white, and silver pigments provide protection to plastics against detrimental ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV exposure induces structural alterations in plastics, resulting in brittleness and susceptibility to fragmentation. However, these particular pigments serve as effective shields, safeguarding the plastic polymers from UV-induced damage. Consequently, they maintain the structural integrity of plastics, mitigating the adverse effects of UV exposure on their composition and durability.",

        "content": "The Indian government is planning a significant skill upgrade for its professional workforce. This initiative aims to meet the anticipated demand for jobs in developed economies over the next five years. The official projections suggest that 3.58 million job vacancies will be available in 16 countries, including the US, Saudi Arabia , UAE, Canada , and others. These estimates are based on a study done by the National Skill Development Corporation International (NSDCI), under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). Strategy to boost international mobility for Indian workers The NSDCI study, titled 'International Workforce Mobility,' is designed to develop a strategy that enhances international mobility for Indian employees in the target countries. It is estimated that 68% of India's total population is between 15-64 years of age. This large working-age population presents India with a chance to create a high-quality skilled workforce for the world. Professionals are encouraged to register on the MSDE portal, where they will be scrutinized and provided with essential skill upgrade training by NSDC. Government coordination for deployment of skilled professionals Following the skill upgrade, the Indian government will coordinate with various partner countries to facilitate the deployment of the candidates. The skill upgrading process is tailored to refine professionals' skills to meet certain standards and practices of respective countries. For instance, a path lab attendant or an electrician, would need to know about the latest requirements of their prospective country. This strategic approach will ensure that Indian professionals are well-equipped and ready for their roles in foreign job markets. Experts' views on projected job opportunities Despite the government's projections, some experts have expressed reservations. The Vice-Chancellor of Dr B.R. Ambedkar School of Economics University in Bengaluru , N.R. Bhanumurthy, stated, \"These numbers are slightly lower than our expectations.\" He added that Indians are highly sought after in many countries where skilled labor is required, and that demand for the Indian workforce has grown significantly. Projected job openings in various sectors and countries The NSDCI study indicates demand for workforce in healthcare, manufacturing, and IT sectors across Europe , Asia, and Australia . In Gulf nations, job openings are projected in construction, wholesale and retail trade, and manufacturing. The highest vacancies are projected at one million each in UAE, Saudi Arabia, followed by 390,000 in the US and 320,000 each in Canada and Qatar. Australia should have 54,000 job openings, while Germany is anticipated to have 37,000 openings for Indian workers over next five years.",

        "content": "Lima , the capital of Peru , is a vibrant city that boasts a rich history and a dynamic culinary scene. Known as the gastronomic capital of South America , Lima offers an array of dishes that reflect its diverse culture and heritage. From street food to fine dining, the city's food landscape is as varied as it is delicious. Ceviche: Peru's national dish Ceviche is arguably the most iconic dish in Peru. This refreshing dish consists of fresh ingredients marinated in citrus juices, typically lime, and spiced with chili peppers. It's often accompanied by sides of sweet potato and corn. The acidity from the lime juice \"cooks\" the ingredients without heat, resulting in a light and flavorful dish that perfectly captures the essence of Peruvian cuisine. Lomo saltado: A fusion favorite Lomo Saltado represents the fusion of Peruvian and Chinese culinary traditions. This stir-fry combines marinated strips of soy sauce-seasoned tofu (a vegetarian twist on the traditional beef), onions, tomatoes and peppers served with rice and crispy potatoes. The result is a savory dish that showcases Peru's ability to blend different culinary influences into something uniquely its own. Quinoa salad: Andean superfood Quinoa has been cultivated in the Andes for thousands of years and has gained international recognition for its health benefits. In Lima, you'll find quinoa salad made with this nutritious grain mixed with fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, avocados seasoned with lime juice and herbs. It's not only healthy but also incredibly tasty—a testament to Lima's ability to make even simple ingredients shine. Picarones: Sweet finish Picarones are Peru's answer to doughnuts but made from sweet potato flour mixed with squash flour, which gives them their unique taste. These rings are deep-fried until golden brown then drizzled with chancaca syrup—a sweet concoction made from unrefined sugar cane juice spiced with cinnamon and cloves. Enjoying picarones under Lima's sky makes for an unforgettable dessert experience.",

        "content": "India 's IT sector has been hit by a wave of 'silent' layoffs between 2023 and 2024. The All India IT & ITeS Employees's Union (AIITEU) reports that approximately 20,000 tech professionals lost their jobs in this period. The AIITEU suggests the actual number could be higher but remains unreported. These layoffs have occurred across IT services firms of all sizes. Silent layoff practices and their impact in 2024 Silent layoffs are a common practice among firms, discreetly letting go of employees. The most prevalent method involves giving a worker 30 days to secure a new role within the same firm. If unsuccessful, the employee is asked to leave. In 2024 alone, between 2,000-3,000 employees lost their jobs at top Indian IT services companies, according to Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (NITES). Major companies implementing silent layoffs US-based Teradata, a cloud analytics and data platform company, axed around 35-40 employees from its Hyderabad campus at the end of 2023. This followed a global layoff of approximately 1,100 employees in 2022. Boston-based financial services firm State Street took over Atos Syntel's operations here last year, and reportedly let go of around 400-500 employees in March 2024, as part of streamlining operations. Layoffs continue across major IT firms Reports indicate that similar layoffs are occurring across Accenture , Infosys , and Cognizant. In 2024, Infosys reportedly asked nearly 200-500 employees to voluntarily resign. However, both Infosys and Atos Group have denied these allegations of layoffs. Industry experts have labeled this period as one of the highest layoff years post the financial crisis of 2007-2008. Expert insight on the current layoff scenario Yugal Joshi, leader of technology services research at Everest Group, attributes challenging macroeconomic scenarios as a contributing factor to the layoffs . He stated, \"All of them promised to maintain or increase operating margin and for a service company beyond people reduction there are not many credible levers.\" Joshi expressed concern about service providers trimming their smaller-sized clients, as lost clients are rarely regained.",

        "content": "Holland & Barrett, a leading health food chain in the United Kingdom , has come under fire for its new product—a dark chocolate bar that claims to alleviate menopause symptoms. The 75g bar, retailing at £3.79, is marketed as a soothing aid contributing to \"the regulation of hormonal activity.\" It contains vitamin B6, typically found in almonds. However, this product has been met with strong disapproval from menopause campaigner Kate Muir who called it a \"ridiculous money-making product.\" Accusations of exploitation, insensitivity Muir accused Holland & Barrett of exploiting vulnerable women, emphasizing the need for proper medical help from the NHS. She highlighted the alarming increase in suicide rates among perimenopausal women. This sentiment was mirrored on social media , where users dismissed the product as \"insulting\" and \"patronizing profiteering tosh.\" The controversy escalated when it was revealed that these chocolate bars contain a woman's entire daily allowance of saturated fat. Holland & Barrett defends their product In response to the backlash, a spokesperson for Holland & Barrett defended the product—stating that their food range aims to offer functional alternatives to popular snacks. The company emphasized that the chocolate bar and its contents contribute to a balanced diet and healthy lifestyle. They described it as a small indulgence with added benefits compared to other bars. They assured customers of guidance from trained advisors in their stores on how vitamins or herbal supplements may aid with menopause symptoms.",

        "content": "Greensboro and Guilford County elected officials are considering whether to approve performance-based incentive packages for what is known as “Project Mercury” for an industrial property in east Greensboro. The county Board of Commissioners appears to be the first to consider the economic-development project with a public hearing set for 5:30 p.m. June 6 in the Old County Courthouse at 301 W. Market St. in Greensboro. The unidentified company behind Project Mercury is requesting up to $373,855 in incentives from the county. It also is making incentive requests from Greensboro City Council and the N.C. Commerce Department, the latter involved because the company is considering locations out of North Carolina. In exchange, the company would commit to a $26.94 million capital investment and 80 jobs, both by Dec. 31, 2028, at 3617 McConnell Road. People are also reading... The prospective Class A industrial building is in McConnell Business Park and is being marketed for lease, along with 3655 McConnell Road, by the Triad office of CBRE. The 3617 McConnell building contains 104,629 square feet. The 3655 McConnell property features 120,368 square feet, while there is a proposed third building under consideration at 140,273 square feet. The site became available as an industrial site in June 2022 when a Cincinnati industrial real-estate firm paid $2.33 million to purchase a combined 35.88 acres. The properties were a 29.8-acre tract at 3635 McConnell Road and a 6.02-acre tract at 3617 McConnell Road. The buyer was McConnell Road Industrial I LLC, an affiliate of Al. Neyer of Cincinnati, which entered the North Carolina market in 2019 with an office in Raleigh. Al. Neyer’s listing of the McConnell property touts neighboring Coca-Cola, Vistar and Walmart facilities. “Central North Carolina has been the epicenter of a string of recent job announcements from major manufacturers, such as Toyota, Boom Supersonic, VinFast and Wolfspeed,” according to the listing. “The companies have unveiled plans to construct advanced manufacturing facilities that will employ more than 13,000 people. “The projects are expected to drive significant ancillary activity among suppliers and support industries, fueling future demand for industrial space across central North Carolina, including Greensboro.” Al. Neyer also lists Buckhorn Industrial Park in Mebane and Haw River Industrial Park in Graham among its other eight N.C. developments. rcraver@wsjournal.com 336-727-7376 @rcraverWSJ Get the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly. {{description}} Email notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.",

        "content": "The Jacksonville City Council adopted its Fiscal Year 2025 budget last Tuesday evening, and here’s everything you need to know. The FY25 budget goes from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025. Some of the highlights in this year’s budget include no change in the tax rate, remaining at $.60, a 2.25% water and sewer rate increase and a $4 recycling and residential sanitation rate increase. The total proposed budget is $119,436,756, which breaks down as follows: This proposed budget is roughly $8,000,000 less than last year’s amended budget which totaled $127,345,478. During the Jacksonville City Council’s budget retreat, they came up with several goals or initiatives to be the focus of this year’s budget. These included pay plan integrity, fee schedule review, recreation land development, citizen/cultural engagement efforts, economic impact — housing and development, street improvements, cultural competency and awareness, downtown development and Unified Development Ordinance review. In the City of Jacksonville Proposed Budget Fiscal Year 2024-2025 that can be found in full on the city of Jacksonville’s website, the foundation of the budget is built on maintaining the integrity of the employee compensation and pay plan. Therefore, the proposed budget includes a market and merit pay increase of 5%. The Capital Improvement Plan was another important piece, critical for how the city makes improvements to city systems, budget documents explain. City systems include things like parks, facilities, water, sewer and other capital-defined items. This year’s budget has also been developed with the intention of preparing for major investments in city facilities over the next five years, through 2030 or so. Budget documents say these capital investments will be a focal point during FY25. This year, the city also developed a new strategy for evaluating requests for new employees. According to budget documents, this process was developed through discussions with each department regarding their mission, their ability to effectively accomplish that mission, and their ability to do more within their existing resources. The proposed budget also includes a number of Capital Improvement projects that are currently underway or will begin in the new fiscal year. The FY25 projects actually represent $10,262,500 of Capital Improvements, and include street rehabilitation, water and sewer improvements, recreation development and building improvements. One concept also taking affect in this year’s budget is the aforementioned increase in sanitation fees. According to the budget documents, the fee increases will help the city’s sanitation fund move closer to operating as a true enterprise fund, also further decreasing the demand on the general fund, effectively freeing up that money to provide for other needs and services. As previously stated, Capital Improvement Plan projects are a major part of the FY25 budget. At this time, however, the Capital Improvement Plan does not specifically list the Recreation and Sports Complex as a funded capital project because city council is awaiting an update to the Recreation and Parks Master Plan. Some of the notable projects being funded in FY25 include the Northwoods Community Center expansion, Jacksonville Station Phase 2, an upfit to the Center for Public Safety, improvements to Court Street, an upgrade to the Commons Pump Station, the Commons Challenge Courts & Trail, the Downtown Transit Transfer Station and more. The city also used a Five-Year Consolidated Plan to assess affordable housing and community development needs. The Annual Action Plan is the process by which the consolidated plan is then implemented into the fabric of the community. Requests from the community this year included in the FY25 budget include $200,000 to Carolina Statewide Development LLC for a 72-unit low-income housing project, $180,000 to ECCDI for a 44-unit homeless housing project, $5,000 to Williams Outreach for rapid re-housing services, $15,000 to Onslow Women’s Outreach for a women’s shelter, $20,000 to Onslow Community Outreach for a women’s shelter and $10,000 to Philippians Place for a homeless coaching program. In addition, requests were made for $10,000 to Pretrial Resource Center for Judicial System Support programs, $5,000 to United Way of Onslow for local nonprofit support, $10,000 to Onslow County PEERS for family development programs, $10,000 to the WARM Program for a home repair program and $30,000 to Boys & Girls Club for youth development programs. There is also community support funding outside of the Annual Action Plan. This year, this includes things like the $1.5 million contribution to the YMCA pool project, $333,333 to One Place for their new facility, $100,000 to the Dix Crisis Intervention Center and a total of $50,000 in opioid support funds.

        "content": "Israel's foreign minister accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” on Tuesday, after the country moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Ireland and Norway were set to follow suit the same day in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. The diplomatic move has no immediate impact on the war in Gaza , but adds to international pressure on Israel to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Over the weekend, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in a western part of Rafah, causing a large fire and killing at least 45 people , according to health officials. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged a “tragic mishap” had occurred. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. In the past two weeks, more than a million Palestinians fled Rafah as Israeli forces pressed deeper into the city. People displaced by fighting lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the U.N. says. Israel says it needs to invade Rafah to destroy Hamas militants’ last stronghold. Israeli bombardments and ground offensives in Gaza have killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry , which doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people — mostly civilians — and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more. Currently: — Netanyahu says deadly Israeli strike in Rafah was the result of a \"tragic mishap.\" — As Israel attacks Rafah, Palestinians are living in tents and scrounging for food. — Spain’s prime minister says its Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state as the EU rift with Israel widens. — An Israeli strike in southern Lebanon kills 2 people near a hospital, officials say. — Iran’s acting president addresses its new parliament . A watchdog says Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war . Here's the latest: COPENHAGEN, Denmark — Norway on Tuesday formally recognized a Palestinian state with the Scandinavian foreign minister calling it “a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” However, “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively,” Barth Eide said. “The international community must increase its political and economic support for Palestine and continue the work for a two-state solution.” Last week, Norway, along with Spain and Ireland, said in a coordinated effort that they were recognizing a Palestinian state. MADRID — Spain moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland and Norway to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure to soften its devastating response to October’s Hamas-led attack. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused Spain of “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes” and told the country that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran’s parliament reelected hard-liner Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf on Tuesday as its speaker, reaffirming its hard-right makeup in the wake of a helicopter crash that killed the country’s president and foreign minister. Of 287 lawmakers voting Tuesday, 198 backed Qalibaf to retain the position he first took in 2021. He initially became speaker following a string of failed presidential bids and 12 years as the leader of Iran’s capital city. Many, however, know Qalibaf for his support as a Revolutionary Guard general for a violent crackdown on Iranian university students in 1999. He also reportedly ordered live gunfire to be used against Iranian students in 2003 while serving as the country’s police chief.",

        "content": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) — Three players quit Argentina's women's squad on Monday in a dispute over not being paid and conditions at a camp ahead of two friendlies. Goalkeeper Laurina Oliveiros, defender Julieta Cruz and midfielder Lorena Benítez, all regular starters, walked out. “We reached a point in which we are tired of the injustices, of not being valued, not being heard and, even worse, being humiliated,” Cruz posted on Instagram . “We need improvements for Argentina’s women’s soccer national team, and I am not only talking about finances. I speak about training, having lunch, breakfast.” Cruz and Benítez said during national squad training sessions they received a ham and cheese sandwich and a banana, which they consider inadequate for high-performance athletes. They said the Argentine Football Association told them they won't be paid for the friendlies against Costa Rica on Friday and Monday because the games are at home in Buenos Aires. Benitez added their family members were being charged 5,000 pesos ($5) for match tickets. “And there there are millions of things we have gone through,\" the midfielder added. Oliveros wrote on Instagram , “With a broken heart and thousands of dreams disappearing little by little. May the next generations enjoy and be happy running after the football, as we were sometime ago.\" AFA did not comment on the players' decision. Estefanía Banini, considered the country's best female player ever, supported her three former teammates. Last year, she also decided to stop playing for the national team. “A matter of time. Thanks for being willing to speak about it,” the Atletico Madrid midfielder said on her social media channels. AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

        "content": "Dragon Quest's creator hopes the upcoming Dragon Quest 12 will hopefully be a fitting posthumous work for two developers who passed away during development. Yuji Horii has delivered an update on the upcoming Dragon Quest 12, revealing he'd just been in a meeting about the forthcoming RPG. Horii reveals he can't say too much right now, but he hopes that Dragon Quest 12 will be a fitting tribute to two developers who passed away while the game was still in production. \"Everyone, thank you for all the congratulations,\" Horii's tweet begins, speaking on the recent anniversary of Dragon Quest - May 27, 2024, marked 38 years since the first Dragon Quest was released. \"I'm hoping it will be a fitting posthumous work for the two people who have passed away,\" Horii's tweet further reads, speaking on Dragon Quest 12 itself. It's widely assumed that one of the developers Horii is referring to here is legendary manga artist Akira Toriyama, who passed away earlier this year at the age of 68. It's never been confirmed that Toriyama was actually working on Dragon Quest 12 before he passed away, but it's been widely assumed since the Dragon Ball artist has worked on every numbered entry in the RPG series so far. There's nothing in Horii's actual tweet to indicate that Toriyama is one of the two people he's referring to. All we know is that Dragon Quest 12 will hopefully be a fitting posthumous work for two unnamed developers who passed away at some point since 2021 when the RPG was first announced. Last month, in April, by removing one key, long-time producer, and potentially replacing them with a veteran Nier producer. This was allegedly due in part to Dragon Quest 12, which has been delayed several times internally, and while the RPG apparently remains far off, on the series' anniversary, and it looks like it's not too far off at all.",

        "content": "The Britpop icon is set to play the album in its entirety next month Liam Gallagher has revealed that he is “blown away” by the live production of his upcoming ‘Definitely Maybe’ tour , and described the stage as being almost identical to the image he had envisioned. The former Oasis frontman is due to play the Britpop band’s 1994 debut album in full across the UK and Ireland next month to mark its 30th anniversary. The dates will include four gigs at The O2 in London and the new Co-Op Live arena in Manchester, as well as further stops in Sheffield, Cardiff, Glasgow and Dublin. Now, with just days to go before the opening night, the singer has shared insight on the live production for the tour, and described it as being like “a photo of what’s in my mind”. “Production rehearsals tday for DM shenanigans CMON,” Gallagher wrote on X/Twitter yesterday (May 27). In a follow-up tweet, he added: “Absolutely blown away by the set it’s full on Psychedelic it’s like they’ve taken a photo of what’s in my mind”. In response to the first update, a fan got in touch with Gallagher, and asked how the track ‘Up In The Sky’ was sounding during the rehearsals – to which the singer responded with one word: “crucial”. Production rehearsals tday for DM shenanigans CMON — Liam Gallagher (@liamgallagher) May 27, 2024 Absolutely blown away by the set it’s full on Psychedelic it’s like they’ve taken a photo of what’s in my mind LG x — Liam Gallagher (@liamgallagher) May 28, 2024 Crucial — Liam Gallagher (@liamgallagher) May 27, 2024 The hints about the production of the forthcoming shows arrive following Liam confirming to fans that he was “gonna go for it visually” back in October. “It’s gonna be mega trust me,” he shared at the time, also sharing that he wants to “bring the cover alive on stage”. “Flamingos, bowls of lasagna that I’m gonna dive head first in naked cmon,” he added, presumably referring to the plastic flamingo placed atop the fireplace on the album cover. Since then, the Britpop star has also revealed that he doesn’t plan to play the tracklist from ‘Definitely Maybe’ in chronological order , as it wouldn’t make sense to have some of the biggest hits from the LP arriving midway through the setlist. “Mixed up,” he told a fan who put the question forward to him on X. “Can’t be singing ‘Live Forever’ [four] songs into the set.” The aforementioned single is actually third on the LP’s tracklist, which begins with ‘Rock ‘n’ Roll Star’ – a past opener at Gallagher’s solo concerts. Other songs on the album include ‘Shakermaker’, ‘Cigarettes & Alcohol’ and ‘Slide Away’. When pressed on whether he’d be airing any of his solo material on the tour, Gallagher said: “Not a drop”. He also named ‘I Will Believe’ – the B-side to Oasis’ debut single ‘Supersonic’ – as the track he’s most excited to perform live. As well as the aforementioned shows across the UK, Gallagher is also scheduled to showcase the record in its entirety when he headlines Reading & Leeds 2024 in August. Previously, he said that brother and former-bandmate Noel Gallagher turned down the offer to take part in the upcoming dates . However, ex-Oasis guitarist Bonehead will be joining him on the tour following his solo projects and previous cancer scare. He’s since been given the all-clear . Although not taking part in the tour, Noel did announce a 30th anniversary reissue of their classic debut album , featuring previously unheard recordings and outtakes. A teaser for the collection led to speculation about a potential reunion earlier this month. During an interview with NME in April , Gallagher said an Oasis return was “not happening” around the ‘Definitely Maybe’ anniversary. He was asked if fans could expect a comeback to mark the three-decade milestone of ‘(What’s The Story) Morning Glory’ in 2025. “I don’t know – I don’t think that’s happening either,” he responded. ‘It’s not happening at this moment in time.” Meanwhile, Oasis recently shared an early live recording of ‘Supersonic’ to celebrate the single’s 30th anniversary.

Factors such as agricultural practices, industrial demand, sulfur availability, and regulatory policies influence market growth and trends in sulfur pastilles. The agricultural sector is a major driver of the sulfur pastilles market, with sulfur being an essential nutrient for crop growth and soil health.

In one of its intervention services, the North-East Development Commission (NEDC) has taken over the construction of bridges on the three spots located in Kalajanga, Bara and Tashan Turmi which have remained prone to flooding over the years. Already, work at the first spot in Kalajanga village has reached above 50 percent of completion as workers are on site all day round to ensure that the construction was completed on schedule as disclosed by the Supervisor of the project, Jacob Joseph, who spoke to journalists at the site. Joseph revealed that the contract was awarded to Triacta Nigeria Plc, which immediately mobilised to site and commenced work in order to complete and deliver it before the rainy season will set in. According to him, “As you can see, work is progressing steadily, and I can tell you that we have done more than 50 percent of the work. In the next three weeks, we will deliver this one and move to the next spot. Our men are already there to create a diversion to enable us begin the work.” The supervisor assured the people that the bridge, which is a three-span will provide smooth traffic flow on the spot against what used to happen every rainy season as flood used to wash away the culvert there before. He commended the villagers for their cooperation and support for the company, saying that most of them work as casuals in the security department because, according to him, “It is their terrain and they know it very well.” He also said that some of the skilled youths in the village were engaged in order to be well trained and master their trades, stressing that the atmosphere has been made convenient for them by the community.

        "content": "Senator Abubakar Kyari, the Minister of Agriculture, has stated that the scarcity and high pricing of the country’s key products are due to a major infestation of the tomato crop. Using his official X (formerly Twitter) account, Kyari made a statement on Monday in which he called the infestation that is creating tomato scarcity “Tomato Ebola” or “Tomato Leaf Miner.” Recall that a market survey carried out by The News Chronicles revealed on Sunday that a basket of tomatoes was selling for as much as N150,000 in some regions of the nation. The minister announced that to contain and get rid of the infestation, the Federal Government has dispatched specialists to the impacted areas. The Minister explained: “A serious infection known as Tomato Ebola or Tomato Leaf Miner has impacted a considerable portion of our tomato farms. This has led to a significant decrease in tomato availability and an increase in prices.” “We are addressing this issue head-on in our ministry. To contain and get rid of the infestation, we are sending agricultural specialists to the impacted areas.” “In addition, just as we established the Ginger Blight Control Taskforce, we are providing our farmers with the tools and direction they need to recover their crops as soon as possible.” “We are aware of the disruption this causes to your everyday lives and are making every effort to find a solution and bring back reasonably priced tomatoes.” Backstory The News Chronicles said earlier on Sunday that vendors in Lagos, Abuja, and other Nigerian marketplaces were charging as much as N140,000 and N150,000 for a basket of tomatoes, a price that had surged in the country’s markets in May. The article stated that dealers ascribed the increase to normal seasonal variations in the amount of tomatoes produced. They claimed that with the arrival of the nation’s wet season, the harvest season for the varieties of tomatoes currently on sale has practically ended. According to TNC, as of April 2024, comparable food products were offered for between N50,000 and N100,000, showing a 100% increase in less than a month. Things To Note Tomato prices have increased significantly over the past year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) most recent Food Price Watch report for April. According to the data, there was a 131.58% increase in the price of 1 kg of tomatoes between April 2023 and April 2024. This is a significant annual cost increase. Furthermore, the analysis emphasizes a notable surge in tomato prices shortly. In April 2024, the average cost of one kilogram of tomatoes increased by 17.06%. This increase indicates that the price of this necessary good is still trending upward. In a similar vein, SBM Intelligence recently conducted a study known as the Jollof Rice Index, which tracked the price of cooking Jollof rice in Nigeria’s major cities. The index indicates a significant increase in the average cost of making this well-liked dish. In particular, the price of cooking one regular serving of Jollof rice increased from N13,106 in October 2023 to N17,000 in March 2024. Households throughout the country will be impacted by this increase in the price of components that are crucial to this traditional dish.

        "content": "Northern Ireland Economy Minister Conor Murphy (Image: Liam McBurney/PA Wire) Sinn Féin have reappointed Conor Murphy as Economy Minister after he stepped down just 20 days ago on medical grounds. Earlier this month the party announced that Mr Murphy would be stepping down from the role on the advice of his doctors days before he was due to give evidence to the Covid Inquiry. During the pandemic, while Mr Murphy was serving as Finance Minister, he denied misleading Stormont over a joint order of PPE with the Irish Government which never materialised due to market pressures at the time. Former Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey was appointed to the Economy ministry on an interim basis until Mr Murphy was deemed fit to return to work.

Michelle O’Neill said: “I am really delighted to welcome back Conor Murphy as he takes up the reins again as Economy Minister today, and I know he is looking forward to getting back to his desk. “Conor is one of the most experienced ministers in the Executive and it’s great to have him back after a break on the advice of his doctors. “He is focussed on getting back to creating jobs and promoting the benefits of our all-island economy and our unique dual market access to the European and British economies.\" Ms O'Neill recalled how Minister Murphy had set out his economic vision for the department when he took up office in February. “He will continue the work of reforming Invest NI, the expansion of Magee, and the promotion of news skills initiatives and the Tourism Action Plan,\" she added. “I also want to say a huge thank you to Deirdre Hargey who stepped up without a moment’s hesitation into the role of Economy Minister when Conor was forced to step aside. “Deirdre once again proved to be an able minister who did a great job and I’m really grateful for the work she has done for all over the last number of weeks. “There is much work to do, and I wish Conor all the very best as he gets down to working with others to deliver on the Executive’s economic priorities to build a better future for all.” For all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.

        "content": "Every week for the past several months, I’ve been writing about Donald Trump’s legal troubles, and I’ve gotten to see, time and time again, how he has fought tooth and nail to delay and derail his criminal hush money case. Last week, I finally got to see Trump in the flesh as he strode into the Manhattan courtroom, a scowl on his face, frowning at just about every person there, including the 12 jurors who are about to decide his fate. Trump sat sandwiched between his attorneys and flanked by his son Don Jr. and adviser Boris Epshteyn. As his defense team rested its case, each member of the jury sat upright and watched the day’s proceedings intently. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury is expected to begin its deliberations the following day. Its members have to consider. Over the past six weeks, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has presented his case for why Trump should be convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, bringing in witnesses who described how badly Trump wanted to protect his image ahead of the 2016 election: , the former CEO of American Media Inc., and Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney and personal fixer. Pecker confirmed he used his tabloid empire to kill negative stories about Trump, while Cohen, the prosecution’s star witness, testified that Trump instructed him to pay off porn actor Stormy Daniels weeks before the 2016 election to protect his presidential campaign and prevent Daniels from going public about her affair with Trump. In order to find Trump guilty of felony record-keeping fraud, the jury must unanimously agree that the prosecution has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Trump falsified records when making payments to Cohen that he did so with the intent to conceal another crime, like the violation of election laws. Trump’s attorneys have argued that the payments to Cohen were simply legal fees, while the prosecutors have spent the entire trial trying to prove they were actually reimbursements for the payment Cohen made to Daniels to preserve Trump’s standing with the voting public before Election Day. Even one deflection will lead to a hung jury—meaning no verdict is reached and Trump is neither convicted nor acquitted. “If they’re responsible jurors, they’re going to take some time, regardless of whether they have strong feelings about the case, to go through the instructions and walk through what the different witnesses proved in their minds and debate with each other,” , a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law and a former federal prosecutor, told Slate. Lonergan expects jury members to take at least a few days, if not a couple of weeks, to come to a decision. And if they ask New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan for readbacks—transcripts of trial testimony to refresh their memory about what certain witnesses said on the stand—that will only add time to the deliberation process. A major factor in the jury’s deliberations will be how reliable the group believes Cohen to be. He has been convicted of lying to Congress once before—even serving prison time—and has admitted to having a vendetta against Trump. However, during the hush money trial, he has maintained to the jury that he told his past lies “in order to protect” his former boss. Currently, the jury is being asked to decide whether to convict Trump on felony charges alone. However, Merchan could introduce “ ,” allowing the jury to convict Trump on misdemeanor charges instead. This would require the defense to waive its statute of limitations, since misdemeanor charges can be pursued only within a two-year window of the crime, according to New York law. However, if Trump’s attorneys want to limit a more damaging verdict, it might be in their favor to offer the jury lesser charges to consider. “A misdemeanor charge just requires proof that the former president intentionally falsified business records, but to convict on a felony, the jury would have to believe that the former president did so with the intent to conceal another crime,” , senior director at the Brennan Center’s Justice Program, explained to Slate. It’s not yet clear whether misdemeanor charges will be thrown into the mix. Nonetheless, the type of white-collar felony that Trump faces typically brings a prison sentence of one to four years. All the experts Slate spoke to believe that Trump won’t actually spend time behind bars. “First-time offender in New York City? Zero prison time,” said Adam Pollock, a former New York assistant attorney general. He thinks Trump, if convicted, will likely have to serve just probation, since his case deals with a nonviolent crime and a relatively small amount of money—Daniels was paid $130,000 in her hush money deal. Probation allows a defendant to remain out of prison with some restrictions on their liberty. In Trump’s case, the exact terms of his probation would be determined by Merchan, and they could include having to wear an ankle monitor, attending regular check-ins with an assigned probation officer, and completing community service. He might also be required to get permission anytime he travels, and his probation officer would have the legal right to make unannounced visits to his home. If the jury cannot come to a unanimous decision, then Merchan would be forced to declare a mistrial, and though not acquitted of the charges, Trump would be free to walk. Bragg would need to decide whether he wants to retry Trump all over again. An important piece of that calculus will be finding out why the jury couldn’t reach a verdict. “ ” said Eisen. “ There will be a lot of things that the office will want to consider before retrying.” And if the jury finds Trump guilty, he will most likely appeal the verdict. Similar to Trump’s civil fraud case, he would need to while the appeal plays out, which would take months, at a",

        "description": "Following Wednesday's election, the real heroes will not be the politicians or the party leaders, but the IEC vote counters.",
        "content": "For voters, the 2024 elections process promises to be simple enough: Arrive at a polling station, out your ‘X’ in the box, and then enjoy the rest of the public holiday as we wait to see who will be in parliament by the end of the week. Bookmark The South African website’s Elections 2024 hub for the latest news you need to know But for those in charge of counting up the actual votes, it’s not as simple. On Wednesday night, the real heroes will not be the politicians or the party leaders. No, that honour will belong to the Electoral Commission (IEC) officials and volunteers who make voting days possible. A large chunk of them will be tallying up the votes throughout the night. So, just how does the commission decide how many seats each party gets in our National Assembly? We’ve put together a brief explainer on the subject, to help you understand how the democratic process works. Calculators at the ready... HOW THE IEC DECIDE THE NUMBER OF SEATS EACH PARTY GETS IN PARLIAMENT There are 400 seats to play for in total. That’s how many MPs serve in parliament during a five-year term. Official IEC data suggests that there are 27.7 million registered voters ready to go this campaign, but they are expecting a voter turnout of between 65% to 70%. That suggests around 18.7 million South Africans will cast their vote. So, let’s say the election turns out something like this on Wednesday, in terms of how many votes each party receives. If we assume the majority of the votes go to five established parties, it could look something like this: HOW DOES THE ‘QUOTA’ AFFECT THE VOTE? Now, to translate those numbers into Parliamentary seats: IEC officials will have to divide the total number of votes (18.7 million) by the number of parliamentary seats (400), in order to generate a “quota”. On the face of it, things seem simple: You simply divide the number of votes for each party by the quota, and you get the total number of seats they should win. However, there’s another devil in the detail. In order to make sure the votes are more fairly reflected, +1 is added to the total number of seats, meaning the official calculation is as follows: The quota is the benchmark for how many votes each party needs to gain one seat in parliament. By doing the aforementioned sum, that gives us 46 634 . So Party D, for example, would just be able to scrape one MP into the house with their total of 47 000. Sjoe, we know it’s a little complicated. But basically, adding the +1 to 400 means that an extra seat is actually left open after doing the division. With 399 seats decided, the last one goes to the party with the “highest remainder”, once their total votes from across the nation has been divided by the quota. REMEMBER THE REMAINDER As you can see, Party E has the biggest remainder of 0.951. Rather than letting all those votes go to waste, they actually end up counting as an extra seat in parliament. Clever that, isn’t it? And, as we’ve practically given away while trying to explain the remainder, our “proportional representation” system of voting means that a party which gets 52.5% of the votes will get 52.5% of the seats in parliament. For every 0.25% of the vote each party receives, that’s worth one MP getting elected to parliament. You can now consider yourself up to speed, even if you did have to have two or three reads of how everything works. We’re going to take a lie down, and thank our lucky stars we aren’t the ones doing long division in the early hours of Thursday morning!",

By Adenike Kaffi The Chairman, Board Of Trustees, Al- Habibiyyah Islamic Society, Dr Kola Adeyemi, has charged Muslim clerics and imams on the need for self development as a means to avert eating ‘from the dustbin’. He explained that Imams and Islamic scholars are teachers who should lead from the front and show good leadership examples in the fight against corruption and any ills of the society. Adeyemi added that this would only be achievable when the Imams sustain themselves from halal means and sources and not from questionable sources. Adeyemi gave the advice on Saturday, during the opening of a two- day workshop themed: “Creating a Resilient Faith-Based Community For Sustained Accountability Messaging”. The workshop supported by MacArthur Foundation and held in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, was to ensure that Imams and Islamic scholars, are enlightened on the different ways they can contribute to societal growth and fight corruption and societal ills. Speaking further, Adeyemi stressed that the government should partner with religious leaders who will not divert whatever attention given to them towards negativity or mislead the society. “Those who will appreciate the enormous influence that they have and use it towards the advancement of the course of governance.The government should be able to identify what they want without mincing word and not to play politics with religion”, he said. Adeyemi, who is also the Executive Director, The Just Foundation, also hinted that the society also trains Islamic clerics in agricultural activities and its value chain. Also speaking, a member of the society, Imam Fuad Adeyemi, said the Al-Habibiyya society has been embarking on feeding programmes for refugees in collaboration with the United Nations Commission for Refugees. In their feedbacks, the Imam, Al-Habibiyya Society, Imam Idris Adisa and Mrs Wasilat Abiola urged Muslim clerics to be at the forefront in the fight against corruption and emulate good habits as that is what the society stands for.

        "content": "Featuring a massive A-list star, it won two Oscars. Our TV movie pick for tonight (Tuesday, 28 May) is Born on the Fourth of July , the 1989 biographical anti-war drama starring Tom Cruise. Earning his first Oscar nomination for his performance in the film, Cruise plays the real-life Ron Kovic – a young patriotic American who enlists to serve in the Vietnam War where he becomes permanently paralysed in battle. Struggling with his paralysis and an uncaring, bureaucratic United States upon returning home, he becomes an anti-war and pro-human rights political activist. Part of co-writer and director Oliver Stone’s Vietnam War trilogy – which also includes Platoon and Heaven & Earth – Born on the Fourth of July’s powerful real life story, its visceral filmmaking and Cruise’s intense and transformational performance made the movie a massive critical and commercial success. It was even nominated for eight Oscars and won two – with Stone taking home the Best Director trophy. Born on the Fourth of July is airing on TV tonight on Film4 at 9pm . It is also available to rent on Apple TV, Google Play, Rakuten TV and the Sky Store. Check out its trailer right here: Here are the other movies airing on TV tonight: This is the End – Comedy Central – 9pm In this hilarious comedy horror, the apocalypse kicks off while a bunch of celebrities (all playing themselves) are at a gaff party in LA.

        "description": "Belgium commits USD 1 billion to Ukraine as Zelenskyy continues his whistlestop European tour",
        "content": "BRUSSELS: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday picked up a second USD 1 billion promise of military aid in as many days for his war with Russia during a whirlwind tour through the European Union. The pledge came from Belgium, which topped up the money with a commitment to give 30 F-16 fighter jets over the next four years. The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defence system, which Zelenskyy sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. A day earlier, Zelenskyy signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates 1 billion euros (USD 1.1 billion) of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and 5 billion euros (USD 5.4 billion) by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the 27-nation bloc is again struggling to overcome Hungary's objections to the bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros (USD 7 billion) are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia's staunchest ally in the 27-nation bloc. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine's defence efforts. Zelenskyy met with Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the Nato alliance. Since Russia launched a spring offensive around eastern Kharkiv, Zelenskyy has insisted Ukraine urgently needs seven more US-made Patriot air defence systems to stop Russia hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that wreak wide destruction. Dutch defence minister Kajsa Ollongren, meeting with her EU colleagues, said that such a system will be built \"in a short time frame.\" The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. \"Ukraine is also fighting Europe's fight,\" she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose swift distribution of centralised EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. \"We need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,\" Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur told reporters ahead of the meeting. \"The urgency is very, very acute.\" Zelenskyy was to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia's response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine's biggest military test since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its Western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia's bigger army and air force.",

Despite the one receiving the serve, it is Rybakina who is making her opponent move all across the court with strong forehands and dropshots. Once again, it is break point and Rybakina deals with the second serve quickly. Share 5m ago 05.57 EDT Minnen 2-6 0-3 Rybakina* (denotes server) The games in which Rybakina serve end much more quickly with a few aces to wrap things up. Nine games in a row with wins for Rybakina in this match. Minnen is not able to get a sniff. We get a quick shot of the other courts in Paris and they’re all drenched because of the rain. Games have been pushed back to 12.15pm local time. Share 8m ago 05.53 EDT *Minnen 2-6 0-2 Rybakina (denotes server) Rybakina is, of course, known as a big hitter and accurate server. But she has recently been adding these precise drop shots to her game that have made her much more well rounded. Minnen just can’t keep up. Share 11m ago 05.51 EDT Minnen 2-6 0-1 Rybakina* (denotes server) Wow! Great effort from Minnen. Rybakina hits her shots all over the court but the Belgian twists her body and manages to return every single ball, her last backhand flying over Rybakina to the baseline. But Rybakina is keeping her at bay and only allows her opponent to briefly get her hopes up before a few flying aces to take the first game of the second set. Share 16m ago 05.46 EDT Rybakina takes the first set 6-2 Minnen isn’t down and out yet as her varied shots finally get the better of Rybakina. The crowd cheers her on as the underdog but the latter brings out a beautiful drop shot and after a couple of powerful forehands, she wraps up the set in dominant fashion. Think the world No 4 just needed a couple of extra minutes to warm up after those six unforced errors in a row. View image in fullscreen Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan hits a backhand.

She then hits back with a great slice to try to move Rybakina around but the world No 4 is better at that game and Minnen can only watch as the ball flies past her.

She then wins the advantage and wraps up the game with ease. Share 29m ago 05.33 EDT *Minnen 2-4 Rybakina (*denotes server) After getting some advice from her coach, Minnen tries to longer serves but annoyingly for her, Rybakina’s strike zone is so large given her stature. It takes real precision to hit her weak areas. The world No 4 wins that game without her opponent winning a singe point. Share Updated at 05.33 EDT 32m ago 05.30 EDT Minnen 2-3 Rybakina* (*denotes server) A couple of quick aces wrap up this game incredibly quickly. Rybakina is known for her incredible serve that is extremely difficult to defend, a lesson that Minnen is learning in real time. Share 35m ago 05.27 EDT *Minnen 2-2 Rybakina (*denotes server) Minnen’s second serve lets her down early on but some good play from both players gets us at 40-40. A short rally ends in Rybakina netting a volley, but she gains the advantage after taking advantage of Minnen’s poor positioning. It is a break back and we’re all tied. Share 38m ago 05.23 EDT Minnen 2-1 Rybakina* (*denotes server) Rybakina is on the board! She finishes it quick after returning back to back serves with incredible pace.

And after finally getting a couple points on the board she then nets a shot and seems to lose her rhythm again. Minnen then uses some tricky shots near the net to round out the game.

        "content": "The police in Gujarat’s Bharuch caught a mentally unstable man on Monday evening after he allegedly attacked a group of Jain women monks earlier in the day. The man is currently undergoing treatment at the Bharuch civil hospital and the police said the monks are stable. As per details, six Jain monks left their religious place at Shrimali pole and were walking towards their Upashray (a place for monks to stay) at Dharol when an unknown man started following them. A police officer said, “When the monks asked him not to follow them, the man came closer and an argument ensued. Soon, he removed his belt and started attacking the monks.” Advertisement Satish Rathod, a vegetable merchant by profession who was passing by, tried to stop the man. When two others known to Satish intervened, the attacker escaped, the officer said. Rathod then escorted the monks to the Dharol Upashray and subsequently, Hemant Shah, a resident of Vidhya Vihar society, lodged a complaint against an unknown person at the Bharuch taluka police station on Monday afternoon. The police registered an offence under IPC Act Sections, 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506(2) (If threat be to cause death or grievous hurt), 341 (Punishment for wrongful confinement), 354 (Assault of criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354 (d) (Stalking) and 295(a) (deliberate and malicious act, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious feelings). Later, the police caught the suspect and identified him as Altaf Hussain Shaikh, 44, a resident of Kabootar Khana area in Bharuch and a native of Khambhat. Sensing him to be mentally unstable, the police took him to the Bharuch civil hospital. Advertisement Talking to The Indian Express , Bharuch taluka police inspector P D Jhankat said, “The accused is mentally unstable and undergoing treatment at the hospital. Once he is fine and the doctor gives a declaration about the same, we will arrest him.” Jhankat added, “The accused has been living with his elder brother in Bharuch for the last six months. His brother told us that he is mentally unstable and also showed us a file to prove his medical treatment history. We have also come to know that after his wife left him, he started creating troubles for his mother at his native place so his elder brother brought him to Bharuch.”",

        "content": "On May 28, Samsung Electronics has revealed an agreement with Lennox (NYSE: LII), a prominent provider of HVACR industry climate solutions, to establish a joint venture aimed at selling ductless HVAC systems across the United States and Canada. As the requirements for ducted and ductless systems evolve and converge, providing both options to customers creates greater synergies. This collaboration merges Samsung, known globally for 40 years of HVAC innovation, with Lennox, a leading North American HVAC OEM and distributor, to deliver top-tier heating and cooling solutions. Samsung will hold 50.1% of the new entity, Samsung Lennox HVAC North America, while Lennox will possess the remaining 49.9%. “It is a great pleasure to take the first step in creating a long-term HVAC industry-leading partnership with Lennox,” said KS Choi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Samsung Electronics America. “Our collaboration, focused on strong product offerings and customer networks in the growing ductless segment, will bring new solutions to the market. We look forward to launching innovative technologies together in the future.” The joint venture will market Samsung's ductless products in the U.S. and Canada, as well as \"Lennox powered by Samsung\" products, available through Lennox stores and their direct-dealer network. Additionally, Samsung-branded products will continue to be supplied to existing Samsung HVAC distributors and representatives in these regions. Samsung anticipates that this venture will bolster their presence in the North American HVAC market by leveraging Lennox’s established distribution channels. Concurrently, Lennox aims to enhance its business by incorporating Samsung’s innovative ductless systems into its product lineup. This partnership will enable Samsung to integrate its expertise in artificial intelligence, software, smartphones, and semiconductors to offer enhanced smart home services via Samsung SmartThings, facilitating easy device connection and control for a smarter, more seamless lifestyle. SmartThings Energy allows users to monitor household power consumption, with AI Energy Mode assisting in reducing energy use of connected appliances. By bringing together their innovative products and expanding their distribution reach, Samsung Lennox HVAC North America aspires to fortify its residential and homebuilder business across North America. In addition, Samsung and Lennox will seek further partnership and collaboration opportunities with homebuilders in various product categories from home appliances to televisions and device parts and technology. “This joint venture represents the union of two outstanding brands with strong market positions and deep customer trust. It is an honor to work with Samsung as we invest in solutions to meet our customers' HVAC needs,” said Alok Maskara, Lennox Chief Executive Officer. “I am excited about the future of this joint venture as part of our growth strategy.” Subject to customary closing conditions, the joint venture is anticipated to begin operations in the second half of 2024. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer for the joint venture will be appointed by Samsung and Lennox, with the headquarters based in Roanoke, Texas.",

        "description": "According to proxy advisory firm ISS, the demerger may unlock value for its shareholders and improve ITC's return ratios",
        "content": "By PTI Comments READ LATER Minority shareholders are expected to benefit from the demerger of ITC 's hotel business into a separate entity, ITC Hotels, as it may unlock value for them, and improve return ratios of the FMCG major, as per reports of four proxy advisory firms. The reports from proxy advisory firms, including InGovern Research Services, ISS and SES, come ahead of the June 6 meeting of shareholders of ITC to consider and approve the demerger proposal. According to proxy advisory firm ISS, the demerger may unlock value for its shareholders and improve ITC's return ratios. \"The structure will enable ITC Hotels to operate with an optimal capital structure with the ability to access capital to fund its growth requirements. \"It can attract the right set of investors, strategic partners and collaborations whose investment strategies are more sharply aligned with that of the hospitality industry,\" ISS said in its report. Last year in August, ITC board had approved the demerger of its hotels business into a separate entity. Shareholders of ITC will get one share in the soon-to-be-listed hotel entity for every 10 shares they hold in the company. Highlighting the benefit of demerger, another advisory firm InGovern said that the current ITC shareholders will receive a direct stake in a dedicated, publicly traded hotel entity, becoming shareholders of a specialised company focused solely on the hotel business. This move aligns with ITC's corporate strategy of fostering multiple growth drivers, ensuring continued interest in the hotel sector, and protecting against potential hostile takeovers in the future, it said. \"Given the clean swap of shares which is beneficial for the minority shareholders as well as for the growth of both the companies, we recommend shareholders vote for this scheme of arrangement,\" it said. Proxy advisory firm SES is of the view that the decision to keep 40 per cent stake with ITC, is a strategic decision to give stability and allow fair discovery of price and is in interest of shareholders. SES does not identify any major concern with regard to the proposed demerger. Another proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, has also recommended the proposed demerger scheme. However, Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) has suggested shareholders of ITC Ltd to vote against the proposed demerger of the hotel business on the grounds that it does not provide complete value unlocking for shareholders.

Commanding Officer, Commander Dan Lee, said: “I am immensely proud of the work the ship’s company have done to ready HMS Duncan for this important deployment. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) “HMS Duncan will be ready to deliver on operations around the clock as we join efforts to protect trade routes from Houthi attacks, continuing the excellent work of HMS Diamond and HMS Richmond in the region.\" HMS Duncan is equipped with the Sea Viper missile system (Image: AFP/Getty Images) READ MORE: 'Houthis launch fresh attack' in the Red Sea as oil tanker 'struck by missile' He added: “We have spent the past week readying the ship and saying our farewells to our families and loved ones who turned out to wave us off from Round Tower in Portsmouth. “It is a privilege to serve on the Royal Navy’s ‘last and best’ Type 45 destroyer and I have every confidence that the ship and our people will succeed on operations and support stability where tasked.” During the course of her deployment, HMS Diamond shot down nine drones and one missile, launched by Houthis from the coast of Yemen at cargo ships. HMS Duncan’s 200 men and women have worked to ensure that their ship is ready to deploy, successfully completing trials and training last week in preparation for the deployment, which will see the ship work to ensure freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for merchant vessels.

Read our Privacy Policy HMS Duncan spent five months leading NATO’s premier task group in the Mediterranean Sea last year, prior to handing over flagship duties to the Italian Navy in December. The ship is now ready for more operations, with more than 60 new members joining the ship’s company. A missile splashed down in the waters of the Red Sea last Thursday (May 24), but caused no damage to a passing commercial vessel. The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack, although it can take hours or even days for them to acknowledge their assaults. Trending The attack happened in the southern Red Sea near the crucial Bab el-Mandeb Strait, theUnited Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations Centre said. The private security firm Ambrey similarly reported the attack. The Houthis have launched attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding that Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the United States Maritime Administration. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat.

        "content": "Bengaluru: Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara on Tuesday indicated that the next procedure to bring back Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, who is facing charges of sexually abusing several women, from abroad will commence if he does not turn up on May 31. His statement comes a day after Prajwal released a video statement that he will appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) and cooperate with the inquiry. “We have taken all efforts within the country to bring Prajwal back. We have written to the central government, we have obtained a warrant against him, which we have informed the Ministry of Home and External Affairs. Also, a Blue Corner Notice has been issued. In the meantime, he released a video message about his return,” Parameshwara told reporters. Prajwal’s decision to come back is appropriate as no one can escape from the clutches of law, he said. “It is said that his membership will expire if he loses the election, and his diplomatic passport will also be impounded. Considering all this he might have decided to come back.” Once Prajwal returns, the legal process would begin, he said, “I don’t know what prompted him to release that video... We will see what happens on May 31. If he doesn’t turn up, the next procedure will start.” To a question, would Prajwal be arrested at the immigration centre when he lands here, Parameshwara said, SIT will decide it. “There is already a Blue Corner Notice, arrest warrant, notices have been served asking him to appear before SIT. A chargesheet and other things will be done later. Now we have to find out the truth,” he said, replying to a question if he will be arrested upon surrender. Asked about Prajwal’s allegation that Congress conspired against him, the Home Minister said, “Let’s see all those things. SIT will consider all those things.” Prajwal (33), the grandson of JD(S) patriarch H D Deve Gowda and the NDA candidate from Hassan Lok Sabha segment, is facing charges of sexually abusing women. He reportedly left for Germany on April 27, a day after Hassan went to polls, and is still at large. A ‘Blue Corner Notice’ seeking information on his whereabouts has already been issued by Interpol, following a request by the SIT via the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). A Special Court for Elected Representatives issued an arrest warrant on May 18 against Prajwal Revanna, following an application moved by the SIT. To a question on BJP’s protest against alleged rise in murders in the state and brand Bengaluru taking a hit, the Minister said, “protesting is their right, we are not saying that they should not protest. We will respond to it at the appropriate time.” Claiming that the law and order situation in Karnataka was good, he said, “murders have been reported unfortunately... They should not have happened. I will also release the data on the crime rate and number of murders that took place when BJP was in power. Also, drug cases during their time.”",

        "description": "It is recommended that elected officials may be the subject of a public report even if corruption allegations are not proven, if the report is purely factual and in the public interest.",
        "content": "A landmark review has recommended Queensland's anti-corruption watchdog should be able to report on corruption allegations about elected officials even if the person is not found guilty. The report by former Queensland Chief Justice Catherine Holmes recommends law changes, but they won't give the Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) unfettered powers. Justice Holmes recommended the CCC be able to make public reports retrospectively, provided it satisfied specific criteria. A 2023 High Court ruling blocked the CCC from publicly releasing a report into the The dismissed appeal meant the CCC was unable to publicly release reports and media releases about other investigations. An independent review was announced in February and handed to the government last week. Justice Holmes noted in the review it became clear a \"one size fits all\" approach would not be suitable. \"The conclusions I have reached almost certainly will not please all, but they set up a workable regime which balances the considerations of human rights protection and the desirability of public sector transparency and accountability,\" she said. Public interest and retrospective ruling Justice Holmes made 16 recommendations in the almost 500-page report, with the first outlining that CCC public reports and statements should be made in the public interest. Some factors it must take into account include: Public reports on individual corruption investigations will be allowed where serious conduct has been substantiated by a court, tribunal, or disciplinary process. Elected officials may be the subject of a public report even if corruption allegations are not proven, \"provided it contains no critical commentary or expression of opinion concerning them\", other than if the allegations of corruption are unsubstantiated. Anyone identifiable in a CCC public report will be given 30 days to submit whether it should be anonymised. Government to accept recommendations Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath said the government will adopt all the review's recommendations. \"Ms Holmes has considered all sides of the issue of public reporting and left no stone unturned in delivering a clear and balanced set of recommendations,\" she said. \"There is a clear public interest in the CCC being able to report on corruption matters. This is vital for the transparency and accountability of our democratic institutions. \"Public reporting cannot occur at the expense of due process and proper regard to individual rights. Respect for these values is equally important.\" Review sparked by high-profile cases Former state public trustee Peter Carne was investigated for corruption by the CCC in 2018. He was cleared and not criminally prosecuted. The CCC moved to make its report on the investigation public through state parliament but Mr Carne took legal action to block the move. His initial case in Queensland's Supreme Court failed but the Court of Appeal overturned the decision on appeal. The CCC then took its fight to the High Court but it was dismissed. Former Deputy Premier Jackie Trad also launched a bid in the Supreme Court to suppress a separate CCC report. Under parliamentary privilege, Deputy Opposition Leader Jarrod Bleijie said the investigation related to the independent recruitment process of former under treasurer Frankie Carroll in 2019. It's not known if the report made any findings against Ms Trad. The case was dismissed last year after the CCC conceded it had . At the time, Ms Trad welcomed the outcome, saying the CCC's conduct had a \"significant impact on my political career and my family over the past three years\".",

        "description": "Cape Town Spurs CEO Alexi Efstathiou has explained why one of his most-wanted youngsters, Luke Baartman, did not feature in the last match of the season against Kaizer Chiefs.",
        "content": "Spurs's 2-0 home win over Amakhosi saw the sleeping giant finishing outside the Top Eight in the DStv Premiership log table, marking an end to what has been the visitors' worst season in the PSL era. The absence of \"Boere\", as the talented Baartman is fondly known in football circles, caught the eye. This was more so because the last time the two sides had met, in November 2023 at FNB Stadium, Baartman came from the bench to score a stunning goal past Itumeleng Khune. The youngster is one of the players that form part of the Chiefs faithful's wish-list ahead of what is hoped to be a much improved season for the Soweto giants, hence the question marks regarding his absence from the team sheet on Saturday. The highly-rated 17-year-old made 10 appearances for the Urban Warriors in all competitions, and saw a return of league goals in what was a challenging season for the Urban Warriors. Speaking to , Efstathiou explained why the teenage sensation could not take part in the exciting encounter. \"The reason he was not part of the team that played against Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday is because he is writing exams, he is in Matric,\" Efstathiou revealed. Nevertheless, the likes of Asanele Velebayi and Ashley Cupido gave a five-star performance at DHL Stadium to heap more misery on Cavin Johnson's men, who would have been pleased to hear the sound of the final whistle as it marked the end of a season to forget for them. As for Baartman and a couple of his teammates who have been linked with moves away from Spurs, it remains to be seen if they will be wearing new colours in the new campaign.",

        "content": "A woman has confessed to eating her grandmother's ashes in a bid to cheer her grieving mum up following her death. Cheyenne, from the city of Narre Warren in Australia , shared how she put her nan's cremated remains in a bowl so she could consume them. Since then, she has encouraged her mother to join in and sprinkled them on her brother's pasta on another occasion. However, her sibling seemed to be unaware of what she had done. Despite the controversial decision, Cheyenne believes her grandparents will live on in her \"forever\" after using her as a garnish. She said her mother didn't seem to mind the suggestion because it was \"just for fun.\" She revealed her bizarre actions after calling into Fox's Melbourne breakfast show during their 'Cashfessional' segment. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Host Fifi Box was left stunned when a caller admitting to consuming her nan's ashes ( Image: Fox) But hosts Fifi, Fev & Nick were left speechless after they asked Cheyenne what her confession was. \"I ate my Nan,\" she said. \"My Nan passed away in August last year and got cremated. My family and I were grieving, so we went over to Mum's one night and we thought to cheer her up again... let's eat Nan.\" All three presenters gasped in shock following the unexpected outburst, which led the grandaughter to further explain her actions. \"After I did it once, I got Mum to do it because I didn't want to be alone in it. But that's not the only part of the story... this is the part I've told nobody. My brother got out of jail not too long ago,\" she added. The hosts were left in 'shock' by the confession ( Image: Fox) Fev, 43, interrupted and said \"Oh God\" before Cheyenne explained that she wanted to prank her brother who was finally out of jail. \"I put some of Nan's ashes in the pasta sauce,\" she giggled. Co-host Fifi Box, 47, said she was trying to wrap her head around the concept before she asked: \"This is so much for me. I'm taking this on board. Have you stopped eating her?\" In response, Cheyanne said: \"I'll say yes for your sake, Fifi. I eat her just for fun. Nan will live on through me forever.\" Fev rounded up the conversation and commented: \"I'm a little bit shocked. I don't get shocked too often.\"",

The market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 7.34% during the forecast period. For more insights on the forecast market size and historic data (2018 - 2022) - The global home decor market is experiencing significant growth due to the increasing demand for eco-friendly furniture and interiors. This trend is driven by both consumer preference and environmental regulations.

Popular furniture companies are responding to this trend by offering certified and salvaged products, contributing to the expansion of the eco-friendly office furniture market. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 8.5 million tonnes of office furniture are disposed of annually, highlighting the need for sustainable alternatives. The home decor market is currently experiencing a surge in trends, with smart technology leading the way. Devices such as voice assistants, urban planning, and bedrooms are being integrated with technology for convenience and efficiency. Carpets and consoles are popular decor choices, with consumers seeking rugs and room dividers that add style and function to their spaces. Bedrooms are a focus area, with consumers looking for comfortable and stylish bedding and storage solutions. Prefabricated and consumer-friendly home decor solutions are also gaining traction, offering affordability and ease of installation.

        "content": "Argentine President Javier Milei accepted Monday the resignation of cabinet chief Nicolas Posse. Current Interior Minister Guillermo Francos will succeed Posse, the Argentine presidential office said in a statement. The resignation of the Argentine cabinet chief comes amid pressure over the major economic reforms proposed by the government, including plans to privatize state companies, along with other austerity measures aimed at reversing a prolonged economic crisis marked by inflation. Posse, a 58-year-old industrial engineer, has served as chief of the Cabinet of Ministers since Dec. 10, 2023, when Argentine President Javier Milei took office.

        "description": "Jade Williams, 31, began getting heavy periods after the birth of her first child and they grew heavier and heavier over the years - but doctors couldn't figure out why",
        "content": "A mum with bleeding so heavy she got through 30 pads a day - costing £600-a-year - discovered it's because she has two uteruses. Jade Williams, 31, began getting heavy periods after the birth of her first child, Elouise, in November 2012, when she was 19. They grew heavier and heavier over the years but doctors didn't know why. Even after having three more children - Ajay, seven, Maisie, five, and Sienna, four - Jade's bleeding persisted and doctors struggled to pinpoint the reason. They tried her on various medication but nothing worked and the bleeding became so intense she would have to wear nappy-sized period pads and two pairs of trousers to avoid leaks. She would get through 30 pads a day - costing her around £600-a-year - and would bloat so much she was \"bigger than during pregnancy \". Eventually in late 2023 she switched to a different hospital and demanded answers. An exploratory surgery revealed an unexpected outcome - she was bleeding from two uteruses. Despite having been through four pregnancies and countless scans, the rare condition - known as uterus didelphys - had been missed. Skincare expert warns people not to 'waste money' on latest anti-ageing trend Jade at hospital ( Image: Jade Williams/SWNS) Jade has had an IUS coil fitted since then and the bleeding has been significantly reduced, meaning she can go about her daily life again without worry for the first time in years. Jade, a McDonalds manager, from Basingstoke, Hampshire, said: \"I had always had heavy bleeding after my first daughter. \"I could barely leave the house - I was wearing underwear, pads, leggings, trousers, and then I'd still have to go home and change. Doctors gave me pills but nothing would help and I would bloat so much I would be bigger than when I was pregnant. They told me it would stop on its own, and not to worry - but of course I did worry. \"When I found out I was bleeding so much because I have two uteruses I couldn't believe it. They said I was one-in-a-million. Since the bleeding has been under control I have been able to go back to work - and I'll be able to wear shorts and dresses for the first time this summer. But this condition ruined my life for ten years - and we need more research into it.\" Jade began bleeding after her first pregnancy and never stopped - with it getting heavier over time. She didn't even stop bleeding during her next three pregnancies and it would be accompanied by horrible cramps. She said she was \"constantly in touch with the hospital and GP\" and was prescribed medications, but said nothing helped. It affected every aspect of her life - with her needing to cancel plans, take time off work and change clothes several times a day no matter how much sanitary protection she wore. Her sex life struggled as she had to double up on underwear instead of sporting lingerie and the bed \"would look like a crime scene after\". Jade with partner Anthony Nunn ( Image: Tony Kershaw/SWNS) After a decade with no idea what was causing it, Jade - who is engaged to Anthony Nunn, 41 - put her foot down and demanded answers. She even moved to a different hospital in the hope it would be taken seriously. She said: \"I said 'I can't keep living like this' - I needed two pads and two pairs of trousers at a time. I knew it wasn't normal and it wasn't going away.\" In October 2023 she went in for a scan and was called in for an emergency biopsy shortly after. Jade had needed treatment to have cancer cells removed from her cervix directly after her first pregnancy over a decade earlier. After seeing her scan, doctors revealed the bleeding wasn't due to endometriosis, as she had suspected - so Jade became increasingly worried the cancer was still present. After further biopsies and an exploratory surgery the following month, Jade was told she was cancer-free after all. But doctors went on to tell her the reason her bleeding was so heavy - is because she was bleeding from two uteruses fused together. She said: \"They said it was one-in-a-million. They said the condition causes pre-term labour, and all my babies were early so that makes sense.\" The doctors also removed nine uterine polyps during the procedure. Medics were unsure why, but after the surgery, her second uterus started to fail - and eventually blocked off. So after having a Merina coil inserted into her one remaining functional uterus, her bleeding has slowed to a spotting and become manageable. She said: \"My situation is a lot better now. Before, I was constantly using heat pads and getting through 30 sanitary towels a day - it was so bad. In summer I'd need to wear a jacket in case I needed to tie it around my waist - people would ask 'are you hot? and I'd say 'yes!'. \"Now I can go swimming with my kids - whenever they asked before, I would have to say no. Finally I know the reason why and I can have more of a normal life. But there's not much awareness and I still never really got answers. I want more women to be aware of it and I want there to be more information out there.\"",

        "content": "Spain, Ireland and Norway are moving to formally recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, a step toward a long-held Palestinian aspiration that was fueled by international outrage over the civilian deaths and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip following Israel’s offensive. The joint decision by two European Union countries plus Norway, a nation with a strong diplomatic tradition in peacemaking, may generate momentum for the recognition of a Palestinian state by other EU countries and could spur further steps at the United Nations, deepening Israel’s isolation. Previously seven member of the 27-nation European Union officially recognized a Palestinian state. Five of them are former east bloc countries who announced recognition in 1988, as did Cyprus, before joining the bloc. Sweden's recognition came in 2014. The Czech Republic, an EU member, says that the 1988 recognition by the former Czechoslovakia — of which it then formed a part — does not apply to the modern state. Slovakia's Foreign Ministry says that the two sides confirmed their mutual recognition when Slovakia was becoming independent in 1992-93, and that the Palestinian state has a fully functioning embassy in Bratislava since 2006. EU members Malta and Slovenia say they may follow suit, though not immediately. Some 140 of the about 190 countries represented in the U.N. have already recognized a Palestinian state. Here’s a look at how and why the new European announcements could be important: A U.N. partition plan in 1947 called for the creation of a Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state, but Palestinians and the wider Arab world rejected it because it would have given them less than half of the land even though Palestinians made up two-thirds of the population. The Arab-Israeli war the following year left Israel with even more territory, Jordan in control of the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and Egypt in control of Gaza. In the 1967 war, Israel seized all three territories, and decades of on-again, off-again peace talks have failed. The United States, Britain and other Western countries have backed the idea of an independent Palestinian state existing alongside Israel as a solution to the Middle East’s most intractable conflict, but they insist Palestinian statehood should come as part of a negotiated settlement. There have been no substantive negotiations since 2009. Though the EU countries and Norway won’t be recognizing an existing state, just the possibility of one, the symbolism helps enhance the Palestinians’ international standing and heaps more pressure on Israel to open negotiations on ending the war. Also, the move lends additional prominence to the Middle East issue ahead of June 6-9 elections to the European Parliament . Diplomatic pressure on Israel has grown as the battle with Hamas stretches into its eighth month. The U.N. General Assembly voted by a significant margin on May 11 to grant new “rights and privileges” to Palestine in a sign of growing international support for a vote on full voting membership. The Palestinian Authority currently has observer status. The leaders of Spain, Ireland, Malta and Slovenia said in March they were considering recognizing a Palestinian state as “a positive contribution” toward ending the war. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said that his Cabinet would certify the formal recognition after a meeting Tuesday. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez said. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by the three countries might make. Even so, their recognition would mark a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Little would likely change on the ground in the short term. Peace talks are stalled, and Israel’s hardline government has dug its heels in against Palestinian statehood. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez’s government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Israel, which rejects any move to legitimize the Palestinians internationally, recalled its ambassadors to Ireland, Norway and Spain after they announced the decision last week. Steps like the ones by the three European countries will harden the Palestinian position and undermine the negotiating process, Israel says, insisting that all issues should be solved through negotiations. Israel often responds to foreign countries’ decisions deemed as going against its interests by summoning those countries’ ambassadors and also punishing the Palestinians through measures such as freezing tax transfers to the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority. Some 140 countries have already recognized a Palestinian, more than two-thirds of the United Nations' membership. Some major powers have indicated their stance may be evolving amid the outcry over the consequences of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between noncombatants and fighters in its count. Israel launched the offensive following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Britain has said no recognition of a Palestinian state could come while Hamas remains in Gaza, but that it could happen while Israeli negotiations with Palestinian leaders were in progress. France has indicated that it isn’t ready to join other countries in recognizing a Palestinian state, even if it isn’t opposed to the idea in principle. German has said it will not recognize a Palestinian state for the time being. Follow AP’s Israel-Hamas coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",

Gupta expresses pride in this achievement, emphasizing the importance of offering great vegetarian options in the popular Madrid neighborhood. While talking to us, she opens up about being an entrepreneur. Read the exclusive story here.",
        "content": "Earlier in an interview with Bombay Times actress Esha Gupta spoke how her partner Manuel Campos Guallar, (Spanish-entrepreneur) helped her set her business. The actress who is in Madrid right now has finally set her business and started a restaurant chain. “It’s an achievement that I’m really proud of myself to be honest. Building something from the start and seeing it turn into a reality,” she tells us exclusively. “Madrid is second home to me, it only seemed right to jump into this partnership when the opportunity arose,” Gupta adds. Ask the actress what prompted her to kick start her own restaurant, and she mentions, “I’ve been cribbing about Spain not having enough vegetarian options at good places, and when we were coming with the concept, the main priority was great veg options which everyone enjoys unexpectedly. Apart from the amazing food, it’s a more bespoke kinda place in the most famous neighbourhood of Madrid.” The actress who was last seen in , is enjoying being an entrepreneur , however, she also busts the myth that one should not come under pressure to become an entrepreneur. “Don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think we should put this pressure on anyone and compare. I became an actor by chance and gods will, but business is what I’m building. I think everyone should do what they feel is right for them. I’ve always had a “baniya buddhi” like they say. But being a mom and taking care of your family is more tiresome, so I would say women should do as it pleases them, without the expectations of the society, but be respected in everything they do.” Currently, she is happy in “life and with the people” she has. “I am satisfied, not so much as there is so much more to do, whether it’s personal growth or professional. I am just starting. Keeping my focus on other things which are in the pipeline,” she signs off.",

Gardening enthusiasts are facing the annual battle with weeds , despite the less-than-ideal weather conditions, reports the Express . One individual took to Reddit to highlight the extent of their weed problem as they asked for advice on their weed issues - with pathways and gravel areas overrun. They said: \"How to get rid of weeds in between the stones of my pathway and gravel road?\" Fellow green-fingered folk have been quick to offer their two pence on the matter. One person suggested: \"I used a weed torch to get weeds that pop up along our driveway and brick patio. It is quick and you don't need to spray chemicals.\" Another chimed in with: \"Landscaped for a good while. Weed torch is fun but is routine. I would pour boiling salt water all over those weeds.\" A third advised: \"Near boiling water, string Weeder, flame weeding.\" Someone else recommended a mix of \"white vinegar 1/3 pail of hot water.\" And another shared their extensive experience, writing: \"I have five aces, which includes a couple of paved areas and a long gravel driveway. I have tried the propane torch, salt, pulling manually, and vinegar. None of these methods have worked beyond a month and they all took a long time to complete.\" They continued: \"I'm at the point where I'm about to embrace the growth and plant some sort of moss between the pavers (I've read you can blend moss into a slurry and pour it between the cracks to grow -I have yet to try it). I'm not sure about the gravel driveway though.\" One more added their technique: \"Scuffle hoe for the pea gravel, it's way faster than anything else. For the little bricks, boiling water or a torch.\" What's your secret to a weed-free garden? Drop us a line in the comments below.

        "content": "Hannah Kamke wanted medical care—she wanted to confirm whether she was pregnant, and if so, she wanted to terminate. Instead, she stumbled onto a crisis pregnancy center that she claims lied to her about her pregnancy status and later slapped her with a lawsuit accusing of domestic terrorism. Today, CompassCare, an anti-abortion “crisis pregnancy center,” is trying to weaponize a pro-choice law known as the FACE Act against Kamke in federal court while publicly disparaging her as a violent and dangerous extremist. Kamke is fighting back, accusing the clinic of misconduct and demanding damages of her own. The high-stakes battle points toward a new stage in the effort to hold fraudulent anti-abortion clinics accountable, and in the clinics’ own attempts to evade liability through smear tactics and legal hardball—against their own patients when necessary. Kamke’s story, as relayed to me in an interview and documented in legal filings, is sadly familiar. She sought assistance because she popped positive on multiple pregnancy tests but also had her period; due to a medical condition, she believed she could not conceive but wanted a medical professional’s confirmation. Googling abortion clinics, Kamke came across CompassCare, which purported to offer health care services to women with unplanned pregnancies. When she called, the woman on the phone refused to say whether the clinic offered abortions but encouraged her to come in for a pregnancy test and an ultrasound. What happened next still haunts her. Upon arrival, the staff instructed her to urinate in a cup then wait in an exam room. A nurse entered, and Kamke told her that if she was pregnant, she intended to have an abortion. The nurse allegedly responded that “God needs every child to be born,” adding that Kamke “was put on this earth” to become a mother. According to Kamke, the nurse also stated that individuals who obtained abortions were more likely to be sexually promiscuous and, therefore, more likely to get STIs. After the nurse got the result of the pregnancy test, which appeared to be the same type of regular stick you could get from the drugstore, she allegedly told Kamke that it came back negative. But according to Kamke, the nurse asked about her “sexual history.” She encouraged Kamke to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound, and CompassCare gave her paperwork promising that a physician would oversee the procedure. Kamke—confused and distraught by this point—agreed. But a physician was not involved in the ultrasound; instead, the nurse conducted it. CompassCare would later produce Kamke’s medical records to her criminal attorneys—but the records did not make any mention of the performance of this ultrasound. The nurse declared that the ultrasound showed no proof of pregnancy. But just before Kamke intended to leave, a staff member allegedly rushed in and excitedly announced, falsely, that a “miracle” had occurred: The test had changed and now showed that Kamke was pregnant. (Medical records from the visit show that she was clearly never pregnant.) It is unclear whether this misdiagnosis might have been the product of sheer negligence or a fraudulent excuse to further evangelize Kamke against abortion. Either way, recognizing that she was not receiving legitimate care, Kamke said she walked out, violated and betrayed by her mistreatment. Fifteen months later, Kamke was still angry. As she told me, “I was mad at CompassCare and felt like they had set me into a trajectory of anger that didn’t need to exist. I was mad that these people are able to do what they do under the guise of health care when they provided no health care.” So, one night, she spray-painted the word “LIARS” on CompassCare’s sign. The clinic removed the graffiti within hours—and immediately pressed criminal charges, falsely accusing her of an affiliation with the radical pro-choice group Jane’s Revenge. Local police obtained a search warrant and raided her home. Kamke confessed to the act and eventually pleaded guilty in Amherst Town Court to a single charge of disorderly conduct, paying CompassCare $2,580 in restitution. She thought that would be the end of it. It was not. In October 2023, CompassCare brought a federal against Kamke, falsely tying to her to an “extremist group” and accusing her of participating in “a wave of violence against pro-life pregnancy centers.” The clinic alleged that, by graffitiing its sign, Kamke had violated the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, or FACE Act. Congress this law in 1994 to protect abortion clinics from escalating violence, including the assassination of doctors and blockade of patients seeking care. Local authorities, especially in conservative areas, could not always be relied upon to prosecute these cases. The statute applies to anyone who, “by force or threat of force,” intentionally “intimidates or interferes” with a facility providing “reproductive health services,” as well as anyone who “intentionally damages or destroys the property” of such a facility, because it provides those services. Though typically invoked in criminal charges, the FACE Act also imposes civil liability on offenders. CompassCare accuses Kamke of a civil violation and demands monetary damages. In response, Kamke argues that CompassCare has no right to invoke the FACE Act because it “does not provide” reproductive health services but rather attempts to trick women out of receiving such services. She also asserts that she did not graffiti the clinic’s sign it provides reproductive health services, as the FACE Act requires, but because it doesn’t. Kamke—now represented by the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine—volleyed her own allegations at CompassCare . She of violating New York law by engaging in malpractice and negligence. The clinic, she alleged, refuses to tell patients whether it performs abortions until they have already been ensnared in its “care”—at which point it subjects them to evangelical coercion and pseudoscientific malpractice. She said it fails to provide informed consent for invasive services like the transvaginal ultrasound and lies about who will perform them. This blizzard of malpractice and misinformation, Kamke alleges, amounts to serious fraud against patients, subjecting them to “harm and trauma.” CompassCare has responded by furiously Kamke in public, an unusual way to treat a former patient. Rather than denying her allegations outright, the clinic a First Amendment right to lie to patients by falsely telling them a pregnancy test turned positive because of a “miracle.” (CompassCare and its attorney did not respond to Slate’s requests for comment.) But Kamke’s counterclaim is not the only legal trouble the organization faces: New York Attorney Tish James recently filed against CompassCare, along with other crisis pregnancy centers, accusing them of illegal and deceptive business practices for advertising “abortion pill reversal,” or the ability to halt a medication abortion after it has begun. Legitimate medical groups this practice to be dangerous, unethical, and ineffective; James charges CompassCare with unlawfully advertising and performing it as an “experimental medical treatment” on vulnerable women. California Attorney General Rob Bonta has a similar suit against Heartbeat International, which runs a sprawling network of crisis pregnancy centers. James, Bonta, and Kamke’s lawsuits are part of a new approach to holding crisis pregnancy centers to account for misleading and mistreating women. For a while, blue states like California tried to limit the centers’ deceptive practices by mandating disclosures—like informing patients that they lack a license to provide medical services. But the Supreme Court blocked this approach in 2018, , in effect, that anti-abortion groups have a First Amendment right to mislead potential patients. Four conservative justices accused California of borrowing a tactic from “authoritarian regimes.” Since then, both victims and pro-choice advocates have shifted toward the civil justice system for solutions. Suing specific crisis pregnancy centers for mistreating patients is not a swift or perfect solution; a statewide law like California’s would curb the clinics’ deception more efficiently. Litigation, though, has its own benefits: It shows courts the precise harms inflicted by the clinics’ lies and allows a jury—drawn from the very community targeted by the clinics—to hear the facts and impose civil liability if they’re proved. A woman in Massachusetts, for instance, is currently the crisis pregnancy center Clearway Clinic. The plaintiff alleges that the clinic failed to identify her ectopic pregnancy during an ultrasound, then encouraged her to continue the pregnancy; this oversight could have literally killed her. She’s certainly not the first person whose life has been endangered in this exact way: Although crisis pregnancy centers rarely admit it, the ultrasounds they offer designed to thwart abortions rather than identify potential complications. Any patient with an ectopic pregnancy risks death by amateur misdiagnosis. Anti-abortion organizations accuse all these plaintiffs of a vindictive political agenda. And the CEO of CompassCare, the Rev. James Harden, has relentlessly vilified Kamke, “humiliating and denigrating” her, in her lawyer’s words; Harden even announced on TV that he intended to hit her “in the pocketbook.” But Kamke isn’t chasing money, or retribution—just an end to this legal saga, and maybe some measure of closure. In conversation with Slate, she said she wanted some semblance of justice, however small, and a confirmation that she suffered a genuine wrong. Three years after her appointment at CompassCare, she remains rattled by the experience. “What do I really want? I want my life back,” she told me. “I want these people to no longer have control of my",

Join us in rebuilding Smooth Moves and become an all-star F.A.R.T. (Furniture Arrangement & Relocation Technician)!

The Netherlands has the core components for a Patriot system and other EU nations will contribute other key parts and munitions. “Ukraine is also fighting Europe’s fight,” she said. Hungary, meanwhile, continues to oppose the swift distribution of centralised EU aid, angering just about every one of its EU allies. “We need all these critical decisions and still there are too many decisions which are not made,” said Estonian defence minister Hanno Pevkur. “The urgency is very, very acute.” Mr Zelensky was due to visit Belgium and Spain earlier this month but postponed all his foreign trips after Russia launched its offensive in the Kharkiv region. Ukraine has repeatedly tried to strike behind Russian lines, often with drones, though Russia’s response to the new technology used in unmanned vehicles has improved in recent months. The onslaught unfolding as the weather improves has brought Ukraine’s biggest military test since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Slow deliveries of support by its western partners, especially a lengthy delay in US military aid, have left Ukraine at the mercy of Russia’s bigger army and air force.",

        "description": "On Monday the Ukrainian President successfully secured a Spanish pledge for additional air defence missiles.",
        "content": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has picked up a second promise of military aid worth one billion euros in as many days for the war with Russia during a whirlwind tour through the European Union. The pledge came from Belgium, which topped up the money with a commitment to give 30 F-16 fighter jets over the next four years. The Netherlands added to the goodwill by promising to quickly assemble with key EU partners a Patriot air defence system, which Mr Zelensky sees as key in stopping Russia from hitting the power grid and civilian areas, as well as military targets, with devastating glide bombs that cause wide destruction. A day earlier, Mr Zelensky signed a bilateral security agreement with Spain that allocates one billion euros of military aid to Ukraine in 2024, and five billion euros by 2027. The bilateral aid is essential since the EU is again struggling to overcome Hungary’s objections to the 27-nation bloc itself providing billions of euros in military aid to Kyiv, which is in its third year of war following Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion. An estimated 6.5 billion euros are stalled by the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is considered Russia’s staunchest ally in the EU. Single member states have wide veto powers and Hungary has long held up funds aimed at boosting Ukraine’s defence efforts. Mr Zelensky met Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo on Tuesday and as well as the immediate money obtained a security agreement aimed at providing guarantees of military help until Ukraine joins the Nato alliance.

        "description": "Chinese automobile manufacturer SAIC has announced plans to fit the electric vehicles from subsidiary IM Motors with solid-state batteries from 2027.",
        "content": "2027 will be an interesting year in terms of the introduction of solid-state batteries. After CATL, Toyota and Nissan, SAIC is now also positioning itself as a pioneer of this technology and is committing to a similar time horizon to bring solid-state batteries into series production. Several media reports on a new strategic plan came out a few days ago, according to which SAIC intends to complete its first production line for solid-state batteries next year and start series production the following year. The first IM Motors brand models with solid-state batteries on board are planned for 2027. The energy density will then be over 400 Wh/kg, according to reports. Lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes currently reach their limit at around 350 Wh/kg. In a first step, SAIC plans to equip with semi-solid-state batteries this year, which, according to the manufacturer, will achieve an energy density of over 300 Wh/kg. The semi-solid-state batteries will also be used in other SAIC brands from 2025. China’s largest state-owned car manufacturer is keeping a low profile when it comes to further details. When it comes to solid-state batteries, SAIC merely states that the new battery technology will increase the safety of the batteries and that the production costs of solid-state batteries will be around 40 per cent lower than those of batteries with liquid electrolyte. SAIC’s battery strategy is embedded in a broader innovation approach that also focuses on digitalisation in the vehicle. The Chinese company is also expanding its cooperation network: For example, the state-owned car manufacturer recently signed a contract with Audi to jointly develop electric cars. The is due to be launched on the market in 2025. At the beginning of the year, the Japanese business newspaper revealed that a number of major Chinese battery and car manufacturers had formed an alliance to jointly drive forward the commercialisation of solid-state batteries. The Chinese government is said to be the initiator of the alliance. The consortium called China All-Solid-State Battery Collaborative Innovation Platform (CASIP) was founded in January with the aim of developing and producing competitive solid-state batteries and establishing a supply chain by 2030. According to , CATL, CALB, EVE Energy, SVOLT, and BYD’s battery subsidiary FinDreams Battery are involved in the alliance. There are also several state-owned manufacturers from the automotive industry as well as the private companies BYD and Nio. Other players include representatives from the government and academia. According to the Japanese newspaper, ‘influential state-sponsored funds are also on the CASIP membership list’. It is unclear whether SAIC is one of the state-owned manufacturers involved. The car manufacturer was not explicitly named when the plans were announced in February. The alliance demonstrates that China will not allow its market-leading position in electric car batteries to be overtaken by a technological leap towards solid-state batteries. Against this backdrop, the new consortium will primarily focus on basic research, key technologies, the joint development and production of electric vehicles with solid-state batteries and the establishment of a corresponding supply chain. A member, CATL has now announced its intention to produce pure solid-state batteries in small quantities for the first time . With regard to the alliance, it should be emphasised that the project coordinated from Beijing brings together competitors who are sometimes aggressively fighting for market share. One example cited by is the fact that CATL has sued its competitors CALB and Svolt for patent infringement. Together, the Chinese rivals are bringing together the initiatives launched in South Korea, Japan, North America and Europe to commercialise solid-state battery technology, which could outpace the Chinese industry.

        "description": "@nomither6 I still do have my collection and like to keep my games too which is why I would never buy the game if it had the 'GH' packaging. If I didn't own the game by the time it was a 'Greatest Hit' and wanted it, I would rather hunt for used copies if that's the only way to find the OG packaging.",
        "content": "@Th3solution You know, I hadn't even noticed it hadn't been continuing. I did like the Platinum line from the early days, but the red banner of Greatest Hits titles I found rather ugly. Anyway, could it be something to do with most games being sold through digital storefronts now, and continual sales? I'm ashamed to admit, but I couldn't tell you the last time I looked at games in a physical store. Even having said that, they could do a section in the digital store announcing a line that hits a certain sales threshold (and if you notice, some games do get stealth permanent price drops), thereby getting a lower price and becoming platinum or whatever. There's a lot they could do to improve the store, I feel. @BAMozzy The Greatest Hits program was never exclusive to first party games. In fact the majority of games on it were third party. Stuff like Battlefield, Crash Bandicoot, Battlefront, Monster Hunter, Metal Gear Solid, LEGO, Resident Evil, and Yakuza games, to name a few from the PS4 gen GH collection. For first party, I agree it becomes a little sticky when a game is cross gen, but some of them are sold as a package with both PS4/PS5 versions included. I also agree that the PC releases also complicate things because they seem to be releasing around the timeframe that a game would be considered a “greatest hit”. Remakes shouldn’t be a problem though since it didn’t stop them before (The Last of Us Remastered is a Greatest Hit on PS4, as is The Nathan Drake Collection) Still, at this point I think it would easily make sense to consider games like Demon’s Souls, Returnal, Horizon Forbidden West, R&C Rift Apart, GoW Ragnarok, SM1 & Miles Morales, UC Legacy of Thieves Collection; as well as 3rd party games like It Takes Two, Resident Evil 8, Yakuza Like a Dragon, No Man’s Sky, Hades, DMC5, Deathloop, GT7, AC Valhalla, FF7 Remake, Control, Stray... etc, etc. We’ve reached a point where there are enough games that have sold well and/or received accolades that they can be celebrated (and sold at a discount). Of course, I’ve always thought there was a weird inconsistency of which games get the special “Greatest Hits” moniker on their cover art. Games like Friday the 13th, Project CARS, and Plants vs Zombie: Garden Warfare 2 were included and yet hits like Shadow of the Colossus Remake, RDR2, and Detroit Become Human were not. Edit: As far as a GH collection cannibalizing the subscription service, I don’t think it would. PS+ subscription numbers have remained stagnant anyways. Some people would rather buy their games and I think the promotion of being a discounted GH would help sales. @Malaise The red “Greatest Hits” stripe still appears on the digital cover art, but it’s less noticeable than the red disc jacket of the physical versions. Like you say, the tradition could easily transfer over to the digital storefront, especially if the games are getting a price drop anyways. @Th3solution What I meant was that the main reason behind the 'Greatest Hits' maybe no longer relevant. The 'purpose' from the business perspective wasn't 'Customer' focussed but a way to have a secondary PR run to boost sales of an 'older' game that wasn't really selling anymore. Now they have PC and PS+ Sub services and the 'hype/PR' around those games releasing on PC or into a Sub service generates 'sales' on PS5. When Spider-Man came to PC, PS5 sales were also 'boosted' because of the PR. All I am saying is that Sony/Playstation is not the 'same' as it was when they weren't releasing games on PC to generate a second wave of 'sales' and if you missed their 'Greatest Hits', Subscribe to a higher tier to get to play them. If they were 'budget' price now on PS5, it devalues their Sub service and/or being able to sell the game at 'full' Price on PC. Essentially, that Sony are not in the same situation they were in, their 'market' has changed as they aren't solely relying on Game Sales on their Console as its now supplemented by PC and Subscription sales. Those still 'remind' people those games are all on Playstation too... @BAMozzy Perhaps that’s true. Either way, it’s unfortunate that the tradition has stopped after 5 generations. i used to keep my game cases back then and hated the greatest hits ugly red cover lol White DS5 that came with the console is on its way back to Sony due to developing a tendency to go left constantly. Almost a year to the day since having the console and what I can only describe as 'light' use - posted it back 3 days before its warranty expires so hopefully Sony will repair/replace the innards. I've still got 3 official DS3s and 4 DS4s - much more heavily used and no sign of drifting. @nomither6 I still do have my collection and like to keep my games too which is why I would never buy the game if it had the 'GH' packaging. If I didn't own the game by the time it was a 'Greatest Hit' and wanted it, I would rather hunt for used copies if that's the only way to find the OG packaging.",

        "description": "Jake Last was goalkeeper for Burnley under 14s Academy and hoped for life as a professional footballer until his dreams were shattered after a hospital visit",
        "content": "A promising footballer has seen his life turned upside down after a twinge in his knee led to a devastating diagnosis. Two years ago Jake Last was playing in goal for Burnley under-14s Academy, earing the nickname of \"The Cat\" because he was so agile. The devoted Manchester United fan had hoped for life as a professional footballer - only for a heartbreaking diagnosis which has meant him having to rethink his future. For tests after he began to suffer with a sore knee revealed he had bone cancer. And while initially it looked like treatment was successful - with Jake even ringing the bell - the cancer has returned leaving the youngster having to have his right leg amputated with surgery set for next month. But, the now 15-year-old, from Chadderton , Oldham , is already hoping for a footballing future, potentially playing for the Manchester City or Everton amputee teams - and even England. His dad, John, 54, said: \"I don't think you will ever get Jake to not be involved in football. He is an amazing lad. He has been unbelievable. \"It is strange to say, but he lives as if he has never had the disease. The treatment (chemotherapy) has been brutal. But he knows it is having an effect on the cancer and helping get rid of it.\" Jake's determination has impressed both Manchester footballing halves - City and United. Kobbie Mainoo, the United star, who shone in last weekend's FA Cup Final, sent him a video message telling the teenager: \"Hi Jake, it's Kobbie. I'm sorry to hear everything you are going through. Stay strong and I hope everything goes well with the surgery.\" A friend of his family who is a City fan donated a framed, signed shirt worn by City goalkeeper Ederson, which was auctioned to raise money to help Jake's family through tough times. You can donate here. John told how the family's nightmare began when Jake said he had a twinge in his knee. He said: \"He was playing for Burnley under 14s and had suffered an ankle injury and was on crutches for six weeks. We thought the pain in his knee was just because he had been on crutches so long.\" Eventually Jake was taken to hospital for an X-ray. It was initially thought he had damaged his tendons - but further tests in March 2022 revealed it was Osteosarcoma - bone cancer. Jake had 16 weeks of chemotherapy at Manchester Children’s Hospital before having surgery at Birmingham to replace his knee, tibia and femur with titanium implants. The teenager had 14 more weeks of chemotherapy at Manchester Children’s Hospital to \"mop up\" any remaining cancerous cells. He rang the bell in May of last year, as there was no sign of the cancer, then underwent tough physiotherapy and hydrotherapy to help him to walk again. But last October a MRI scan found that the cancer had returned in his hip. John said: \"We were devastated as we really thought he had beat this horrible disease. So he started a different type of chemotherapy in February of this year, of which there are six sessions, he has one more to go which is from June 4 to June 9. \"He had an MRI scan after the second lot of chemotherapy and it was found that the chemotherapy was attacking the tumour and breaking it down. It also showed that there was a small cancerous tumour in his lung and a suspected tumour in his spine but the tumour in his lung had not grown since his first scan so that is good news\". Following a recent scan, the radiologist said his back problem is now not cancerous. He needs to have a final scan next month before undergoing surgery. John said: \"Jake has decided he will be more able bodied if they remove his right leg at the hip. The higher we go the less chance there is of the cancer returning. He had already said to the doctors after being diagnosed 'why don't you just take my leg off'. But they rightly said they had to try and save his limb. Now it has come back in his hip he struggles to walk without his crutches.\" Determined Jake had already started football training again before the cancer was discovered in his hip, this time playing for grassroots side, Droylsden . He was invited to watch the England amputee team play in Partington which was \"brilliant\". His dad added: \"Around here there are only Manchester City and Everton that have amputee teams. He can hopefully go training with one of them and one day get in the England set up.\" Chelsea Ashworth, who has set up a Gofundme page to fundraise for Jake's family, said: \"Jake is an absolute incredible inspiration and has endured so much over the last few years and still has a long road to recovery.\" Jake is the second child of John and his wife, Tracy. \"In 2007 we had a daughter, Olivia, who died shortly after her birth. Jake was born in 2008 and I guess the loss of Olivia was why he was born so soon after. He still talks of his sister - and I am sure if she was here she would be saying I'm right behind you,\" said John. You can make a donation here. So far £7,700 of a £10,000 target has been raised.",

        "description": "The Pope's behind-the-door remark has caused outrage, particularly because he has been hailed as a \"pro-LGBTQ+\" Pontifex, particularly when compared to his predecessors.",
        "content": "Pope Francis , often deemed too liberal by more conservative elements of the clergy, is under fire for using a cuss word to describe homosexual men. According to a report in The Guardian, several Italian media outlets have reported that the pontiff used the term “frociaggine”, a vulgar Italian word that roughly translates to “faggotness”, while reiterating his objection to admitting gay men to Catholic seminaries. The remark was made when the pope said that while it was important to embrace everyone, there was already too much “frociaggine” in some seminaries. The story was first reported by Dagospia, a gossip website before being covered by dailies like La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera. The media reports claimed – while quoting unnamed bishops – that the pontiff meant the derogatory terms as a “joke” and left those who heard it “surprised” and “perplexed”. One bishop is quoted saying that the pope might not have been familiar with the offensive nature of the term. Two newspapers, La Repubblica and Corriere, stated that it was decided that homosexual men should be admitted to seminaries, but the move was vetoed by the pope. The word “frociaggine” stems from the word “frocio” that refers to the English term faggot. The term faggot is often used in the Anglosphere to refer to a gay person in a derogatory manner though its shorter fag is also used for cigarettes. Historically, while the term fag/faggot has been used to refer to men perceived to be less masculine it evolved over term to refer to homosexual mean. In recent years, it has also been “reclaimed” by gay men, much like the N word was “reclaimed” by black folks. Unlike his predecessors, Francis has taken a more ambiguous approach to the LGBTQ+ community, earning the disdain of more conservative cardinals. In an impromptu press conference on the papal plane when he took over, when asked about gay priests, Francis had said: “If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge? The catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well. It says they should not be marginalised because of this [orientation] but that they must be integrated into society.\" While approving a ruling in December 2023 allowing priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples, he has always been vocal about not allowing gay people to join the clergy and claimed he was “concerned” about the “fashion” of being gay to which the clergy is “susceptible”. Pope Francis’ ambiguous position is sharply different from his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI who has been a longtime opponent of homosexuality. While opposing same-sex marriage, Benedict had said: ““People dispute the idea that they have a nature, given to them by their bodily identity, that serves as a defining element of the human being. They deny their nature and decide that it is not something previously given to them, but that they make it for themselves.” The Church’s official position remains that homosexual acts are “sinful”. A 2016 decree stressed the obligation of sexual abstinence as well as “barring” gay men from the clergy. To say the Catholic Church has had a complicated relationship with sex would be an understatement. While the Church remains steadfastly opposed to abortion and some forms of birth control, it has also had a rather chequered past about dealing with sexual abuse within the clergy. While cases of sexual abuse by the clergy are more documented in various parts of the world, it’s almost impossible to pin a number in Italy because of an Italian government treaty with the Vatican the guarantees areas of immunity to bishops and priests. In the US, a 2006 documentary called Deliver Us From Evil showed how a priest named Olivier O’Grady was switched from parish to parish to cover up his rape of dozens of children. Spotlight , a 2015 Academy Award-winning team, also showed a dramatized version of a true story of the Boston Globe’s investigative reporting team shone a light on the widespread sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests in the 1970s, and the cover-up attempts of the Boston archdiocese. In 2018, a Pennsylvania grand jury published a 1,356 page report documenting the decades of sexual abuse by over 300 Catholic priests in six dioceses and also accused senior church officials in Pennsylvania and the Vatican of a “systemic cover-up”. A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse by Dr Thomas Plante, states that approximately 4% of the priests in the past half century (mostly ‘60s and ‘70s) had a sexual experience with a minor. The study claims that the number is “consistent with male clergy from other religious traditions” and is “significantly lower than the general adult male population which may double this number”.",

On May 28, tvN revealed the best scenes that were personally selected by each of the lead actors Byeon Woo Seok , Kim Hye Yoon , Song Geon Hee , and Lee Seung Hyub . Byeon Woo Seok, who became an icon of pure love by portraying Ryu Seon Jae, said, “I remember the scene (in episode 15) where Sun Jae restores his lost memories.” He explained, “It is the moment when Sun Jae, who has lived for 15 years with forgotten memories, reunites with Im Sol. The deep and desperate feelings of Sun Jae that I felt while acting were so vivid that I had lingering emotions, which is why I remember that scene the most.“ Kim Hye Yoon, who plays Im Sol, shared, “It is the scene (in episode 2) where Im Sol runs toward Sun Jae while holding a yellow umbrella. I thought it was Sun Jae and Im Sol’s first meeting and the beginning of their relationship at the same time.” Song Geon Hee, who takes on the role of Kim Tae Sung, also picked the same scene as Kim Hye Yoon. He remarked, “I think the epilogue of episode 2 is the best scene. I was impressed by the process of depicting Sun Jae’s feelings and how he falls in love with Im Sol as soon as he sees her holding an umbrella for him.” Lee Seung Hyub, who plays Eclipse’s leader Baek In Hyuk, shared, “I remember the scene (in episode 10) where [Bae In Hyuk] parodies Jung Dae Man (Mitsui Hisashi) from ‘Slam Dunk’ by saying, ‘I want to do music.'” He explained, “Even though it was Bae In Hyuk’s imagination, it was my first time acting with this much of a comical element. As it was a new challenge, I was very nervous at the time of filming. But I was also able to enjoy watching it because viewers said that it was entertaining.” The final episode of “Lovely Runner” airs on May 28 at 8:50 p.m. KST.

        "content": "MADRID (Reuters) : Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after seven months of conflict in Gaza. By joining more than 140 of the 193 member-states of the United Nations that recognize a Palestinian state, Madrid, Dublin and Oslo said they sought to accelerate efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. “This is a historic decision that has a single objective: that Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a televised address before a cabinet meeting that will formally approve the measure. Spain will recognize a unified Palestinian state, including the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, under the Palestinian National Authority with East Jerusalem as its capital, he said. The Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation, has welcomed the decision. Sanchez said Madrid will not recognize any changes to pre-1967 borders unless agreed to by both parties. “It’s the only way of advancing toward what everyone recognizes as the only possible solution to achieve a peaceful future, one of a Palestinian state that lives side by side with the Israeli state in peace and security,” he added. Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs said last week it would upgrade its representative office in Ramallah in the West Bank to an embassy and appoint an ambassador and upgrade the status of the Palestinian mission in Ireland to an embassy. The three countries say they hope their decision will spur other European Union countries to follow suit. Israel has repeatedly condemned the move, insisting that it bolsters Hamas, which staged the Oct. 7 attack on Israel from its Gaza base. “Sanchez, when you... recognize a Palestinian state, you are complicit in incitement to genocide against the Jewish people and in war crimes,” Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz wrote on X on Tuesday. The Palestinian flag was flying outside the Irish parliament as the government was set to approve the recognition in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. “The people of Ireland know that a two-state a solution is the only way to bring peace and stability to people in Israel, and to people in Palestine,” Prime Minister Simon Harris told journalists before the cabinet meeting. Of the 27-members of the European Union, Sweden, Cyprus, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria have already recognized a Palestinian state. Malta and Slovenia have indicated they could follow. Britain and Australia have said they are considering recognition, but EU member France has said now is not the time, while Germany joined Israel’s staunchest ally, the United States, in rejecting a unilateral approach, insisting that a two-state solution can only be achieved through dialogue. The conflict, which was triggered after Hamas militants stormed across Israel’s southern border on Oct. 7, has so far killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Israel says the initial assault, the worst in its 75-year history, killed 1,200 people, with more than 250 hostages taken. Israel has responded to the recognition move by pulling its ambassadors from Madrid, Oslo and Dublin and summoning the three countries’ ambassadors to watch videos of Israelis being taken hostage by Hamas gunmen. It also blocked Spain from providing consular services to Palestinians in the West Bank and accused Spain of helping Hamas. In response, Spain has escalated criticism, describing the Gaza conflict as a “real genocide.” Spain said on Monday it would ask other EU members to officially back last week’s International Court of Justice order for Israel to halt its military assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. But Sanchez on Tuesday sought to ease tensions by condemning Hamas and calling for the release of hostages. “It is not a decision we take against anyone, certainly not against Israel,” he said. “We want to have the best possible relationship.”",

        "description": "This year, the growth is expected to be tempered by a high base effect",
        "content": "By ANI Comments READ LATER Bank credit growth is expected to moderate 200 basis points (100 basis points is equal to 1 percentage point) to 14 per cent this year after an estimated robust growth of 16 per cent last financial year, according to Crisil Ratings. Strong economic activity and retail credit demand drove loan growth last year. This year, the growth is expected to be tempered by a high base effect, a revision in risk weights, and a somewhat lower gross domestic product (GDP) growth, asserted Crisil. However, on the positive side, it notes that the fundamental drivers of credit demand seem to be broadly intact and a revival in private corporate capital expenditure, especially towards the second half of year 2024-25, can provide some tailwinds. Within the expected overall bank credit growth of 14 per cent in 2024-25, the largest segment, corporate credit, at 45 per cent of bank credit, should see growth remaining steady at 13 per cent, while retail (at 28 per cent of bank credit), the second-largest segment, is expected to grow the fastest at 16 per cent. Ajit Velonie, Senior Director, CRISIL Ratings, said, \"Growth in corporate credit will be supported by private sector industrial capex in fiscal 2025, underpinned by expectations that GDP growth will remain solid.\" Retail credit will likely report a tad lower at 16 per cent, compared with 17 per cent last year, but will remain the fastest-growing segment for banks. Explaining rationale, it said the retail segment will feel the drag of lower growth in unsecured consumer credit (at 25 per cent of retail credit) as banks realign their strategies following the regulatory advisory to counter a potential rise in loan delinquencies. Home loans remain the largest constituent of retail credit and should grow steadily, given increasing preference for home ownership and better affordability, the rating agency said. Agricultural credit growth will remain linked to monsoon trends but should witness a moderation on the back of a strong financial year 2023-24. The southwest monsoon, as predicted by the weather bureau IMD, is likely to hit Kerala on May 31, a day before the normal date of June 1. The India Meteorological Department said conditions are becoming favourable for the onset of the monsoon. These rains are crucial to the Indian agriculture economy, especially for kharif crops. India has three cropping seasons - summer, kharif and rabi. Comments",

        "content": "Dear Annie: My heart is broken, and so is my wife’s. This past year, we planned a family vacation because my daughter and her family and my son and his live in a different state. We were meeting in the middle to save everyone from such a long road trip. My wife and I have been married almost 35 years, and she helped raise my two children. My grandchildren all adore her. On the second day of our trip, my wife and my son’s 7-year-old son were playing cards. My wife went to give him a hug, and out of the blue, my son and his wife literally jumped up and said, “No! We don’t do that!” It was shocking to say the least. My wife couldn’t believe it; she immediately left the room, and she says even now, four months later, that the look on our grandson’s face when that happened broke her heart. Needless to say, the rest of the trip was very awkward. I am very close to my son, and we still talk roughly every other day, but my wife will never forgive them for that. I feel like my son and his wife owe my wife an apology because things will never be the same. My son is a police officer, and he has seen a lot, and as a result he and his wife are very overprotective of his children. They don’t let them spend the night away from home because they don’t trust people. I know that we can’t be too careful, but the way they handled that situation was totally wrong. I told my wife that if they had decided that no one could be “affectionate” with their son, they should have told us that in private. Please give me some advice. Thank you! -- Heartbroken Dad and Grandfather Dear Heartbroken: You are correct that they should have spoken to you in private about their wishes that you not hug their children. By reprimanding your wife in front of her grandson, they are hurting their own son by depriving him of a grandmother’s hug -- which is a sad thing to deprive a grandson of. Instead of never forgiving, try to get curious about the why. You mentioned that your son is a police officer and has seen a lot. Maybe he just saw something very disturbing. Whatever the reason, it’s important that you have a dialogue about it so that you and your wife can have a better understanding of it. In the future, hopefully, your son and daughter-in-law never reprimand you or your wife in front of your grandchildren. But forgiveness is a gift you give yourself. So forgive. “How Can I Forgive My Cheating Partner?” is out now!

        "content": "A WOMAN has revealed that she makes £20,000 a month from a simple side hustle, that takes minutes to set up. Taylor Couch shared details of her money making hack via a video posted to her TikTok channel, which she often uses to share side hustle tips and tricks. The side hustle pro revealed that YouTube pays around £10-£20 per 1000 video views. She then explained that simple, faceless videos such as 'relaxing cafe music mix' or 'cosy fireplace sounds' gain around 60 million views on the video sharing platform. This means that the creators of these videos made over £230,000 from just one video. To make your own video, Taylor explained that all you need to do is go to ai.invideo.io. Then, ask the AI to make you a video, being as descriptive as possible. For example, Taylor asked the AI to create a three minute YouTube video with 10 scenes of beautiful scenery, paired with relaxing music. Then click 'generate video' and select your audience. \"Boom! Within minutes you have a video\", she said. You can then edit the video if you want to, and when you're happy with it, simply download it and upload it to YouTube. You can do this as many times as you like, creating a variety of different videos. \"Then sit back, and collect income passively\", she said. Taylor's video, which was posted under the username @thecouchclub , has likely left many people impressed, as it has racked up over 780,0000 views on the video sharing platform. TikTok users raced to the video's comments section to share their thoughts. One person said: \"Golden!! Thank you for sharing this!!\" A second person said: \"Thank you, helpful tips and ideas that I really appreciate. Based on new research from Finder, an estimated 22.8 million Brits are using side hustles to top up their income. Among generation those aged 18-23 68 percent have a side hustle in 2024. Those aged 24-42 aren’t far behind, with 65 per cent having an additional source of income. Side hustles are less popular among older generations, with 40 percent of generation those aged 43-54 having one. Whereas 23 percent of people aged 55-73 and just 7 per cent of those aged 74 and over are earning extra cash this way. \"Definitely want to try this!\" A third person added: \"AI is really changing the game!!\" A fourth said: \"I love the way you can use AI to make money online\".

        "content": "SHE \"was sick\" of her greasy splashbacks that took off half the paint any time she tried to clean them. So, after getting inspiration from others online, Victoria decided to splash out on some stick on tiles from Temu to give her kitchen a revamp . She documented the process in a video on her TikTok page, as she admitted she was initially hesitant to buy from Temu after hearing mixed reviews. \"Would you believe that these stickers only cost me £16 from Temu?\" Victoria said. \"I've never bought from Temu before, and I thought it was gonna be a bit of a scam, but honestly this is so good. \"They actually look like real tiles - you cannot tell they're stickers!\" She initially showed where she'd tried to clean some of the grubbiness off her splashbacks, and it had taken the paint off. Victoria then showed the tile stickers she'd picked up, as she had been inspired by someone else who had bought the pink version. \"You simply peel back the plastic, and then you peel back the other bit for it to be sticky,\" she said, demonstrating as she went. \"I placed it on the wall like this - trust me it took me hours, but it's super easy. \"This is the final result and I am so chuffed with it!\" Victoria added in the caption: \"This isnt an ad, im so really happy with how these came out! \"You literally can't tell they are stickers!\" But the process wasn't entirely straightforward, as Victoria added: \"The cutting in around the plugs though was a REAL faff!\" \"I buy loads from there tbf,\" one person commented on the video. \"I've had some great stuff but prices have definitely gone up.\" \"Well if £16 is inflated I am sure gutted I missed them 'cheap',\" Victoria laughed. \"It doesn’t look any different on camera unfortunately,\" someone else argued. Well Polished conducted a survey and the results are in! Most Hated Household Chores Most Liked Household Chores Men VS Women: Who Puts the Work In? Men spend 7 hours 54 minutes a week cleaning. Women spend 12 hours 15 minutes a week cleaning. \"I wish they were more defined!\" But Victoria was entirely unbothered by the remark, as she replied: \"That's okay! \"I don't look at it through a camera! \"And boy has it made a difference in real life!\"",

CAVA Group's ( CAVA ) shares rose over 5% ahead of the company's Q results, scheduled after the market close, with analysts estimating EPS of $0.05 and the consensus revenue of $245.46M. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 5 upward revisions and 0 downward revisions, while revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 1 downward revision. Biggest stock losers Hello Group's ( MOMO ) shares fell nearly 6% after the company reported mixed Q1 results, with revenue dropping 9% Y/Y on the back of a decline in live video service revenues, Value-added service revenues, and Mobile games revenues. Monthly active users on the Tantan app fell to 13.7M, compared to 19.5M a year earlier, while Momo's total paying users were 7.1M in Q1, compared to 7.8M a year ago.

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria I’m not aware of rivalry between Asake, Seyi Vibez – Ayra Starr Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport Entertainment I’m not aware of rivalry between Asake, Seyi Vibez – Ayra Starr Published on May 28, 2024 By Sunny Green Itodo Afrobeats singer Ayra Starr has denied knowledge of the rivalry between her colleagues, Asake and Seyi Vibez. While Asake and Seyi Vibez have not had any public spat, there has always been a chill between their fanbases, especially on social media. In a recent interview with The Beat FM Lagos, Ayra Starr was asked whether her decision to work with both men on her sophomore album, ‘The Year I Turned 21,’ was intentional because of their rivalry and she denied knowledge of the rivalry. According to her, she decided to work with them because she loves their sonic prowess. She said, “I didn’t put Asake and Seyi Vibez on my album because of their rivalry. I didn’t know about the rivalry between Asake and Seyi Vibez. I just love both of them as artists. “I’m really big on sonics; what would sound good sonically. My team is always thinking of the business side but I’m just thinking of who would be sonically compatible with me. And I’ve been listening to Seyi Vibez’s ‘Different Pattern’ for a very long time. So I decided to work with him. When I sent the record to him, he sent his verse almost immediately. They were very quick with it. Asake, too, he sent me his verse in three days.” Related Topics: Asake Ayra Starr Seyi Vibez Don't Miss How I met my husband – Veekee James You may like I’m not aware of rivalry between Asake, Seyi Vibez – Ayra Starr ‘Sabigays’: Controversy as Ayra Starr embraces LGBTQ fans at Brazil concert Ayra Starr relishes BET nominations Burna Boy, Ayra Starr, others bag nominations for 2024 Bet Awards ‘I didn’t know Rihanna was real until I saw her’ – Ayra Starr ‘I’m single but have broken a few hearts’ – Ayra Starr Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

        "content": "Dear Readers : I appreciate it when people give me updates on previously published advice. Related Articles Ask Amy: My husband wants me to stay home, but I can’t do that Ask Amy: My unsociable neighbor doesn’t know about me and his wife. When should I tell him? Ask Amy: He asked me if I like his girlfriend, and I couldn’t tell the truth Ask Amy: Amy Dickinson announces her column is ending Ask Amy: Am I being unreasonable about my husband’s attachment to his friend? Below is a Q&A originally published in 2016, and then the recent update. Dear Amy : I’m hoping for a career in art, specifically as an illustrator. Three years ago I graduated with an art degree and have been working to make that happen, doing a lot of research, building a portfolio and exploring my options. I work part time to keep myself fed, but otherwise I’m always drawing, painting and networking. From what I’ve learned, it takes years before most artists can quit their day jobs. I’m prepared for this; I’m in no way lazy, but I know it will take me a long time. I keep my head down and keep trying. My family and friends are supportive, which is wonderful, but there is a big problem. They don’t understand why it is taking me so long. So they offer art advice, although they are not artists: advice on what to paint, how much to sell it for, whom to work for and so on. Sometimes the advice is ridiculous, if not insulting: “Just go work for Disney,” or “Nobody wants to buy those kinds of paintings. Paint portraits; those will sell.” Or, “Do it for the exposure if you have to.” They don’t trust that I know what I’m doing, and they don’t recognize how hard I’m working. It gets to the point where I don’t want to talk about my art at all. I want to enjoy my family get-togethers again. How can I let on (politely) that I’m not interested in their bombardment of ill-informed advice? – Struggling Artist Dear Struggling : Everybody’s an expert, and the less people know about your particular field, the more “expert” their advice becomes. What you are going through is akin to people telling a certain struggling writer (yours truly), “You should write a book and get Oprah to endorse it!” This sort of statement might actually be a vote of confidence from the person offering it; unfortunately, instead it highlights the fact that none of these spectacular goals has been met. It’s a quick way to feel like a loser. Don’t stop talking about your work (if you’re asked), and don’t avoid or ignore this unsolicited advice, but look for effective ways to cope with it. “You should work for Disney,” could be met with “That might be very cool. Do you know anyone there I can call?” Remember always that this is really your fan club; they’re just disguised as a Greek chorus of know-it-alls. Dear Amy: I wrote to you as a struggling artist who was bombarded with bad career advice from family and friends. Well, I’m still a struggling artist and I’m still bombarded with ill-fitting advice, but I’m excited to say I’ve just received an offer on my picture book. I am going to be a published children’s book author/illustrator! The best thing I did was ask for advice from authors and illustrators. I joined the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators and got involved with the local chapter. I’m lucky I found a kick-butt agent and a wonderful writing group. Meanwhile I let the bad advice from my family roll off my back. I know they mean well, and I’m sure they’ll be thrilled to receive a copy of my picture book. My grandma, who taught me how to paint as a child, has dementia now and can’t give advice anymore, but she giggles in delight when I doodle for her. She’s still my biggest fan. – Soon to be Published Dear Soon to be Published: Your update is delightful. Your hard work has really paid off! I look forward to adding your book to my library. Dear Amy : You recently answered a question from “Living a Lie,” who had been lying for 50 years, claiming to be a Vietnam veteran. I am a female military veteran. I, along with countless other women, served proudly alongside our male counterparts. I am disappointed with your comment to Living a Lie about “many thousands of men who served during the Vietnam War, and who have oftentimes suffered because of their service.” Related Articles Ask Amy: My husband wants me to stay home, but I can’t do that Ask Amy: My unsociable neighbor doesn’t know about me and his wife. When should I tell him?

Too often our female soldiers are not acknowledged or recognized for their vital contributions in military service. A quick Google search may have provided you the opportunity to be more inclusive with your response. – Proud Veteran Dear Proud : I’ve heard from several women veterans, highlighting your point. I should have been inclusive in my response, and I apologize for my mistake. You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O. Box 194, Freeville, NY 13068.

        "description": "Actor Manchu Manoj returns to Tollywood after an eight-year hiatus. During this break, he found love, married Mounika, and welcomed their daughter in April 2024. As he prepares for a comeback with Mirai and What the Fish, Manoj reflects on embracing fatherhood and a new perspective on life.",
        "content": "Actor Manchu Manoj is celebrating two decades in Tollywood this year, but it’s been an eight-year hiatus since his last film. The actor, who made his debut in a lead role with Donga Dongadi in 2004, attributes this hiatus to a “necessary break to rebuild his personal life”. The actor shares, “During this time, I found love and married Mounika . Our joy was doubled when we welcomed our daughter in April 2024.” Manoj has been relishing this new chapter in life, embracing fatherhood fully. Now, as he gears up for a comeback in 2025 with Mirai and then What the Fish , Hyderabad Times catches up with the actor for a tete-e-tete. Excerpts... The first time Manoj saw his baby girl, admittedly his blood pressure shot up because of his excitement. “Experiencing the birth of my daughter was surreal; it’s still sinking in. Holding her for the first time, I felt like I was cradling a precious gift from God. My sister, Lakshmi, handed her to me in the operation theatre, and as I embraced her, my emotions overwhelmed me,” he says, adding, “Witnessing my wife’s strength and pain during labour, while trying to comfort her, transformed me profoundly. It was a moment that reshaped my perspective on life.” When his daughter was born, the room filled with joy as she let out a soft roar. The nickname “Puli” stuck, inspired by her initial reaction. “It’s a temporary moniker until we settle on her official name. The ‘MM’ in ‘MM Puli’ symbolises our bond—Manoj and Mounika,” he says. Manoj is set to make a comeback with Mirai. It was HanuMan actor Teja Sajja who approached Manoj to star in the film. “He narrated the script to me, and I fell in love with the character. It’s a crazy concept. Coming to my other project, What The Fish, it is currently in the pre-production phase and the shooting will soon commence in Canada,” he reveals, adding that the audience will witness him in never-before-seen avatars in his upcoming films. Manoj was born with a passion for acting and he is always hungry for good roles. “Like Hulk says, ‘I’m always angry’, I’m always hungry for acting. When I hear a new script, my energy levels always go up,” he shares. It was in the year 2016 that Manoj felt he deserved a break. “I was 11 months old when I entered the industry as a child actor! When you are born into a film family, you need to realise when to pause and make yourself a priority. Finding Mounika helped me restart my life with a fresh perspective,” he says.",

I know in my heart we will see you again, my love,” she added. Pineda then revealed she named her unborn child Christiana. “For now, enjoy your time in heaven along with all the angels,” she stated. “We can’t wait to have you back in our arms in His time.” A post shared by Charee Pineda-Soledad (@chareepineda) Aside from her husband Martell Soledad and their firstborn Cesco who were both with the actress in the hospital, Pineda also received comfort from her fellow celebrity moms Angeline Quinto, Yasmien Kurdi, Lovely Abella and Melissa Ricks through the comments section.

        "description": "Poco F6 review: Big display, bigger battery but nothing else",
        "content": "Listen to Story Poco F6 is not the dream smartphone that was promised. If I were writing this review within a couple of days of using the phone, my verdict could have been different. The initial days with Poco F6 were pretty good. However, I used the Poco F6 for a little over a week and I saw it struggle in some areas. While it has its pros, the cons overpower the overall performance. Let’s dive deep into the details of the latest Poco flagship. Poco F6 was launched in India on May 23 at a starting price of Rs 29,999. While the smartphone has a plethora of listed features, Poco focused on 4 major parts for this flagship — display, gaming performance, camera, and battery. The smartphone is available in three different variants. The standard variant with 8GB RAM and 256GB of internal storage is priced at Rs 29,999. And other variants are 12GB+256GB and 12GB+ 512GB priced at Rs 31,999 and Rs 33,999, respectively. But is the smartphone worth it? Let's see. The display is perhaps one of the best features of Poco F6. The screen does justice to the vibrant colours presented on it which enhances the gaming or Netflix sessions on the phone. I watched the last legs of IPL on Poco F6 and I have nothing to complain about. It hit the brightness of 2400 nits and I could feel it. While I mostly watched content during the latter part of the day, it was easy to text even under the peak sunlight. The touch is quite smooth and cheers the response rate. I did not feel any hindrance when it came to the touch and display. Adding on to the same point, the fingerprint lock is also built so well that it instantly, within a few seconds, picks up and unlocks the phone. I have a habit of using the face lock — which is also very quick— and could not use the fingerprint lock that often. But whenever I did, it worked just fine. The smartphone has a boxy look with curved edges and a very big screen. To review Poco F6, I moved from iPhone 13 which was a big screen change. I am not kidding when I say that the Poco F6 is as big as my face. While it was excellent for watching content and gaming, Poco F6 is not handy. I do not follow the “phone in the front pocket” phenomenon (because my denim pockets are equal to nothing) but the phone is too big to keep in your hand or in your back pocket. I struggled to use the smartphone with one hand only. I tried typing with my left hand on the phone, but couldn’t reach for the letters at the other end of the keyboard. Coming to the back panel of Poco F6, I was using the classic black version. The phone looks sleek and has a classy edge to it. But I also noticed that it gets attached to smudges and fingerprints. The big gas stove cameras add a heavier look to the device, but in fact Poco F6 is very light. The battery was another aspect that impressed me massively. I never charged the device twice in a day. And on a day when I did not use the device much, the battery was able to stretch for another half a day. Staying true to what was said in the event, the device charged up pretty quickly. In just 15 minutes, the charging speed picked up pace from 41 per cent to 88 per cent, thanks to 90W turbocharging support. Poco F6 features a big 5,000mAh battery. The only fact to be worried about is that it heats up while charging. Even after Poco said that the device has several sensors all across the body to cool down the system. And the disappointment begins! On a personal note, the camera is not that impressive. I tried to click images in all modes, but did not enjoy the experience. The camera does not do justice to the subject being clicked. The images clicked on the phone also have really high saturation, and despite switching off the skin filters, the phone clears out the subject’s skin, even in the selfie mode. Now, this may actually not be a dealbreaker for all users, because this eliminates the need to edit and image and are somewhat social media-ready. However, anyone looking to get at least close-to-authentic shots on the phone, would be disappointed. The Poco F6 features a dual-rear camera system with a 50-megapixel Sony main lens and an 8MP Sony ultrawide lens. The pictures in a well-lit environment come out fine, but the night mode is a bit underwhelming. Pictures clicked by Poco F6 I think the camera is just on the boundary of workable but fails to make it into the great category. The portrait mode has good edge detection, but the overall result is a heavily touched up picture, and I am not a fan of that. Poco F6 portrait mode Here are a few pictures I managed to click this week: It is all well if it ends well. But here, it does not. Poco bragged about the gaming experience so much that one would think that this device could take up hours of gaming. The truth is, after playing Call of Duty for only 30 minutes, I could feel the device heat up. I understand that Delhi is under the wrath of the sun these days, but even in a well air conditioned room, the device heats up during gaming sessions. It was not uncomfortably hot, but it was warm enough that I decided to give it a rest. The plus point, however, is that it cools down quickly as well. I think the liquid cooling system is doing its job. The Hyper OS was supposed to be a better one than the previous operating system, but I felt there were a few drawbacks. Starting with the bloatware on the phone. If I am spending Rs 30,000 on a device, I expect it to be clean. But Poco F6 comes with a bunch of extra applications pre-installed in it. These can be uninstalled, sure, but I would personally prefer no bloatware in the first place. What makes the experience worse is ads in the user interface. For instance, if you want to play any of these pre-installed games, you will have to go through different advertisements. In fact, every time I wanted to search for an app or content, Poco F6 would throw an ad on my face. Over and above, for one time, the device processor slowed down and could not load the home page for a few seconds. But this happened only for one time and never again. Poco might bite me back saying, one can easily uninstall applications which are not in use. My question is how many should I remove? It entails a number of games including, Bubble shooter, Tiles, Block puzzle, Word trip. It also has other heavier applications, like Snapchat and LinkedIn pre-installed. The bloatware does not only take up a huge amount of storage but it also slows down the processor over time. And it is quite frustrating to look at these many apps when I am not even using them. Poco F6 is priced at Rs 29,999 in India. It may make sense for someone looking for a device with a good battery backup and a beautiful display. The phone is also great for users who want to game on their mobile on a budget. However, the excessive bloatware, heating up and okayish camera, makes the phone harder to recommend.",

        "content": "The European Union (EU) and US have been “too soft” on Serbia and should set a deadline for it to adopt sanctions on Russia, Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti told the Financial Times in an interview. He added that the alignment of Serbia’s foreign policy to that of the EU is of vital importance to ensure a sense of security in Kosovo. “Once Serbia puts sanctions on the Russian Federation, then that would be a moment when they would show that they want to get integrated into EU, and Serbia without Russia cannot threaten the security of the continent. So then, I could trust that they basically want peace. And US and EU would not try to appease them anymore,” said Kurti. He justified the Kosovo police raid on several branches of the Serbian Postal Savings Bank in the north of Kosovo last week, in which Serbian dinars, which have been “outlawed” in Kosovo, were seized. Kurti said the restrictions stemmed from Kosovo’s Constitution, which stipulates only one means of payment. He said two-thirds of Serbs received benefits from Kosovo in euros. The Kosovo prime minister declined to say when Pristina would pull its special police back from the northern municipalities but insisted that “complaints from Serbs about their presence were receding.” Kurti conceded there are “sometimes differences” with his European and US allies “when it comes to strategies, operations and tactics on the ground on one hand, and when it comes to relations with Serbia,” but not on values or principles. He said the West’s “soft” approach was “a consequence of having high hopes that sooner rather than later, Serbia will jump into the western democratic camp. In my view, we have waited for too long to be still hopeful,” Kurti told the FT.",

        "content": "On Tuesday, DuPont (NYSE: DD ) stock received an upgraded rating from Citi, moving from Neutral to Buy, with an increased price target set at $95, up from the previous $85. The upgrade follows a positive investor reaction to recent company announcements, with DuPont shares experiencing an approximate 3% rise in the 1.5 days following the news. Citi's analysis indicates that DuPont's decision to operate its businesses independently could drive value through targeted growth and clearer portfolio structure. Additionally, the firm anticipates benefits from a recovery in the electronics sector and a reduction in destocking in more challenging markets. The main concern among investors has been DuPont's valuation, especially in the Electronics and New DuPont (RemainCo) segments. However, after reassessing DuPont's Sum of the Parts (SOTP) valuation in light of the new business structure, Citi has expressed confidence in the company's prospects. The firm's revised outlook is partially based on strong earnings expectations from the electronics division over the next 18 months. Moreover, Citi suggests that further details on the company's separation plan could act as additional positive catalysts throughout the year. DuPont's stock performance and Citi's upgraded rating reflect a broader sense of optimism regarding the company's strategic moves and potential market recovery. The new price target of $95 represents a significant increase and underscores Citi's positive expectations for DuPont's financial future.

        "content": "THIS is the shock moment riot cops raid a Costa del Sol club packed with bikini-clad tourists in a chilling crackdown known as Operation Marbella. The chilling footage shows nearly 20 heavily-armed police storming the Ocean Club Marbella in the Spanish resort of Puerto Banus and ordering revellers out of the pool. British holidaymakers watched on speechless in their swim shorts and bikinis as officers clad in body armour crashed the venue in a broad-daylight raid. Tourists packing out the \"beautiful people\" venue, which over the weekend held one of its two annual champagne parties popular with Bank Holiday visitors from the UK , were urged to keep calm. Police issued loudspeaker messages in Spanish and English saying: “This is just a routine check. The minute we finish you can continue enjoying your afternoon. “Don’t worry, there’s nothing serious going on.” But the images of the operation, which lasted nearly two hours and also involved a police helicopter hovering overhead, showed why some revellers were left uneasy over the ordeal. One clubber is understood to have been arrested, although police have not yet commented officially on the reason for the detention. The spectacular club raid followed a string of shootings in the area, sparking the launch of the so-called Marbella Plan last month to keep British and Irish tourists safe. Police warned locals and visitors at the time they could expect to see more random stops and police checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They said nothing about surprise raids on busy tourist-popular venues, although earlier this month heavily-armed officers crashed a gym at a sports club in the residential area of Nueva Andalucia near Puerto Banus and made three arrests. Gym-users were asked for their ID before being allowed to continue with their routines. The series of shootings so far this year in the Marbella area included a March 11 attack on British-run eatery La Sala near Puerto Banus. The shooting led to the arrests in April of a British man and Irish national described by police as having links to organised crime. Kerry Katona recently claimed she had U-turned on a decision to move to the famous Costa del Sol resort with her family, including fiancé Ryan Mahoney, because of the violent incidents there. Fernando Bentabol, the prosecutor in charge of combating narco crime in the province of Malaga, which Marbella is part of, shone the spotlight on its dark underbelly in a recent newspaper interview. Asked by a local Spanish journalist if the Costa del Sol was turning into Medellin, Colombia’s second largest city previously the most violent in the world and the former home of notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar , he said: “Yes and no. \"It can’t be compared to Medellin because countries such as Colombia are the ones that produce drugs, and most of the actions there are related to plantations, as happens in Morocco for example with cannabis. “We are in the area where the drugs are introduced and distributed to Europe. “But in terms of the level of the organisations involved and their economic capacity, yes it can of course be compared.” Locals have branded parts of Marbella like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\". One suggested recently tourists should start thinking about putting on a bullet-proof vest with their swim shorts and sandals. Another wrote on social media, expressing her fears an innocent person could be killed: “A stray bullet could end up entering a house.” In the early hours of Saturday morning, a 33-year-old man was shot on a residential estate a short drive from Puerto Banus, just across the Marbella muncipal border in the neighbouring municipality of Estepona. No arrests have yet been made. Around ten shell casings thought to have been fired from an AK-47 were reportedly found on the ground at the scene. British man Marcus Stewart mowed down several pedestrians in May 2017 after speeding away from the Ocean Club in an Audi following a fight between two groups of men from the UK. He was arrested by an armed cop on the beach after a police chase following a spectacular head-on crash on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile with a car carrying an 18 day-old baby. He was later jailed for more than five years. By Tom Malley SPANISH police have launched \"Operation Marbella\" to crackdown on violence and keep Brits safe after a spate of recent gang shootings. The Costa del Sol resort is fast becoming a hotspot for crime and cops have warned locals and visitors they can expect to see more random stops and officer checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They are understood to be increasing vigilance in residential areas as well as shopping centres and nightspots, like the millionaire’s playground of Puerto Banus. It comes after two terrifying shootings in March, within the space of a week. As police crackdown on crime they are recruiting the help of sniffer dogs and “aerial resources” - including helicopters and drones. The start of the operation, which will continue through the summer season into October, comes after locals started branding areas like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\" following four shooting incidents in just over a month. No charges were brought against a second Brit held in the drama, a passenger in the car. The Ocean Club describes itself on its website as the “original classic beach club in Marbella and a reference for style, modern luxury and an atmosphere that has made it famous as one of Europe’s chic favourites for relaxing, partying and enjoying the best that summer has to offer.” It adds: “Daytimes are easygoing, with a quality restaurant, while our themed parties are famous for being as glamorous as they are exciting and lively. \"Live music, dancers, entertainers and beautiful people make it an experience to remember.” It held its opening party this year on May 3 and its second champagne party on Sunday, a day after the weekend police raid. High-season bed packages round its saltwater pool cost up to €1,150 (£980). The most expensive packages include three bottles of Veuve Clicquot, a luxury champagne from France . Revellers who book the most expensive VIP beds are warned online there is an additional €1120 (£955) minimum spend on Saturdays. A WAVE of anti-tourist measures are being implemented across Europe to curb mass tourism in popular holiday hotspots. Overcrowding has become the main problem in many sunny destinations, with authorities trying to find a solution to keep tourists and locals happy. Officials have attempted to reduce the impact of holidaymakers by implementing additional taxes on tourists, or banning new hotels. Earlier this year Venice became the first city in the world to charge an entry fee for holidaymakers after it started charging day-trippers €5 (£4.30) if visiting the historical Italian centre. It was followed by an area in Barcelona which resorted to removing a well-used bus route from Apple and Google Maps to stop crowds of tourists from using the bus. Meanwhile, San Sebastián in the north of Spain, limited the maximum number of people on guided visits to 25 to avoid congestion, noise, nuisance and overcrowding. The city has already banned the construction of new hotels. The Spanish government has allowed restaurants to charge customers more for sitting in the shade in Andalucia. Benidorm has introduced time restrictions, as swimming in the sea between midnight and 7am could cost a whopping £1,000. The Canary Islands are also considering adopting measures to regulate the number of visitors - and charge tourists a daily tax. Greece has already enforced a tourist tax during the high season (from March to October) with visitors expected to pay from €1 (£0.86) to €4 (£3.45) per night, depending on the booked accommodation. Officials in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia want to introduce a fee for travellers to remind people to be courteous during their trips.",

One suggested recently tourists should start thinking about putting on a bullet-proof vest with their swim shorts and sandals. Another wrote on social media , expressing her fears an innocent person could be killed: “A stray bullet could end up entering a house.” In the early hours of Saturday morning, a 33-year-old man was shot on a residential estate a short drive from Puerto Banus, just across the Marbella muncipal border in the neighbouring municipality of Estepona. No arrests have yet been made. Around ten shell casings thought to have been fired from an AK-47 were reportedly found on the ground at the scene. British man Marcus Stewart mowed down several pedestrians in May 2017 after speeding away from the Ocean Club in an Audi following a fight between two groups of men from the UK. He was arrested by an armed cop on the beach after a police chase following a spectacular head-on crash on Marbella’s famous Golden Mile with a car carrying an 18 day-old baby. He was later jailed for more than five years. By Tom Malley SPANISH police have launched \"Operation Marbella\" to crackdown on violence and keep Brits safe after a spate of recent gang shootings. The Costa del Sol resort is fast becoming a hotspot for crime and cops have warned locals and visitors they can expect to see more random stops and officer checkpoints in and around the holiday destination. They are understood to be increasing vigilance in residential areas as well as shopping centres and nightspots, like the millionaire’s playground of Puerto Banus. It comes after two terrifying shootings in March, within the space of a week. As police crackdown on crime they are recruiting the help of sniffer dogs and “aerial resources” - including helicopters and drones. The start of the operation, which will continue through the summer season into October, comes after locals started branding areas like Puerto Banus the \"Wild West\" following four shooting incidents in just over a month. No charges were brought against a second Brit held in the drama, a passenger in the car. The Ocean Club describes itself on its website as the “original classic beach club in Marbella and a reference for style, modern luxury and an atmosphere that has made it famous as one of Europe’s chic favourites for relaxing, partying and enjoying the best that summer has to offer.” It adds: “Daytimes are easygoing, with a quality restaurant, while our themed parties are famous for being as glamorous as they are exciting and lively. \"Live music, dancers, entertainers and beautiful people make it an experience to remember.” It held its opening party this year on May 3 and its second champagne party on Sunday, a day after the weekend police raid. High-season bed packages round its saltwater pool cost up to €1,150 (£980). The most expensive packages include three bottles of Veuve Clicquot, a luxury champagne from France . Revellers who book the most expensive VIP beds are warned online there is an additional €1120 (£955) minimum spend on Saturdays. A WAVE of anti-tourist measures are being implemented across Europe to curb mass tourism in popular holiday hotspots. Overcrowding has become the main problem in many sunny destinations, with authorities trying to find a solution to keep tourists and locals happy. Officials have attempted to reduce the impact of holidaymakers by implementing additional taxes on tourists , or banning new hotels . Earlier this year Venice became the first city in the world to charge an entry fee for holidaymakers after it started charging day-trippers €5 (£4.30) if visiting the historical Italian centre. It was followed by an area in Barcelona which resorted to removing a well-used bus route from Apple and Google Maps to stop crowds of tourists from using the bus. Meanwhile, San Sebastián in the north of Spain, limited the maximum number of people on guided visits to 25 to avoid congestion, noise, nuisance and overcrowding. The city has already banned the construction of new hotels. The Spanish government has allowed restaurants to charge customers more for sitting in the shade in Andalucia. Benidorm has introduced time restrictions, as swimming in the sea between midnight and 7am could cost a whopping £1,000. The Canary Islands are also considering adopting measures to regulate the number of visitors - and charge tourists a daily tax. Greece has already enforced a tourist tax during the high season (from March to October) with visitors expected to pay from €1 (£0.86) to €4 (£3.45) per night, depending on the booked accommodation. Officials in Santiago de Compostela in Galicia want to introduce a fee for travellers to remind people to be courteous during their trips.",

        "description": "The father of NRL star Payne Haas is accused of being at the “centre” of a failed drug smuggling attempt in Indonesia.",
        "content": "Indonesian investigators expect to extradite Gregor Haas from the Philippines “very, very soon” for his alleged role in the attempted importation of enough drugs to qualify a convicted person for the death penalty. Haas, an Australian citizen and the father of NRL star Payne Haas , has been in detention in the Philippines since his arrest this month in a dramatic sting involving local and Indonesian police, who had been hunting him for months. Gregor Johann Haas poses for a mugshot following his arrest in Cebu province. Credit: AP The latter are desperate for him to face justice and questioning in Indonesia. Australia, though mostly silent on this case, is against any outcome that opens the possibility of execution. The Indonesians accuse Haas of links to the notorious Sinaloa Cartel of Mexico and of attempting to import more than five kilograms of methamphetamines, hidden in consignments of ceramic flooring, through Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in December. The drugs were allegedly sent from the Mexican City of Guadalajara. Indonesian narcotics agency spokesman Sulistyo Pudjo Hartono accused Haas of being at the “centre” of the operation and “above” six other suspects, all of them Indonesian. Brisbane Broncos player Payne Haas (left) and Gregor Haas at the 2019 Dally M Awards at the Hordern Pavilion in Sydney. Credit: AAP Sulistyo said Haas, 46, had been living on a small island off Lombok on a temporary stay permit as an investor and businessman. The Australian was believed to have entered the Philippines on December 6, several days after Sulistyo said Indonesia received intelligence about the alleged shipment. He would not speculate on whether Haas had received a tip-off. Where the Australian gets sent next, and under what circumstances, is a matter for the Philippines, which is now under the more Western-friendly leadership of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. While authorities there do not have to consult Australia, they have promised to do so anyway in a show of goodwill between the two countries. Asked if Haas could be deported to Australia, Sulistyo declared emphatically, “No!” “If an Indonesian citizen commits a crime, killing an Australian citizen in Sydney or Melbourne, he will be prosecuted over there, he will be indicted over there, he will be questioned over there and will be imprisoned over there. It is all similar everywhere,” he said. A decision by the Philippines Bureau of Immigration may be weeks away, or possibly longer. Complicating the matter of extradition, and potentially putting international loyalties to the test, is the case of Philippine citizen Mary Jane Veloso, who has been on death row in Indonesia for a more than a decade on a contested drug conviction. Marcos Jr is under intense pressure to bring her home, and Haas could be used by both Indonesia and the Philippines as a bargaining chip. The Australian Federal Police has said it had no role in tracking or arresting Haas. Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's opposition-controlled legislature passed changes on Tuesday that are seen as favoring China and diminishing the power of the island's president.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Thousands of people gathered outside Taiwan's legislature on Tuesday to oppose changes being pushed through by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies that would give the body greater power. The Nationalists, also known as the KMT, took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan's de facto independence from China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. The proposed legislative changes would give them more power to control budgets, including defense spending that the KMT has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. Taiwan's legislative chamber was festooned with banners promoting both sides in the dispute, while arguments on the floor broke out into shouting and pushing matches.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: While dismissing the rumours of becoming the next head coach of the Indian men's cricket team, former Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh empathizes with Hardik Pandya as he navigates a challenging phase in his career. Despite Pandya's struggles in the IPL , both as a captain and player for Mumbai Indians, Harbhajan believes that he will perform differently when representing India in the upcoming T20 World Cup . He hopes that Pandya, who \"hasn't been a free man in the last two months,\" will find his form during the tournament, as a strong performance from him could significantly boost India's chances of success. \"When he wears that blue jersey, he will be a different Hardik Pandya because we know he can score those runs and take those wickets. I want Hardik to come good as he has gone through a lot and I wish him all the very best to have a very good tournament for India,\" said Harbhajan. \"If he has a good tournament, obviously India will have a great chance to go forward. Yes, his form is a bit of a concern...and lot of other stuff was going on around him, his shifting from Gujarat to Mumbai, was a big change and the team (MI) didn't react too well to Hardik coming back and that too as captain,\" the 43-year-old added. He urges the team management to ensure that Pandya and Rohit are on the \"same page\" and that the entire team plays together as a cohesive unit. \"It looked like they (MI) were not playing together as a team. So there was a lot going on. Hardik wasn't a free man in the last two months. I believe both of them and many others who have played in different teams will have to come together to do something special for the nation,\" he said. Regarding India's pace attack, Harbhajan believes that Jasprit Bumrah is the only bowler who can consistently perform well regardless of the conditions. He feels that Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj may need assistance from the pitch to be effective. Harbhajan hopes that the other bowlers will step up and take responsibility alongside Bumrah. \"Pace attack definitely could be a concern because because Bumrah is in a different league for the kind of bowler he is. He will win you games on any kind of pitch. He doesn't need conditions whereas other bowlers like Arshdeep and Siraj would need help from conditions. If there's bounce, Siraj might do well. He is tall, can also swing it both ways, hits the deck hard and has got pace. But if wickets are slow then the challenge begins for other bowlers,\" said Harbhajan. Impressed by Virat Kohli 's improved strike rate and the addition of new shots to his repertoire during the IPL, Harbhajan emphasizes the importance of Kohli and Rohit Sharma scoring quickly in the Powerplay while also respecting the conditions in the USA and West Indies. \"Virat has shown a lot of improvement from last year to this year and people spoke about his strike rate. It was in 130s during last year and this time it is in 160s,\" he said. Regarding the speculation surrounding Gautam Gambhir as a potential candidate for India's head coach position, Harbhajan believes that the most crucial task for any coach is to bring the team together and ensure they play as a cohesive unit. \"I don't think I will be able to give that much time. At this stage of my life I have a young family and I need to be around them and look after them. Yes, when the right time comes, I will put my foot forward and say I am ready for it,\" he concluded.",

        "content": "Tuesday, May 28, 2024 A joint initiative by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Qatar Tourism aims to simplify licensing procedures and stimulate the tourism sector. In a bid to boost the nation’s hospitality and tourism sectors, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and Qatar Tourism have launched an initiative to streamline licensing procedures for tourism establishments and businesses. The initiative includes elements like seasonal discounts, festival-specific discounts, promotional offers, and special deals, all designed to stimulate the tourism sector. The key focus is on simplifying and speeding up ‘Qualitative Licensing Services’ making it easier to overcome challenges faced when applying for promotional and price reduction licenses, as well as procedures for festival, event and exhibition licensing. Hassan Sultan Al-Ghanim, Assistant Undersecretary for Consumer Affairs at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, said: “This was introduced to facilitate the procedures for obtaining specific licenses for tourism and hospitality establishments, where obtaining the license would take one business day, with the prerequisite that all terms and conditions are met and the required documents submitted, this would have a direct positive impact on the entire sector’s value chain. Qatar tourism sector has been identified as one of the key sectors in the country’s economy, which contributes to attracting investments and increasing the revenues. “This initiative comes within the framework of the efforts of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to develop the business environment and facilitate business ventures in the country, and to establish an encouraging investment environment for entrepreneurs and investors. It is important to shed light on the Ministry’s keenness to consolidate collaborations with various relevant government entities with the aim to facilitate and streamline procedures for granting the necessary approvals and licenses to establish a business.” An integral part of the initiative is the issuance of a single-fee annual license that includes all offers and discounts provided by hotels, as announced through their marketing plans. The application process for the ‘single- license’ will be overseen by Visit Qatar, the main branch of Qatar Tourism, thus ensuring streamlined procedures and enhanced inter-sector cooperation. Omar Al Jaber, Acting Chief of the Tourism Development Sector at Qatar Tourism, said: “The new licensing initiative by Qatar Tourism and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry aims to enhance tourism offerings across relevant businesses and provide necessary protection for the activities of these establishments. Thus, providing the sector the flexibility to intensify its efforts by launching promotional campaigns that revive their work as well as provide tourists opportunities to enjoy attractive offerings, enhancing visitors’ experience. This initiative reflects Qatar Tourism’s commitment to develop and expand the reach of the tourism sector in the country, by including more tourism and hospitality businesses and focus on being comprehensive with its licensing protocol and elevating the efficacy and transparency of key services.”",

        "content": "TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Taiwan’s opposition-controlled legislature passed changes on Tuesday that are seen as favoring China and diminishing the power of the island’s president. The changes pushed by the opposition Nationalist Party and its allies give the body greater power to control budgets, including defense spending that the party has blocked in what many see as a concession to China. The Nationalists officially back unification with China, from which Taiwan separated during a civil war in 1949. They took control of the legislature with a single-seat majority after elections in January, while the presidency went to Lai Ching-te of the Democratic Progressive Party, which favors Taiwan’s de facto independence from China. Thousands of people gathered outside the legislature to protest the changes. The legislative chamber was festooned with banners promoting both sides in the dispute, while arguments on the floor broke into shouting and pushing matches.",

        "description": "Playing Destiny 2. Not played it in a few years, and I've never really been able to follow the story that well, possibly cos I never pay that much attention to it anyway. It is pretty cool though when I've read up about it. The gameplay still feels as good as ever, especially the shooting which is probably one of my favourites in a FPS.I'm playing solo which has mostly been fine. I did bump up difficulty to Legendary, as I found I was destroying everything. That made the horde sections too difficult for me, as you get dumped back to the start of the section when you die. So back on to Classic, seeing as you can't change the difficulty mid mission.",
        "content": "After a few weekends of not playing anything, I got the itch to just play something, so I went back to the FF7 remake. I won't say it \"clicked\" for me this time necessarily, I still think the combat is wildly overrated and the pacing of this game has been so far pretty horrible, but after a couple of really boring early chapters, Chapter 4 and 5 were significantly more interesting to me than basically anything that came before it outside of the opener. And I quite literally have nothing else to play right now, so I may as well see this to the end. Also I don't care if it is all a trick, Jessie you are welcome to ruin my life. Hopped back on Tekken 8 because I have a local tournament coming up this week. Starting again after a break was rough but after a couple days I think I can hold my own again. Also, finally started Hi-Fi Rush and it's been delightful. Dave The Diver and Animal Well are queued up next. Still playing FF7 Rebirth (102 hours, now in Chapter 12) and a little bit of Fallout 76 here and there. I’m having a lot of fun with Stellar Blade! For a game that actually has a lot of little issues that do add up, it’s getting enough right to keep me fully engaged, though I am surprised just how much it really does take from NieR. I was looking for something breezy and this is fitting the bill wonderfully. @Jimmer-jammer Did you play Fallen Order? If so, how does it compare to Stellar Blade? @Black_Swordsman Structurally, I’d say Fallen Order is actually a pretty fair comparison, though Stellar Blade is a fair bit more clumsy in it’s execution and its writing and characters just aren’t on the same level. Beyond that, little things like unpausable/unskippable cutscenes and a protagonist who tends to control like a dump truck at the most inopportune times chip away from what could be a smoother experience. Overall, it fits well within PlayStation’s portfolio of graphically sexy, straightforward and polished comfort food. @Jimmer-jammer I'm glad to hear it's not all bad, then. I loved Fallen Order but from what you say overall I think I will still give Stellar Blade a pass. Eyeing up RotR for when I end my gaming break, so I'll tag you when I have gotten round to the part of the game where you're past the early hours and the real experience begins! Got a specific build in mind, but not Berserk-related this time. 😉 I love the fact that there are preset character creation codes in the game. I'll give you a clue as to my build. \"Got the coin for it?\" 😃 @Black_Swordsman You actually get to make two characters, so you can probably role play that even farther than you might think 😊 I'm making my way through Sand Land and finding it pretty enjoyable. Definitely my type of game. Also still playing and loving Sea of Thieves. I'm playing Rise of the Ronin currently. So far it seems like Ghost of Tsushima with better combat which is a good thing because I loved that game. I'll probably make a start on WRC 10 tomorrow also. WRC 9 was great so I'm expecting more of the same. @xeofate I just started this as well (RotR) I went for a Geralt of Rivia build as I was saying to Jimmer-jammer above. Only played a bit so far, loving the combat which is excellent as you say. I remapped the controls to make them match the control scheme for the Souls games. 😃 Did you go for a specific type of character for your primary Blade Twin? @Black_Swordsman That's not a bad idea remapping the controls actually, might do that myself. I went with the Dex build of Breaker like I always do in souls games. For the main protagonist I kind of made him like an old greying Jin from Ghost of Tsushima. As for the other Blade Twin I made her like my pawn in Dragon's Dogma 2 which was named after my old German Shepherd dog Rusty I've been in a bit of a gaming slump since beating Dragon's Dogma 2 but I think this game is going to change that, liking it so far. xeofate wrote: I'm playing Rise of the Ronin currently. . Black_Swordsman wrote: @xeofate I just started this as well (RotR) I am many hours into RotR and have enjoyed my journey so far i think its a better game than GoT but that's just my opinion. Decided to give XDefiant a try. I've been looking for a game that I can play when I have a spare 15 minutes and this looks like it'll be perfect for that. I've put in a few hours on Deliver Us Mars. The story seems compelling enough, the graphics and score are fantastic and the exploration puzzle gameplay is pretty much what I'd expected from playing the first game. The only thing that's getting to me is the jankiness of the character animations, it's like half way between cartoon and realism and keeps throwing me out of full immersion. The spacey sci-fi geek in me is enjoying it so far though. Just started RotR properly. Looks promising so far. Loving the combat. Edit: Just beat the Prologue and first boss. Proper action rpg game so far. Edit 2: Haha, didn't realise the second boss that you're meant to defeat was actually the final boss battle of the prologue, completed and got the appropriate trophy this morning🤣 . @Jimmer-jammer Now let loose in the world! @xeofate Idk how it is for you but, also, RotR strongly reminds me of TW3 so far for some reason. I think it's related to the quest & leveling-up system. I’m currently playing Dragon’s Dogma 2 . I’ve been playing for 40 hours, and I’m level 32 and have barely touched the main quest. I love this game. Playing Destiny 2. Not played it in a few years, and I've never really been able to follow the story that well, possibly cos I never pay that much attention to it anyway.

        "content": "LONG-TIME Derby favourite City Of Troy looks set to be replaced at the head of the market - as the wounded superstar loses supporters everywhere and drifts alarmingly in the market. City Of Troy suffered a disastrous 2000 Guineas after being sent off the red-hot 4-6 fav on the back of glowing reports from trainer Aidan O'Brien and a sensational two-year-old campaign. The Ballydoyle handler has since admitted he treated the colt 'like too much of a God' in the run-up as he crashed out at Newmarket. With doubts building over just how much these Justify colts train on at three and the horse's confidence no doubt shattered by his no show, punters are looking elsewhere in the Derby market. And Coral are predicting City Of Troy, who has spent months at the head of the market, will be replaced if money keeps coming in for two key rivals. One of them is Aidan O'Brien's Los Angeles, who's unbeaten in three, was a Group 1 winner last season and looks tailor made for the 1m4f Derby trip. Described by his trainer as 'lazy', Los Angeles was last seen holding off Euphoric to win a Group 3 over 1m2f at Leopardstown earlier this month. The other is Charlie Appleby's Dante runner-up Ancient Wisdom. Last year's Futurity winner was pumped six lengths by Economics at York but William Haggas will not run his stable star at Epsom. Ancient Wisdom might have been the second string of Godolphin had Hidden Law not suffered a fatal injury seconds after winning the Chester Vase . But he deserves his place near the top of the betting and is now into as short as 4-1. Los Angeles has been cut into 7-2 with City Of Troy drifting alarmingly out to 11-4. Bookies Coral joked City Of Troy is 'under siege' as Derby favourite - but there's no denying he could find himself completely friendless before Saturday's race. Coral's David Stevens said: \"City Of Troy was as short as 7-4 for the Derby last week, but in recent days Ancient Wisdom, who was 11-1, and Los Angeles, 6-1 at the weekend, have been the pair attracting the most support. \"The money has come to such a point where either could now end up replacing City Of Troy as big race favourite come Saturday.\" Betfred Derby odds via Coral 11-4 City Of Troy 4-1 Los Angeles 5-1 Ambiente Friendly, Ancient Wisdom 11-1 Dancing Gemini 12-1 Macduff 16-1 Bellum Justum 20-1 Voyage, 25-1 Deira Mile 33-1 Bar A responsible gambler is someone who: Find our detailed guide on responsible gambling practices here .",

        "description": "Generations of families have warm memories of Melton Mowbray’s Trevonne Dance School, which is celebrating its 50th birthday this week.",
        "content": "Many former students were in the audience at the weekend for a celebratory showcase of the family-run organisation at Melton Theatre. Just 10 youngsters took part in the school’s inaugural sessions at what is now John Ferneley College back in the 1970s. Advertisement Advertisement Sign up to our daily newsletter Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Melton Times, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Half-a-century later, 300 students, aged from toddlers to women in their 60s, strut their stuff at the modern studios based at North Street in the town. Hayley Sessions runs Trevonne after taking over in the late 1990s from her mum, the school’s founder, Yvonne Makins. On clocking up 50 years, Hayley told the Melton Times: “It’s amazing. There were students my mum used to teach before my time and their children were part of my cohort of dancers and they now bring their own children to sessions. It is fabulous to see that they all bring their children back.” Trevonne started out using The Drill Hall in Melton and they also staged lessons at Venture House and Melton College at various times. Advertisement Advertisement The school moved to North Street three years ago - they have three senior teachers, five assistant teachers and some volunteer teachers giving lessons in their three studios. “It’s so nice having our own studios because when you are working towards exams or shows and you have the older girls who want to put in more hours they can stay on later,” said Hayley. “We’ve had to stop dancing in the past when the caretaker’s rattling his keys somewhere we’ve hired.” The school regularly sends dancers to perform at events in London, at iconic venues like the Royal Albert Hall and Sadler’s Wells. Advertisement Advertisement Many students also train with Trevonne and go off to do performances in Leicester or Nottingham. They also put on productions in their own studios after hiring equipment in and they use Melton Theatre about three times a year for shows. Some students go on to study performing arts at Brooksby Melton College or at colleges in Leicester and Nottingham. Being part of Trevonne has been important for the development of children who attend sessions. Advertisement Advertisement Hayley, whose speciality is teaching modern and tap although she is trained in all genres, said: “It is great for building friendships, discipline, confidence. “It’s great to put their school books away and come and enjoy dancing. For some it becomes a way of life, it is something they are good at.” Reflecting on the achievements of Trevonne, she added: “It is incredible. It doesn’t seem possible at all that it’s been going so long and all the young lives that we’ve touched. It’s a huge achievement that we are still here and going strong. “Two of my daughters are teachers and one is a dancer as well. Advertisement Advertisement “They just enjoy it and hopefully one day I can pass it on to them.” Any family interested in dancing with Trevonne can email [email protected] or call 07946 009401.

Read on for actionable insights on leveraging customer intelligence and staying ahead in this rapidly developing area. You’d be hard pressed to find two more overused buzzwords than artificial intelligence (AI) and omnichannel. But when retailers put these two ubiquitous topics together? That’s when the magic starts to happen. There are exciting times ahead as AI finally makes omnichannel retail a reality. The promise of omnichannel retail The concept of omnichannel retail experiences is nothing new. Retailers have long sought to provide shoppers with seamless, fully connected interactions regardless of the channel via which they choose to browse or buy. So far, however, few execute this really well. Instead of the omnichannel dream, most retailers are stuck in a multichannel model where they market and sell via disconnected online and offline touchpoints. They rely on campaigns being designed to deliver consistent messaging, but their interactions are disjointed and don’t take into account how the individual shopper is navigating the retail experience. AI-enabled experiences in an evolving space AI is set to change all this. It allows retailers to get smarter about how they engage with people – understanding where shoppers are on the purchase journey, predicting what they need, and tailoring the experience accordingly. AI also overcomes resource limitations, enabling the execution of thousands of creative variations for truly one-to-one interactions. But all this is only possible when AI has a strong foundation of data and identity – in other words when it is fueled by customer intelligence. Customer intelligence is fully connected data that delivers a single customer view. It allows retailers to understand the people they are interacting with, and to apply that understanding in a meaningful way. Most retailers recognize the need to use data to fix disjointed experiences. Customer expectations continue to rise, and personalization is required to build trust. What’s more, the retail landscape is constantly evolving. The convergence of commerce and marketing in areas such as social commerce and shoppable ads is one example. Another is the reinvention of how shopping feels in the physical space, with retailers bringing digital elements to in-store shopping to create ‘phygital’ experience (think virtual assistants advising on in-store purchases). Both of these trends require deep, data-driven customer understanding. Moving ahead with customer intelligence Despite understanding the need for customer intelligence, few retailers really know how to use it. So, what can they do to reach the point where they can fuel AI and make omnichannel a reality? The steps retailers should take depend where they are on the path to customer intelligence maturity. Our research reveals that while 90% of brands have started the journey, only 4% are already able to use customer intelligence to gain a competitive advantage. The vast majority only have pockets of insight and are using data solely for rear-view measurement. There’s a long way to go to achieve real-time, predictive, innovation-focused customer intelligence, with use cases fully aligned to business value. Here are four actions retailers can take today to move forward with customer intelligence and support AI-enabled omnichannel experiences: 1. Ensure there’s a board-level sponsor A board-level champion can get buy-in for customer intelligence and articulate what the organization wants to achieve with it. They can push for greater integration, and ultimately embed insights into boardroom decision making. Perhaps most importantly, they can ensure there is a dedicated budget for customer intelligence and grow it to enable a culture of innovation. 2. Build a comprehensive data set Bringing data together, using an enterprise data management platform and an advanced identity solution, achieves a single, coherent view of shoppers. Then a data audit can reveal any gaps. Retailers should establish the right value exchange for their first-party data, being clear what data will be used for, asking customers for their permission, and then following through. They can then bolster this with high quality second- and third-party data. 3. Increase analytics sophistication Most retailers have a basic toolkit of conventional, reactive analytics. They should look for opportunities to apply advanced, predictive analytics – building on the view of what has happened with a view of what will happen. Based on those future scenarios, they can make decisions across product development, supply chain, and customer service, as well as marketing. 4. Assess infrastructure and support Retailers should ensure their tech stack is up to date and cloud based, allowing collaborative access to customer data across the organization. Ultimately, they should work towards an entirely automated workflow from data gathering and ingestion to analysis and activation. They should also establish a core, multidisciplinary team to drive standardization and maintain quality. There’s potential to work with partners to make the most of in-demand skills and expertise. It’s nothing new, but true omnichannel experiences – that meet shoppers where they are and offer meaningful, personalized interactions – are still the retail dream. Only now AI enables retailers to turn it into reality. With a strong foundation of customer intelligence, the dream is well within reach. Learn more about Acxiom’s retail marketing solutions.",

        "description": "PRIME Minister Rishi Sunak has been ordered to publish secret documents showing the impact of his cut to Universal Credit.",
        "content": "As Chancellor, Sunak scrapped the £20-a-week uplift introduced during the pandemic in March 2020 despite being urged not to do so by the likes of footballer Marcus Rashford. The Government has subsequently refused to publish analysis examining the impact of not extending the support. However, the Information Commissioners' Office (ICO) has now demanded the Treasury disclose the details. The support was worth around £1000 a year and was a temporary measure to help vulnerable families through the coronavirus crisis . READ MORE: SNP will force vote on Palestinian statehood, John Swinney says It came to an end in October 2021 despite warnings it could plunge 800,000 people into poverty . Last summer the Treasury refused to release any analysis of ending the support when requested by The Mirror. They argued it would \"not be in the public interest due to the harm it would cause to policy development and delivering for welfare benefit claimants\". But in a decision notice - sent to the paper just hours before the General Election was called - the ICO ordered the Treasury to publish the information \"within 30 calendar days\". It means the Government has until June 21 to publish the details, just two weeks before the UK hits the polls. In its judgement, the ICO said: \"The commissioner has concluded, that the public interest favours disclosure of the request information. In reaching this view, the Commissioner has given particular weight to the fact that the policy to which the statistics relate is no longer live. \"He has also given weight to the fact that the policy was one which was developed in the unique circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic. There is a strong public interest in knowing as much as possible about what information the government was considering in that unprecedented and challenging period.\" READ MORE: SNP MSP John Mason claims ICC is 'biased against Israel' During the investigation, the Treasury told the ICO it did not conduct \"a formal impact assessment relating to the conclusion of this temporary policy\", but it admitted information was held \"that details our analysis on the impacts of further extensions, which can be used to show the impact of not extending the uplift\". It added: \"The uplift was initially put in place temporarily between April 2020 and March 2021. In March 2021, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced it would be extended for a further 6 months. This policy was always designed as temporary so the information in scope relates to analysis completed prior to the 6-month extension\".",

        "content": "Newcastle United have gone cold on signing Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. The England international is ready to leave the Gunners after losing his first-choice status to David Raya. A move to the Magpies was mooted for Ramsdale, but Newcastle have found his 30m asking price too steep, says the Daily Mail . With FFP concerns looming, Newcastle are now seeking a cheaper alternative. Meanwhile, Ramsdale is also courting interest from Chelsea with the summer market now swinging open.

        "content": "Falling 7-1 behind George Russell in qualifying and blaming that on his team-mate getting Mercedes’ new front wing in Monaco, Jamie Chadwick says Lewis Hamilton is “spinning” the narrative. Arriving in Monaco 6-1 down on Russell in the intra-Mercedes team-mate qualifying battle, Lewis Hamilton put his latest defeat to his team-mate down to Russell running Mercedes’ new front wing in Monte Carlo. Qualifying P7, 0.08s down on Russell who was P5, Hamilton said: “I anticipated it would be difficult to outqualify George because he has the upgraded component, but it’s just great to see that we are bringing upgrades. “ I already know automatically that I’m going to lose two-tenths going into qualifying. That’s definitely frustrating.” Going on to declare he does “not anticipate being ahead of George in qualifying particularly this year”, Hamilton was pressed on the claim with a “we’ll see” reply. But rather than read too much into Hamilton’s comment, Williams development driver Chadwick believes Hamilton is “spinning it” to suit his narrative. “I think he knows what he’s doing,” Chadwick told Channel 4. “He’s spinning it to make it sound like he’s maybe not got the upgrades this weekend which for me, I’m not sure about because a team like Mercedes, they generally always bring upgrades to both cars. “It’s not like they need to split it between the two cars. “So yeah, I think he should take his hat off to George. He’s 7-1 on someone like Lewis Hamilton, which is incredible. “And I think Lewis is probably not happy about that, to be honest. And that’s where that comment has come from.” 👉 F1 2024: Head-to-head qualifying record between team-mates 👉 F1 2024: Head-to-head race statistics between team-mates Hamilton did in fact not have the upgraded front wing in Monaco, one report claiming the drivers tossed a coin to decide who would run it, another by Jenson Button saying the seven-time World Champion opted not to as damaging the wing in qualifying would’ve meant a pit lane start as he would’ve had to revert to an old spec. Chadwick reckons Hamilton best get used to be second on the list when it comes to new Mercedes parts. “He’s on his way out next year,” she added, “George is going to be staying in that seat for what they hope is a long time so they need to keep that seat and keep George happy. “And obviously that might come off the back of maybe Lewis being not so happy but at the same time he’s done an incredible job, he’s smashing him.” Up on Hamilton in qualifying and race stats, Russell is also ahead of his team-mates in the Drivers’ standings with 54 points to 42.

        "description": "Manchester City continue to face accusations of cheating as the Premier League's 115 charges related to alleged financial wrongdoing hang over Pep Guardiola's side",
        "content": "Arsenal sporting director Edu claims that he 'cannot say how he feels' when it comes to the 115 charges of alleged financial wrongdoing facing rivals Manchester City . Premier League chiefs threw the book at City last February, three months before they secured their third of four successive league titles at Arsenal's expense. Edu's club once again finished as runners-up to Pep Guardiola and co this season, angering supporters who continue to accuse City of cheating their way to unparalleled success. The reigning champions vehemently deny any wrongdoing and it's been widely reported that City executives believe they'll be cleared once a hearing takes place - although it's unknown when . In the meantime, Edu is keeping tight-lipped. Pep Guardiola has already identified his replacement when he leaves Man City Man Utd and Arsenal eye wonderkid that team-mates claim is 'best they have seen' \"There are things that unfortunately I cannot say what I feel,\" the ex-Gunners midfielder told Brazilian outlet Estadao when asked about City's charges. \"But all the credit in the world to Pep for the training and work he's been doing since he started his career. \"I even joke with my son that I want to see if he's really good at rugby. It's a joke I make because he's already won everything in football.\" However Guardiola achieves his success won't be a mystery to Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta , who was part of the Catalan's coaching staff before making his return to the Emirates in 2019. Arteta has been working closely with Edu ever since to help reach City's level on the pitch and in the same interview, the Gunners chief explained one of the most crucial aspects of his role - transfers. Your turn! How should Manchester City be punished if they're found guilty? Let us know in the comments section Edu kept it brief when asked about Manchester City's 115 charges ( Image: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) \"You can't sign for the sake of signing,\" Edu stated. \"This has to be a process that takes weeks and weeks. On my table, I have reports with over 180 pages of a player. It is really detailed. Physical, technical, mental profile - if you have experience of Premier League, if you will be able to adapt. It has it all. \"We analyse our shortcomings, where we can improve, where we can invest and from there we go in search of this new name. What I am going to do now, we have been discussing since January. It is not my decision or Mikel. It's from a whole group.\" The aim for Arsenal is to go one better next season and lift their first Premier League title in what'll be 22 years.

        "description": "The company, one of China’s largest private-sector conglomerates, aims to cut its debts by 10 billion yuan (US$1.38 billion) annually in the next two to three years.",
        "content": "Shanghai-based Fosun, controlled by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang, announced on Tuesday that the proceeds of the sale will be used to replenish general working capital. The divestment aims at streamlining Fosun’s portfolio and “enhancing [our] asset-light operation strategy”, the company said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. “It also demonstrates the company’s continuous efforts to create maximum value for its shareholders.” Fosun, which is involved in a wide range of industries including tourism, pharmaceuticals, real estate and financial services, aims to cut its debts by 10 billion yuan (US$1.38 billion) annually in the next two to three years, co-chairman Wang Qunbin said during an earnings briefing on March 28. An asset-light strategy refers to a business model under which a company has only a small amount of fixed assets on its balance sheet. “[Fosun] could dispose of more noncore assets and could even target disposing of its stake in Hainan Mining, which could generate more than enough liquidity for all of its capital market debts,” Andrew Chan, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in a research note on Tuesday. Fosun owns nearly half of Shanghai-listed Hainan Mining, which has a market capitalisation of 14.6 billion yuan. Since April 2023, Fosun has spent more than US$46 million to buy its Hong Kong-listed shares as a way of boosting investor confidence, according to Chan. He added that Fosun is comfortable with its current liquidity buffer, which still has more than US$2 billion in assets that could be disposed of to enhance liquidity. Fosun reduced its interest-bearing debts, such as bank loans and corporate bonds, by 15 billion yuan to 211.9 billion yuan in 2023, according to the company’s annual earnings report. It posted a net profit of 1.38 billion yuan for 2023, turning around from a net loss of 831.8 million yuan a year earlier. Its revenue grew 8.6 per cent to 198.2 billion yuan. Taking over HAL will strengthen ABN Amro’s position as one of the top three wealth-management firms in Germany and increase its assets by €26 billion. “This is a rare opportunity to add scale to our German activities,” ABN Amro CEO Robert Swaak said in a statement. “The proposed acquisition will further strengthen our position and offer employees of the combined group the opportunity to play a driving role in the consolidating German market.”",

Are the websites that post them taking steps to assure they are legit? “No and no,” says Kay Dean of San Jose, Calif., a former criminal investigator in the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Inspector General. Dean’s bad experience with a health care provider with glowing reviews led her on a journey into the expansive realm of fake online reviews. “I no longer put an ounce of trust in any online review site,” she says. She is the founder of Fake Review Watch , which she says is on the side of consumers and honest businesses and attempts to show the issues that major review platforms have with fake reviews.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Personal experience led to her investigation About seven years ago, Dean used stellar reviews she saw on Yelp and Google to select a medical care provider. “The experience turned out to be the exact opposite of what was claimed on the platforms, leaving me suspicious about these reviews I had relied on. And so, drawing on my knowledge as an investigator, I began doing some digging and uncovered this medical practice was trading fake reviews with other businesses in Facebook groups.” She discovered that “the online review world was saturated with so much deception — far more so than people realize.” Frustrated by a lack of official action against this widespread fraud, Dean created YouTube videos with case studies as real examples, which she offers to major news outlets. “That’s been effective, but my larger goal is to highlight the culpability of tech companies and review sites that are not doing enough to protect the public. I try to educate people not to trust online reviews at all, and I attempt to rally public support for more enforcement and new legislation.” Fake reviews are very convincing I asked Dean to share the clues consumers should look for to alert them that they are reading a fake review. “It is extremely difficult for the average consumer to discern which reviews are fake,” Dean notes, “as they can be very detailed and convincing, some written by the business itself. I’ve seen many contractor reviews with photos of work lifted off of a real estate listing in another state and thousands of Yelp reviews with content simply plagiarized from Tripadvisor written by other people, sometimes years earlier. Determining whether (a review is) real or fake often requires analyzing sets of reviewers and businesses together to see if suspicious patterns emerge indicating deception.” Dean points out that even the Better Business Bureau website “has become polluted with review fraud, hosting plenty of fake BBB reviews. I’ve found that a robust black market exists for them, including several marketers in Facebook groups offering to sell BBB reviews. I reached out to one guy from Pakistan. He offered to sell them for $3 each!” Furthermore, she notes, the BBB site lacks transparency. “Just click on a BBB review to find out something about the reviewer. Nothing comes up. There are no photos. No last names are used, nor is there any other way of finding out who or what else the person has reviewed, or if they even exist. So while the BBB says, ‘Trust us,’ you can’t.” An industry of fake reviews Online networks, many based in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, sell fake reviews for the BBB, Yelp, Google, Angi and many more, charging as little as 50 cents per review. They have “programs” for movers, lawyers, doctors, dentists, you name it, and will create fake positive and negative reviews that appear to come from real people in cities all over America. Sites such as Reviews That Stick offer reviews across multiple platforms to boost the reputation of a business. “Much of the fraud, though, is organized on social media sites with impunity,” Dean says, adding, “Facebook does little to stop the marketing of fake reviews. There are scores of groups on its platform that openly facilitate buying and selling them. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , however, web-hosting platforms are not responsible for this kind of illegal activity conducted by third parties.” Houston defamation attorney Paul Sternberg says, “But when the platform itself — such as the BBB — gives an A+ rating when they know or should know from hundreds of complaints the business is misleading its customers, I believe they have opened themselves up to being sued. Even if the platform says, ‘We do not endorse,’ the very fact of awarding that grade — which then is used by the business in its advertising — is an endorsement.” If we can’t trust online reviews, then what? Dean believes that until social media sites like Facebook and review platforms such as Google and Yelp can be held accountable for the rampant review fraud they allow to be foisted on the public, not much will change. This would require congressional action. Until then, she recommends consumers use the old-fashioned method of choosing businesses — by talking to real relatives and friends about who they would recommend.

        "content": "A CAPSULE wardrobe is a term often thrown about in the fashion business, but what is a capsule wardrobe? A capsule wardrobe is a specific selection of go-to staples you can rely on day in and day out, season after season, year after year. A capsule wardrobe is essentially a minimalist collection of clothes, that you can put together in different ways to create a simpler, more sustainable way of dressing - and easier in the mornings too - as you can mix and match those staples with other key pieces or trend items. Typically a capsule collection is a refined collection of some of your most worn pieces, your classic go-to's you can't live without, but are versatile enough to see you through every season, any occasion, year after year. Some of the most popular wardrobe staples we have in our closet - and have done for many decades - include a trusted pair of jeans, smart wide-leg trousers, classic layering items, such as T-shirts and tanks, as well as a timeless leather biker jacket or blazer. In most cases, you can wear every item in your capsule wardrobe as one complete outfit, or use it as a base to style with other garments. Pair your failsafe Levi jeans with a white t-shirt, black heeled boots, and a black leather jacket for the office, after-work drinks, brunch with friends, or your next shopping spree. Alternatively switch the white t-shirt for a more jazzy top for an evening out, either way your capsule wardrobe will be the base for many looks, save you money in the long run and leave you feeling confident and looking great. You can even pair the same jeans with. tank top and sandals for the warmer months, or a city break. The point is it is effortless, versatile and interchangeable. The best part of a capsule wardrobe is it is timeless, so if you don't have select items in your closet already they are well worthy investment pieces to see you through any occasion, season, and style. Generally, a capsule wardrobe is classic colours, and tonal hues, such as black, white, greys, navy, and camel, which can be paired with any outfit, hence why it is so popular to nail. For those who may prefer a colourful wardrobe, you can easily inject colour through other layering items, accessories, or your make-up to elevate a look and make it more personal to your style. And, if you change your style in years to come, the capsule wardrobe is still a fallback you can rely on. If you are looking to declutter your wardrobe, slim down your closet, and start to forge a capsule wardrobe, we have some handy tips to help you curate the essentials. A classic black bag is a staple, it will go with any outfit and is suitable for any occasion, day or night, year after year. You can't go wrong with this Kate Spade Pebbled Leather Tote, which can be styled not just as a shoulder bag but also as a cross-body and handbag. The pebbled black leather is an elegant choice that won't date, making it a great starting point for your capsule wardrobe and suitable for a multitude of events. It's perfect to house your laptop when heading to the office, as well as your valuables for a shopping spree. Knott Pebbled Leather Medium Crossbody tote, £375 Of course, jeans are a classic wardrobe essential, and while you may own a variety of styles; from skinny, to wide-leg, or flares, a straight leg in a classic blue denim wash is our top pick. If we were only to wear one pair of jeans for the rest of our lives it would have to be Levi's 501s, which complement any outfit, can be dressed up or down and are super flattering for all body types. Levis have stood the test of time, and are available in numerous waist and leg lengths to suit every body shape. From summer through to winter a pair of jeans are always a failsafe option. While we are trying to keep our capsule wardrobe to a minimum we recommend stocking up on this style in blue denim, ecru and black. 501s Levis Original Jeans, £100 We love a blazer more than anyone, as they are a versatile statement piece for anyone of any age, and for any occasion. Some may prefer fitted blazers, our personal favourite is an oversized design, as it is flattering, timeless, and much more versatile. You can wear your blazer over jeans and a jumper when heading to the office, over leggings and a hoodie for a quick dash to run errands, over a dress for drinks for a little more coverage, or on its own with knee-high boots, and cinched in with a belt for full-on glam. Blazers are created using various fabrics, such as wool, cotton, and linen, but we recommend a relaxed cotton design to see you all year long - as a wool blazer in summer or a linen blazer in winter isn't quite the most sensible style option. Relaxed Single Breasted Blazer, £69 When it comes to Autumn and Winter, a turtle neck, or roll-neck jumper is a must. They are chic, classy, timeless, formal and flattering as they elongate your arms and neck. They work as the perfect winter warmer, as you can style under a blazer, shacket, another jumper, or leather jacket. M&S has an impressive range of turtle neck designs, which also come in its signature Heatgen technology for extra warmth in the colder seasons. But come the warmer seasons you may switch to a sleeveless tank for layering. Pure Merino Wool Roll Neck Jumper, £35 We love a cosy knit jumper, and this & Other Stories number is a classic. A knit jumper is perfect to layer in winter, wear on its own, under a blazer or parker jacket, with jeans, leggings, a skirt, over a dress, paired with boots, trainers, you name it. But you can also keep it with you in the Spring and Summer seasons too, drape it over your shoulders so it is easy to slip on when the balmy nights turn a little chilly at those upcoming garden parties. This & Other Stories' jumpers are long-lasting, with a slightly boxy fit, so you have room to move or layer underneath. Mock Neck Sweater, £45 We have an entire drawer filled with T-shirts, the majority of which are classic white round-neck styles. Why? Because they go with everything. A round crew neck boxy t-shirt is a lifesaver for everyone and a non-negotiable in your capsule wardrobe. Arket's boxy style is perfect, as the short sleeves are the perfect length, the collar is not too tight or loose around the neck, and best still - the fabric is not see-through, yet not too heavy. Tuck into jeans, a skirt, or shorts, or wear over leggings, you can dress up or down, wear on its own, or layer on top. However you choose to style a white T-shirt, it will always look chic. Crew-Neck T-shirt, £17 If you only buy one pair of boots, make it a pair of classic black boots . One of the classics we return to time after time is a block heel ankle boot with a pointed or square toe because it goes with every outfit. You can pair this footwear must-have with jeans, a skirt and jumper for the office, and a blazer dress for weekend drinks, the possibilities are endless. Dear Frances has plenty of boot designs, but the Cube Boot is part of the Core Collection, which speaks volumes in our opinion. Cube Boot, £595 A cotton shirt sounds super formal but it doesn't have to be styled solely for the office with a suit. It's a must-have for those days you want to look \"done\" and well put together but with minimal effort. Worn with jeans and trainers, it looks classic and is a brilliant base under a chunky round knit jumper and leggings, or with smart trousers. You can even wear the shirt undone over a bralette for an evening out. Extra Fine Cotton shirt, £29.90 A pair of classic white trainers will never go amiss in your wardrobe. Some may prefer the timeless Converse, whether its high or low tops, Veja, the New Balance 550, or Superga's Nappa trainers or Cotu Classic, which are hugely popular with Kate Middleton. What we love is not only are they super fashionable, but they go with everything, and provide a little platform to elevate you. Pair with skirts and floral dresses in the summer, with jeans or trousers in winter and spring, as long as they are crisp and clean you will look super chic. 2740 Platform Nappa, £110 Over the last few years, our major obsession has been with leather trousers, faux or real, is up to you. Currently, we're loving a wide-leg leather pant, a more wearable silhouette than the PU leggings of seasons past. While they may not be the most summer-appropriate trousers, they will see you through every other season and occasion. You can pair your leather trousers with a slogan jumper, trainers and a trench coat for a casual but put-together look, with heeled boots, or a blouse and heels for evening drinks. I have lived in my straight, wide-leg, high-rise leather trousers for years, and continue to get compliments on them because they give a polished look no matter how you style them. Vegan Leather 90s Straight Pant, £82 A midi dress has been our firm favourite style for many years now, as it is practical, moveable and versatile. This design is suited for all ages, and suits various style preferences, as you can opt for midi shirt dresses, midi slip dresses, midi wrap dresses - and so much more. One of our personal favourites is a floral printed midi dress, like Nobody's Child, which is short-sleeved and falls midway down your calves as you can dress it up or down. Pair this number with sandals or trainers in the summer, heels for a wedding or formal occasion, or layer with a chunky knit jumper, tights and boots for the winter months. Wildflower Print Clover Midi Dress, £59 Linen shirts are essential when the warmer weather hits, whether that is in the balmy spring and summer seasons. If you are heading on holiday, or making the switch over from your winter wardrobe to summer, a linen shirt is paramount. You can layer over a t-shirt, tank top and jeans, or a skirt, for the daytime, or wear over a bikini for those pool days. It's lightweight and effortless, and you can even be bold by opting for a block colour such as vibrant green or bubble gum pink. Linen fabric is super gentle on the skin, and breathable, which is why it's a welcome alternative to a cotton poplin. Linen Shirt, £35 For shoppers looking for anything leather, or remotely biker/ rock chic inspired, Allsaints is the place to go. We have lusted after their leather jackets for longer than we can remember, and if you have yet to buy yours, now is the time to do so. We recommend an oversize biker style rather than a fitted leather, as it is more timeless, and goes with everything. Plus, the larger style, means you can wear it more if your body changes over the years. And the worn and weathered look after years of wear just makes it look cool and vintage, a win-win. Billie Oversized Leather Biker Jacket, £399 The LBD - also known as the little black dress - has been the iconic evening look for many years, and it is not going anywhere. A little black dress is classy and timeless, so it's no surprise it cuts our capsule wardrobe. Whether it is cotton, scuba or a satin slip dress, an LBD is a garment you will wear forever more, whether it is for a festival, drinks, or date night. You can pair it with knee-high boots, heeled boots, or stilettos, layer with a blazer or biker jacket over the top, or even opt for a t-shirt or sheer long sleeve underneath for a daytime look. The styling options know no bounds. Marlow Dress, £98 Wide-leg trousers have made a comeback in recent years, and we aren't mad about it. This style is flattering as the high-waisted design, and wide leg feature, means the trousers elongate your legs and skim over them so they appear longer and leaner. They are also a welcome alternative to formal smart trousers in the workplace, and jeans, which can feel a little restricting. Pleated Wide Leg trousers, £40 We love a trench coat in the Spring and Summer months, as well as the transitional periods between seasons. You can style it with a classic white top and jeans for a casual, yet chic, everyday look, or layer over a jumper or knitted roll neck should you wish. Some even wear over a tracksuit with a cap for those off-duty days. Premium Trench Coat, £51.60 (Was £129) A racer vest has become another wardrobe staple in recent years, and a welcome alternative to roll necks and t-shirts we wear all year round. This summer style is perfectly paired with trousers, jeans, shorts, as well as skirts, so you can get creative. What we love is River Island's design is longer length and not cropped, which some may prefer for more coverage. Plus, you can shop an unmissable deal on racer vests at River Island, which is two tops for £18. White Rib Racer Vest Top, £10 We don't feel an outfit is complete without jewellery. Over the years the resurgence of gold jewellery has proved hugely popular, and we are well on board. If you are unsure how to style gold jewellery, we recommend easing your way with a statement gold hoop, whether it is a smaller huggie or chunkier style. For those who love their accessories as much as we do, layer up with stackable rings, bracelets and bangles, as well as chokers and pendants - more is more. Missoma has a vast array of styles to shop across rings, necklaces, bracelets and earrings, so you can shop sets or individual pieces to your heart's content. Medium Chubby Hoop Earrings, £115 Outerwear is essential, and one coat design we see time and time again is a pea coat, tailored coat, and straight coat. It comes under numerous titles but it is a straight coat, with button front fastening, is a long line and is more structured than a trench coat. You can style it with any outfit, as it instantly elevates any look. Fawn Felt Single Breasted Coat, £170 New Balance trainers are the hottest footwear trend now, but what is the best style for you? Best trainers for women, these are our favourite pairs to snap up. A leather jacket has always been one of our wardrobe staples, here's where to shop the outerwear.",

        "description": "Several products by Indian brands MDH and Everest in Singapore and Hong Kong were found to contain traces of harmful ethylene oxide.",
        "content": "Ethylene oxide is a colourless gas used as a pesticide and to make other chemicals. “The issues have been sorted. We have put in place mandatory tests,” BN Jha, director of marketing at the Spices Board of India, the government regulatory and export promotion agency for Indian spices, told This Week in Asia on Monday . He noted that the contaminant was found in a consignment shipped 18 months ago and could have occurred naturally. India plans to conduct mandatory pre-shipment sample testing for six months, after which it will reassess the situation to see if there are persistent concerns. Raj Paroda, a former director general of the Indian Council for Agricultural Research, told This Week in Asia: “We are concerned because it’s a matter of prestige and reputation. The system should be made stronger in terms of traceability and quality.” MDH and Everest, two of India’s most popular spice brands, have said their products are safe for consumption. “We do not use ethylene oxide at any stage of our spice production. Our products adhere to stringent health and safety standards,” MDH said in a statement reported by India’s Mint newspaper on April 28. Following the recalls, Britain’s food watchdog applied extra control measures on all spice imports from India starting this month. Once valued more than gold and silver, India’s spices trade spurred European traders to sail to the country in the 15th century. While India’s spice exports remain significant, the country must overhaul its approach to food safety and public communication to boost consumer confidence, industry experts say Over 400 products from India were flagged by the European Union between 2019 and 2024 for containing contaminants, according to a report by the Indian newspaper Deccan Herald. 03:28 India’s beloved butter chicken dish is at centre of court case probing who invented it Smita Sirohi, a former agriculture adviser to the Indian embassies in Belgium, Luxembourg and the EU, said Indian authorities had tightened preventive measures to remove any residue from ethylene oxide. “I am surprised why similar steps were not taken for other markets since they had taken them earlier for the EU,” Sirohi said, referring to the recent cases in Hong Kong and Singapore. “Certainly it will have a damaging impact,” recalling how EU importers had cautioned about Indian spice consignments in earlier cases. India exports US$4 billion of more than 200 spices and value-added products to some 180 countries annually while the country’s domestic market is the world’s largest at US$10 billion, the Spices Board of India has estimated. The sheer variety of Indian spices makes it hard for traders to trace within the supply chain to the relevant farms, Sirohi said. Farmers typically send their spices to traders for aggregation and shipment in wholesale markets. Large factories would receive supplies from these markets, and contamination can occur potentially at each step of the supply chain, according to Sirohi. Though mandatory testing can show the presence of chemicals exceeding certain legal thresholds, the problem could only be resolved by assessing the stage of initial contamination in the supply chain, Sirohi said. Authorities also need to establish guidelines for chemical use and tighten food safety processes, she added. India’s health ministry has said the country applies one of the world’s strictest standards for capping residual pesticides through rigorous risk assessments. But the cases in Hong Kong, Singapore and Europe show food safety processes and oversight in India need further strengthening, industry players say. Ruchit G Garg, founder and CEO of Harvesting Farmer Network, an agriculture technology platform, said India needed to establish excellent food safety standards. “Our spices [and agricultural products] may or may not have had traces but our track record isn’t very good and our farming practices aren’t very organic,” he said. 02:27 One family, one polling station: remote Himalayan villagers cast votes in Indian general election “India needs to invest heavily in fixing its reputation to produce healthy, chemical-free agricultural products. It has a long reputation of producing chemical-rich food, much beyond the safe limits defined by many countries.” One market analyst said there could be a spillover adverse impact on other Indian products beyond spices. “The fact that these two brands failed [to meet quality norms] does not speak well of them and could have a wider impact on other Indian brands,” said Lloyd Mathias, a Delhi-based angel investor and business strategist. “Indian standards have to be on a global benchmark. One cannot afford to have different standards. There can be absolutely no compromise on safety,” he said.",

        "content": "A Cardiff restaurant and bar in a residential area that applied to stay open until 4.30am during the week is being run as a nightclub according to a licensing official. Members of Cardiff Council's licensing sub-committee refused Delta Lounge's proposals to alter its premises licence at a meeting on Wednesday, May 22. The venue, located in Lower Cathedral Road, is currently allowed to stay open until midnight at the latest. Speaking at the meeting pollution control officer at Shared Regulatory Services (SRS) Emma-Jayne Barratt said the application raised \"serious concerns\" and said noise complaints had already been made about music being played late. She said that on one occasion music from the venue could be heard by someone sat in a vehicle outside the building.

For more Cardiff news sign up to our newsletter here . \"It looks like a fun place... [but] for us it is really in the wrong place,\" said Cllr Wild. \"You only have to go a few hundred metres and you are right into houses in almost every direction. Personally I think those hours are too late. I don't think we should be negotiating past 11pm.\" Delta Lounge applied to open its premises from 9am to 4.30am Thursday to Sunday and 9am to 6.30am on Fridays and Saturdays. A video played at the licensing sub-committee meeting showed a large crowd of people in Delta Lounge at an event which took place from Saturday, February 17, to Sunday, February 18. In the video people were dancing and loud music was audible. There was no sign of any food being served or eaten. David Abuneke, who took on Rockin Chair in December 2023, said he wanted to extend the opening hours to accommodate for a lot of his clientele who worked late hours and came in from 11pm. He also said customers were asked to leave the premises quietly. Mr Abuneke said: \"To run a business like this is hard. I have lost all of my savings trying to get this place up and running. People who go there are not troublemakers... we don't want to have problems with our neighbours.\" PC Jason Jones, representing South Wales Police at the meeting, said he also felt that the premises was being run more as a nightclub than a restaurant. In highlighting concerns about public order, PC Jones pointed committee members' attention to a report of a fight involving \"multiple males\" that police attended at about 2.23am on Friday, January 26. Mr Abuenke said the fight did not take place inside the premises and that the issue occurred after someone was asked to leave, adding that an individual tried to have an argument with a bouncer on the door. Delta Lounge's application also included a proposal to sell alcohol on and off the premises from 9am to 4am from Sunday to Thursday and from 9am to 6am on Friday and Saturday. They were also asking to host entertainment in the form of live and recorded music from 9am to 4am from Sunday to Thursday and between 9am and 6am on Friday and Saturday.",

        "content": "However, according to CaughtOffside sources with knowledge of the situation, the English club and Unai Emery don’t consider him as part of their plans and are already working to let him go – temporarily or permanently – during the summer. Aston Villa to cash in on Phillipe Coutinho At the moment, the big obstacle to a definitive farewell seems to be his contract at Villa Park, which runs until 2026. Coutinho is unwilling to lose money on his £135k per week deal by negotiating an early termination of the agreement. Aston Villa, for their part, have set what they consider a fair price for him of around £6m-£8m. Whilst that paltry figure shows how far his stock has fallen, it has piqued the interest of various clubs around the world. Among those are some teams from Qatar and elsewhere in the Middle East, who could decide to bring him back there in the summer. Vasco da Gama are also very interested in him and have already started to talk with the Brazilian player. At the moment, however, Vasco consider the costs of the possible operation too high, when adding the amount of a transfer to the salary requested by Coutinho. In any event, Aston Villa, to lighten their wage bill, are also willing to consider a loan but continue to hope that a club will take Coutinho on a permanent basis.",

        "description": "This index fund provides exposure to artificial intelligence stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon.",
        "content": "Warren Buffett turned Berkshire Hathaway into one of the largest companies in the world through a litany of shrewd investments. In fact, its stock price has skyrocketed more than 4,300,000% since he took control in 1965. That accomplishment has made Buffett one of the most revered figures in the financial world. Surprisingly, Buffett has never recommended Berkshire stock. Instead, he has regularly advised investors to periodically purchase shares of an index fund that tracks the S&P 500 ( ^GSPC 0.70% ) . That strategy provides diversified exposure to hundreds of American businesses that are collectively \"bound to do well\" over time, according to Buffett. Indeed, history says investors can build an $903,800 portfolio over three decades by simply investing $350 per month in an S&P 500 index fund. Here's how. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides diversified exposure to hundreds of U.S. companies The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ( VOO 0.68% ) measures the performance of 500 U.S. companies, a blend of value stocks and growth stocks from every market sector. The index fund covers about 80% of U.S. equities and nearly 50% of global equities by market capitalization, meaning it spreads money across many of the most influential companies in the world. One tailwind that should send the S&P 500 higher in future years is artificial intelligence (AI). Just as e-commerce, mobile connectivity, and cloud computing drove the index higher in past years, many experts see AI as the next generation-defining investment theme. Indeed, the five largest holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (shown in the chart) are all well positioned to monetize AI in the future. Here's a look at each company. Microsoft ( MSFT 0.74% ) is the largest enterprise software vendor and the second-largest cloud computing provider. The company is monetizing artificial intelligence with generative AI Copilots for its software products, and cloud AI services. Most notably, Microsoft Azure lets developers build generative AI applications with large language models from ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Apple ( AAPL 1.66% ) has cultivated brand authority across several consumer electronics verticals, and it has a particularly strong market presence in smartphones. The company undoubtedly lags its big tech peers in monetizing artificial intelligence, but upcoming versions of iOS will reportedly feature AI-powered search, summaries, photo editing, and other automations. Nvidia ( NVDA 2.57% ) graphics processing units (GPUs) offer unparalleled performance when accelerating data center workloads like artificial intelligence applications. The company holds more than 80% market share in AI chips, and its extensive product ecosystem -- spanning hardware, software, and services -- makes Nvidia a one-stop shop for building entire AI data centers . Alphabet ( GOOG 0.72% ) ( GOOGL 0.83% ) is the market leader in digital advertising and the third-largest cloud computing provider, and it's leaning into artificial intelligence across both product categories with its Gemini model . Specifically, Gemini simplifies ad campaign creation with natural language, supports the development of generative AI applications, and automates work in its office productivity suite Google Workspace. Amazon ( AMZN -0.17% ) enjoys a leadership position in e-commerce, retail advertising, and cloud computing, and the company is using artificial intelligence across all three product categories. Rufus is an AI-powered shopping assistant, Amazon Ads offers generative AI for creating brand images, and Amazon Bedrock is a cloud service for developing generative AI applications. The Vanguard S&P 500 is a cheap, easy way to build wealth The S&P 500 is a proven moneymaker. The index outperformed virtually every other asset class over the last two decades, from international equities and fixed income to real estate and precious metals, and it has been a profitable investment over every 20-year period in history. The S&P 500 returned 1,970% over the last 30 years, compounding at 10.62% annually. At that pace, $350 invested monthly would be worth $74,200 in one decade, $288,100 in two decades, and $903,800 in three decades. Of course, past performance is never a guarantee of future returns, but even a more conservative growth rate of 10% annually would turn $350 invested monthly into $791,000 over three decades. Warren Buffett believes \"American business -- and consequently a basket of stocks -- is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.\" His logic is simple: The U.S. is the largest and arguably the most innovative economy in the world. Indeed, 16 of the 20 largest companies in the world are U.S. companies, and the U.S. stock market is by far the largest. That makes a compelling argument for investing in U.S. stocks, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is essentially a basket of the most successful U.S. companies. Additionally, with an expense ratio of just 0.03%, meaning the annual fees will total $3 for every $10,000 invested, the index fund is a cheap and easy way to build wealth.",

        "content": "Several county athletes were competing at the East of Scotland age group athletics championships at Grangemouth last weekend. The event attracted athletes from as far north as Aberdeen down to Galashiels. Branna Kenny, of Haddington Athletics Club, was first up in the under-13 girls’ 70m hurdles. Branna Kenny (left) took gold in the girls' 70m hurdles in Grangemouth. Image: Simon Wootton She won gold in a very closely contested race by just one-hundredth of a second in a fast time of 12.70s. Archie Brown, a pupil of Law Primary School in North Berwick who competes for Lasswade Athletics Club, was taking part in three events in the under-13 boys. He dominated all his events, winning gold medals in the 100m, 200m and long jump. He ran personal bests of 13.40s and 27.15s respectively, and a long jump personal best of 4.94m. Archie Brown (centre) won three gold medals on an impressive day His sister Freya Brown, a pupil at North Berwick High School who also competes for Lasswade Athletics Club, was competing in the under-15 girls’ 1,500m. In a very competitive final, she sprinted away in the last 200m to win gold, taking 20 seconds off her personal best to finish in 4m38s. Cerys Wright, also of North Berwick High School, was competing in the U15 girls’ 800m. Freya Brown (centre) timed her sprint perfectly to clinch gold in the 1,500m She ran a very brave race from the front, just being pipped for gold by hundredths of a second. She came away with a personal best of 2m16s and the silver medal. A spokesperson for Team East Lothian said: “This was a great start to the track season with national events coming up later in the summer.”",

        "content": "Chelsea are closing in on the appointment of Enzo Maresca – but what style of play can fans expect from the highly rated Italian coach? Having guided Leicester City to the Championship title last season, Maresca appears to have topped Chelsea’s shortlist to replace the outgoing Mauricio Pochettino after Roberto De Zerbi and Kieran McKenna were also considered by the Blues’ hierarchy. Chelsea will need to pay around £10million in compensation but hope to have the Italian appointed by the end of the week. The 44-year-old will inherit a young and bloated Chelsea squad but one that did show promise towards the end of the season as they finished sixth to secure a return to European football. Following his retirement from the professional game in February 2017, which saw him play for the likes of Juventus and Sevilla, Maresca went straight into coaching. He enjoyed a stint as an assistant manager at West Ham under Manuel Pellegrini before being appointed as Manchester City’s Elite Development Squad manager in 2020. ‘Manuel [Pellegrini] was the person who convinced me to try to become a coach when I decided to finish playing,’ Maresca said. ‘So, I always say that in terms of an experience about football, Manuel for me is like a father. ‘If I had some doubt, to be honest he helped me a lot as a player and in the last two years when I worked with him when he was manager at West Ham, and I have a tremendous relationship with him. ‘I was still working like a player with him and one day during a chat with him he said: ‘You know when you finish as a player you should try to become a coach because I think you can be a good coach.’ Maresca enjoyed immediate success in his first season at City, guiding the team to the Premier League 2 title before leaving to join Parma at the end of the season. His time in Serie B was far from successful, though, and the Italian was sacked after just 14 games and he ended up returning to City in the summer of 2022 as one of Guardiola’s assistants. ‘Unfortunately, it didn’t go as I hoped,’ Maresca said of his short stint at Parma. ‘We signed 14 new players, it was a young team with an international environment, I was training in four languages, and it wasn’t so quick to get certain concepts across. ‘The start was difficult and from the outside there was a tendency to always see the glass as half empty. It ended after 13 games and I was very sorry, I still think we were on the right track.’ Last summer, Maresca was appointed as Dean Smith’s replacement at Leicester and guided the Foxes straight back to the top flight after a superb season in the Championship. Despite a disappointing tenure at Parma, Maresca’s impressive spell at Leicester and attractive style of play has caught the eye of many over the last year. The former City assistant helped Leicester pick up 97 points en route to the title, with his side boasting the best defensive record in the league. In addition, Maresca oversaw a total overhaul of the team’s style of play, turning Leicester into a possession-focused team, a philosophy and play style that is said to have appealed to the Chelsea hierarchy. ‘He’s by far the best manager I’ve worked for,’ Leicester City midfielder Harry Winks told Sky Sports in March. ‘He’s incredible. I think everybody will say he’s going right to the top in [terms of] managerial stature. He’s got everything. ‘He’s a great man-manager. He’s tactically incredible, some of the decisions that he tells us to do before the game and how he views the match is something I’ve never experienced before in football. ‘So, yeah, it’s opened my eyes a lot to football in the way it’s played and the kind of Pep Guardiola style as well, I know he worked with for a long time. ‘I’m loving my football, it works perfectly for me. It’s exactly the kind of football that I want to play and buy into. ‘I think since he has come in, I’ve learned so much and continue to do that.’ Maresca values control of the ball and positional play above all else. In the Championship, Leicester were known for their patient and possession-heavy build-up but this did not come at the expense of goalmouth action, with Leicester scoring 89 goals throughout the season – a tally only bettered by Ipswich. Maresca likes to involve his goalkeeper as a key cog in their intricate build-up from the back and also uses inverted full-backs to help with ball retention in central midfield. A deep-lying playmaker – as opposed to a more physical defensive midfielder – is preferred at the base of midfield to help recycle possession, with the other midfielders expected to push forward and make runs in behind the opposition’s defence. With full-backs operating infield, Maresca likes his forwards to stay high and wide in attack, although the central striker often drops deep to aid build-up. When they lose the ball, Maresca wants his side to press quickly and high to try and regain the ball, before dropping back into a 4-4-2, with a central midfielder pushing up alongside the striker to try and win the ball back. ‘When you go out on the pitch you know exactly what to do and how the opposition are going to operate and what you can do to affect that,’ Winks said in an interview with talkSPORT this season. ‘To do it so simply is the most important thing. That’s a thing a lot of managers probably struggle with, getting the message across, but the gaffer does it so well here.’ Maresca favoured a 4-3-3 formation at Leicester, although he has used a 4-2-3-1 as well at points. Robert Sanchez’s ball-playing capabilities could see him return as first-choice goalkeeper, while Levi Colwill and Wesley Fofana’s pace and passing attributes make them a potentially exciting centre-back partnership. Pochettino used Marc Cucurella as an inverted full-back towards the end of last season and the Spaniard could continue there under Maresca. Reece James often played in central midfield for Wigan during his loan spell in 2018/19 and could be deployed in a similar role on the right side. Man Utd star told Erik ten Hag he did not want to play in FA Cup final Former Chelsea player set to return as part of Enzo Maresca's coaching staff Gary Lineker questions if Man Utd star faked injury to get out of FA Cup final Arsenal miss out on Pot 1 for Champions League draw next season Moises Caicedo may be tasked with the playmaking role at the base of midfield, with Enzo Fernandez allowed a greater license to get forward. Cole Palmer may start further back in central midfield under Maresca, but the Italian’s play style should still allow Chelsea’s standout performer this season to flourish in advanced positions. In attack, Christopher Nkunku’s all-round capabilities could afford him a second chance after a wretched injury-affected first campaign at Stamford Bridge, while Noni Madueke and Mykhailo Mudryk’s pace and dribbling abilities make them obvious candidates to start out wide.

        "description": "The first woman to ride the winner of the Melbourne Cup has revealed why she is walking away from a career that made her a household name.",
        "content": "A series of “random” head knocks during track work has convinced Michelle Payne to retire from race riding almost nine years after she rewrote the history books by becoming the first female jockey to win the Melbourne Cup. Payne has informed Racing Victoria that she will not be reapplying for a jockey’s licence beyond this season, which ends on July 31, bringing to a close one of this country’s most inspirational sporting careers. Michelle Payne after winning the 2015 Melbourne Cup on Prince Of Penzance. Credit: Justin McManus Payne, who had her first race ride as a 15-year-old in 2001, said she knew it was time to call it quits after suffering three successive black eyes from training accidents at the end of last year. “I had three horses, one took fright and gave me a really decent whack in the head, another one did the same thing and it gave me a blood nose, and then another one of my young horses bucked me off, but with quite a nasty knock to the head again. So I got three black eyes all in a row,” Payne said. “It was late last year, and it knocked me around a bit and probably shocked me into retirement a bit quicker than I was thinking. But it was on the cards anyway.” While Payne, who has had a joint trainer-jockey licence since 2016, is intending to hang up the saddle for good come August, she has not ruled out farewell rides before the end of the season. “I did a concussion test at Sandown on Saturday, because they were doing testing for jockeys for the new season, just to see if I could ride for the last couple of months of my licence, and I passed, so that was all good,” she said. “It is a new era in my life and I guess a bit emotional, but things come to an end and I have been lucky to survive some pretty horrible injuries.” Payne suffered a number of career-threatening falls across her 23 years in the saddle. In 2004, the then 18-year-old was sent head first into the turf after her horse fell 100 metres past the Sandown winning post and she suffered a fractured skull and bruising on the brain. Jamie Kah (left), Glen Boss, Corey Brown and Michelle Payne launch the Melbourne Cup tour on Tuesday. Credit: Victoria Racing Club In 2016, just six months after her record-breaking Melbourne Cup win on Prince Of Penzance, Payne was trampled on and required pancreatic surgery after she fell from her brother Patrick’s horse during a race in Mildura. At the time, Payne defied calls to retire even though she had achieved her life-long dream of winning the Cup, a feat that inspired a movie, Ride Like A Girl , as well as a new generation of female jockeys. The ongoing impact of her seismic win and her powerful post-race speech that women “beat the world” are still being felt today. One of Australia’s leading jockeys, Jamie Kah, said at the VRC’s Melbourne Cup tour launch on Tuesday that Payne’s 2015 victory in the race that stops a nation was a “massive turning point” for women in racing. “Probably from when I started riding (in 2012), it was already changing, but probably a good five or six years before that, the Clare Lindops of the world would never have imagined doing what Michelle did,” Kah said. Michelle Payne, who is calling time on riding, helped launch the VRC’s new honour boards this month. Credit: Vince Caligiuri/Getty Images “It was just a really good turning point. Now trainers see good jockeys and they put the good jockeys on. “It is not a good female jockey, or a good male jockey – it’s, if they are a good jockey and they ride well, they put them on. There’s no sexist people in this industry any more, and I think Michelle really helped that.” During the past four months Payne has begun working more closely with her trainer brother Patrick, allowing her to find more time to balance speaking and charity engagements with the seven-day workload of training a team of 10 horses at her Miners Rest property, near Ballarat. “It probably got to the point earlier this year when I didn’t know how I could keep managing it,” Payne said. “With consistent management of staff, track riders, education of babies and grass gallops – I was very lucky to be able to lean on my brother for some support, he’s been amazing. “What I have been able to do for him [in return] is head to Tasmania for the carnival with his horses, head to Adelaide for the carnival with his team, and fill in at the races where he needs a hand.” She said it was too early to tell whether they would consider forming a training partnership. Following her rise to national prominence in 2015, Payne is still very much in demand. She helped launch the VRC’s Melbourne Cup tour at Flemington on Tuesday by announcing the Victorian destinations of Cowes, Melbourne, Alpine Shire, Mountt Wycheproof, Rochester, Nathalia, Woodside, Trentham and Lancefield. Earlier this month she unveiled new honour boards outside the VRC committee room to recognise past Cup winners and VRC chairpersons, secretaries and CEOs. “Having a bit of relief from the training definitely helps being able to juggle all of those sorts of things,” Payne said.

Discover which therapies are expected to grab the major binge eating disorder market share @ Binge eating disorder is a serious mental health condition characterized by recurrent episodes of consuming large quantities of food in a short period while feeling a loss of control over eating behavior. Unlike bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge eating disorder typically do not engage in compensatory behaviors such as purging or excessive exercise to counteract the binge eating episodes. Several factors contribute to the development of binge eating disorder, including genetic predisposition, psychological factors like stress or low self-esteem, and environmental influences such as societal pressure to attain certain body ideals. Traumatic life events, childhood experiences, and dysfunctional family dynamics may also play a role in its onset. Symptoms of binge eating disorder include eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific time frame, eating rapidly until feeling uncomfortably full, eating alone due to embarrassment over food intake, and experiencing feelings of guilt, shame, or distress after binge eating episodes. Individuals with BED often struggle with emotional regulation and may use food as a coping mechanism to deal with stress, anxiety, or depression. Diagnosing binge eating disorder involves a comprehensive assessment by a healthcare professional, including a physical examination, psychological evaluation, and discussion of eating habits and behaviors. Criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) are used to determine if someone meets the diagnostic criteria for BED.

        "description": "The high-profile dispute is another example of risks posed by unregulated AI development, and how little AI companies care.",
        "content": "A couple of weeks ago, shortly before it became apparent that Congress won’t be regulating the rapid development of AI technology anytime soon, the leading avatar for chatbots and other generative AI tools, Sam Altman, showed us all the true face of Big Tech and Silicon Valley, once again. Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, tweeted out a single word—“her”—on May 13, as the company’s engineers demonstrated the capabilities of its latest AI-powered voice assistant model, ChatGPT-4o, on a livestream. The message was a clear reference to the uncanny resemblance between the assistant’s voice and the voice of a real, live, and very identifiable woman, actress Scarlett Johansson, who played an AI assistant that forms a romantic and sexual relationship with a human in the movie . The intentional decision to employ a flirtatious female voice on a that will probably become near-ubiquitous one day was questionable enough. But days later, Johansson implied in a that OpenAI may have simply stolen her voice, or created a fake facsimile, after she rejected an offer to work for the company. OpenAI has that the voice was meant to sound like Johansson, and produced records showing it hired a different actress—although it’s also true that the company telegraphed repeatedly that its new feature was inspired by , and intimated that Johansson agreed to let the company use her voice. The move came days before Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) closed several months of with tech CEOs by announcing a “roadmap” that calls for billions in government spending on further AI research and development, and . A group of academics, tech accountability, and civil rights groups responded with a , explaining that researchers, labor organizations, and other public-interest groups “were marginalized in the conversation,” while “some of the loudest and most-self serving voices from the industry,” including Altman, Elon Musk, and Marc Andreessen, had lawmakers’ ears. “Any legislative process that begins with industry in the driver’s seat is fated not only to fail the public interest, but even to exacerbate AI’s ongoing harms,” the group said in the May 20 report. The dispute between OpenAI and Johansson is a neat distillation of the cluelessness, the soft bigotry, and the apathy with which the titans of industry and Big Tech conduct themselves as they develop what are widely expected to become the most world-altering, and dangerous, technologies in human history. The case also involves overt sexism and bias, which has been a of AI applications in the past. And as much as anything, it’s a clear indication of the industry’s willingness and ability to unfairly exploit and abuse the labor of even the most powerful, well-off workers in our society. Kate Devlin, a lecturer in AI and society at King’s College London and author of , said the company’s offer to Johansson was a very deliberate choice to align its vision and products with the imagined future in —i.e., people substituting interaction with attentive computers for human relationships, and even falling in love with them. The movie, incidentally, was a depiction of dystopia, not a love story. “This is despite years of criticism about the reductive and unhelpful predominance of female voices for subservient virtual assistants,” Devlin added. “Sex sells, and OpenAI knows they can get a lot more engagement with a persona for their model that coos and giggles at your every command.” Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a Brown University professor who participated in the discussions with CEOs and Congress, said the dispute shows the need for immediate regulation, so there are rules in place to protect the public while companies are debuting AI products and experimenting with the emerging technology. “They did this with a fair amount of impunity,” Venkatasubramanian said. “The idea that ‘you do this first and if someone complains we’ll see what happens’ is very much the ethos of a lot of what happens in this area for a while now. This is just an attention-grabbing example.” OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. that she received an offer “to voice the current ChatGPT system” last September, which was around the same time that Altman said publicly that is his about AI, during a demo and Q&A session at a customer relationship management conference. The movie “inspired us,” and “certainly more than a little bit,” Altman said. Reporters the resemblance during the demo between the so-called “Sky” voice and Johansson’s, all the way back in September 2023. Johansson declined OpenAI’s initial offer; and she never responded to a renewed offer from Altman this month, two days before the release of ChatGPT-4o, according to her statement. Yet, despite the lack of consent, the new voice assistant feature dropped last week, alongside Altman’s “her” tweet, and with a voice “so eerily similar” to Johansson’s that her “closest friends” could not tell the difference, the actress said in her statement. Whatever else might be said about its portrayal of the future, is a movie—an expression of human imagination meant to tell a story and to maybe say something about life and living. On the other hand, Altman is a real guy, whose company apparently ignored a real woman’s denial of consent, and capitalized on her likeness and on-screen personas (her labor, in other words) in the real world. Most people probably understand on an intuitive level exactly what OpenAI and Altman were doing. Research suggests that casting actors who are known mainly for voice acting into voiceover roles allows filmmakers to take advantage of the star’s on-screen persona(s). In this case, we have an actress who is well known as a sex symbol, and whose on-screen personas, including in , have been described as “ ,” and “ ” by film critics. In short, by “casting Johansson as Samantha, the film allows us to associate Samantha with how Johansson looks, thereby giving Samantha a ‘phantom’ sexual presence,’” according to by Devlin, at King’s College, and others. Similarly, by trying to “cast” Johansson, and by using a similar voice, OpenAI apparently sought to imbue its product with those same qualities, in order to entice more customers. It’s quite a move for a company whose technology is expected to help form the AI infrastructure on Apple and Microsoft’s ubiquitous devices. It’s also worth noting that OpenAI was criticized by in December for having an all-male and all-white board, and for nominating Larry Summers, who of sexist remarks. The company to its board in March. Venkatasubramanian said he was struck by how AI companies evade responsibility for their design choices. “On one hand, they convey the impression that what they’re doing is like sci-fi, alien and completely different from anything ever done before,” he said. “They do that through the voice that’s been described as ‘flirty,’ and by cryptically referring to the movie. These are deliberate choices. But when confronted they tend to back off and say we didn’t mean that.” are no less worrisome. As a background matter, the “magic” behind AI often includes . OpenAI, a company worth billions, has to Kenyan workers making less than $2 an hour. The development points to how AI threatens a broad range of professions, including white-collar or so-called knowledge workers, and even the most powerful in our society. Johansson chose not to work for Altman and OpenAI; still, the company was able to use its huge public profile and its technology to reap much of the attention and other benefits that it would have gained if Johansson decided to sign a contract with them. Johansson has said that the company only took down the “Sky” voice after she was forced to hire legal counsel, and it’s likely she will pursue the apparent violations of her publicity rights. She may have a good case with some precedent: Going back to the 1980s, artists like and , who are famous for their distinctive, recognizable voices, have successfully sued companies that hired people to impersonate their voices for commercial use. The Midler case went all the way to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that a famous voice is distinctive enough that an imitator cannot be used in a commercial enterprise without consent and approval. The dispute also parallels more recent circumstances, when the popular artist Drake released a song that relied on AI to generate the voice of the late Tupac, who remains one of the best-selling artists within the genre. Lawyers representing the late rapper’s estate sent a letter saying their client “would never have given its approval,” and was dismayed by the “flagrant violation of Tupac’s publicity” rights and “the legacy of one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time.” The song was scrubbed from social media after the threat of legal action. Ironically, was the victim of a possible publicity rights violation in April, when a content creator uploaded a new song believed to have featured AI-generated vocals from Drake and The Weeknd. At the time, the artists’ label, Universal Music Group, made the stakes clear in a statement condemning AI-generated content that infringes on publicity rights: The issues raise a question as to which side of history these companies want to be on, UMG said: “the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation,” a UMG spokesman in a statement reported by NPR. UMG has artificial-intelligence platforms over using its copyrighted works to “train” models; and other major businesses, like , the , and a host of other publications, have filed lawsuits against companies like OpenAI and Microsoft. OpenAI had to have known about these controversies before deciding to rip off Johansson’s likeness. And yet it wasn’t a deterrent to the multibillion-dollar company. , or the fast-growing category of work known as content creation, is uniquely vulnerable to artificial intelligence. In a sense, content creators, who are effectively contract workers for social media platforms, often lack and conditions of their employment—the algorithmic systems that handle ranking and content moderation. The dispute with Johansson is simply a high-profile example of the power Big Tech and AI companies wield. Of course, the dispute also demonstrates a kind of cluelessness in the industry, much like the that showed a hydraulic machine crushing a trumpet, piano, books, and other instruments of creativity and imagination, and replacing them with the latest iPad. (Apple pulled the ad and apologized after receiving major backlash.) Polls show that most Americans don’t trust companies to use and develop AI responsibly. A recent Pew Research Center showed that 70 percent of Americans say they have “little to no trust in companies to make responsible decisions about how they use AI in their products,” and 80 percent said the information companies collect in the process “will be used in ways that people are not comfortable with.” Still, industry leaders are trying to sell us on a vision of the future and of AI focused on deep relationships with flirty, attention-trapping computers that sound like Scarlett Johansson, which will also read our children and make things like musical instruments and pencils obsolete. It’s almost laughable, until you remember the actual stakes at hand when it comes to AI, and the fact that these companies are still unregulated in the U.S.",

        "description": "The end of such men is coming through legislation. And it’s accelerating because of the alleged behaviour of men like Wick.",
        "content": "My colleagues have been embarrassed by the revelations about the behaviour of Darren Wick, former head honcho of news at Nine. It’s the avalanche of allegations, of sexual harassment, of bullying, of ghosting, the desperate remnants of alpha maleness of it all which embarrasses the women – and a few good men – with whom I work. So, a couple of questions. Who knew what and when? How is it remotely possible that former MD Hugh Marks claims to have known nothing ? Look, I believe he believes that about himself. But then he was busy with other issues, wasn’t he? Former Nine news chief Darren Wick. And here’s the one I know you’re all asking yourself: how could a bunch of smart, educated, powerful women put up with this terrifying behaviour for so long? Let me answer this for you. We are still telling women not to make trouble, not to complain, just in case it ruins our careers. We are still telling women to be compliant and courteous. It hasn’t worked in my case, but then I’ve had to pay for that. The truth is, our careers are set to be ruined whether we comply or whether we don’t. If we try to tell our bosses what’s going on, we are sent on our way. Or, in the interim, we are all told to go to human resources, the place where the hopes, dreams and ambitions of many a woman have gone to die. It is true of at least the media that the power of women at work has soared over the decades since I started my journalism cadetship at The Sydney Morning Herald in 1982, but it is also true that the power of men remains ascendant. It’s true in both industries I’ve worked in – media and universities – despite the heavily feminised workforce. It’s true of nearly every sector I’ve written about, from finance to the arts to the law. Powerful men can choose to behave ethically and well. Unfortunately, they can also behave like bulldozers. For these men, it’s ultimately rewarding because they build a kingdom in which they are both admired and feared. Woe betide anyone unfortunate enough to be in their paths. We are set to be saved. All set to be saved. But it will take time. This is where we are now. I’d like to believe that Nine management on the TV side acted out of a desire to protect the woman brave enough to make the complaint. But really, the government made them do it. The end of these men is coming through legislation. And it’s accelerating because of the alleged behaviour of men like Wick . Men like Peter Fray and Chris Dore . Men like Mark Forbes . Men like the pathetic child of journalism royalty who used his connections to protect his behaviour. Men like the former ABC child genius who was forced to leave before it all came undone. Now Adrian Foo, Nine’s former publicity boss of Stan, is in the queue . It’s true that not all the men named here behaved in the same way. Some were accused of being workplace jerks, rather than workplace predators. And none of them wielded a casting couch in the way Harvey Weinstein did. Let me tell you about the former chief of staff conducting parallel relationships with two infant journalists, each of whom thought they were “the one”. Only one got the job she wanted at the end. The other was “managed out”. As I have suggested on many, many occasions, we should have workplace bonk bans . Sure, shag who you want on your own time but when you are doing it with a person who is professionally beneath you, it brings all manner of trouble. And the chances are that on many of these occasions, women say yes because they fear what will happen to their careers if they say no. Do not criticise women who are silent. They fear they have no choice. What happened at Nine happens in every sector in Australia. In finance (think AMP’s Boe Pahari ), in mining, in the law (think Dyson Heydon ). There are cases after cases with decisions made in favour of the women complainants. But it takes more than guts to bring a complaint. It takes time, money and more resilience than most of us have. But here is what’s about to happen. As Karen O’Connell, longtime researcher and now professor of law at UTS says, we are set to enter a new world: “We will have had a complete paradigm shift in Australia because of the introduction of positive duty.” Shorter version: this is basically regulation of the kinds of behaviours we think of as sexual harassment. Employers will have to take a step back and look at their whole culture. As I’ve said, maybe Nine acted out of decency. But my money is on Nine acting because it had no choice. The law says employers have a positive duty to protect staff. In the past, we have had to rely on individuals to speak up. In the case of Boe Pahari, it’s hard to feel anything but grief when thinking about the career of Julia Szlakowski, the woman who made the complaint about AMP’s rainmaker. It’s hard to feel anything but grief when thinking about the career of young journalist Amy Taeuber, who made a complaint about a colleague and got sacked for her trouble. There’s a long list of women who are less famous but just as hurt, whose careers are in tatters because they dared to say something. The law backs this. As O’Connell says, the future for men looks like this. Men will need to have a set of skills and a set of values that their employers need them to meet. And men will not be permitted to succeed unless they know how to treat people equally. All I would say to the Hugh Markses of this world is, maybe listen to the women. No, you don’t have to believe every complaint which comes to you, but you do need to have open hearts and open minds. And that’s the only way to protect women at work.

        "content": "In his quest for a sixth term, 1st Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe, a Democrat, is facing a challenge in the June 11 primary. Columbia attorney Austin Drake Nichols is making a bid for the office. The 1st Judicial Circuit includes Orangeburg, Dorchester and Calhoun counties. Party primaries will be held June 11 with any runoff scheduled for June 25. The general election is Nov. 5. Pascoe was first elected in 2005 as solicitor for the 1st Judicial Circuit. \"Being a prosecutor has been a calling my entire adult life. It is all I've wanted to do even before law school. A prosecutor's duty is to seek justice in every case and protect the rights of both victims and defendants,\" the 57-year-old said. \"I take this role very seriously since a prosecutor is the only person in the judicial system whose job is to do 'justice.' Other than being a father to three amazing sons, being solicitor is both the most important and only job I desire waking up to every morning,\" said Pascoe, who is married. Pascoe said his office would seek justice, something which he has experience in. \"Having done it for 30 years and having prosecuted corrupt politicians at the Statehouse, I am in a unique position which is allowing me to call out selfish and corrupt behavior when their actions impede the fairness of our justice system,\" he said. Pascoe was assigned as a special prosecutor in a public corruption probe of the General Assembly in 2014. He oversaw the investigation and secured the convictions and office removals of five state General Assembly members, including the House speaker, Senate president pro tem, House Judiciary chairman and two former House majority Leaders. \"I have the experience in bringing diversion programs to our circuit by establishing drug courts and a Youth Mentor Program, which has been recognized as best in the state. I am currently in the process of getting a youth program implemented to deal with our current statewide epidemic of guns in the hands of our children,\" Pascoe said. The Youth Mentor Program was the first of its kind in the 1st Circuit to target youth juvenile violence by linking the judicial system with the local faith community, the solicitor said. He continued, \"My office has been working with Orangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenell and the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office for several months now to come up with a program that will be operational very soon.\" Pascoe said the difference between him and his opponent is that he brings more \"experience, results and commitment to the community.\" \"I have 30 years prosecutorial experience and successfully tried over 200 violent crime cases. My opponent has none. I have created drug courts and diversion programs in our circuit. My opponent has no such experience. Finally, I live in the circuit and raised three sons in Calhoun and Orangeburg counties. My opponent was not even registered to vote in the district when he filed to fun,\" he said. Pascoe is a 1989 magna cum laude graduate of The Citadel. He graduated from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1993. He worked as a state prosecutor with both the 5th Circuit Solicitor's Office and Attorney General's Office after graduating law school. As an assistant solicitor, he was profiled on Court TV for the guilty verdict of Jeffery Weston, one of the state's only murder trials where the victim's body has never been discovered. As solicitor, he said he again successfully prosecuted a \"no body\" murder case in Orangeburg County, securing the murder conviction of Kenneth Cutter. Pascoe also cited the life sentences given to two men responsible for the murder of 6-year-old Winston Hunter of Woodford. Nichols is an attorney with the The Rutherford Law Firm LLC, 1315 Blanding, Columbia, SC 29202. The 29-year-old Anderson native said he now resides in Calhoun County and that questions surrounding his residency are unfounded. According to filing information with the South Carolina Election Commission dated April 1, 2024, Nichols lists his address as 1708 Bridge St. in St. Matthews. \"I reside right on Bridge St. in Calhoun (County). If I didn't reside in the county, I wouldn't have been eligible to even apply to run. It's another attack just because I'm young and haven't been out of law school much. So I've moved around,\" Nichols said. He said he is also registered to vote at the same place. \"You can't be registered to vote somewhere else and run somewhere else,\" he said. He said he wants to accomplish two things if elected. \"One, I want to be able to prosecute cases for the whole circuit. That is going to include making sure that from top to bottom -- myself included and everyone in the office -- is trained and skilled. Not saying that they aren't now, but that we continue to be intentional about polishing up our skills and polishing up our trial advocacy and studying, growing and developing that so that we're strong and effective when we're in the courtroom,\" Nichols said. He continued, \"But like I keep saying, particularly for Orangeburg, it's a college town, it's a college community. There's a lot of young people in the 1st Circuit, and I wanted to get young people back involved in service, back involved in wanting to be in law enforcement, go to law school and be a lawyer, work in the victim's advocate office, work in some type of role with city, town, county and state government.\" Nichols said he wants to \"encourage our youth and encourage young people to be civil servants.\" \"We're going to do that through the good work and through the hard work that we do while we're having fair, common sense and strong prosecution, but also making sure that we're touching the community,\" he said. He joined the firm of SC House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford of Richland County in August 2023. \"I do a lot of civil litigation all over the state. I'm licensed in both South Carolina and in D.C. I do some criminal defense, as well,\" Nichols said. He is a graduate of Westside High School in Anderson. \"I just had a little brother and niece graduate from Westside. I went to Coastal Carolina for undergrad, was student body president there and then went to law school at (the University of South) Carolina,\" he said, noting that he got his undergrad degree in political science, with a minor in ancient philosophy. He was married in April. \"It has been an extremely busy spring for me. No children, just a lot of nieces and nephews, and no animals, yet, but hopefully I can convince her to get one when this is said and done,\" Nichols said. As far as his campaign, he said it's not all about winning. \"At the end of the day in this race, we're all Democrats. ... Whether I win, or Mr. Pascoe wins this primary, I am certain that either of us will do a great job. Either he'll continue to do a great job, or I will do a great job. But we've got to continue to support Democrats along this journey, and we've got to continue to uplift people of the 1st Circuit, particularly our young people.\" Contact the writer: dgleaton@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5534.

        "description": "The author of Crazy Rich Asians returns with another outrageous comedy of manners, family and money. So much money.",
        "content": "Lies and Weddings Kevin Kwan Hutchinson Heinemann, $34.99 Kevin Kwan’s fifth novel, Lies and Weddings , is dangerously absorbing and deceptively clever. Like all his books, it follows the eccentric personalities of the absurdly ultra-wealthy with a pixie-ish flair, not unlike the way Wes Anderson treats colour in his movies. The story begins with a wedding between Lady Augusta Leung Gresham (daughter of The Right Honourable the Countess of Greshambury Arabella Leung Gresham and The Right Honorable the Earl of Greshambury Francis Gresham) and Prince Maximillian Zu Lichtenberg of Norway. (You can imagine the fun Kwan had in creating the names of his characters). As the mother of the bride, Arabella is in her element, pulling all the strings to ensure her eldest daughter’s wedding in Hawaii is nothing short of a Met Gala-level affair. Much to her daughter’s despair, she’s also strategically using the wedding to launch the latest of her ultra-insiders resorts — part of her global lifestyle luxury brand, which she hopes to eventually sell off to a private equity group for billions. Less than 24 hours before the wedding, the bride mutates into a hot ball of rage when her mother insists she wear a couture Valentino dress that costs more than a two-storey sandstone in Sydney. The bride just wants to wear something charming by a local Hawaiian designer. But their conflict is conveniently and unexpectedly interrupted by a volcanic eruption on the island, which literally splits open the grounds of the resort. Author Kevin Kwan. Credit: Giancarlo Ciampini Thinking her life could not get any worse, Arabella returns home to the family estate (Greshambury Hall), only to be told by her husband that they are, in fact, facing crippling debt — they can no longer borrow any more money from a private investor set up by their family doctor, Thomas Tong. She’s learning the painful lesson that being descendants of Renaissance noble-people does not inoculate them from fiscal realities. “Tell me what I’m supposed to do without my Agnes Martins? My powder room will never look the same,” Arabella cries in the spirit of Moira Rose . How will she survive in prison without seeing her cosmetic dentist thrice a year? Now Arabella’s goal of marrying off her children “to the debilitated descendants of Victoria and Albert” has become even more urgent. She’s especially concerned about her only son, Rufus, a wayfaring dreamer who spends his time painting and surfing and being described by the press as “sex on a stick” whose “brow ridges alone could command half a billion.” To his mother’s distress, he’s also getting too close to Thomas Tong’s daughter, Eden – an unassuming childhood friend who grew up next to Greshambury Hall. For Arabella, when there’s a will, there’s a way — especially when you’re connected to an empire of status-obsessed individuals who have honorific titles, own luxury super yachts and have personal art consultants on speed dial. Arabella calls upon some familial help. With just one phone call, she is taking a helicopter from Battersea to Paris for a meeting to enact a trifecta of royal marriages. By having her son marry Princess Solene de Courcy of France, she can finally link the Greshams with the noblest houses of Europe and become the matriarch of her own self-made dynasty. Cue a montage of globetrotting action from London to Venice to Paris to Hong Kong to Beverly Hills to Marrakesh to Hawaii. Money can dismantle boundaries and borders. The Greshams use it to affix families together. Like Jane Austen featuring Asian people, Kwan’s novel has the impressionistic quality of a Bridgerton episode. Everyone is blessed with ethereal beauty, and it is beauty alone that will inevitably attract fortune. The Booklist is a weekly newsletter for book lovers from books editor Jason Steger.

        "content": "A 25-year-old Orangeburg man is accused of stalking a woman and causing her to fear for the safety of her and her family, according to a warrant. Gabriel Kimani Berry, of Wolfe Trail, is charged with stalking. Berry’s ex-girlfriend claims he has been harassing and stalking her for about two months. She fears that the alleged incidents won’t stop until Berry kills her, according to the incident report. She told officers she hadn’t left her residence in a week because she was afraid she’d encounter Berry. A warrant accuses Berry of using a pattern of words and conduct “that served no legitimate purpose and was intended to cause” his accuser “fear of bodily injury and/or death of herself and her family.” It goes on to accuse Berry of: • Calling and texting his ex’s phone, threating to “smack the f - - -“ out of her with one of his guns. • Driving by his ex’s residence and vandalizing her property. • Displaying a weapon and posting his ex’s whereabouts on social media. • Threatening his ex and her mother on Facebook. Berry was taken into custody on May 21. Orangeburg Municipal Judge Chasity Avinger did not set bail on Berry on Wednesday, leaving that matter to be considered by a circuit judge later. If Berry’s convicted, he faces up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Contact the writer: mbrown@timesanddemocrat.com or 803-533-5545. Follow on Twitter: @MRBrownTandD.

Mr. Xing Jin, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of So-Young, commented, \"In the first quarter, our business continued to showcase its remarkable resilience and adaptability, with top line exceeding guidance and increasing 2.6% year-over-year to . Growth during the quarter was primarily driven by sales of medical products and maintenance services, which increased 23.3% year-over-year. More importantly, we made significant progress in the businesses we are developing to fuel future growth. Building on the success of our model clinic, we are on track to expand our network into core cities nationwide by the end of the year. With a firm focus on ensuring the quality of products and services, we standardized operating procedures to streamline every stage from site selection to clinic opening and operations, allowing us to grow our offline presence at a rapid pace. Directly complimenting this is our supply chain business. With a growing pipeline of products and an expanding distribution network now covering 750 institutions, we are able to spot emerging trends, quickly bring new high-quality products to market, and create a win-win outcome for both upstream suppliers and end consumers.

Within just a few months, our newly established clinics are able to outperform our financial models. We will continue investing in and nurturing these promising businesses during their growth phases. At the same time, we are implementing disciplined cost controls to support a healthy and sustainable expansion of our bottom line.\" Total revenues were ( ), an increase of 2.6% from in the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues generated by the sales of medical products and maintenance services from growing order volumes for cosmetic products and medical equipment. Cost of revenues was ( ), an increase of 3.2% from in the first quarter of 2023.

The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company's preliminary estimates of market and operating conditions, as well as customer demand, which are all subject to change. To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in , or GAAP, this press release presents non-GAAP income/(loss) from operations and non-GAAP net income/(loss) attributable to So-Young International Inc. by excluding share-based compensation expenses from income/(loss) from operations and net income/(loss) attributable to So-Young International Inc., respectively. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand the Company's operating and financial performance, compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and assess the Company's core operating results, as they exclude certain expenses that are not expected to result in cash payments. The use of the above non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and will continue to be incurred in the future.

        "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL )'s smartphone shipments in China were 52% higher in April than a year ago, extending a rebound seen in the previous month, according to data from a research firm affiliated the Chinese government. Shipments of foreign-branded phones in China increased by 52% in April to 3.495 million units from 2.301 million a year earlier, data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) showed on Tuesday. Although the data did not explicitly mention Apple, the company is the dominant foreign phone maker in China's smartphone-dominated market. This suggests that the increase in foreign-branded shipments can be attributed to Apple's performance. The big increase follows a weak performance earlier this year in the world's biggest smartphone market, as the U.S. tech giant faces intensifying competition in the high-end market from local rivals such as Huawei. Apple's shipments in China increased by 12% in March, marking a significant improvement from the first two months of 2024, when the company experienced a 37% slump in sales. Sales may see a further boost in May, as Apple launched an aggressive discounting campaign this month on its official Tmall site in China, offering discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($318) on select iPhone models. The price reduction, double the size of a discount it offered in February, comes after Huawei introduced last month its new series of high-end smartphones, the Pura 70, following the launch of the Mate 60 last August. Huawei overtook Apple in the first quarter as the No.2 smartphone vendor in China and is ramping up its marketing campaign by opening more flagship stores and adding more retail distributors. Huawei spinoff Honor holds the top spot. Overall smartphone sales in China increased by 25.5% to 22.7 million units in April, data from the CAICT showed.",

        "content": "An Indian climber rescued from Everest has died in hospital, a Nepali tourism official said Tuesday, taking the number of fatalities this season on the world’s highest mountain to eight. Banshi Lal, 46, was plucked from the mountain last week and taken to a hospital in Nepal’s capital Kathmandu. “He died at the hospital yesterday,” Rakesh Gurung of the tourism department told AFP. Three people — a British climber and two Nepali guides — among the eight are listed as missing but presumed dead. The latest fatality comes as the Everest mountaineering season nears its end, with the death toll relatively low compared to other years. Last year was the deadliest season on the mountain with 18 fatalities. Three others died climbing other Nepali peaks including a Romanian aiming for Lhotse, neighbouring Everest, and a French and a Nepali climber on Makalu, the fifth-highest peak. Nepal is home to eight of the world’s 10 highest peaks and welcomes hundreds of adventurers each spring, when temperatures are warm and winds typically calm. All the Everest deaths occurred in areas above 8,000 metres (26,200 feet), known as the “death zone”, where thin air and low oxygen levels heighten the risk of altitude sickness. Nepal has issued more than 900 permits for its mountains this year, including 419 for Everest, earning more than $5 million in royalties. More than 600 climbers and their guides have already reached the summit of Everest after a rope-fixing team reached the peak last month. China also reopened the Tibetan route to foreigners this year for the first time since closing it in 2020 because of the pandemic. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "description": "Waitrose has unveiled its brand new cat food - Lasagne Chunks in Jelly - and it has left many people confused",
        "content": "People have been asking whether Waitrose's social media accounts got hacked after the store uploaded a picture of its new, limited edition cat food. The supermarket left many baffled after unveiling its Essential Waitrose Lasagne Chunks in Jelly with Mozzarella, Juicy Tomato and Fresh Basil. The image posted to the retailer's Facebook , X, and Instagram accounts shows the product sitting on a shelf. On the front, there is a photo of a ginger cat alongside a plate of the lasagne. In the caption, Waitrose wrote: \"Help your cat rise AND shine with our new lasagne-flavoured snack. Inspired by our favourite fuzzy orange friend #GarfieldMovie.\" So, for anyone hoping the cat food is real, they'll be disappointed to know it is made-up. The entire post is a joke and a nod to the brand new Garfield movie that has come out. The Garfield Movie is available in cinemas now, it was released last week on May 24. The 2024 film sees the iconic ginger cat - who loves lasagne and is voiced by Chris Pratt - unexpectedly reunite with his long-lost father, the street cat Vic. However, the post did seem to fool many people. Some even asked if the store's accounts had got hacked while others 'couldn't believe how well cats are now being fed'. On Reddit , one user called SmileyEeyore asked: \" Did Garfield hack Waitrose’s Instagram?\" They added: \" If Garfield got to have his say in commercialised cat food, we know he would stop the human gatekeeping of lasagne. \"The only conclusion is therefore that he’s evidently managed to infiltrate Waitrose HQ & is out there doing it for the cats.\" On X, Nushy wrote: \"Is this real? please say yes!\" Jayveeboyce put: \"Waitrose cats eating better than half the country at this point — I am not surprised.\" Deb___x agreed: \"These cats don’t know they are born.\" Squirrel_lover4 jokingly pointed out: \"April fools day was last month.\" Seagull4 replied: \"Is this an April fool? It’s May... almost June.\" Meanwhile, Eat_static seemed impressed, writing: \"Ha ha, brilliant.\" Waitrose has been approached for comment.",

        "description": "The article discusses the impact of junk food consumption on health, referencing the ICMR-NIN guidelines. It also mentions a visit to Gadchiroli and a speaking assignment at Dr Rani and Abhay Bang's organisation in this article by Rujuta Diwekar.",
        "content": "I visited Gadchiroli a few years ago on a speaking assignment. I was addressing the social worker community at Dr. Rani and Abhay Bang’s organisation. Amongst many things that I carry back are the names of two tribal girls — Frooti and Selfie. One tends to think that people in rural areas inhabit a different planet from those in metros but that’s not really the case as far as penetration of junk food products — colas, chips, chocolates (and now even clicks on smartphones) — go. And so, the recently released ICMR-NIN guidelines on healthy eating that ask people to avoid eating ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is a step in the right direction. UPFs and their detrimental effects on both people and the planet are well documented. Global scientific communities are asking for warning labels on UPFs like those on cigarettes. But those are hard to come by, especially in developing economies where industries habitually push back any kind of regulation. And probably that’s why the ICMR, in its latest guidelines, asks you to read food labels and make informed choices. What does this really mean for a child though who lives in an obesogenic environment? The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD 2021) shows that from 2000 to 2021 there has been an almost 50% increase in DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), basically years spent in poor health. Most of this has been caused by non-communicable diseases such as obesity , high blood sugar and blood pressure in the 15-49 age group. One may be tempted to call these lifestyle disorders, the diseases that one gets because of one’s own negligence, lack of discipline and willpower. Or we can acknowledge that there is data to show that when policies that prioritise health are in place, these risks can be mitigated. One example of this is Chile which, in 2016, introduced front-of-label octagonal black warning labels on all UPFs. It does not allow advertisements of junk food on TV programs that are directed at kids. It was a response to the fact that half of their children were either overweight or obese, and the gambit paid off. Studies found that consumption of sugary beverages had dropped. Also, companies cut sugar and salt to meet the new regulations. Essentially, Chile has presented proof of concept for junk food regulation and warning labels. Many other countries have followed suit. In 2020, the Oaxaca state of Mexico banned sales, distribution and supply of sugary beverages (colas, caffeinated energy drinks etc) and high-calorie foods to all kids under 18, similar to restrictions on alcohol. In 2017, Norway (also known as one of the healthiest, happiest countries in the world) increased the tax on sugar and chocolate products by 80%. Canada too is putting restrictions in place to create a healthier environment for children.ICMR states that 56% of disease burden in India is due to unhealthy diets (read high consumption of UPFs). We are probably the only country where pizza and burger chains have a dedicated birthday area. What can you do as a parent then to ensure that your kids have not just a long life but also a healthy one? 1. Teach children that consumption of packaged food is unhealthy 2. Tell them how to recognise UPFs. They usually have more than five ingredients and include additives, emulsifiers, stabilisers, hydrogenated oils etc. And even if they are enriched with vitamins or minerals, it does not make them healthy 3. Watch out for sneaky sugars such as high fructose corn syrup 4. Reinforce that chips, chocolates and colas are chips, chocolates, and colas even when sold and advertised as low fat, sugar or low calorie Most importantly, remember that guidelines that warn you about UPFs without any policy shifts — like regulation and taxes — are toothless, to say the least. As a nation we have taken massive strides in the areas of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases. We still have a long way to go even there, but the intention and the machinery is in place. It’s time that our politicians and policy makers stop reducing obesity to a lifestyle choice and instead address the elephant in the room.

        "content": "Leadership of the renowned pan African students’ movement, The Progressive Students Movement (PSM), Nigeria Chapter has hailed President Bola Ahmed Tinubu for the successes recorded by his administration in its first 1 year in office. The president of the group, Comrade Ambassador Bestman Okereafor, gave the commendation in a statement he shared with journalists yesterday. He said it is important to commend the efforts of the president on national defence and internal security. According to the statement, “Information show that our gallant military troops have succeeded in neutralising 9,303 terrorists/criminals, including degenerated kingpins such as Damina, Dangote, Kachalla Azarailu and Boderi among others “This is apart from the arrest of 6,998 and the rescue of 4,641 hostages, among other achievements. “Another key achievement of Mr. President in the last year was the signing of the Access to Higher Education Act, 2023, into law on June 12, 2023. “This law enables indigent students to access interest-free loans for their educational pursuits in any Nigerian tertiary institution, a move considered as a fulfillment of one of his campaign promises to liberalize the funding of education”. “However, we call on school managements to be accountable and transparent by ensuring that students’ data are promptly uploaded to the NELFUND site to enable students to access the loan. “We call on NELFUND to ensure the principle of federal character is upheld; all regions must have a fair share regardless of state, religion, and tribe. “We also call on the government to consider paying both the academic and non-academic staff unions their outstanding emoluments to avoid elongation of the academic year, which may further complicate the student loan plans. “We have seen a situation where ASUU went on strike for eight months under the last administration. “We also caution school management to halt any plans of hiking school fees because of the student loan, as it will be vehemently resisted.”",

        "content": "Chef Guntas Sethi is a celebrated name in the food industry who is known for her love for all things delicious. Recognized as the ambassador for the European Union's 'More Than Food' campaign, her journey epitomizes a blend of culinary excellence and sustainability, inspiring aspiring chefs to embrace innovation and mindful cooking practices. In an exclusive chat with Etimes, she said, \"My journey as a chef began when I decided to pursue my Master’s in London at Le Cordon Bleu to study patisserie. After that, there was no looking back!\" Scroll down to read the detailed interview. Indian households have been embracing this trend since the beginning. Back in the day, when not every household have a refrigerator, which meant that there was not much that could be saved, so Indians would always think of ways to repurpose everything and not let anything go to waste. Indians have always stretched their leftovers, like dal is used to make parathas. An example of trash treasuring is seen in Gujrati culture, where it is quite common to use pumpkin skin to make chutney. In the same manner, leftover veggies have been used as fillings to make stuffed parathas or to make equity/ grilled sandwiches, which are quite famous in the north. So, I feel Indians have always looked at cooking consciously. Over the years, as technology has evolved, we have access to so much, especially with how quickly everything is delivered through e-commerce platforms. We have forgotten how to repurpose things and extract more utility out of ingredients, because it's more convenient to get something new. However, as climate awareness is gathering steam, there has been a drastic attitudinal shift in people across the world, especially younger consumers who have started to make more informed choices. There’s a greater focus on health and well-being, and people in India are now more conscious and driven to make better food choices. They want to know what they are eating and the story behind its production and how safe it is to consume. In fact, there has been a significant surge in interest and consumption of European food and beverages in India due to their stringent production standards. We need to now ensure that these ingredients are also being utilised to their fullest potential in our kitchens. What’s beautiful about European ingredients is the variety of products available. Because of how vast the geographical region is, there are a lot of different climates, soils, and topography factors, so there is a broad range of products available all of which with various characteristics and taste. What is important, I feel, with ingredients from the European Union, is to understand how to use them in a way that lets the produce shine. For example, in India, we tend to work with a lot of masalas, and we love our flavours, but with European produce, while they can be used along with Indian ingredients, it is important that we let them shine and not overshadow them because they have subtle yet extremely rich flavours. One could use cherry tomatoes from Spain in Indian gravies or add mozzarella from Italy to make cheese dosas – the combinations are endless. So, it is important to treat the produce well instead of overcrowding it with a lot of other ingredients. I wholeheartedly believe that Indians are now becoming global citizens. As we travel more, we always bring back a little bit of the culture and food with us. This not only makes us want to experiment more, but also opens us to welcoming different trends and different cuisines. In recent years, there has been a sudden surge in popularity of European food amongst Indians that goes beyond just popular cheeses and wines. Indians now understand the vastness and actively opt for different cuisines such as Mediterranean, Italian, Danish and more. There is a growing awareness around not just the cuisine but also the ingredients. For example, Burrata is an Italian cheese that not a lot of Indians understood, but today, a lot of gourmet restaurants and even fast-food chains, have a burrata pizza because of how much Indians are loving it. Talking about opportunities, I see a lot of fusion food coming in. There is a particular restaurant in Bombay called Gallops, which serves a saag dish with burrata on top. Now, Palak Paneer is something that we have always eaten, but replacing an Indian version of cottage cheese (paneer) with a European cheese like Halloumi, PDO from Cyprus is a whole new variant. Similarly, Azeite de Trás-os-Montes, a PDO extra virgin olive oil from Portugal can be used to marinate paneer with other spices and served alongside crostini as an appetizer. So, there are endless possibilities on how it can all be worked around. And every day there is something new to see. For me, food is something that has always, always, always been at the centre stage of every celebration. I grew up in a Punjabi family, where the conversations revolved mainly around food. When we used to sit for lunch, we used to decide on what we should have for dinner and at dinner, what to have for breakfast the next day. So, food has always been in my DNA. However, my first choice was to get a degree in Chartered Accountancy. My journey as a chef began when I decided to pursue my Master’s in London at Le Cordon Bleu to study patisserie. After that, there was no looking back! Soon after, I started making marble cakes and brownies at home. I’d get compliments and the orders followed. It picked up so much that within nine months, I had to get a proper studio. That was the beginning of my cloud kitchen patisserie called Chef Guntas, based in Khar. As followers on Instagram took off, more avenues for growth opened up. That’s when I became the ambassador for European Union’s food and beverage campaign ‘More Than Food’ in India. When we talk about sustainability, it is important that food is, first of all, produced sustainably. The EU has put in place several measures to ensure all food and beverages are authentic and of high quality and are produced in a safe and sustainable manner. Take for instance, the Farm to Fork strategy. Part of the European Green Deal, it is a comprehensive plan aimed at promoting sustainable food systems within the EU. It focuses on various aspects of the food supply chain, from production to consumption, with the goal of ensuring food security, reducing environmental impact, and improving public health. Organic farming practices, including more efficient energy and water use and pesticide limitations, are a few of the ways European farmers and producers help mitigate climate change and preserve nature. On a personal level, it is important to understand the nutritional profile and characteristics of a produce. For example, while broccoli florets have a lot of protein in it, so does the stem. But sustainability goes beyond that: in India, 78.2 million tonnes of food goes to waste each year. To combat food wastage, there are so many ways to repurpose food. I feel food allows for a lot of innovation, with opportunities to use a lot of different fruits and vegetables in the preparation. Be it using all part of an orange from Malta – from segments to peels – in a chocolate mousse or using asparagus from Netherlands in a salad and later in an Aloo Asparagus subzi, a lot of European vegetables can be used sustainably in Indian kitchens by making sure every single part of them comes into use. So, it is not just about what can be restricted from throwing away, but also different ways to see how your available ingredients can be swapped with something that you would ideally buy, rather than just discarding it. I have long been a passionate advocate for integrating sustainability into our kitchens. Sustainably produced foods are crucial for reducing environmental impact and promoting ethical practices, and they are the cornerstone of value in ingredients from the European Union. EU ingredients truly are More Than Food and bring such authenticity and quality to our plates. While we speak about sustainable cooking and farming practices, it's equally important to be mindful in the kitchen to minimize wastage. My advice to aspiring chefs would be to choose their ingredients wisely, and to not be afraid to experiment in the kitchen. Thumb and Embed Images Courtesy: istock and Instagram/chefguntas",

        "content": "Palestinian Premier and Foreign Minister Mohammad Mustafa revealed that five European countries will soon recognize the Palestinian state. In exclusive statements to Asharq Al-Awsat, he said: “Other important and internationally prominent non-European countries will follow... They will also soon recognize the Palestinian state, and some of them may take several months...” In a telephone interview with Asharq Al-Awsat from Riyadh, the prime minister underlined the importance of Saudi Arabia’s role, stressing that coordination with “the brothers in Saudi Arabia is at the highest level.” “Saudi Arabia has linked any regional peace to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,” Mustafa stated, adding that the Kingdom plays a diplomatic role in pushing for the release of Palestinian funds that are withheld by Israel, and in supporting the government’s plans for the post-war stage. Commenting on the Brussels meeting, during which the Palestinian Prime Minister presented the reform plan with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Quartet office on Palestine, Mustafa noted that all partners have “praised the government’s reform program [...] and the wise policy of President Mahmoud Abbas.” Meanwhile, a European official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the European Union appreciates Saudi Arabia’s efforts with regard to reviving the peace process. Luis Miguel Bueno, the official spokesman for the European Union for the Middle East and North Africa, referred to the meeting in Brussels, on Monday, with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Qatar and the Emirates. Bueno highly valued the Kingdom’s efforts towards ending the war and establishing a “Palestinian state that lives side by side with the State of Israel.” The European official also pointed to intensified diplomatic movements in Brussels, which he said “express a shared vision by the European Union and our Arab partners to move forward towards a two-state solution.” British foreign minister David Cameron said on Tuesday an investigation by the Israeli army into the Rafah air strikes must be \"swift, comprehensive and transparent\", again calling for a pause in fighting. “Deeply distressing scenes following the air strikes in Rafah this weekend,” Cameron said on X, saying the “investigation must be swift, comprehensive and transparent.” “We urgently need a deal to get hostages out and aid in, with a pause in fighting to allow work towards a long-term sustainable ceasefire.” Israeli tanks reached the center of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground operation in the southern Gaza city that has sparked global condemnation. The tanks were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area without commenting on reported advancements into the city center. Overnight, its forces pounded the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing its offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly. Since that strike, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, officials in the enclave run by Hamas militants said. Israeli tanks pushed towards western neighborhoods and took positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah in one of the worst nights of bombardment reported by residents. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area. Witnesses in Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armored vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate response. Since Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the edges of Rafah and entered some of its eastern districts but had not yet entered the city in full force. Reacting to Sunday night's attack in a camp where families displaced from assaults elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, global leaders urged the implementation of a World Court order to halt Israel's assault. Residents said the Tel Al-Sultan area, the scene of Sunday's deadly strike, was still being heavily bombarded. \"Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,\" one resident told Reuters over a chat app. Around one million people have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday. Israel has kept up attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. Spain, Ireland and Norway will officially recognize a Palestinian state on Tuesday, despite an angry reaction from Israel, which has found itself increasingly isolated after more than seven months of conflict in Gaza. The three nations have painted their decision as a way to speed efforts to secure a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas. More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. Around one million people have fled the Gazan city of Rafah in the past three weeks, the United Nations Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) said on Tuesday. The small city on the southern edge of the Gaza Strip had been sheltering more than a million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults on other parts of the enclave. Since early May, Israel's military has been carrying out what it says is a limited operation in Rafah to kill fighters and dismantle infrastructure used by Hamas, which runs Gaza. It has told civilians to go to an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" some 20 km (12 miles) away. Many Palestinians have complained they are vulnerable to Israeli attacks wherever they go and have been moving up and down the Gaza Strip in the past few months. UNRWA said the flight from Rafah \"happened with nowhere safe to go and amidst bombardments, lack of food and water, piles of waste and unsuitable living conditions.\" Providing assistance and protection is becoming nearly \"impossible\", the agency said. Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a ceasefire in Gaza. He called for a permanent ceasefire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the movement seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two-state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied. The Israeli army said it kicked off a series of new security measures in the northern Israeli towns after carrying out a drill simulating a ground offensive in Lebanon. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group had intensified its attacks on Israel in response to the latter’s Monday strike that targeted a hospital entrance in south Lebanon killing one person. In recent weeks, the Israeli army carried out a drill simulating a ground offensive on Lebanon. The Israeli army spokesperson said the “exercise simulated combat scenarios in the northern arena, the rapid deployment of forces on the ground, the functioning of the division and brigade headquarters and the readiness of the forces for an attack”. Israel’s announcement comes amid new strict measures imposed in Israeli settlements and northern towns. News agencies have displayed images showing cement barriers placed as roadblocks in northern Israel. An Israeli newspaper also reported that the army decided to trim down its alert units in the northern towns, a decision that drew criticisms from Israeli officers. An order was also issued to close an Israeli settlement, and entry banned even for Israeli soldiers. The new measures triggered concern among the town residents, amid mass destruction of buildings estimated by Israel’s i24 News at 930 buildings destroyed by Hezbollah strikes. On Sunday, Hezbollah heavily shelled the town of Kiryat Shmona. The town’s municipal chief was quoted as saying that over 40 percent of the town’s fleeing residents have no plans of returning back. “We expect the number to rise”, he said. Hezbollah, in a wide-scale offensive, carried out 15 military operations on Sunday against Israeli targets in response to the latters’ successive attacks targeting people on motorcycles in Lebanese border towns. An Israeli strike on Monday outside a hospital in south Lebanon killed one person at the hospital entrance. He was heading for medical tests. Fifteen other people sustained varying injuries, including seven civilians and eight health care workers at Salah Ghandour Hospital in the city of Bint Jbeil. The hospital security guard, Hassan Jouni, underwent surgery due to severe injuries. For the first time since the hostilities began in the southern Lebanon border area, the Israeli army targeted the vicinity of a hospital on Monday morning. The Israeli military has increased its efforts in recent days to apprehend individuals using cars or motorcycles on the roads, resulting in the fatalities of Hezbollah members and civilians. The Lebanese Ministry of Health condemned the brutal Israeli shelling that targeted the hospital. Hezbollah retaliated against the Israeli assault on the hospital by “targeting and destroying the newly installed spy equipment at the Miskaf Am site.” The Israeli military said that it bombed a building where Hezbollah members were located in the Yaron border area on Sunday. Additionally, the air force targeted Hezbollah members in Hula, hitting a weapons storage facility in Mays Al-Jabal and military infrastructure in Khiam. The Israeli raid on the town of Yaron led to casualties. Two Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants were attacked in Baghdad over the past 48 hours, causing damage but no injuries, and Iraqi security forces arrested some suspects, the interior ministry and police sources said on Monday. Initial investigations showed that the restaurants were targeted over the perceived support of US-based brands for Israel amid the war in the Gaza Strip, police sources said. The first attack took place early on Sunday when two men on a motorcycle threw a make-shift bomb at a branch of the American fried chicken chain restaurant in eastern Baghdad's Palestine Street, causing minor damage, police sources said. On Monday, another KFC Baghdad branch and a second American-style restaurant were attacked by group of masked men who broke into the restaurants and used sticks to smash glass and destroy furniture. They fled before the arrival of security forces, police sources said. KFC did not immediately comment on the attacks. The interior ministry did not elaborate on the motives behind the attacks and said a police commander and other officers responsible for the areas where the attacks occurred had been detained and faced punitive measures. Western brands have been hit by boycotts and other forms of protest by a largely spontaneous, grassroots campaign over Israel's military offensive in the Gaza Strip since the deadly Hamas attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7. The actions reflect a groundswell of anger over Israel's military operation that has killed more than 35,000 people in Gaza, according to health authorities there, and caused a humanitarian crisis. The Biden administration told Israel to take every precaution to protect civilians after a military strike in Rafah killed dozens of Palestinians, as it faced calls from some fellow Democrats to halt military shipments to Israel. \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians. Biden has faced increasing pressure from within his own party to scale back support for Israel, even before the airstrike on Sunday night that set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze in a Rafah camp, killing 45 people. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent Democratic lawmaker in the House of Representatives, on Monday called the strike \"an indefensible atrocity\", adding in a social media post that \"it is long past time for the President to live up to his word and suspend military aid.\" \"Horrific and gut wrenching images coming out of Rafah last night,\" Representative Ayanna Pressley said in a social media post. \"How much longer will the US stand by while the Israeli military slaughters and mutilates Palestinian babies?\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American serving in Congress, called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a \"genocidal maniac\". Netanyahu on Monday said the strike was not intended to cause civilian casualties but went \"tragically wrong.\" The NSC spokesperson said the US government was \"actively engaging\" with the Israeli military and others on the ground to assess what happened. Almost half of Democratic voters disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war, according to a recent poll from Reuters/Ipsos. Weeks of campus protests about the war have added to the pressure, and wider demands for a permanent ceasefire have put Biden's reelection campaign on the defensive. An Israeli strike targeting a motorcycle in southern Lebanon hit next to a hospital entrance Monday, killing the motorcycle driver and a hospital security guard and wounding several civilians nearby, local health officials said. It was not immediately clear who the driver was or why he was targeted in the strike in the town of Bint Jbeil. The Israeli army did not give a statement on the strike but said it had targeted other areas of southern Lebanon in response to “terrorist launches.” The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been exchanging strikes with Israeli forces in the border area almost daily since Oct. 8, a day after the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began. Mohammed Suleiman, director of the Salah Ghandour Hospital in Bint Jbeil, said they had initially received one person killed and nine wounded in the strike, most of whom were “civilians who were in front of the hospital, where family members and people accompanying the patients usually gather.” Hospital officials later said that a security guard who was wounded in the strike had died. The strike also caused minor damage to the hospital, an Associated Press photographer at the scene said. Hezbollah later said it had launched a barrage of dozens of missiles at Meron, Safsufa and Kiryat Shmona in northern Israel in response. Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 people in Lebanon since the war in Gaza began, most of them militants with Hezbollah and allied groups but also including more than 70 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, strikes from Lebanon have killed 15 soldiers and 10 civilians. The clashes have displaced tens of thousands on each side of the border. Israeli officials have said they may launch an offensive in Lebanon if no diplomatic solution is reached that would allow the displaced to return. The Israeli military said Monday that its reservists had in recent weeks “conducted a division-level and brigade-level exercise that simulated ground operations in Lebanon.\" Hezbollah legislator Hassan Fadlallah, who visited the site of the strike in Bint Jbeil, said that Israel “will not be able to return settlers (residents) to the north in this way.” “The only way to stop everything that is happening in the region today and on the border with Lebanon is to stop the aggression against Gaza,” he said. Western countries, in particular the US and France, have come forward with a series of proposals for a cessation of hostilities on the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has refused to enter into an agreement until a ceasefire is implemented in Gaza. Initially, the proposals stipulated that Hezbollah would move its forces several kilometers away from the border, but a French diplomatic official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing negotiations said the latest proposal has abandoned this idea as Hezbollah would not agree to it unless Israel also halted its overflights in Lebanese airspace. Instead, the new proposal would rely on a strengthened presence of the official Lebanese army and UNIFIL peacekeeping forces in southern Lebanon to enforce the cessation of hostilities, with a long-term aim of negotiations for demarcation of the land border between Lebanon and Israel. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was expected to arrive in Beirut on a diplomatic visit Tuesday. The members of the Ministerial Committee assigned by the Joint Arab-Islamic Extraordinary Summit met in Brussels on Monday with European Union Foreign Affairs Council to discuss the war on Gaza. Chaired by Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Faisal bin Farhan bin Abdullah, the committee included Qatari Prime Minister and FM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Jordan's Deputy PM and FM Dr. Ayman Al-Safadi, and Egyptian FM Sameh Shoukry. They discussed the dangerous developments in Gaza and the Israel’s ongoing military operation that is claiming the lives of innocent civilians, including the recent “appalling targeting of the tents of displaced Palestinians near the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA)” in Rafah. The Ministerial Committee “stressed the need for the international community to fulfill its responsibility to intervene immediately to stop the massacres committed by the Israeli forces and to stop the deepening of the unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are experiencing.” It reiterated the importance of creating serious political conditions for the establishment of a Palestinian state according to the 1967 border with East Jerusalem as its capital, and in line with the relevant international resolutions. It expressed its rejection of “discussing the future of the Gaza Strip in isolation from the Palestinian issue.” It called for “confronting all flagrant violations committed by the Israeli forces against the Palestinian people” and stressed the importance of holding the Israel accountable for the ongoing violations in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The European Union pledged more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) on Monday to support displaced Syrians, but it dismissed any notion of them being able to return home because of instability under Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Before an EU-led donor conference on the 13-year-old war, Jordan's foreign minister said that the international community was abandoning Syrian refugees as funding to support them in host countries dwindles, suggesting that ways had to be found to ease voluntary returns to Syria. The EU conference aims to keep the war on the agenda, as well as support for the millions of refugees it has created. But as the economic and social burden on neighboring countries mounts the bloc is divided and unable to find solutions, diplomats say. Refugees returning home is not yet one of them however, the bloc's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell made clear at the start of the conference. \"While the European Union would wish that returning home could be a realistic option for all refugees, everywhere and always, we concur with the United Nations system that currently the conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified returns to Syria are not in place,\" Borrell said. \"We insist that it is the Assad regime that bears the primary responsibility for putting in place these conditions.\" Borrell said the bloc was pledging 560 million euros in 2024 and 2025 to support refugees in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan and a further 1 billion euros for Türkiye. Syria has become a forgotten crisis that nobody wants to stir, amid the Israeli war in Gaza and tensions growing between Iran and Western powers over its regional activities. Although Assad has long since reasserted control over most of Syria in a war that began with a 2011 uprising against him, more than 5 million refugees mostly in Lebanon, Türkiye and Jordan and millions more displaced internally still have little prospect of returning home. \"We're going to be sending a very clear message from Jordan as a host country that we feel that refugees are being abandoned,\" Ayman Safadi told reporters on arrival in Brussels. \"Host countries are being abandoned.\" Jordan is hosting around 1.3 million Syrians. Safadi said the issue \"can only be solved by them going back to their country. So, we need to focus more on creating conditions conducive for them to return voluntarily.\" Funding to support refugees is dropping with the likes of the World Food Program reducing its aid. Countries say hosting refugees is an increasing burden, notably in economic crisis-hit Lebanon, where the discontent has seen forced deportations. \"We expect our partners to uphold international law, including the principle of non-refoulement, and reject and condemn any forced deportations,\" Borrell said. The 8th Syria conference brings together European and Arab ministers along with key international organizations, but beyond vague promises and financial pledges there are few signs that Europe can take the lead, diplomats said. The bloc has no ties with the Assad government and Monday's talks come just ahead of the European elections on June 6-9 in which migration is a divisive issue among the EU's 27 member states. With far-right and populist parties already expected to do well, there is little appetite to step up refugee support. An upswing in migrant boat arrivals from Lebanon to Europe, with Cyprus and Italy major destinations, has prompted some EU countries to warn of a big new influx into the bloc. \"We'll continue to do everything we can. But unless we're helped, unless the international community shoulders its responsibility, there will be a decrease in services and there will be more suffering for refugees,\" Safadi said.",

        "content": "Torrential rains brought by Cyclone Remal have caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's state of Mizoram, killing 15 people and trapping seven, while eight more died in landslides and other accidents elsewhere in the remote region, officials say. / (min cost $ 0 ) or signup to continue reading Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, when it killed at least 16 and cut power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh. But harsh weather was hampering efforts on Tuesday to rescue at least seven people trapped in the quarry on the outskirts of Aizawl, the capital of northeastern Mizoram, disaster management officials said. \"There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse,\" one of them told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. Seven more people were killed in landslides in Mizoram, which shares a border with Bangladesh, while a falling tree killed one person in nearby Assam, officials said, as schools and colleges shut. Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees. Remal is the first of the frequent storms expected to pound the low-lying coasts of the South Asian neighbours in 2024 as climate change drives up sea surface temperatures. Many parts of coastal Bangladesh have no electricity and telecommunication links, officials said, but crews were working to restore power as soon as possible. \"Mass evacuations significantly reduced potential casualties, but the storm left a trail of destruction,\" said disaster management chief Mijanur Rahman, adding that damages cannot be fully estimated unless communications are restored.

        "description": "An examination of the football vision of John Textor who has said he would like to buy Everton",
        "content": "With 777 Partners’ proposed acquisition of Everton now unlikely to happen it has been reported that John Textor is now pushing to buy the club. But what is the strategy of the current Crystal Palace part-owner? announced on September 15 that had signed an agreement with majority shareholder to acquire his entire 94.1% stake in the club and that closing of the transaction was expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, over eight months on, the Miami-based private investment firm, who have been dogged by payment issues at clubs they do own (Standard Liege in Belgium and Vasco da Gama in Brazil) and hit by legal challenges, have still yet to be given the green light on the purchase by the five members of the board. The technicalities look set to end on May 31, , with the 777 deal now looking dead in the water and there seems little appetite for and company among Everton’s supporters – the Fan Advisory Board questioned the suitability of 777 in a virtual meeting with Moshiri, who was not in the UK, last week. Sky Sports claims that Textor, who holds a 45% stake in Crystal Palace, is now the front-runner to acquire Moshiri’s majority shareholding and it is likely that an agreement with the MSP Sports Capital group, who have already invested in Everton, and Moshiri would fund the club short-term until Textor is in a position to complete his purchase. Textor doesn’t often speak publicly but three months ago the published which gave an insight into some of his thoughts on football ownership. Like 777 Partners, Textor is a multi-club owner and he believes that requires lots of joined-up thinking. He said: “I don't see acquisitions as the business model. What we do, my job - and I'm not a football guy - I watch hundreds of games a year from the grass and on film. “My job is to force loving collaboration on all our people. If my scout in Brazil is not really close with my scout in France, then I have the wrong scouts. “We're a very scout-centric organisation. We use data to help break down games and players who we want to go see. “I want eyes on the grass, on the ball, on the boy. We think a global footprint of talent can compete with unlimited money. “Why does everybody say that the City Football Group is the best multi-club model out there? They're not. Man City is the best football team out there, with an incredible management team, incredible people, but they struggle like everyone else. “They are wonderful people, they're a great organisation. People say they're the best multi-club model out there because they're Manchester City. And I'm Molenbeek, Crystal Palace and Lyon. “We probably have done more collaboration between our clubs. I was able to bring in incredible reinforcements in the January transfer window [to injury-hit Belgian club Molenbeek] from Crystal Palace, from Lyon and from Botafogo and we might just survive.” , Textor proclaimed: “Everton represents the best of English football: the struggles, the glory, the want. I love that it’s out of London. Everybody should want to buy Everton right now.” He had hinted on his plans for the future with what he told the BBC. He said: “No, I don't want to run [Palace] one day. I don't even like running the clubs I have. “I'm a fan, we have good football people in place. One of my favourite people on the planet is Dougie Freedman, everybody knows that. “The only place where I think I would like to see more collaboration is when Palace is struggling with those reserves and struggling with injuries and I have a boat-load of athletes. “I'm in it for the long game. Is there a possibility that if we can't achieve greater collaboration that we would consider selling our interest in Palace? It's possible. “Would we consider buying more? I think we'd prefer that. “This is a message to the fans again. They have a club where everybody who owns stock wants to own more of it. “Why are they complaining? Look, people deserve to complain when they’re losing games, but generally sometimes they don't want to believe their own eyes.”",

        "content": "The Western Cape Education Department reminds parents to be on the look out for offers from schools starting this week. Parents will have until 14th June to accept offers to place their child in Grade 1 or 8. Be sure to check that your contact details on file with WCED are correct and that you can access the online application portal. Parents who applied for a spot in Grade 1 and Grade 8 at Western Cape schools should know the results of their application this Thursday, 30th May. The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) says that parents who applied should make sure their contact details are correct and that they are able to access the online admissions portal here . Parents will have until 14th June to accept or decline an offer. “If a parent has not confirmed their choice by 14 June 2024, the system will automatically confirm their top-ranked choice of school that has made an offer. All other offers will then be removed, so that those places can be offered to other learners,” the department said in a statement . Should a parent not receive an offer on 30th May, the department encourages them to remain hopeful as once other parents accept offers, other spots will free up as mentioned above. “We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to place every learner whose parents applied on time as quickly as possible,” the Western Cape Education Department said in a statement. From 14th June to 31st July, the department will be filling spaces according to the offers accepted by parents. From 15th June through to the end of the year, WCED will work to place students who aren’t initially placed. Parents who don’t respond by 14th June will see their child placed into the top-ranked school which made an offer. Earlier this month WCED reported that it had received as many as 114 144 applications for placement in Grades 1 and 8 for 2025. The department also says that “The window for Grade R applications and transfer requests for Grades 2 – 7 and 9 – 12 will run from 1 to 16 August 2024.” While much of the attention is currently on the elections, if you’re a parent in the Western Cape who applied for placement, keep an eye on your notifications this week",

        "content": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the country's eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon's shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province's capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor’s residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. \"Even before the typhoon hit, we've transported relief goods in places near the typhoon’s expected path, so they were all ready,” Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago , which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing , flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.

        "content": "North Korea's military satellite launch fails, rocket explodes in Yellow Sea. Analysts suspect Russian assistance in new engine type. North Korea's latest military reconaissance satellite launch ended in failure as the rocket exploded and fell into the Yellow Sea shortly after liftoff. Analysts say it shows progress in the country's space ambitions despite the setback. North Korea said that tried a new “liquid oxygen and petroleum engine” with the rocket which failed during its first stage. Initial analysis suggests issues with the newly developed liquid-fuel rocket motor, though other causes are being investigated, according to the state media. While the rocket remains unnamed and no were released, analysts believe it differs from the Chollima-1 used in previous successful launches. The Chollima-1, which also had explosive test failures, uses hypergolic fuels that ignite on contact and are typically used in North Korea's nuclear missiles, which do not use liquid oxygen due to storage temperature challenges. The new engine type may indicate Russian assistance, as Russia has previously vowed to help North Korea's satellite programme. Liquid oxygen engines, like those developed by Russia, require specialised storage and handling due to extremely low boiling points. The shift to a new engine type might allow North Korea to differentiate its civilian space program from its missile program, which is banned by the UN Security Council. Russian experts have reportedly visited North Korea to aid in this effort, though the specifics of their assistance are unclear. Analysts suggest that with proper data analysis from the failed launch, North Korea could attempt another launch soon.",

All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon’s shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province’s capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor’s residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. “Even before the typhoon hit, we’ve transported relief goods in places near the typhoon’s expected path, so they were all ready,” Marcos said. , which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and , making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, , flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.",

With numerous blockchain networks operating in isolation, each with its own unique features and strengths, the potential for collaboration and innovation has been limited. However, a groundbreaking solution has emerged in the form of crypto bridges, which promise to tear down the walls separating these disparate systems and usher in a new era of interoperability and cross-chain transactions. At their core, crypto bridges are protocols or platforms that enable the seamless transfer of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies, tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), across different blockchain networks. These bridges act as intermediaries, facilitating the movement of value between otherwise incompatible ecosystems, unlocking a world of possibilities for developers, users, and the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry as a whole. The Growing Need for Interoperability As the adoption of blockchain technology continues to accelerate, the need for interoperability has become increasingly apparent. Each blockchain network offers its own unique features, such as scalability, security, privacy, or specialized functionality, catering to diverse use cases and requirements. However, the inability to transfer assets or communicate across these networks has created siloes, hindering the potential for collaboration, liquidity, and innovation. Photo by Art Rachen on Unsplash Imagine a scenario where a user holds Ether (ETH) on the Ethereum network but wants to participate in a lending protocol built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Without a crypto bridge, the user would be forced to sell their ETH, incurring transaction fees and potentially missing out on opportunities. Alternatively, they might have to maintain separate wallets and manage multiple cryptocurrencies, adding complexity and friction to the experience. Crypto bridges like Defi Way solve this problem by enabling the seamless transfer of assets between different blockchain networks, effectively breaking down the barriers that have traditionally existed between these ecosystems. The Mechanics Behind Crypto Bridges At the heart of crypto bridges lies a process known as “wrapping” or “tokenization.” This involves locking the original asset on the source blockchain and minting a corresponding token on the destination blockchain. This wrapped token represents the locked asset and can be used within the destination blockchain’s ecosystem as if it were the original asset. For example, if a user wants to transfer Ether (ETH) from the Ethereum network to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), they can use a crypto bridge to “wrap” their ETH into a tokenized version, such as Wrapped ETH (WETH), that is compatible with the BSC network. This WETH can then be used seamlessly within the BSC ecosystem, allowing the user to participate in decentralized applications (dApps), lending protocols, or liquidity pools on that network. The process of unwrapping the asset involves burning the wrapped token on the destination blockchain and unlocking the original asset on the source blockchain, ensuring the conservation of value and maintaining the integrity of the underlying assets. Trusted and Trustless Crypto Bridges Crypto bridges can be classified into two main categories: trusted bridges and trustless bridges. 1. Trusted Bridges: Trusted bridges rely on a centralized or semi-centralized entity, such as a custodian or a federation of validators, to facilitate the wrapping and unwrapping of assets between blockchains. These bridges require users to trust the custodian or federation to accurately represent the locked assets on the destination blockchain. While trusted bridges offer a more streamlined user experience, they introduce a degree of centralization and counterparty risk. 2. Trustless Bridges: In contrast, trustless bridges operate in a decentralized and trustless manner, leveraging smart contracts and cryptographic techniques to enable cross-chain asset transfers without relying on a central authority. These bridges employ mechanisms like atomic swaps, hash time-locked contracts (HTLCs), or more advanced techniques like zk-rollups or optimistic rollups to ensure the security and integrity of the bridged assets. Trustless bridges are generally considered more secure and align better with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology, but they can be more complex to implement and may have higher transaction costs. Unlocking Opportunities with Crypto Bridges The emergence of crypto bridges has unlocked numerous opportunities and benefits for the blockchain ecosystem, including: 1. Enhanced Liquidity and Capital Efficiency: By enabling the seamless transfer of assets across networks, crypto bridges allow users to tap into liquidity pools and opportunities across multiple blockchains. This increased liquidity and capital efficiency can lead to better pricing, reduced slippage, and more efficient allocation of resources within the DeFi ecosystem. 2. Fostering Collaboration and Innovation: With the ability to move assets across different blockchain networks, developers can leverage the strengths and capabilities of various ecosystems to build more complex and innovative decentralized applications (dApps). This cross-chain collaboration fosters creativity and drives the development of groundbreaking solutions. 3. Improved User Experience: Crypto bridges simplify the process of participating in various blockchain ecosystems, eliminating the need for users to manage multiple wallets and constantly swap between different cryptocurrencies. This streamlined experience can drive greater adoption and accessibility for decentralized applications and services. 4. Diversification and Risk Management: By enabling the transfer of assets across multiple networks, crypto bridges allow users to diversify their holdings and exposure, mitigating the risks associated with being tied to a single ecosystem. This diversification can help users manage their investment portfolios more effectively and hedge against potential risks or volatility in specific networks. Challenges and Considerations While crypto bridges offer significant advantages, they also present certain challenges and considerations that must be addressed: 1. Security Risks: As with any blockchain-based system, security is a paramount concern. Crypto bridges can be potential attack vectors for hackers, as they represent centralized points of failure or vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Rigorous auditing, robust security measures, and ongoing monitoring are crucial to mitigate these risks. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape surrounding crypto bridges and cross-chain asset transfers is still evolving. Varying jurisdictions may have different requirements or restrictions, which could impact the adoption and utilization of these bridges. 3. Scalability and Throughput: As the demand for cross-chain transactions grows, crypto bridges may face scalability challenges, particularly in terms of throughput and transaction processing speed. Ongoing improvements and innovations in blockchain technology will be necessary to address these scalability concerns. 4. Compatibility and Standardization: With multiple blockchain networks and varying protocols, ensuring compatibility and adhering to standards can be challenging for crypto bridge developers. Collaborative efforts and industry-wide standards could help streamline the development and adoption of interoperable solutions. The Future of Crypto Bridges and Blockchain Interoperability As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve and mature, the role of crypto bridges is poised to become increasingly pivotal. With the growing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and the emergence of new blockchain networks and Layer 2 solutions, the need for seamless cross-chain communication and asset transfer will only intensify. Looking ahead, we can expect to see further advancements in crypto bridge technology, with a focus on improving security, scalability, and user experience. Additionally, the development of more robust and standardized protocols for cross-chain communication could pave the way for broader adoption and integration of crypto bridges across various blockchain ecosystems. Moreover, as regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology evolve, we may see clearer guidelines and policies surrounding the operation and governance of crypto bridges, fostering greater transparency and accountability within the industry. Conclusion Crypto bridges represent a transformative innovation in the blockchain space, enabling seamless cross-chain transactions and fostering interoperability between disparate networks. By breaking down siloes and facilitating the flow of value across ecosystems, these bridges unlock new opportunities for decentralized finance, enhance liquidity and capital efficiency, and drive greater adoption of decentralized applications and services. While challenges remain, particularly in terms of security, scalability, and regulatory uncertainty, the potential benefits of crypto bridges are undeniable. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to evolve, these bridges will play a crucial role in shaping the future of decentralized finance and unlocking the full potential of a truly interconnected and interoperable blockchain landscape. The advent of crypto bridges is a testament to the innovative spirit and collaborative efforts within the blockchain community. By unifying the blockchain universe, these bridges pave the way for a future where seamless cross-chain transactions and interoperability are the norm, ushering in a new era of decentralized innovation and empowering individuals and businesses alike to harness the full potential of this groundbreaking technology.

        "content": "viewers were left absolutely horrified and threatening to turn off their TVs after the soap aired some particularly disturbing scenes involving Tom King. Tom has been deceiving everyone into believing that Belle Dingle is the manipulative one in their relationship, but in a shocking twist, it's actually Tom who's been pulling the strings. He's been systematically gaslighting Belle, making her believe she's the one at fault, when in reality, he's the mastermind of manipulation since they tied the knot. In an episode on Monday, 27 May, Belle wrongly blamed herself for their issues, claiming Tom had always treated her with love, Tom grew agitated by her refusal to communicate with him. Desperate to maintain his grip on her, he sought out new ways to exert his control, even when she wasn't physically present. The climax of the episode was too much for many fans to bear as Tom menacingly picked up a syringe and approached their beloved dog Piper, implying he would harm the innocent animal. Viewers were appalled by the scene and quickly expressed their outrage on Twitter. One upset fan tweeted: \"Blimey even a dog isn't safe in that f***ing village # ,\" while another exclaimed: \"no f***ing way is he gonna kill that dog #Emmerdale.\", reports . A third chimed in with: \"NO NOT THE DOG #emmerdale,\" and a fourth commented: \"No! this is too far poor piper leave her alone #Emmerdale.\" Another added: \"this story line is disturbing,\" and yet another viewer said: \"Oh COME ON NOW. This is beyond sick.\" Emmerdale's recent episodes have taken a dark turn, revealing the harrowing truth of Belle Dingle's (played by Eden Taylor-Draper) life with Tom, as viewers witnessed the chilling moment he discovered her lie about contraception and punished her by scalding her hand under hot water. Eden Taylor-Draper, who brings Belle to life on screen, spoke out about the intense scenes, cautioning fans: \"I think you can expect to see everything escalate throughout the episode. You'll see how easily Tom can switch on and off and how he truly feels and his anger towards Belle. You'll get a glimpse into Belle's terrifying reality.\" The actress also discussed the storyline's significance in shedding light on such a traumatic issue, saying: \"People have reached out which I think is a great sign that everything is resonating in some way.\" She continued, expressing gratitude for the opportunity to portray this narrative: \"So many people go through this and I'm really grateful that I've been able to play out Belle's story. We've worked with charities and people that have gone through this and it's important that what we're portraying is real.\"",

        "content": "Manchester City captain Kyle Walker admits he never began his career as a fullback. For many, Walker is now the best fullback City have seen. But he told the club's website of his time as a junior with Sheffield United: I don't know a right-back or a full-back who started off there. I couldn't get a game at centre-forward to be completely honest. I signed my scholarship and there were better centre-forwards than me, even though I went to Lilleshall as a centre-forward at Under-16s. I was a late developer. I didn't grow and I was very light. We played Nottingham Forest and they had a quick winger, but the right-back at the time wasn't playing for one reason or another. The coach put me there and from that day on I have never played another position. At first, I thought why am I not playing centre-forward? Why am I not getting the goals and the glory? But you soon realise it's quite enjoyable. Your role changes in the team and I enjoyed setting people up rather than scoring. I went from getting the odd 10 or 15 minutes in the first four months after I came out of school and into full-time football, to playing every game.\" This article first appeared on Tribal Football and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "A collaborative research team from China and Ukraine has made significant strides in tracking near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), improving our ability to assess potential risks. By conducting regular observations, the team has been able to pinpoint the locations of these asteroids and accurately map their orbits. NEAs are asteroids whose orbits come close to Earth's, posing a potential threat of collision. The necessity for immediate follow-up observations of newly identified NEAs is crucial for quickly determining their orbital elements. Accurate tracking of these rapidly moving objects requires short exposure times during astronomical measurements to prevent elongated streaks in images. Researchers from the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SHAO) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Mykolaiv Astronomical Observatory have developed an innovative technique to address this challenge. The rotating-drift-scan (RDS) charge-coupled device (CCD) technique allows asteroids to be imaged as point sources, even with long exposure times. This advancement is crucial for improving the precision of asteroid tracking . The research leveraged a comprehensive dataset of over 11,000 positional measurements of nearly 500 NEAs. These measurements were captured using two 50-centimetre telescopes located in Xi'an, China, from 2019 to 2023, and in Mykolaiv, Ukraine, from 2011 to 2022. This extensive data collection has been instrumental in refining the tracking and mapping of NEA orbits. A new study published in the Astronomical Journal highlights the potential of this research to revolutionise asteroid detection. By using a network of small telescopes and employing the RDS CCD technique, global monitoring of NEAs can be significantly enhanced. This improvement in detection capabilities is a critical step in protecting Earth from potential asteroid impacts. | Why solar storms impact power grids and when will a solar storm hit Earth next?",

        "description": "Nasa's Magellan data indicates volcanic activity on Venus",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: A recent analysis of data collected by Nasa's Magellan spacecraft between 1990 and 1992 reveals evidence of fresh lava flows on the planet's surface during the spacecraft's observations. The study was published in Nature Astronomy on May 27. Planetary scientist Paul Byrne of Washington University in St Louis, who was not involved in the study said, \"This definitely is another step in the path to understanding Venus as a living, breathing world.\" Despite being similar in size to Earth, Venus was long considered geologically inactive. However, many scientists believed that Venus should have comparable levels of internal heat, which is the primary driver of volcanic activity and earthquakes. The new research follows a similar approach to a study published last year, which identified a volcanic vent changing shape and potentially releasing lava in Magellan data, providing the first conclusive evidence of such activity on Venus. The current study, led by planetary scientist David Sulcanese of D'Annunzio University in Chieti-Pescara, Italy, and his colleagues, searched for signs of volcanism across Venus' vast surface area, which is three times the size of Earth's dry land. Magellan's radar images revealed long, sinuous features appearing between two of the spacecraft's passes over the western slopes of Sif Mons, a large shield volcano, and Niobe Planitia, a flat region dotted with volcanic vents. The researchers considered various explanations for these features, such as artifacts in the radar data or the result of landslides. However, the features followed the local topography, indicating that they were indeed flowing across Venus' surface, and they occurred in relatively flat areas where landslides would be unlikely. Byrne believes that the study authors have convincingly demonstrated that the changes in the surface appearance in these two instances are best explained by the presence of lava flows. He suggests that there may be many more instances of active volcanism waiting to be discovered, given the low resolution of Magellan's data and the immense land area of Venus. Both Byrne and the study authors agree that Venus could currently have a level of volcanic activity comparable to that of Earth. Future NASA missions, such as DAVINCI and VERITAS, scheduled to launch next decade, will provide more detailed maps of the Venusian surface, making it easier to identify signs of ongoing volcanic activity.",

        "content": "Israel’s deadly attack on a refugee camp in southern Gaza, which reportedly resulted in 45 deaths and 249 injuries, has sparked widespread international reactions. The Israeli Prime Minister called it a “tragic mistake,” while the country’s Foreign Ministry warned its embassies about a “strong wave of anti-Semitism.” The Palestinian Health Ministry reported that the Israeli airstrike on a refugee camp in southern Gaza killed at least 45 civilians, including 23 women, children, and elderly people, and injured 249 other civilians. This attack has led to widespread reactions. In response to the global backlash, Benjamin Netanyahu said, “Unfortunately, something tragically went wrong.” The European Union’s foreign policy chief expressed his shock upon hearing the news in his initial reaction. Meanwhile, Axios, citing an American official, reported that the White House is investigating the incident to determine what exactly happened and whether the situation necessitates U.S. action. The identities of the American officials who spoke with Axios are unknown, but the media outlet quoted them saying, “The devastating images following the Israeli military’s Sunday night attack in Rafah... are heartbreaking.” The French President, in a relatively cautious reaction, said that Israel must immediately halt its military operations in Gaza. The Spanish Foreign Minister also stated, “If Israel continues to violate the International Court of Justice’s ruling on stopping the attack on Rafah, we will seek appropriate measures to enforce this decision.” This comes as the Israeli government, led by Netanyahu, faces opposition within Israel for its relentless attacks in Gaza. Netanyahu’s speech in the Israeli parliament was repeatedly interrupted yesterday due to protests. Countries in the region, especially Arab nations, have also reacted to Israel’s attack on the refugee camp in Rafah, calling for an immediate cessation of Israeli military operations in Gaza. In a rare reaction, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused Israel of “terrorism.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. Δ",

        "content": "A Michigan mom was fatally struck by an out-of-control vehicle while heroically saving her two-year-old daughter’s life at a drag racing event on Sunday. Kadie Price, 33, was in the crowd with her family when a 1980 Jeep CJ lost control and veered off the racing strip before slamming into another vehicle, police said. The other vehicle, which had been stationary at the time of impact, struck Price as a result — just seconds after she had pushed her daughter to safety. Chaos ensued at Silver Lake State Park Sand Dunes in western Oceana County — about 270 miles northwest of Detroit, MLive.com reported . Despite several people rushing over to offer immediate care to Price, including Silver Lake State Park rangers, they were ultimately unable to save her. Price was pronounced dead shortly after she was struck just before midday. Her daughter was able to avoid “serious injury or worse,” police said, as a result of her mom’s quick-thinking. “Please keep the Price family in your prayers,” the Oceana County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. The driver of the Jeep is being identified as a 64-year-old man who hails from Michigan. His name is not being released at this time as the investigation is ongoing. Two off-roaders who took part in Sunday’s race have since detailed the horrific incident. “I’ve been coming out here a long time,” Bryce Straubel told WOOD . “That was probably one of them most brutal accidents I’ve ever seen.” “It breaks me,” Straubel added. “People are coming out here to have a good time and this mother just lost her life. She pushed her daughter out of the way to save her — it’s just rough to hear. It really is.” The Silver Lake State Park is a 3,000-acre park runs along the shorelines of Lake Michigan. It contained about 2,000 acres of san dunes.",

        "content": "Aizawl: Twelve people died, and several others were missing as a stone quarry collapsed in Mizoram’s Aizawl district on Tuesday morning amid incessant rains as an impact of cyclone Remal, officials said. The incident happened around 6 am in an area between Melthum and Hlimen on the southern outskirts of the Aizawl town, they said. “Twelve bodies have been recovered so far, while several others are suspected to be still trapped under the debris,” Aizawl’s Deputy Commissioner Nazuk Kumar told PTI. “We are looking for more bodies. The operations will continue till we clear the entire site,” she added. Director-General of Police (DGP) Anil Shukla told PTI that heavy rains were affecting the rescue operations at the disaster site. He said the rains triggered landslides at several other places in the state and at least two persons have been “swept away”. Among the victims of the stone quarry collapse are a four-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl, another police officer said. “We have also rescued two persons alive from the site,” he said. A landslide swept away a building in Aizawl’s Salem Veng, following which three persons went missing. Search is underway for them, an official said. The state capital has been cut off from the rest of the country due to a landslide on National Highway 6 at Hunthar, officials said. Besides, several intra-state highways have also been disrupted by landslides, they said. Chief Minister Lalduhoma announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia for the families of those killed in calamities caused by rains, including the quarry collapse. He handed over cheques of Rs 2 lakh each to the families of the eight Mizo people who died in the quarry collapse and said the remaining amount would be given to them soon. Home Minister K Sapdanga told PTI, “The identities of the four non-tribal people are being verified. If they are permanent residents of Mizoram, they will be given the ex-gratia amount. If they came here temporarily to work, then they will not get any financial support.” Lalduhoma said the government has earmarked Rs 15 crore to tackle disasters triggered by rains, which occurred as an aftereffect of cyclone Remal. Later, Lalduhoma along with Sapdanga, who also handles the Disaster Management and Rehabilitation Department, visited the stone quarry site to take stock of the situation and oversee the orescue operations. Because of the rains, all schools were closed and government employees, except those involved in providing essential services, were asked to work from home. Meanwhile, more than 30 families were shifted to safer places due to unprecedented flooding of the Tlawng river at Sairang village, about 21 km from Aizawl, a senior official said. “Several farms on the bank of the river have been fully submerged by the water. The water level is continuing to rise. However, no casualty has been reported,” he added. In Aizawl town, some cemeteries have also been swept away by landslides, and over 150 graves damaged.",

        "description": "A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday.",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines — A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the country's eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon's shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province's capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor's residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. \"Even before the typhoon hit, we've transported relief goods in places near the typhoon's expected path, so they were all ready,'' Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago, which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.",

        "content": "The talented young Frenchman has shone at Selhurst Park and clearly seems ready to make the step up to a bigger club, with key figures clearly eager for him to make the move to Stamford Bridge. According to Phillips, Shields is driving this and pushing for the Blues to sign Olise, who has a £60m release clause at Palace, and who is also wanted by Man Utd. The report adds that Olise came very close to joining Chelsea last summer, so it could still be that they will be able to lure him to the club this year, in what could be a vital move for the west Londoners to bring in a much-needed upgrade on the likes of Mykhailo Mudryk, Raheem Sterling and Noni Madueke. Olise transfer: Should he choose Chelsea or Man United? Chelsea and United are two of the biggest clubs in England, and indeed Europe, so it might not be the easiest choice for Olise if it comes down to a decision between those two. Still, even if MUFC just won the FA Cup final, there clearly seems to be a more promising project being put together at CFC, especially once they finalise a deal to . The Red Devils are surely at an earlier stage of their project due to the recent change in ownership and new arrivals at board level, so that could likely mean a change of manager in the near future, as well as numerous ins and outs in the transfer market. Olise would do well to take these things into consideration when choosing his next move, though in truth he’ll perhaps be hoping the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City or Liverpool join the race as they’d likely be much better moves for him at this stage!",

        "content": "The management of Ebonyi State University, Abakiliki, has broken its silence on the death of a final-year student of the institution, Favour Ugwuka. Naija News reported that Favour, a student of the Department of English, committed suicide in her hostel at the Ishieke Campus of the university in Abakaliki, the state capital. Favour reportedly passed all her courses but repeatedly failed a particular course, whose lecturer had vowed she would never pass. The mother of the deceased blamed the lecturer for making her daughter commit suicide. Reacting, the accused lecturer in the Department of English Language, Professor Amechi Enyi, during an interview with journalists in Abakaliki last Friday, revealed that the late student merely copied down three examination questions. The lecturer stated that it was incorrect to claim that her death was related to academic activities. Addressing journalists on Monday at the institution’s conference room, the Vice Chancellor, Professor Chigozie Ogbu, dismissed the deceased’s claims that the accused lecturer was behind her failure. Ogbu stated that the certified true copy of Ugwuka Favour Chinonye’s results, with the registration number EBSU/2018/89726 for the Department of English Language and Literature, was registered in 2018/2019, which is her first year. According to him, Favour offered 9 courses in her first year, out of which she failed 3 and had a CGP of 1.78. In the second semester of her first year, she took 8 courses, out of which she failed 2 and had a CGP of 1.75, thereby having a sessional CGP of 1.76. The Vice Chancellor further revealed Ugwuka’s academic performance in subsequent years, concluding that she had outstanding courses, including ENG 416, which she failed twice. He said, “When a student is confident that a lecturer has deliberately marked them down, and they are sure that they passed the exam, what the student does is to complain to the HOD or Dean and request re-marking, which will be sent to the Vice Chancellor’s office. “It is usually sent to another university to re-mark and let us know. Some of them, on very rare occasions, have returned positive, and whatever the student gets here is usually what they get from the other university after re-marking, and that is the process. “If at the last exam, the late student felt that she was marked down by the lecturer, she would have complained to the Dean and asked for re-marking, and the paper would have been sent to another place for re-marking. ‘But from what is seen, it’s not that the student deserves to pass, and she didn’t pass. And from the record, you will find out that this is not the only course that she didn’t pass. “In 2019/2020, which is her 2nd year, she registered a total of 10 courses. Out of the courses, she was absent in 2 courses: Intermediate English Composition (ENG 215) and Philosophy and Logic (GST 102). She was absent in the 2 courses out of the 8 she wrote, she failed 2. She had a GP of 1.41 in that 1st semester. In her 2nd semester, she registered 10 courses. Out of the 10 courses, she failed 4 and had a CGP of 1.82. Total CGP in her 2nd year is 1.62.”",

        "content": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — A weak cold front will approach the area today helping to increase our rain chances ever so slightly. A few isolated showers will be possible north of I-4 late in the morning along with a few showers developing along I-75 and quickly pushing inland through the early afternoon hours. Most of the rain moves over to the east coast this evening. It will still be warm and very muggy through the day with highs in the low 90s and feels like temperatures close to the triple digits. Although this is a cold front, it is not going to drop our temperatures but it will bring us lower humidity for Wednesday and Thursday. Temperatures will be hotter though with highs in the mid and upper 90s both Wednesday and Thursday. Rain chances will come down back to a 10 and 20% each day through the weekend.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email t the start of a new school year, you are standing in front of your closet and thinking about what to wear. As you assess your options, one thing becomes clear – it’s time for a fresh pair of shoes to kick off the school year in style. Whether boys school shoes or girl’s school shoes, buying new shoes for the school year offers numerous benefits beyond just fashion. In this article, you will explore five compelling reasons why investing in new shoes for the school year is a smart choice. 1. Outgrown Shoes Your feet can grow quickly, especially during growth spurts. Wearing shoes that are too small can be uncomfortable and even harmful to your feet. Check if your toes feel cramped or if your heels slip out of your shoes when walking. If your shoes feel tight or uncomfortable, it’s time for a new pair that fits properly. Getting shoes that fit ensures your feet have enough room to grow and stay healthy throughout the school year. 2. Increased Activity Levels As the school year starts, you might find yourself getting more active with sports, games, and other activities. Wearing proper shoes is essential to keep up with your increased activity levels. Athletic shoes provide support and cushioning to help prevent injuries and keep you comfortable during physical activities. Look for shoes designed for the specific sports or activities you’ll be participating in. Whether it’s running, basketball, or dancing, having the right shoes can enhance your performance and enjoyment while staying active. 3. Fashion and Self-Expression Your shoes are a way to show off your unique taste and sense of fashion. Whether you prefer sneakers, boots, or loafers, there are endless options to choose from to match your style. Look for shoes in colors or patterns that reflect your personality and make you feel confident. Expressing yourself through your footwear adds a fun and personal touch to your school wardrobe. 4. Durability and Longevity Over time, shoes can wear out and lose their support and cushioning, especially if you wear them every day. Investing in high-quality shoes made from durable materials ensures they last longer and provide better protection for your feet. Look for shoes with sturdy construction and quality materials that can withstand the demands of school life. Choosing durable shoes saves you money in the long run by reducing the need for frequent replacements. 5. Support Local Businesses Local shoe stores provide personalized service and unique selections that you might not find in big chain stores. By shopping locally, you’re helping to support your community and the local economy. Plus, you might discover hidden gems and new favorite brands that you wouldn’t have found otherwise. Prioritize Your Footwear for a Successful School Year As you gear up for the new school year, don’t overlook the importance of prioritizing your footwear. From ensuring proper fit and support to expressing your personal style, the shoes you choose play a significant role in your comfort, confidence, and overall well-being. So, take the time to select footwear that not only feels great but also reflects your unique personality and style.

        "content": "Parenthood didn't come easy for Kourtney Kardashian. The reality TV star and her husband Travis Barker welcomed her baby boy Rocky six months ago. She was going through IVF in a desperate bid to become a mother, documenting her struggles on social media and on their show on Disney Plus and Hulu. The Poosh founder has now opened up about the ordeal in more detail, telling followers she went through five failed IVF cycles and three egg retrievals, all before conceiving her son naturally, welcoming their first child together last November.

READ MORE: Kourtney Kardashian's rarely seen son Mason, 14, joins Instagram and fans all say the same thing Kourtney detailed having five rounds of IVF ( Image: kourtneykardash/Instagram) She opened up about her pregnancy on social media ( Image: kourtneykardash /Instagram) Answering questions in an Instagram Q&A, one fan had asked Kourtney how to find the \"strength to keep going\" despite her pregnancy problems. In a candid response, she replied: \"I stopped after a year of trying (5 failed IVF cycles, 3 retrievals).\" She added: \"My body relaxed and I believed in God’s plan for my life. Lots of prayers for whatever was meant to be for us. Also lots of optimizing my health.\" Kourtney provided more words of wisdom for the follower, who said they'd gone through six rounds of IVF. \"I know how hard it is to feel like you're not trying, but believing in God's plan and saying your prayers is so powerful. All the best,\" she added. Kourtney's pregnancy journey has played out across different seasons of The Kardashians, from start to finish. They mentioned they were trying to conceive during season one, detailing some of the strange ways Kourtney was attempting to get pregnant. In season one, she said her doctor suggested she drink the Blink-182 drummer's semen, four times a week. In December 2022, the pair revealed they were stopping IVF and planned to conceive naturally, with the couple revealing their happy news at a Blink-182 concert in Los Angeles last June – she gave birth after an urgent fetal surgery in September. Rocky joins Kourtney's three kids shared with Scott Disick; Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9. Travis shares kids Landon, 20, and Alabama, 18, with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.

        "description": "Esteban Ocon incurred the wrath of Alpine F1 boss Bruno Famin at the Monaco Grand Prix by causing a collision with team-mate Pierre Gasly with a brainless move on the first lap",
        "content": "Last May, Esteban Ocon stood on the Monaco Grand Prix podium at the end of one of the very best race weekends of his Formula 1 career. Twelve months on, after Sunday's race in Monte Carlo, his future with Alpine - perhaps in F1 altogether - looks to be in doubt. For more than a year, the threat of civil war at the French team never materialised into anything, but the touchpaper was well and truly lit in Monaco. Only Ocon knows what possessed him as he lunged up the inside of team-mate Pierre Gasly at Portier on the first lap of the race. They made contact which nearly flipped Ocon's car, and sparked a furious tirade from his fellow Frenchman over the radio. He also picked up a time penalty which, because the damage to his own car forced him to retire from the race, was converted instead into a five-place grid drop for the next race in Canada. But it remains to be seen whether he will even be on the Montreal grid. Mercedes 'won't tolerate' F1 star 'attacking' his team-mate as Lewis Hamilton seat ruled out Charles Leclerc made X-rated admission moments after emotional Monaco GP win If Gasly was angry, team principal Bruno Famin was beside himself. He described Ocon's botched overtake as an \"attack\" on his team-mate and warned that there will be \"consequences\" for the 27-year-old. It remains to be seen what those consequences will be. Ocon apologised to Famin and Gasly in private and said sorry in public as well, taking full responsibility for his actions - but still it seems to be a real possibility that he could be replaced in Canada. Such a punishment is extremely rare in F1 and Alpine will need to be absolutely sure of themselves before pulling the trigger on such a drastic measure, not least because of the potential legal minefield that it could produce. F1 driver contracts are so complicated these days that it would be daft to assume what clauses do and don't exist in each person's deal. But the team's lawyers will have to comb the fine print and make sure it is legally possible for them to force Ocon to sit out as a punishment. And even if it is, Ocon is not likely to react well to being benched. Tensions are high at Alpine right now and those involved would do well to take a breath and not make any rash decisions in response to this incident, for risk of making things infinitely worse for a team that is already in turmoil. Things may be worse for Ocon in the long-term, though. His Alpine contract is up at the end of the year and, though he is a candidate for the seats at Mercedes and the new Audi F1 project, those prospective new employers aren't likely to be impressed with the sort of driving he demonstrated in Monaco.

        "content": "A sessions court in Mumbai on Tuesday sentenced two former staffers of a salon chain to life imprisonment in the 2018 Kirti Vyas murder case. The body of the 28-year-old Kirti Vyas has not been found yet. The quantum of sentence of two convicts in the Kirti Vyas murder case was announced on Tuesday. In the hearing on Monday, the two were found guilty in Kirti Vyas murder case. ADVERTISEMENT Reports stated that Additional Sessions Judge MG Deshpande on Monday had held the convicts--Siddhesh Tamhankar and Khushi Sahjwani, his accomplice--guilty under various sections of the Indian Penal Code including 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence). Tamhankar and Sahjwani, who worked as account executives and managers at an Andheri salon chain, reported to Vyas, the financial manager, the investigation states. Vyas was allegedly killed after writing a memo to one of the accused about poor performance. Vyas disappeared on March 16, 2018. Her relatives reported her missing to the DB Marg police station after they were unable to locate her using CCTV footage from Grant Road and Mumbai Central railway stations. Vyas was last seen boarding the Virar-bound train at 9:11 am from Grant Road in Andheri, according to the report. According to the PTI report, the Kirti Vyas murder case was later handed to the Crime Branch, which nabbed Tamhankar and Sahjwani. Police solved the case by conducting DNA testing on blood recovered in a car related to one of the defendants and allegedly used in the Kirti Vyas murder case.",

        "content": "A typhoon has finally moved away from the Philippines, leaving at least seven people dead, mostly due to floods or toppled trees, and forcing the closures of several seaports, stranding thousands of passengers, officials said Tuesday. Typhoon Ewiniar crept by the country’s eastern coast late Friday night and lingered over the Philippine islands for several days, before shifting northeastward away from the archipelago. All storm warnings were lifted Tuesday. The typhoon’s shift in direction spared the densely populated capital, Manila, from a potentially damaging hit. Ewiniar, locally known as Aghon, was last tracked Tuesday about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of the northern town of Basco in Batanes province with sustained winds of 130 kph (81 mph) and gusts of up to 160 kph (99 mph), according to government forecasters. At least six villagers drowned in floodwaters or died after being hit by falling trees during the sudden deluge in the hard-hit province of Quezon, provincial police said. In southern Misamis Oriental province, a villager died when a tree fell and struck a motorcycle taxi she was riding on with her sister as they were on their way to school, police said. Many villages were overwhelmed by flash floods. Some low-lying areas were engulfed in up to eight feet (2.4 meters) of water in Lucena, Quezon province’s capital city. The flooding was partly due to clogged drainage systems after an extra-hot summer season, Quezon Governor Angelina Tan and other provincial officials said. Tan said many houses, including the governor’s residence, were damaged by fierce wind and torrential rains. The typhoon forced her to seek shelter elsewhere while overseeing the distribution of food and other aid to displaced villagers, she said. Before flying to Brunei on Tuesday for a state visit, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said more than 26,700 people were affected by the typhoon, including many who fled to evacuation centers in five provincial regions. Three airports and 29 seaports could not operate normally due to the typhoon while six cities and towns were hit by power outages, he said. More than 4,800 passengers, truck drivers and cargo helpers were stranded at one point due to seaport closures as the typhoon lashed southern and central provinces, the Philippine coast guard said. “Even before the typhoon hit, we’ve transported relief goods in places near the typhoon’s expected path, so they were all ready,” Marcos said. About 20 typhoons and storms each year batter the Philippine archipelago , which also lies in an Asian region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , making it one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest on record, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing , flattened entire villages, swept ships inland and displaced more than 5 million in the central Philippines.",

In late April, then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the Ukrainian Army’s losses stood at almost half a million soldiers at the time. He also said that Russian battlegroups get the better of the enemy along the entire front line, driving Ukrainian troops out of their positions. According to Shoigu, the combat potential of the Russian Army enables it to maintain constant fire on the enemy, preventing them from holding defensive lines. In March, Shoigu announced that the Ukrainian forces had lost more than 71,000 soldiers since the start of the year. { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:410:3072:1639_640x0_80_0_0_291541aaf5a8aa5b8fd38171cd7b7062.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_2237c7bdc15a5cc99fca8c77d0a93800.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_640x0_80_0_0_2237c7bdc15a5cc99fca8c77d0a93800.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_f9dfb8b156ac67f2220d16559ef2532f.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_640x0_80_0_0_f9dfb8b156ac67f2220d16559ef2532f.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_5b02c9aad5740296d0394a08e0ca5a5c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_640x0_80_0_0_5b02c9aad5740296d0394a08e0ca5a5c.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 640, \"height\": 256 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:410:3072:1639_1280x0_80_0_0_3e565560daa6d2f7ffdb85df87f837af.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_e492aa6e5823ba3599e7d9286f6d9535.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_1280x0_80_0_0_e492aa6e5823ba3599e7d9286f6d9535.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_38fd069eb4ba29e96ca97600f69ec20d.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_38fd069eb4ba29e96ca97600f69ec20d.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_604ec85d37234dba1738c657db4a5e21.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_1280x0_80_0_0_604ec85d37234dba1738c657db4a5e21.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1280, \"height\": 512 } { \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:410:3072:1639_1920x0_80_0_0_01ab6275dc966f6d8af90ab1bd58b4b9.jpg\", \"thumbnail\": [ { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_aacd6739ef5c001bfdee558e6438e44c.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_0:160:3072:1888_1920x0_80_0_0_aacd6739ef5c001bfdee558e6438e44c.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_74f799cf267232550aeae15ec47b39bd.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_171:0:2902:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_74f799cf267232550aeae15ec47b39bd.jpg\" }, { \"@type\": \"ImageObject\", \"url\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c436e35cf8c036830f28eb79242367df.jpg\", \"image\": \"https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0f/1117935001_512:0:2560:2048_1920x0_80_0_0_c436e35cf8c036830f28eb79242367df.jpg\" } ], \"width\": 1920, \"height\": 768 } Russia's Special Operation in Ukraine Live Fast, Die Young: West Hints Ukraine Should Mobilize More Youth Amid Major Losses Yesterday, 15:07 GMT",

        "description": "Former This Morning duo Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford never held back on sharing insight into their busy sex life, and one TV stint saw them visit an underground sex cave to keep the fire burning",
        "content": "The 'Richard and Judy' of ITV were notoriously outspoken on screen - and that includes dishing out details about intimacy. Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford sent shockwaves through the showbiz sphere when they announced their separation after 14 years of marriage on Saturday. Eamonn is said to be \"angry\" about the split, which he allegedly claims was \"very much been orchestrated by Ruth\" who was \"determined\" to move on. The duo have reportedly been secretly leading 'separate lives, professional and personally' for two years. Eamonn broke his silence on the sensational split while presenting on GMB this morning, thanking fans for support and cryptically telling viewers 'what a weekend it was' before moving onto discussing the football. Meanwhile, Ruth is taking a break from her Loose Women duties amid the break-up. Eamonn Holmes lets slip struggle with internal turmoil after 'emotional weekend' Friends of the couple claim there are various factors which led to Ruth and Eamonn's marriage falling apart, including Eamonn's reported low moods during his struggles with chronic pain. The star has suffered with crippling health issues for years, and while Ruth has been by his side throughout, caring for him when he struggled with mobility, she previously admitted that Eamonn's injuries had been 'testing' on their marriage. Fractures in their physical spark were seemingly apparent before their public announcement, with the Mail claiming that Eamonn joked to friends about being 'touched' more by his physio than Ruth in recent years. Ruth and Eamonn visited a sex dungeon ( Image: Channel 5) But before their marriage crumbled, the presenting duo were incredibly open about their sizzling sex life, famously treating viewers to cheeky innuendos whenever they had the chance. They even hosted Eamonn & Ruth's 7 Year Itch in 2017 - a show dedicated to injecting spice back into a marriage. And it wasn't for the faint of heart. The mini series saw Ruth and Eamonn visit a sex dungeon - complete with sex swings, a latex-clad dominatrix and whips - in a bid to inspire couples in the bedroom. The Beflast-born presenter got stuck right in as he brandished a whip, surrounded by scary-looking contraptions. He also admired a blow-up sex doll on the show. A woman called Mistress Komakino joined the presenting duo in the underground sex cave to teach them how she helps couples find their spark again. Eamonn told the Mistress to spank a man in a leather bondage mask, but Ruth wasn't so keen as she winced: \"Oh I don't like hurting people!\" Eamonn got stuck in with the toys ( Image: Channel 5) But Ruth has previously revealed what makes her tick. Just months before their split, she revealed the one thing Eamonn would do to ensure he got sex. She told her fellow Loose Women panelists: \"You can have all the compliments and the flowers but then, if Eamonn comes home and has used my car and he goes, 'Filled the petrol up and did your water bottle', I'm like, 'Get upstairs right now'.\" As the studio audience burst into fits of laughter, Ruth continued: \"I hate doing it. Literally, I'll go round with my petrol light on red, the water bottle empty, smeared [windscreen], I'm like, 'Oh I can't stop and do that,' so he'll do it for me and he knows, he knows.\" She added with a smirk: \"Everyone's got their little trick.\" Meanwhile, Eamonn once joked about their active sex life, revealing: \"I love Ruth deeply but also I fancy her. How could I resist? No wonder I look tired all the time - that woman has me run ragged. I go to work for a break.\" And Ruth revealed her husband's unwavering obsession with her figure helped fan the fames in the bedroom. \"Eamonn is my biggest fan and always makes me feel really sexy,\" she once told The Mirror . \"When I think I'm at my slimmest he thinks I'm too thin. He likes me curvy - he loves boobs, bottoms and legs. I'm really lucky because it would be awful to have a man who commented on me piling on the pounds.\" Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather'",

        "content": "On Thursday (23 May) Doncaster Council revealed the details of Gateway One, an office and retail building that was greenlit by the planning committee in January. The site will revolve around digital technology, with hopes to allow Doncaster to progress as a centre of excellence for Artificial Intelligence . Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Doncaster Free Press, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Local AI firm Automatic Analytics will become a founder member of the project, with several other businesses expected to take residence in the building. According to the council, the site’s design will “enable businesses and entrepreneurs to co-locate with other likeminded businesses and industry leaders to collaborate, develop local supply chain opportunities, access local, regional, and national business support provision, and strengthen industry links with education and skills provision.” The £24 million building will be funded by the Town Deal which was granted to the council by central government. Town Deal funding in Doncaster has been earmarked for the council’s Urban Masterplan, which aims to regenerate the city. Advertisement Advertisement Located on Trafford Way, the building will contribute to the transformation of the Gateway area. Trafford Court Offices, Wolseley Plumb Centre and a vacant retail unit will all be demolished to make way for the new site. Office space will span across five floors, with two commercial units on the ground floor which incorporate alfresco dining. An area of public open space will also be incorporated into the scheme, with the site being designed to achieve Net Zero carbon emissions. Advertisement Advertisement Mayor of Doncaster, Ros Jones , said: “Our city is rapidly becoming recognised for its industry expertise around Artificial Intelligence, and I am keen to build this momentum and drive forward our ambition to regenerate our city centre and develop our economy for the 21st century. “This is an exciting time for Doncaster city centre, with work taking place across several key areas and I look forward to seeing businesses across the city and region take advantage of this state-of-the-art facility.” Work is expected to start on the site in early 2025, with completion expected in 2026.",

        "content": "Max Verstappen insisted following a tough for Red Bull that he was always aware that the 2024 season was never going to be like his exceptional 2023 campaign. Red Bull have been struggling in the past three F1 races – Miami, Imola, and Monaco – to recreate their dominant form which they have enjoyed since 2022. In 2023 Verstappen and Red Bull had an unprecedented run, the team winning all but one of the 22 races – Carlos Sainz won in Singapore – while the Dutchman took 19 wins out of his team’s 21. But 2024 has been a far cry from its predecessor, as despite still leading both Championships, that has not come easily for Verstappen and Red Bull as the like of McLaren and Ferrari are pushing them hard, with the RB20 seemingly more vulnerable than its older sibling the all conquering RB19. Red Bull boss Christian Horner has repeatedly pointed out that the car designs were going to confirm with the cars’ pace converging as well, and now Verstappen added that 2023 was an exception. Speaking to the media after the Monaco GP, the reigning F1 Champion said: “It [2024] was never going to be like last year, to have a season like that is quite rare. “I always knew that this year was going to be a little bit different but also I don’t really think about championship positions or whatever with so many races left. Some races are a bit better for us and some are a bit worse for us. At the end of the day it all works out. “The cars are much closer, some cars work better on street circuits and some work better in fast corners rather than low speed corners. It will swing a bit,” he pointed out. The RB20 doesn’t like kerbs and bumps Asked about the weakness of his RB20, Verstappen said: “Any track that is bumpy or has kerbs, or you have to ride a lot of kerbs, so the street circuits will probably be a little bit tricky but hopefully by then we have a little bit of understanding of what is going on. “We have to wait and see,” he continued when asked about the kerbs in Canada, “new surface as well I think, that might also give us some surprises but it is probably also not going to be our strongest weekend because of that but probably a little bit better than here.” The triple F1 Champion insisted Red Bull racing are resting on their laurels, he said: “We take everything very seriously but sometimes things are not very easy to fix but we are working flat-out on it. “First we need to understand what it is, we don’t now a the moment so this is something that we have to find first,” Verstappen concluded when asked how fast the issue can be fixed. Verstappen currently leads the F1 Drivers’ Standings by 31 points from Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc.",

Join the debate on our social media channels Manager Martin Paterson has left Burton Albion after the club narrowly avoided relegation from League One, BBC Radio Derby reports. The role at Pirelli Stadium was the 37-year-old former Swansea City, Barnsley and Inter Miami assistant manager's first job in charge of a senior side. Whoever the new man is, he’s going to have his work cut out. Thoughts? Stockport County , MK Dons and Bristol Rovers are interested in free agent defender Clark Robertson, according to the Daily Record The centre-back could be set for a return to England this summer following a spell in Israel at F.C. Ashdod. He helped them finish in 6th position in the Israeli Premier League last season. Gillingham are keen on a move for Accrington Stanley winger Jack Nolan, according to reporter Pete O’Rourke on X . Salford have announced two more friendlies. They will face Warrington Town on 24th July and Rochdale on Saturday 3rd August. Appere will join Stevenage when his contract at Sixfields runs out next month. The 6ft 1in Scot has scored 18 goals in 106 games for the Cobblers, including nine when they were promoted to League One in 2022-23. Louis Appere joins from Northampton “It’s been in the works for a while. I’m really looking forward to getting started. “I had positive chats with the manager and it’s a club with real potential with the project and the plans that he has got in place. “The run the club went on towards the end of last season made everyone pay attention. It’s a good club with a good manager and I’m hoping we can do good things.” League Two champs Stockport County have a new man. Jay Mingi has joined from Colchester. Notts County have signed Bradford City defender Matty Platt on a two-year contract - the League Two club's first summer signing. Platt, 26, moves to Meadow Lane on a free transfer following two years with the Bantams. He moved to Valley Parade after three years at Barrow, who he helped win promotion back to the Football League Two in 2020. \"Jay had a fantastic back end of the League Two season at Colchester,\" \"He showed his versatility and intelligence, switching from a familiar central midfield role to wide centre-back, right-back and right wing-back at times. “We believe he has real potential to develop, whilst immediately having the physical characteristics of being on the front foot, aggressive and quick, which will allow him to flourish in League One.\"",

        "content": "Nyanga man sentenced for serial thefts from former employer, neighbours In a troubling case that has left a community on edge, a 28-year-old Nyanga man has been brought before the Nyanga Magistrates’ Court, facing three counts of theft. The suspect, who was previously employed as a domestic worker, has been accused of targeting his former employer and two other local residents. According to the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe, the accused was fired from his position on April 12th, 2024. The very next day, he allegedly returned to the complainant’s home while she was away at a funeral and stole a host of items, including three buckets of yams, three buckets of maize, and a bed cover. The suspect is also accused of stealing five chickens from the complainant’s fowl run. Upon the complainant’s return, she discovered that her doors had been left open, and the missing property was nowhere to be found. It was later reported that the accused had been seen selling the stolen goods. The suspect’s criminal activities did not end there. On April 29th and 30th, he is said to have dug up potatoes from the fields of two additional complainants, valued at a total of $96 USD. Thorough investigations by the authorities led to the recovery of five bags of the stolen potatoes and the eventual arrest of the suspect. The court found the accused guilty on all three counts of theft and sentenced him to a total of seven months in prison. Three months of the sentence were suspended, and an additional month was suspended on the condition of restitution. The remaining three months were further suspended, provided the suspect completes 105 hours of community service.",

        "content": "THIBAUT COURTOIS has been left out of the Belgium Euro 2024 squad as fans claimed that their “golden generation turned bronze”. The Real Madrid goalkeeper, 32, has been capped 102 times for his country. But he will not be adding to that total this summer in Germany as he was the big-name omission from the squad. Courtois missed nearly the entire season due to a knee ligament injury. He then needed another operation on his knee in March when he had a setback but he did return to play four games earlier this month for LaLiga champions Madrid. Courtois threw his Belgium future into doubt after branding manager Domenico Tedesco a liar. He and his international gaffer had been at loggerheads after he was snubbed of the captaincy for their matches against Austria and Estonia last June following Eden Hazard's retirement. Courtois staggeringly accused both the Belgian Football Federation and Tedesco of not appreciating him. Then there was further controversy last month as Tedesco claimed that he had done everything in his power to ensure the crocked Courtois plays for the Red Devils again. But the former Chelsea stopper publicly took umbrage to that claim by responding to a post with his comments with three Pinocchio emojis. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS Courtois made his Belgium debut in 2011 aged 19 and has gone on to make a further 101 appearances for his country. But he had confirmed way back in December that he would not be fit enough to represent his country in Germany. Meanwhile, the likes of Manchester City’s Kevin de Bruyne and Jeremy Doku are both in, along with ex-Premier League striker Romelu Lukaku and Arsenal winger Leandro Trossard. But the Courtois news was not the only shock as Tedesco announced his 25-man squad. Belgium also recalled Axel Witsel - that is despite the 35-year-old announcing his international retirement last year. Tedesco personally visited the Atletico Madrid defender to try and persuade him to return, and his words have done the trick. Witsel earned the last of his 130 caps at the World Cup in Qatar, where Belgium were eliminated in the group stage. Meanwhile, the country’s most-capped player Jan Vertonghen has also been named at the age of 36. Here is the 25-man squad for Euro 2024 in full: Goalkeepers: Koen Casteels (VfL Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton Town), Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest) Defenders: Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Wout Faes (Leicester City), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Arthur Theate (Stade Rennais), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid) Midfielders: Yannick Carrasco (Al Shabab), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Orel Mangala (Olympique Lyonnais), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Aster Vranckx (vfL Wolfsburg) Forwards: Johan Bakayoko (PSV Eindhoven), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Lois Openda (RB Leipzig), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal). However, another notable absentee is Fenerbahce's Michy Batshuayi. The former Chelsea and Crystal Palace forward, 30, has scored 27 goals in 55 caps. Belgium have under-achieved and failed to claim any silverware for the past decade after having a squad many had dubbed as the ‘Golden Generation’. And upon seeing the squad announcement for this upcoming tournament, one fan commented: “Golden generation turned bronze...” Another said: “They are not seeing the quarter finals.” “Belgium fell off,” said a third before a fourth added: “They're just perfect for group stages exit. It's just a matter of time.” STAY in the know this summer with The Sun's transfer experts. Chelsea have been given permission from Leicester to speak to Enzo Maresca . Liverpool and Chelsea are eyeing a summer move for Crysencio Summerville. Premier League clubs are targeting Tosin Adarabioyo, who will be a free agent when his Fulham contract expires next month.

The visit, which coincided with JAC’s 60th anniversary celebration, marked a major milestone in the company’s commitment to partnering with Nigerian interests. According to a statement, Governor Agbu joined international dignitaries and public servants for the ribbon-cutting ceremony, which also spotlighted JAC’s historic delivery of 30,000 Electric Vehicles (EVs) to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This move, the statement explained, is expected to pave the way for Nigeria’s access to EVs, business connections, and technology in the specialised field. “The visit provided Governor Agbu with a firsthand look at JAC’s innovative manufacturing processes and technological advancements, strengthening the strategic partnership between the auto giant and Nigerian interests. This partnership is expected to result in the delivery of electric vehicles in Nigeria, aligning with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s vision for an affordable and cleaner transportation system,” the statement added. “The collaboration between Elizade and JAC is also driving innovation and investments in Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles, a key step towards reducing emissions and revolutionising the automotive industry in Nigeria. This partnership is expected to catalyse technological advancement, job creation, and improved living standards in the country.” “Governor Agbu’s visit has raised hopes for a transportation revolution in Nigeria, and the partnership between JAC and Nigerian interests is poised to make a significant impact on the country’s automotive industry and environment,” it added.",

        "description": "'I'm going to bomb you - not a love bomb this time, a real bomb.'",
        "content": "A grandma who split up with her 37-year-old husband is now a scam hunter and has revealed a conman threatened to send her a bomb. Iris Jones, 83, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, married Mohamed Ibrahim but says she was left thousands of pounds out of pocket by him. In a Facebook post written last week, she revealed she now hunts scam artists who fool women online. A man who claimed to be from the American air force working in Yemen got in contact with Iris. She said: ‘He asked me to send him £2,740 and I asked him how do I send it over? Just to tease him – I like to taunt them now. ‘It wasn’t ‘hi honey’, or anything like that, when I asked him what his favourite food was I expected him to say hamburger, or hotdogs or popcorn – but it was rice. ‘I called him something I can’t share online – and then he said “give me your location, I’m going to bomb you – not a love bomb this time, a real bomb”. ‘There must be a conveyer belt in these places where there are all these scammers and gold diggers who have all these women lined up and they pass you from pillar to post. ‘They don’t think of you as a person – you’re just a name.’ Since Iris has turned into a scam hunter she has offered tips as to how to spot scammers. She added: ‘Usually they send a very handsome picture of themselves, often working on an oil rig or in another country or in the army. ‘These pictures are not them – they are are pictures of genuine men and I think some of them know they are being used. ‘Also, a lot of the time they want to come off Facebook, or the dating app or Facebook dating site and then want to go onto WhatsApp because “it is more private”. ‘That is a red flag. ‘I am on scam alert and I would recommend it for people too as they tell you what to look out for. ‘Then there is the love bombing – after a couple of days of messaging they tell you they love you, and they are narcissists.

Half term is here and the summer holidays is just on the horizon, so I wanted to share my one top tip for affordable days out with the family, one that has saved both my pocket and my sanity some days - it is a National Trust membership . In our house it is the gift that keeps on giving. Getting out, particularly in the warmer months, always helps to clear the cobwebs and offers the opportunity to make memories with the children, but it often becomes a costly exercise. Entry into most places nowadays is eye-wateringly expensive and once in, you’re sure to find many more ways to be parted with your cash, which means such outings can become reserved only for a ‘special occasion’. However, National Trust members have no such concerns and it’s much cheaper than many realise. If like me, you pay for your membership monthly, it is actually pretty affordable. Family membership including two adults and all of their children aged 17 and under costs £13.25 a month, and for single parent families, membership costs just £8.25 a month, admitting one adult with their children. Visit just one place a month and it’s more than paid for itself, visit more and you’re quids in. Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Hucknall Dispatch, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Membership offers unlimited free admission to over 200 historic houses and gardens in England , Wales and Northern Ireland so you could effectively go to one every day if you felt so compelled. Packing up a picnic rather than eating out will also save you a few quid and the outdoor spaces at National Trust properties always offer a scenic place to picnic. Over the holidays, most places also lay on some kind of added entertainment for kids including trails and fun activities. This May half term, whether you want to delve into history at a castle or historic house or discover nature at parks and gardens, there are plenty of events to encourage imaginations to run wild. For example, you can create butterfly art at Chirk Castle in Wrexham, take in a falconry display at Trerice in Cornwall or help Squirrel Holmes solve the nature clues at Lyveden in Northamptonshire. You could even give the wheel of destiny a whirl at Hughenden Manor in Buckinghamshire to become a new character – will you be the Victorian statesman Benjamin Disraeli, an ice house attendant or a woodland bodger? To search for half-term events near you, from storytelling and quests to family trails and historical costume demonstrations, visit the National Trust website where you can also join the NT gang ! What I love the most about our membership is when we’re all starting to get cabin fever this summer, and feel like we're about to climb the walls, we can just head out. And we get to choose from some of the most beautiful properties and gardens in the country - what better place to enjoy an impromptu sandwich on the lawn?",

In our house it is the gift that keeps on giving. Getting out, particularly in the warmer months, always helps to clear the cobwebs and offers the opportunity to make memories with the children, but it often becomes a costly exercise. Entry into most places nowadays is eye-wateringly expensive and once in, you’re sure to find many more ways to be parted with your cash, which means such outings can become reserved only for a ‘special occasion’. However, National Trust members have no such concerns and it’s much cheaper than many realise. If like me, you pay for your membership monthly, it is actually pretty affordable. Family membership including two adults and all of their children aged 17 and under costs £13.25 a month, and for single parent families, membership costs just £8.25 a month, admitting one adult with their children. Visit just one place a month and it’s more than paid for itself, visit more and you’re quids in.

Half term is here and the summer holidays is just on the horizon, so I wanted to share my one top tip for affordable days out with the family, one that has saved both my pocket and my sanity some days - it is a National Trust membership . In our house it is the gift that keeps on giving. Getting out, particularly in the warmer months, always helps to clear the cobwebs and offers the opportunity to make memories with the children, but it often becomes a costly exercise. Entry into most places nowadays is eye-wateringly expensive and once in, you’re sure to find many more ways to be parted with your cash, which means such outings can become reserved only for a ‘special occasion’. However, National Trust members have no such concerns and it’s much cheaper than many realise. If like me, you pay for your membership monthly, it is actually pretty affordable. Family membership including two adults and all of their children aged 17 and under costs £13.25 a month, and for single parent families, membership costs just £8.25 a month, admitting one adult with their children. Visit just one place a month and it’s more than paid for itself, visit more and you’re quids in.

Shah, addressing an election rally at Chandbali under the Bhadrak Lok Sabha constituency, also claimed that the saffron party is set to win 17 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats in Odisha. Also Read Villagers protest against rice mill over pollution 5 hours ago Chinks alleged in sensitive booths list 5 hours ago “Come June 4, and Naveen babu will no longer remain the chief minister, he will become the former CM... BJP is set to win 17 Lok Sabha seats and 75 Assembly constituencies in Odisha,” he said. Shah also said the BJP will ensure that the next chief minister is fluent in Odia, and understands the state’s language, culture and tradition. “Should a ‘Tamil babu’ run the government from behind the scene... By casting your vote in favour of the lotus symbol, bring a ‘jan sevak’ to rule the state in place of an officer,” he said, in an apparent reference to Patnaik’s close aide and BJD leader Kartik Pandian. Stating that lakhs of youths were migrating to other states in search of work, the home minister said: “Once the BJP forms government in Odisha, we will set up industries so that youths don’t have to look for jobs elsewhere.” He also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing free 5 kg of rice to the people of Odisha and criticised Patnaik for distributing the rice in jute bags with his photographs. “PM Modi’s government is ‘chawal wali sarkar’, while Naveen Patnaik’s government is ‘jhole wali sarkar’,” Shah added.

The veteran actor with an envious 49-year career in cinema was talking with Kaumudi movies as part of the promotion work of the movie when he cleared the air about not acting alongside actor Mohanlal for the past 13 years. Mohanlal and Maniyanpilla Raju are school friends and still carry the bonhomie. Maniyanpilla Raju: “It has been long 13 years since I shared the screen with Lal. We talk with each other daily and share jokes. But It hasn’t chanced upon me to ask for a role in his next films. There are friends among us who request Lal for roles in his next movie. Being Lal, it is normal for him to not turn anyone down and those people will be there in some roles in Lal's movies. But I believe that roles come to us if it is fit for us to perform. There is no point in pestering someone for roles. Just see for the fact that I am acting alongside Lal in Tharun Moorthy’s movie. A great role to play. See, these roles come to us, and I believe in destiny more than anything. “",

        "content": "When Yatinder, 17, applied for the Agnipath scheme last year, he was made fun of by his peers, who told him that he will retire before his father. Yatinder, oldest of five siblings, the youth from Balla area in Kangra says that he is at a loss as he has never thought of joining any other profession. His neighbour Suresh Sharma who appeared for the Agnipath exam in March this year said he did so half-heartedly. “I have been training and dreaming to join the forces, at this point, what else could I apply for?” he asks. Their concern found echo among the youths in the state where 42.3 per cent of boys said that they wanted to join the Army, as per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2023-Beyond Basics. Advertisement In fact, according to the central government data tabled in Parliament in February this year, one-fourth of the total soldiers selected from all over the country belong to this region – Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh . In the last round of recruitment held in 2019-2020 for the selection of jawans, of the total 78,629 candidates who made the cut, 18,798 were from the region. However, due to the suspension of the Indian Army’s enrollment drive for two years, around 37,000 youngsters from the region were deprived of their dream of donning the olive green, states the report. Rajesh Singh, a taxi driver and a resident of Dhaloom village near Yol Cantonment, said, “Agniveer is a big issue here. What will our children do when they return after four years? The BJP says that there is no resentment. But what will these youths do when they don’t have any job avenues after four years? Also, these children were preparing hard. They had no option but to sign up to become Agniveer”. The anti-Agnipath sentiments could be felt in many parts of the state with several Congress leaders attacking the BJP over it and the latter trying hard to defend itself. Advertisement Criticising the Centre’s Agnipath scheme, Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said, “There is now less interest among the youth in serving the country (in the Army) because of the BJP’s scheme which is providing jobs only for four years.” Posing several questions to the BJP-led central government, senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had on Friday asked that since the people of Himachal Pradesh have repeatedly voiced their opposition to the Agnipath scheme will Prime Minister Narendra Modi commit to scrapping the “ill-conceived” military recruitment programme? While Mandi is the biggest parliamentary constituency in terms of area, Kangra is the most populous among Himachal Pradesh’s four Lok Sabha constituencies. The cumulative number of people from Kangra serving in the Army or ex-servicemen is around 1 lakh. Making this his poll plank, Congress’ Kangra candidate Anand Sharma, who is fighting a Lok Sabha election for the first time, has termed the Agnipath scheme as an “insult” to the soldiers. Expecting to influence a considerable number of voters in the constituency, he also promised to abolish it if the Congress was voted to power, an assurance also given by other senior Congress leaders. Advertisement The BJP on its part has tried to turn the tide in their favour by not only elaborating on the benefits of the scheme but also by accusing the Congress of spreading lies. BJP’s Hamirpur candidate and Union Minister Anurag Thakur said that 25 per cent of the youth will remain permanently in the Army while reservation would be given for the remaining in central para military forces and state police, and there would be 100 per cent job guarantee for those becoming Agniveer. The issue has gained so much prominence that when Union Home Minister Amit Shah visited Kangra on Sunday, the BJP got a video statement issued from him to allay the fears of the youths and soldiers regarding the scheme. He also alleged that the Congress was spreading lies regarding the scheme. Prof Ramesh K Chauhan, from the Department of Political Science at Himachal Pradesh University, says that in Kangra, every third family has someone in the Army. Advertisement “For the middle class population, the Army is a lucrative job option. The children just wait to complete class 12 and then take some physical training and then apply for the armed forces. A lot of youths from the rural belts also apply for the forces and join the lower ranks. For most, this is not just a job but also a matter of pride. With the Agnipath scheme, they will remain with the Army only for four years and then will be allotted other jobs. But that’s not what the youth wants here. If they wanted to be guards somewhere, they could have just worked with some private agencies,” says Chauhan, adding that even if the BJP pushes for the scheme, this is not going to work for long.",

        "description": "Chelsea will make Leicester City boss Enzo Maresca their new manager \"unless something crazy happens in the next 48 hours\", according to Fabrizio Romano.",
        "content": "Chelsea will make Leicester City boss Enzo Maresca their new manager “unless something crazy happens in the next 48 hours”, according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano. The Blues made the decision to part ways with Mauricio Pochettino last week in a shock decision following a promising end to the campaign for Chelsea . Pochettino, who led Tottenham to the Champions League final in 2019, ended his spell in charge of Chelsea with five successive league wins, earning a Europa Conference League place for next season. That is an improvement of six places from their 12th-placed finish the season before, with Chelsea earning 19 more points under Pochettino. Speculation has been rife over the identity of their potential new boss with Leicester City’s Maresca now seemingly the top candidate to replace the Argentinian at Stamford Bridge. And now Romano insists that Chelsea will appoint Maresca – who got the Foxes promoted from the Championship at the first time of asking – unless “something crazy happens” and that the Italian “believes in the project” at the Premier League club. Romano wrote in his Caught Offside column : “Enzo Maresca will be the new Chelsea manager – unless something crazy happens in the next 48 hours. It will be a ‘here we go’ soon because the latest contacts between Maresca and Chelsea were super positive. “Maresca wants to go to Chelsea and never had any doubts despite some reports suggesting that maybe he wants to stay at Leicester. Although he loves and respects Leicester, it’s been very clear ever since Chelsea entered this story that Maresca wants to be the next Chelsea manager. “Maresca believes in the Chelsea project around young players with a big future, he thinks it is a really exciting project. Meanwhile, Chelsea are convinced he’s a super talented coach and that’s why he’s a name appreciated by both directors and owners, all convinced he can be the man for present and future. “Maresca’s obsession with ball possession, quality football, dominating the game, his knowledge of elite football despite being a young manager – all of this made the difference for Chelsea to pick him. “Talks are now really at the final stages, and it’s expected to happen soon. The salary is agreed and it’s just about the length of the contract. The feeling is that it could be a five-year contract, longer than they initially thought, and they are just discussing this final detail, but the feeling is that they are almost there. “What’s missing is just an agreement between Chelsea and Leicester on compensation, also for Maresca’s staff, but it’s just a matter of days or maybe even hours and then everything will be done for Maresca to become the new Chelsea manager. “So, that will be ‘here we go’ soon and then it will continue to be a busy summer at Chelsea. It won’t be completely crazy but they will try to make smart things happen, including a new goalkeeper and I expect them to try for at least one new centre-back, but it could be two. I also expect Chelsea to be busy with the striker position, and I mentioned many times Benjamin Sesko, who is highly rated at Chelsea but also by others like Arsenal and Manchester United.” MORE CHELSEA MESS COVERAGE ON F365... 👉 Five Chelsea players who should be delighted by the arrival of Enzo Maresca 👉 Maresca emerges as clear choice to replace sacked Pochettino at Chelsea 👉 Leverkusen sack Alonso, Chelsea press Mourinho button, Slot quits and other Managergeddon predictions Ipswich Town boss Kieran McKenna was linked with the Chelsea job before committing his future to the Tractor Boys. And now Romano has revealed that Chelsea “called” McKenna regarding the vacant manager role and informed him he was “no longer in the race”. Romano added: “It’s important to clarify another big story on managers as Chelsea called Kieran McKenna to inform him that he was no longer in the race to become their manager. He also had the possibility to go to Brighton but they wanted an answer early this week, while he also had the possibility to wait and see what happened at Manchester United, with the club still reviewing and discussing internally what to do about Erik ten Hag. “But now, McKenna has decided to commit his future to Ipswich Town. He’s going to extend his contract – everything is almost ready for him to sign a new deal, which will be an important one with big money involved. So, there are no fresh contacts with Chelsea because he’s been informed he’s no longer in the race, and he will stay at Ipswich. “Credits to Ipswich Town on this one – they’ve been waiting and hoping, offering him an important contract. McKenna has decided to accept after Chelsea told him with direct call that he was out of the shortlist to become the new manager. For Brighton, a decision will be made soon on an alternative to become their next manager.” READ NEXT: Ten Hag sack: 10 other managers who lost their jobs straight after winning trophies",

        "content": "ARE you a true foodie? There are 50 signs you know your stuff in the kitchen, from avoiding ready meals to doing your own recipes. Can you pronounce quinoa correctly? Have you any idea how to cook jackfruit? Know what is meant by to coddle something? If you think you can spot a Michelin-star meal when you eat one, why not put your money where your mouth is and give this quiz a try? It comes after research of 2,000 adults found 41 per cent are self-confessed foodies. Natalie Allen, spokesperson for salad brand Florette, which commissioned the research to launch its Gourmet Slaws range, said: “The term ‘foodie’ has been more widely used in recent years. “People make plans around which restaurants they are going to, often several weeks in advance and love to share their meals, recipes, reviews and general thoughts on food on social media platforms. “Cuisine brings so much joy. When we think of special occasions such as birthdays and weddings or even holidays, the majority of them have an enjoyment of food at the heart of them. “Dishes from around the world have progressively been integrated into our diet in the UK as we have become more inquisitive, experimental and so willing to try different and more “exotic” options.” The research also identified the 50 signs someone is a foodie – and they include the kitchen being a favourite room in the house and a tendency to plan holidays around cuisine. Knowing how to make pasta from scratch, actually using the cookbooks they own and having in excess of 30 spices in the cupboard. Owning a set of chef-worthy knives, obsessively reading food blogs, knowing where different cuts of meat come from, eating seasonal produce and hosting dinner parties are further traits. Along with a fondness for dining in Michelin-star restaurants, seeking out independent eateries, and attending food festivals. Of those polled, seven in 10 are passionate about supporting Britain’s food and drink industry. As a result, 58 per cent try to eat in independent restaurants where possible because the food tastes better (42 per cent) and for an authentic experience (36 per cent). It also emerged adults typically eat out twice a month, spending an average of £40 on food and drinks. When dining out, 55 per cent try new meals each time while 18 per cent stick to what they know and love. Similarly, six in 10 claim they are adventurous with food and 24 per cent are willing to travel hundreds of miles for the ‘perfect’ meal. For 34 per cent, eating out at high class restaurants is their idea of fun, while 45 per cent enjoy learning new things about ingredients and meals. While the best aspects of dining out were found to be the satisfaction of eating a good meal (25 per cent), not having to cook (24 per cent) and trying new foods (15 per cent). More than a fifth (23 per cent) even have a list of restaurants they’d like to visit, while 29 per cent have a wish list of countries to travel to specifically for the cuisine. When it comes to cooking, 41 per cent describe their ability as ‘average’, while 38 per cent claim it’s ‘good’ and seven per cent go as far as saying it’s ‘excellent’. But despite many believing they themselves are a foodie, the research, carried out through OnePoll, found 29 per cent dislike the term as it's pretentious (66 per cent) and elitist (18 per cent). Natalie Allen, spokesperson for Florette's Gourmet Slaws, which are inspired by flavours of Korea, China and India, added: “With summer fast approaching it’s likely social gatherings will revolve around food even more, from barbeques to al fresco lunches and late evening dining as the sun sets.” To take the quiz click here . 1.

        "description": "Leicester City boss Enzo Maresca is a frontrunner for the Chelsea job and has previous experience winning at Stamford Bridge - despite having never managed in the Premier League",
        "content": "Chelsea managerial candidate Enzo Maresca has already toppled the Blues despite not having managed in England's top flight. The Leicester City manager is believed to be in discussions with Chelsea about taking over the reins at Stamford Bridge. The west Londoners are currently without a manager following Mauricio Pochettino's mutual agreement to leave , while Maresca's reputation is on the rise after leading the Foxes back to the Premier League as Championship winners. And it's nearly five years since Maresca, 44, orchestrated a surprise 1-0 win for West Ham while serving as assistant coach to Manuel Pellegrini. The Chilean was under scrutiny with the Hammers leading up to Christmas 2019 but bought himself some time by upsetting the Blues on their home turf - although the victory wasn't entirely his doing. It later came to light that Maresca was the brains behind their tactics in west London that day in November 2019, according to The Guardian (via football.london ). Aaron Cresswell netted the only goal of the match to keep West Ham just above the relegation zone at the time, though it only postponed Pellegrini's exit by one month. Watch Champions League, Europa League & Conference League finals with TNT Sports Chelsea offer contract to Premier League star in surprise move to replace Thiago Silva The Hammers nailed their strategy and restricted Chelsea's strengths through the middle after Maresca was said to have taken over training in the lead-up to the game. It was executed to perfection and ended West Ham's 17-year wait for a win at the Bridge. Pellegrini's decision to defer responsibility to his assistant that week paid dividends, and the South American may have staved off the sack even longer had he repeated the tactic. However, Pellegrini was eventually fired in December 2019 after restoring his usual methods to no effect, and Maresca followed him out of the West Ham exit. Fast-forward to today and Maresca could be the man to take over from Pochettino this summer as he makes the step up to Premier League level. The Italian took over at the King Power Stadium in June 2023 and guided Leicester back up at the first time of asking, winning four Championship Manager of the Month awards along the way. Maresca served as Manuel Pellgrini's assistant at West Ham before both left in December 2019 ( Image: Arfa Griffiths/West Ham United FC via Getty Images) The former Juventus and West Brom midfielder's only previous senior management role was a six-month spell at Parma, which ended in disappointment after he won just four of his 14 games in charge. He then returned to Manchester City as one of Pep Guardiola's assistants, having previously worked at the club as manager of the elite development squad. Chelsea, having been impressed by the candidate's journey back to the Premier League, have seemingly decided they'd rather have Maresca on their side than against them. And it could prove to be a gamble worth taking considering his history at Stamford Bridge. DON'T SCRAP REPLAYS! Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!

        "content": "Testimony continues Tuesday in the murder trial of Karen Read, the Massachusetts woman accused of hitting her boyfriend with an SUV and leaving him to die in a snowstorm. Read, 44, of Mansfield, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and other charges. The prosecution says she hit her boyfriend, John O'Keefe , with her black SUV outside of a home at 34 Fairview Road in Canton during a snowstorm on Jan. 29, 2022, following a night of drinking . Her defense plans to argue that someone else is responsible for killing O'Keefe. The defense is set to continue its cross-examination of ATF Agent Brian Higgins, one of three men Read's defense lawyers have implicated in O'Keefe's death. On Friday, Norfolk County Assistant District Attorney Adam Lally asked about flirty text messages, which were exchanged a few weeks before O'Keefe died. \"You're, hot,\" Read wrote to Higgins in one of the messages. \"Are you serious or messing with me?\" Higgins replied. \"No, I'm serious,\" Read wrote. \"Feeling is mutual. Is that bad? How long have you thought that?\" Higgins asks.

trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence PHOTO: Karen Read trial evidence Higgins testified that one day when he was leaving O'Keefe's house, Read \"planted a kiss on me. Not like a friend,\" adding that he interpreted it as romantic. In another exchange, Higgins read a message from Read in which she invited him to her house. \"I'm glad you came over tonight,\" Read later texts. Higgins said he asked Read in one message if she and O’Keefe were breaking up, to which Read replied, “I don’t know. He hooked up (with) another girl on vacation.” Read eventually went over Higgins house, where the pair continued to discuss their interactions, Higgins testified. \"I am not proud of these text messages. It is what it is. I take responsibility for them,\" Higgins told the court. \"John was a friend at the same time. If they were at the end of their relationship, they were at the end of their relationship. But I was not going to have someone utilize me, weaponize me against someone I liked.\" Defense attorney Alan Jackson started his cross-examination Friday by questioning Higgins about his \"romantic interest\" in Read. \"I was physically attracted to her, yes,\" Higgins said. Higgins was cross-examined by Jackson about his phone records and movements within the Canton Police Department. Jackson sought to imply that Higgins had conversations with Brian Albert hours before O'Keefe's body was found and suggest that Higgins had access to Read's SUV and other evidence. Prosecutors are trying to show that Read’s actions were intentional. Read's lawyers have alleged there was a cover-up involving members of several law enforcement agencies. They say O’Keefe was beaten by someone else inside the home, bitten by a dog and then left outside. They argued investigators focused on Read because she was a \"convenient outsider,\" and that prevented them from considering other suspects. The defense is trying to convince the jury that O'Keefe was beaten and argues that Colin Albert had been in a fight. Albert said the injury came when he fell in a driveway and that he never saw O'Keefe on the night in question. He was in high school at the time, but previously testified that he was drinking beer at a friend's house before going to 34 Fairview Road to celebrate his cousin's birthday. Albert is the nephew of the couple that owned the Canton property where O'Keefe was found in January 2022. He also confirmed on cross-examination that he has known the lead state police investigator in this case, Trooper Michael Proctor, since he was a child. Another man that the defense has tried to implicate in the death is ATF Agent Brian Higgins, who testified about a \"romantic\" encounter and series of text messages he exchanged with Read. In those flirty messages, Read told him that O'Keefe had \"hooked up\" with another woman during a vacation. The trial's first few days detailed the futile efforts of first responders to save O'Keefe. They found him face up when they arrived just before dawn on Jan. 29. He was pronounced dead at the hospital, and an autopsy later found he died of hypothermia and blunt force trauma. Several of the first responders said they heard Read make statements, including, \"I hit him,\" after O'Keefe was found. Defense attorneys confronted several of those witnesses by asking why those alleged remarks were not included in official reports. Officers also testified about unusual procedures used during the investigation, including the decision to collect bloody snow in red plastic cups and clearing snow from the crime scene.",

        "content": "Older voters have been promised an even bigger guarantee of their income, with the ‘triple lock plus’ coming in if the Tories stay in power. It sounds like a complicated contraption making it very hard to open a door, but it’s a metaphor meaning state pensions will keep their value in real terms, no matter what is happening in the economy . The ‘triple lock’ was introduced in 2010 , when the Tory/Lib Dem coalition came to power, and means that the annual increase in state pension will be based on whichever is highest of three values: inflation, the average increase in UK wages, or 2.5% at minimum. Unsurprisingly popular with pensioners, the policy has nonetheless been criticised by others who say it is unsustainable with an ageing population. Rishi Sunak now plans to beef it up even further with an added promise that pensioners will get to keep more of their income than other age groups before it is taxed. He said he would increase the personal allowance for those of pension age, while keeping it frozen for working-age adults, meaning that the full state pension would not risk falling into tax no matter how much it went up.

The personal allowance of income earned tax-free is the first £12,570 as standard for everyone, except those earning over £125,140 who aren’t entitled to it. Currently, the full state pension is £11,502 a year, so approaching the taxable level if it kept on increasing while personal allowance remained frozen. Rishi Sunak said that if he wins the General Election on July 4, personal allowance would also rise by the triple-lock tests, for pensioners only. So their tax-free earnings allowance would increase by at least 2.5% each year, and possibly much more, always keeping pace with pensions. While some dubbed this the ‘quadruple lock’, the government settled on ‘triple lock plus’. It’s a bit of a mouthful especially if you weren’t even sure about the original triple lock, but you can expect to hear that term a lot more over the coming weeks. The policy would amount to a tax break of £95 in 2025-26, rising to £275 in 2029-30. By 2029/2030, it would cost £2.4 billion a year and the government said it would be funded through clamping down on tax dodgers – the same pot of money which will help pay for mandatory National Service for teenagers , another flagship Tory election policy. Under the Conservatives, the State Pension had risen by Â£3,700 – and is increasing another Â£900 this year. We introduced the Triple Lock. Now weâre introducing the Triple Lock Plus ð https://t.co/KMc01VYNRc It means a guarantee in legislation that the pensioners’ personal allowance will always be higher than the level of the new state pension. But Labour said it was a ‘desperate move’ from a party which was ‘torching’ what was left of its claims to economic credibility, and they wouldn’t be offering it themselves. Positioning himself as financially responsible, Keir Starmer had a boost this morning as dozens of business leaders signed an open letter endorsing the party’s economic plans. Announcing the pensions policy, Mr Sunak said: ‘Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. ‘This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.’ It is a regular payment from the government which most people can claim when they reach a certain age: currently 66 years old for both men and women. Not everyone gets the same amount, as how much you get depends on your National Insurance contributions while working. The full amount is currently £221.20 per week under the system from 2016. Many pensioners will also rely on income from other sources, such as private workplace pensions. But Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson pointed out that about half the cost of the plan was from not imposing three more years of frozen personal allowances on pensioners. Tory MP says voters should back Reform UK candidate for her seat at General Election I have voted for Labour in every single election since I was 18 – until now What Shrek tells us about the different way the Tories and Labour use TikTok Full list of conservative MPs stepping down ahead of the General Election ‘So the £100 “saving” next year is mostly just avoiding a £100 tax increase, rather than an actual giveaway.’ And Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the ‘biggest beneficiaries of another tax system complication will largely be better-off pensioner households’. Meanwhile, Sam Bidwell of free market think tank the Adam Smith Institute said: ‘The state pension could be financially unsustainable as soon as 2035, a worrying trend which this policy will only exacerbate. Customers say you'll feel 'fresh out of the womb' with this skin foam ‘At a time when working-age people are being squeezed by higher taxes and the cost of living, tax cuts should focus on making work pay, rather than being given to every single pensioner, even those who are millionaires.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk .

Airline TUI has said there was “unprecedented interest” in the roles, which will see 41 new staff flying out of Glasgow airport. The air crews have undergone months of “gruelling” training and will now be deployed on the travel company’s flights from Scotland’s largest city. In addition, four extra pilots have begun working at the Scottish hub. The air crews get their 'wings' (Image: TUI) TUI’s Head of Cabin Crew Management Ian Campbell said: “This year we saw unprecedented interest, with thousands applying for the roles available; and 10,000 applications flying in during the first week.” The majority of the training takes place at TUI’s Training Centre in East Midlands, where the new recruits are put through their paces and learn safety and service.

        "content": "Attorney-general of the federation (AGF) and minister of justice, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), has called on the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Judicial Council to initiate a reform-oriented review of the practice and procedure of the ECOWAS Court of Justice to avoid conflicts with national courts. He said the review should make the court realise its envisioned potential as a respectable regional court. Fagbemi, who addressed the opening ceremony of the Statutory Meeting of the ECOWAS Judicial Council in Abuja, said the council should also provide a credible network for the promotion of uniform rules of practice and procedure in the administration of justice in order to reduce conflict of laws in the region. He said the ECOWAS Judicial Council stands in a proper position to work towards the promotion of rule of law and democratic governance, which have come under intense pressure in recent times. According to Fagbemi, as the ECOWAS bloc continues to work towards achieving uniform economic policies and institutions, the judiciary should not be left behind. He said the challenges confronting the judiciary or the justice system in general across the West African states are identical in terms of judicial autonomy, provision of funding and infrastructural facilities for the courts, among others. In the same vein, he said member states also share the challenges confronting the region in terms of economy, migration, integration, insecurity, enforcement of fundamental rights. The AGF enjoined the ECOWAS Judicial Council to utilise the regional platform, as an avenue for peer review and cross-fertilization of ideas, to address the issues in order to achieve greater independence of the judiciary and a more prosperous and safer sub-region. Earlier, the chairman of the ECOWAS Judicial Council and the chief justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Olukayode Ariwoola, said the council is working towards ensuring a just and equitable society. He charged member states to work towards safeguarding the principles of justice, upholding the rule of law, and advancing the cause of peace and prosperity. In his speech, the president of the Community Court of Justice, Eward Amoako Asante, restated the commitment of ECOWAS Judicial Council to upholding the principles of justice, equity and the rule of law within the ECOWAS Community. Since its inception, he said, the ECOWAS Court has served as a beacon of hope for the people of West Africa, providing a platform for the resolution of disputes and the protection and enforcement of fundamental rights.",

        "content": "KUALA LUMPUR, May 28 — Malaysia can become the key hub to supply power chips to electric vehicle (EV) cars, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim said. He said the power chips are key in energy transition and decarbonisation technologies. For instance, EVs contain over 3,000 chips, two to five times that of internal combustion engine vehicles, he said. “Through Malaysia’s New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030) and the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), we already have the right policy enablers and incentives for companies wishing to manufacture them here,” he said in his speech at Semicon South-east Asia 2024 conference here, today. Moreover, Anwar said the government aims to have 40 per cent of Malaysia’s primary energy mix from renewable sources by 2035. This initiative aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 10 million tonnes annually and achieve 100 per cent renewable energy by 2050. “The government supports exploring new technologies like green hydrogen, nuclear technology, and large-scale energy storage to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and meet the targets of the 2016 Paris Accord,” he said. Starting this September, third-party access (TPA) will be allowed in the national electricity supply industry, enabling other parties to supply energy using Tenaga Nasional Bhd’s transmission lines, reflecting high foreign investor interest in Malaysia, he added. — Bernama",

        "content": "A Brit dad allegedly killed a Russian paedophile with a single punch after saying he wanted to have sex with his underage daughter. The 34-year-old Brit dad is alleged to have fatally hit the Russian tourist, 36, after he made sexual advances towards his 15-year-old daughter at a pool party in Pattaya, Thailand, on May 27. The Russian reportedly told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, which led the Brit dad to punch him in the face. In the scuffle, the Russian landed headfirst on the ground and he was rushed to a hospital in the city. He later died from his injuries. Police in Pattaya launched a manhunt shortly afterward and collected video footage and witness statements in a bid to track the Brit down. Pattaya officers said they had identified the alleged attacker as a British national and issued an arrest warrant on the charges of \"causing grievous bodily harm resulting in death.\" The Brit reportedly remains in police custody following the attack ( Image: AsiaPacificPress via ViralPress) According to the Pattaya Mail, the dad - understood to be from Wales - was found in a guesthouse in Na Jomtien, about six miles away from where the fatal attack took place. He was arrested and brought into the Pattaya City Police Station for questioning. \"I did not think my punch would lead to the man's death,\" the Brit allegedly told Thai police. \"I regret my actions.\" The Brit's Thai wife, 28, said she had attended the party but that she had left early in order to go to work. She then claimed to have received a text from her husband at 3am saying he wanted to go home. Police tacked down the Brit at a guesthouse six miles away from where the fatal attack happened ( Image: AsiaPacificPress via ViralPress) \"I returned to the villa and found him walking along the street, so I took him back inside,\" she said, according to MailOnline . \"When I asked him what happened, he told me that while they were drinking, the Russian man started to sexually harass our daughter, even though his own wife was also there at the party. \"The harassment escalated until the man finally propositioned our daughter. This angered my husband so he punched him once and knocked him out.\" The British dad is understood to remain in police custody. Pattaya is a major tourist destination in Thailand and welcomes millions of visitors from across the world each year.",

        "content": "The Biden administration has asked courts to keep documents relating to Prince Harry's visa application secret, as the Duke of Sussex reportedly finds himself in a dangerous position. The controversy surrounding Prince Harry's visa application continues to stir as he becomes \"caught in the crosshairs\" with the Biden administration urging courts to keep documents related to his case under wraps. Prince Harry's residency status in the US, where he has resided with his wife Meghan Markle since 2020, is potentially at risk following a lawsuit by the Heritage Foundation, which is calling for the disclosure of his visa details. This follows revelations in his tell all memoir, Spare about past drug use including marijuana and cocaine. The conservative think tank is challenging whether he was truthful on his visa forms or received preferential treatment as such admissions typically affect eligibility for entry into the US. The Department of Homeland Security is maintaining that such information should be kept secret, asserting that it will remain undisclosed during President Biden's tenure, the Express reports. TalkTV's Royal correspondent Rupert Bell commented: \"Prince Harry has found himself in the crosshairs again.

        "content": "Ever since coming into the NBA last year, Victor Wembanyama has silenced his doubters with all kinds of magnificent displays. However, the youngster’s desire to prove his worth has always carried the risk of going too far. And sure enough, one such instance occurred recently when the San Antonio Spurs star called out one of his trolls for doubting his capabilities. The situation circled a 187-week-old Instagram post by an account , highlighting the prowess of a 16-year-old Wemby. At that time, a different fan had raised question marks over the then teenager’s ability in the comments, stating, “He not gone do none of that in the NBA”. Evidently, it caught the eyes of the Spurs rookie at least a few days ago, prompting him to hit back at the doubter, declaring, “Why not?”. This hilarious instance caught the eyes of the NBA followers. Consequently, a fan account named YKB uploaded a screenshot of the exchange on X (formerly Twitter), with the caption, “Wemby cooked that man”. This yet again provided a glimpse into his competitive mindset as a youngster. After turning the heads of the critics with his on-court displays, Wemby is now likely on a mission to ensure the same with his off-court antics. So, the 20-year-old probably didn’t think much of it while responding to a comment that is over three years old. Additionally, during those years, the Frenchman didn’t have a CV to highlight his worth to the world. This is likely why, he chose to remain level-headed back in those times, focusing entirely on the craft. But now, the tables have turned. Victor Wembanyama can now back his words with actions Shortly after entering the NBA, his high ceiling as a basketball player became evident to the world. After initially struggling a bit to adapt to the conditions of the league, the rookie rose through the ranks quickly. As a result, by the end of the regular season, Wemby won over his doubters while injecting fear into the hearts of his opponents. His impressive rookie season stat line reflected precisely this. Despite averaging just 29.7 minutes on the court, the Spurs star recorded 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.2 steals, and 3.6 blocks per game. These majestic displays also earned him the 2024 ROTY accolade while keeping him in the conversation for the DPOY award throughout the campaign. These achievements hint at how Wemby will remain one of the frontrunners to become the face of the NBA in the coming years. After all, considering how brilliant his performances are already, that day may not be too far in the future.",

        "content": "Lily Allen uses a kids’ phone to reduce the time spent on social media – and it’s something you can do too. The British singer and actor revealed in an interview with the Sunday Times , that she and her husband, David Harbour , use a system on their phone called Pinwheel that has no browsing capability and no social media , but has other apps such as Uber and Spotify. She explains that smartphones have ‘destroyed’ humanity ‘as a species’ and says the devices have had a grievous impact on her creativity. She said: ‘The creative side of my brain has been ruined by smartphones. ‘I feel like everyone feels the same. I don’t know anyone who can possibly say that the quality of their life is improved by the presence of a smartphone. ‘I think it’s destroyed us as a species. It’s horrendous that they’re designed to be so addictive. Some of us have more addictive personalities than others. It’s evil.’ Previously in 2019, Lily Allen announced that she is giving up her smartphone because she spends seven hours a day looking at it. In a live video at the time, the 39-year-old said: ‘I’m done with this dead a**e app and Twitter and email and WhatsApp. All of it can go and suck its mum’s... I just wanted to let you know that. ‘I care about the world and I care about creating things and I don’t really care about the validation that comes back any more.’ Ms Allen uses an operating system attached to certain smartphones called Pinwheel, which allows users to have the functions of a smartphone but without the internet or social media. So if you’re looking to follow in Lily Allen’s steps, there are a few basic phones you should consider. The Light Phone is a minimal phone that also does not have social media or a browser, but does have maps and podcasts and it can hotspot. This is a great alternative if you’re looking for a way to ween yourself off using social media without letting go of all the practical functions a smartphone has. To use the phone in the UK, you would need the international version, which is compatible with carriers Vodafone, 3, and Giff Gaff. The Light phone requires a nano SIM card, which is the same size an iPhone uses. The international Light Phone is available to buy in the UK, and will cost £235, or it can be bought on eBay. The Pinwheel phone is a real smartphone that has Pinwheel OS installed which allows parents or caregivers to control what is on the phone. It is not an app, but an operating system that disables social media and internet browsers to allow certain apps to feature on the phone. Going back to basics, but miss the practical keyboard of a smartphone? You may want to try the Blackberry at a cool £25 on eBay. Taking it back to the late 2000s, the Blackberry is a great choice that has standard features, but with limited apps. However, it should be noted that the Blackberry uses a mini SIM, which is bigger than the nano SIM cards used by Apple. This phone also allows you to browse the web and check your emails, but mindlessly scrolling on your feed may be a bit more difficult. If you’re ready to go completely cold turkey, you may want to consider a Doro 2404 at around £50. Its large screen with 90s buttons means it’s great for those who are partially-sighted or just prone to forgetting glasses, or if you’re just tired of the smaller keyboards on some smartphones. The flip phone is created for senior citizens, but has all the basics you’re looking for, such as calls, texting, weather, and even a camera, plus FM radio, a calculator, and games. However, it should be noted these phone needs a micro SIM card. This will be a massive change from using an iPhone but is way more sturdy than an one too. If you’re looking for that satisfying slam that you can only get with a flip phone, but want something more stylish than the Doro, you might want to consider the Motorola RAZR, available on eBay for as little as £50? This phone is an echo of those teenage days where having a phone was cool – but it also allows you to take a little breather from social media without compromising on style. The phone requires a mini SIM card to run, which is slightly bigger those ones used in iPhones. Simple. Elegant. Understated. If you’re looking for something that just allows the basics, and can be droppedwithout too much damage, this phone is going for as cheap as £15.99 on eBay. What more is there to say – other than it also takes a mini SIM. With a tagline of ‘designed to be used less’, the Boring Phone 2 can be set up to have no internet browser, social media, mobile games or application store. Getting a tattoo could trigger blood cancer Major outage leaves thousands of customers unable to access banking app Cases of most deadly skin cancer soar to an all-time high Innocent woman branded a thief by AI facial recognition software However, it can have data messaging, voice and video calling which means you don’t need to give up the smart from a smartphone. However, this phone is not yet available, and is currently on a waitlist, which may be a good way to weigh up your options in whether you’re ready to give up your phone as it is now. The Nokia 3310 is not quite a brick phone, but still lasts (almost) forever. It comes in four vibrant shades and is a fun alternative to a smartphone, while still expressing your individuality. The phone can do the basics, includes retro games like Snake, and requires a micro SIM to work. Available now for £59.99, it’s just the product to try if you want to ditch a smartphone.

        "content": "May 28 2024 For the second consecutive year, the Middle East is the fastest-growing real-time payments market globally, according to the 2024 Prime Time for Real-Time report, published by ACI Worldwide (NASDAQ: ACIW), a global leader in mission-critical, real-time payments software, in partnership with GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company. In the Middle East, real-time payments are swiftly emerging as a bedrock of modern economies. With governments in the region implementing real-time payment schemes, businesses and consumers are experiencing tangible benefits, propelling the region into a new era of financial transformation and opportunity. The region saw a remarkable YoY growth of 33.6% in 2023 with 855 million real-time payment transactions, which is projected to grow to 3 billion by 2028, a 2023-2028 CAGR of 28.8%. Last year marked a significant milestone as Oman, Kuwait and Qatar each launched their national real-time payment schemes, joining the more established regional players such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE. With all six GCC member states now running real-time payment programs, transaction value in the Middle East is projected to rise from US$230 billion in 2023 to US$903 billion by 2028. Bahrain is one of the most developed payment markets in the Middle East, with real-time payments accounting for nearly 50% of the total payment volume in the country and the majority of all electronic payments. “Real-time payments eliminate payment friction, inject greater liquidity into the system, and promote economic growth and financial inclusion. Yet, their full potential can only be realized when banks transcend legacy silo systems. With real-time payment schemes now operational in every GCC nation, local banks are at a pivotal juncture where they must harness technological evolution as the catalyst for innovation. The path to innovation lies in modernizing and future-proofing their infrastructure, enabling them to fully leverage the potential of real-time payments,” said Santhosh Rao, Senior Vice President, Sales at ACI Worldwide MEASA. The surge in real-time and electronic payments signals the Middle East’s determined shift towards a cashless economy. In 2023, electronic transactions dominated, comprising over 50% of all transactions in the region and a staggering 95% of the transaction value. Notably, real-time payments accounted for 12% of the region’s electronic transactions last year, a figure set to soar to 22% by 2028, outpacing Europe and North America. The ACI report paints a compelling vision of a cashless economy — by 2028, cash-based transactions will dwindle to a mere 3% of all transaction value in the region. Drawing on the insights gained from the report’s analysis of factors driving the success of real-time payments in the countries that currently lead global adoption, Rao said, “Active collaboration is the cornerstone of a thriving real-time payment ecosystem, fostering an environment where banks must navigate a delicate balance of competition and cooperation with emerging market players. The world’s most successful real-time payment schemes, exemplified by India’s achievements, showcase a myriad of real-time payment methods via QR codes, mobile apps, or online accounts, pushing the boundaries of innovative use cases. With the Middle East leading the world in real-time payments growth, financial institutions should seize the opportunity to carefully study these successes and extract valuable insights to inspire the launch of their own pioneering real-time payment solutions.” Santhosh Rao ACI Worldwide ACI Worldwide News News Fintech News News",

        "description": "DALAM berbagai diskusi mengenai investasi sumber daya manusia, seringkali anak usia dini kurang disinggung dibandingkan kelompok usia lainnya. Padahal, periode usia lima tahun pertama",
        "content": "DALAM berbagai diskusi mengenai , seringkali kurang disinggung jika dibandingkan dengan kelompok usia lainnya. Padahal, periode usia lima tahun pertama sering juga disebut sebagai periode kritis atau bahkan disebut sebagai usia emas ( ). ECED Ecosystem Development Lead Tanoto Foundation, Fitriana Herarti mengatakan tidak semua orang memiliki pemahaman yang sama mengenai usia emas. Secara umum, usia emas menggambarkan periode usia tiga tahun pertama kehidupan. “Pada usia tersebut, tumbuh kembang anak berlangsung dengan sangat pesat, yang tidak akan terulang lagi pada periode selanjutnya. Pesatnya tumbuh kembang ini didasarkan dari hasil riset ilmu saraf dan perilaku selama beberapa dekade yang menghasilkan sejumlah fakta penting,” kata Fitriana, Selasa (28/5). Pertama, perkembangan otak dimulai sejak masa kehamilan hingga mencapai 80% di usia tiga tahun yang kemudian akan menjadi fondasi untuk semua capaian belajar, kesehatan, dan perilaku di periode usia selanjutnya. Kedua, interaksi dua arah (serve and return) antara orang tua atau pengasuh utama dengan anak menjadi kunci perkembangan otak yang optimal. Sebaliknya interaksi yang negatif justru akan menjadi penghambat. Ketiga, kapasitas otak untuk berkembang akan menurun dengan bertambahnya usia. Lebih efektif untuk mempengaruhi perkembangan otak pada usia dini daripada mengembangkan kapasitas otak di kelompok usia lainnya. Keempat, kesehatan mental dan fisik, keterampilan sosial, kemampuan berpikir, dan bahasa yang berkembang di usia dini akan menjadi fondasi yang kuat untuk anak supaya bisa mendapatkan hasil pembelajaran yang optimal, sukses di dunia kerja, dan memiliki kemampuan sosial yang baik. Kelima, pengalaman negatif anak di usia dini, misal mengalami kekerasan, pengabaian, maupun tidak terpenuhinya kebutuhan kesehatan dan gizi akan menghambat optimalisasi perkembangan otak. “Berbagai fakta tentang perkembangan otak tersebut menjadi sebab pentingnya keterlibatan aktif dan kapasitas yang memadai dari orang tua. Pengasuhan tidak lagi cukup didasari oleh insting ataupun meniru bagaimana dulu orang tua diasuh, terlebih karena anak usia dini memiliki kebutuhan spesifik yang berbeda dengan kelompok usia lainnya,” jelas Fitriana. Karena itu, pengasuhan di periode tiga tahun pertama, harus memastikan anak mendapatkan sejumlah hal, yang meliputi kesehatan yang baik, termasuk menerima semua imunisasi wajib, kebiasaan hidup bersih dan sehat sehingga anak terhindar dari infeksi berulang, misal diare, malaria, cacingan, campak, cacar, dll. Hal lainnya adalah Gizi yang mencukupi dengan memberikan Inisiasi Menyusu Dini (IMD), enam bulan ASI Eksklusif, Makanan Pendamping ASI (MP-ASI) bergizi seimbang mulai usia enam bulan, dan ASI hingga dua tahun. Selanjutnya, anak harus memperoleh pola asuh yang responsif, yaitu memberikan pengasuhan yang tanggap terhadap kebutuhan anak untuk mendapatkan kasih sayang, interaksi dua arah yang cukup, dan mampu mengenali perilaku-perilaku anak saat merasa tidak nyaman. Pada usia tersebut, anak-anak juga harus mendapatkan kesempatan untuk belajar pada anak usia dini melalui bermain dan interaksi sehari-hari dengan orang-orang, anak lain, dan lingkungan di sekitar anak. Terakhir adalah keamanan dan keselamatan, yakni memastikan anak berada dalam lingkungan yang aman, bebas kekerasan, terhindar dari ancaman kemiskinan yang mengakibatkan kebutuhan dasar anak tidak terpenuhi, serta penerapan disiplin positif dalam membentuk perilaku anak. Fitriana menjelaskan dari hasil studi yang dilakukan oleh Tanoto Foundation selama satu tahun kepada kelompok orangtua dengan anak usia 0-3 tahun di Jakarta, Pandeglang dan Kutai Kartanegara, diketahui bahwa orangtua yang menerima pelatihan dan pendampingan untuk meningkatkan keterampilan pengasuhan di 5 komponen di atas mampu membantu anak-anak mereka untuk mencapai peningkatan kemampuan di aspek berpikir, bahasa, motorik, dan sosial-emosional lebih dari anak-anak dari orangtua yang tidak mendapatkan pelatihan atau pendampingan. Hal ini menunjukkan betapa pentingnya pengetahuan, kesadaran dan keterampilan pengasuhan orangtua untuk pertumbuhan dan perkembangan anak usia dini, dan juga masih banyak orang tua yang belum memiliki pengetahuan, kesadaran dan keterampilan untuk melakukan pengasuhan yang baik, responsif dan cukup bagi anak-anak mereka di usia 0 hingga 3 tahun. “Studi ini juga menguji kualitas pengasuhan anak di rumah melalui instrument HOME (Home Observation for Measuring the Environment). Pada kelompok intervensi, peningkatan besar terlihat pada beberapa aspek utama pengasuhan anak, yaitu responsivitas dalam memenuhi kebutuhan dasar anak, pengelolaan kegiatan sehari-hari anak, ketersedian dan variasi bahan-bahan untuk belajar melalui bermain, serta keterikatan emosional anak dengan orangtuanya, dibandingkan dengan kelompok non-intervensi,” jelas Fitriana. Pengetahuan dan keterampilan mengenai pengasuhan anak usia dini juga penting untuk dipahami oleh para pengelola layanan pengasuhan sementara saat orangtua bekerja. Oleh karena itu Kementerian Pemberdayaan Perempuan dan Perlindungan Anak (Kementerian PPPA) pada 29-30 April 2024 menyelenggarakan bimbingan teknis kepada pengelola dan pengasuh Taman Asuh Ramah Anak (tempat pengasuhan sementara di jam kerja) dari 22 Kementerian/Lembaga, dan meminta Tanoto Foundation menyampaikan materi mengenai pengasuhan anak usia dini. Dalam layanan pengasuhan sementara penting untuk memastikan bahwa pengasuh memiliki pengetahuan tentang tumbuh kembang anak usia dini agar mampu memberikan stimulasi atau rangsangan perkembangan yang sesuai usia anak, menggunakan disiplin positif dalam mengelola perilaku anak, serta memahami penerapan gizi seimbang untuk konsumsi anak selama berada di tempat pengasuhan sementara. Selain sebagai narasumber dalam bimbingan teknis ini, Tanoto Foundation juga sebagai anggota komite teknis perwakilan ahli pengasuhan dalam penyusunan SNI (Standar Nasional Indonesia) Taman Asuh Ramah Anak. Salah satu standar layanan yang harus ada adalah kegiatan stimulasi perkembangan sesuai usia anak menjadi bagian dari kegiatan sehari-hari anak selama berada dalam layanan pengasuhan sementara.

Violent crime in Los Angeles has been on the rise, with the LAPD recording a 2.9 per cent increase at the end of March 2024, compared to the same time last year. The LAPD reported Friday that, as of the end of April, the city's rise in the number of murders in 2024 continued to decline and, as of April 27, was only 4.2 per cent above the number of murders reported at this time in 2023, NBC Los Angeles reported. The last time the force updated robbery statistics, at the end of March 2024, thefts were up 9.5 per cent, according to ABC 7. Around 600,000 catalytic converters are stolen each year. Most cars are equipped with one converter but those with a dual exhaust system require two. Larger vehicles such as SUVs and trucks may have more than two. According to the New York Times, stolen catalytic converters are passed through 'middlemen, smelters and refineries in the United States and overseas.' They can be stolen in under a minute and cost around $1,000 to replace.

        "content": "MAURICIO POCHETTINO remains the favourite to be the next Manchester United manager. The former Spurs and Chelsea manager - who left his role at Stamford Bridge last week -leads the race to take over from Erik ten Hag . But after United finished the season with somewhat of a flourish, are they in the market for a new manager this summer? That's the question for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and co, who witnessed the FA Cup win at Wembley and saw the respect Ten Hag had from the players and supporters after beating Manchester City. Wins over Newcastle and Brighton preceded it too. So is binning the Dutchman the right thing to do? Paddy Power make it 6/4 that he remains at Old Trafford next season and as low as 4/9 that he's replaced. So with it more likely he'll be gone, we look at the top candidates seemingly strongly in contention with the bookmakers. It's always appeared destined that Pochettino would be in charge at Old Trafford one day. The unfortunate thing for him and the club, it's just never appeared to be the right time. He was a strong, strong favourite prior to Ten Hag's appointment and he's always been into a project when the opportunity has arisen. Reports suggest INEOS hold him in 'high esteem' having tried to land him for Nice a couple of years ago which never materialised. Odds continue to plummet. Stellar time at Brighton but is on the move this summer. Disappointing domestic campaign as they struggle to balance the league and European football but style of football a huge plus. Had been linked with Chelsea and Bayern but they both look to be heading in different directions. So that doesn't leave too many more options at the top end. Played United in final game of the season at the Amex as Brighton boss. Was the 2-0 defeat a good audition? Tuchel had attracted most of the money in recent weeks following the news he'd be quitting Bayern in the summer. He lost out comfortably in the Bundesliga race - finishing a disappointing third in the end - and guided them to the semi finals of the Champions League . Has Premier League experience having coached Chelsea , guiding them to European glory too. He won 63 of his 100 games in charge of the club. Also played United twice earlier in the season, winning both home and away in Champions League group stage fixtures. Odds on the drift and now third favourite after being a short price at the start of the month. The Ipswich boss was seemingly well in contention for both the Chelsea and Brighton roles, though that has changed over the weekend. Odds shortened all week in this market and a return to United looked to be on the cards at one stage. His style of play at Ipswich was one thing but back-to-back promotions from League One to the Premier League has shown he's a winner and puts him in the shop window for a host of top clubs. Will that past work at United help or hinder his chances? Who knows. Odds on the drift. Southgate's name was thrown into the mix earlier on this year and he's remained strong in the betting markets since. The England boss was reportedly the number one choice of Sir Jim Ratcliffe during his takeover process, with new technical director Jason Wilcox also a fan. Southgate's potential appointment is said to be universally welcome by those in the club, including the United players. His contract with the FA runs out in December of this year, meaning this summer's Euros could be his last in charge - after shelving talks on his future until after the tournament. Regardless of the outcome, he could look to leave on a high should England finally get over the line, or admit defeat and hand the reins to someone else should they disappoint on the continental stage yet again. Either way, he could be looking for a fresh challenge after the summer and Old Trafford could present itself nicely. He's also worked with incoming sporting director Dan Ashworth at the FA, which also sways things in his favour. Paddy Power prices Earlier on this calendar year after a sticky spell for Ten Hag, it was GRAHAM POTTER (14/1) who dominated this particular market in the early parts of the season. Potter, who also has previous of working with Dan Ashworth at Brighton, has remained out of work since his sacking from Chelsea at the beginning of last year though has been linked with several top flight roles. Has met owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and no surprises should his odds be shortened still, though is reportedly being lined up for Brighton return. THOMAS FRANK (14/1) saw considerable support last week but his odds have drifted slightly following the events of the last week. The Dane revealed he was really happy at Brentford just a few days ago but could the lure of United take him away if they came calling?

        "description": "Thousands of patients are in dire need of matching stem cell donors to undergo life-saving transplants",
        "content": "By Our Bureau Comments READ LATER With only 0.09 per cent of the population registered as stem cell donors, there is a need for more people to join the stem cell registry, says DKMS BMST Foundation India, pointing to the severe shortage of donors. Patrick Paul, Chief Executive with the Foundation said, “In India, someone is diagnosed with blood cancer or a severe blood disorder every five minutes. Despite the global registry having over 41 million donors, India has only about 0.6 million registered. Thousands of patients are in dire need of matching stem cell donors to undergo life-saving transplants. We need to expand our donor database significantly, to provide these patients a fighting chance.” His words come against the backdrop of World Blood Cancer Day (May 28). DKMS-BMST is a joint venture of two non-profit organisations, BMST (Bangalore Medical Services Trust) and DKMS, one of the largest international blood stem cell donor centres in the world, a note from the Foundation said. The representatives urged healthy people between 18 – 55 years to register and volunteer to become a stem cell donor. Over a lakh people from India are diagnosed annually with blood cancer and disorders such as thalassemia and aplastic anemia, a note from the Foundation said. “For many of these patients, a blood stem cell transplant is their only hope for survival. While conventional methods like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are available, a blood stem cell transplant is often crucial for patients who are at high risk of relapse or who do not respond well to conventional treatments,” it added. Dr Nitin Agarwal, Head of Donor Request Management at the Foundation, pointed out that many people in India are unaware of what blood stem cell donation involves or have incorrect beliefs about the process. “It’s crucial to understand that matching for stem cell transplants, is based on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) characteristics, not just blood type. Education is key to dispelling these misconceptions and encouraging more people to register,” he said. Comments",

Thousands of protesters are gathering in Taipei as opposition lawmakers attempt to pass controversial legislation that could curb President Lai Ching-te’s authority. What Happened : Thousands of demonstrators assembled in Taipei on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. The protests erupted as opposition lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) and its allies in the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) sought to pass a contentious bill. The legislation would grant them greater investigative powers, potentially undermining President Lai Ching-te . Violent shoving matches broke out inside the legislature, echoing the unrest outside. Protesters expressed fears that the new powers could derail President Lai's agenda and lead to leaks of sensitive information. The proposed changes would allow lawmakers to summon the president, companies, and the public for questioning, and access confidential documents. Last week’s protests were among the largest since the 2014 Sunflower Movement, which saw demonstrators occupy parliament to block an unpopular trade pact with China. Inside the legislature, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers opposed the amendments, covering the chamber with placards and shouting slogans. See Also: Here’s What To Expect If Donald Trump Is Convicted As Jury Deliberations Begin Next Week The KMT, advocating closer ties with China, denies any external influence on the law. KMT lawmaker Ko Chih-en stated the reform reflects public opinion. President Lai, who was sworn in on May 20, faces potential challenges in implementing policies amid the legislative turmoil. Why It Matters : The protests come shortly after President Lai was inaugurated as Taiwan’s new president on May 20. Lai’s presidency marks a significant period for Taiwan. The legislative push by the KMT and TPP is seen as an attempt to limit Lai’s influence early in his term. Adding to the tension, a senior U.S. lawmaker recently confirmed that Taiwan’s ordered weapons are on their way , amid escalating military tensions with China. This development underscores the geopolitical stakes involved in Taiwan’s internal politics and its relationship with major global powers. Read Next: Biden Vs.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal might skip Wimbledon in a bid to be match-fit for 2024 Paris Olympics Rafael Nadal might miss Wimbledon, the grass court Grand Slam, in order to be match ready for the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics. The Spaniard, after his first-round exit at the ongoing 2024 French Open, opined it would not be ‘smart’ for him to compete in a Grand Slam right before the Olympics. Nadal was ousted from the French Open in the first round by fourth seed Alexander Zverev. This was the first time Nadal has exited the French Open, a tournament he has won a record 14 times, in the first round. Zverev won 6-3 ,7-6(5), 6-3. Zverev became the third player in the history of the sport to beat Nadal at Roland Garros, behind Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling. The 37-year-old southpaw opined that playing a Grand Slam (Wimbledon in this case) and the Olympics in quick succession wouldn’t be smart on his part, especially given he has been struggling to cope up with injuries. “I can’t confirm anything, but I don’t think it’s smart after everything my body has been through,” he said. Nadal explained the reason behind thinking of skipping Wimbledon. “It will be difficult playing on grass, considering that right after Wimbledon are the Olympic Games,” he said. Nadal won Wimbledon twice—in 2008 and 2010—but also endured some of his toughest moments at the All England Club. He last played in the tournament in 2022, when he was forced to withdraw before his semifinal against Nick Kyrgios with an abdomen strain.",

Another fresh thunderstorm warning is in place for Wednesday, May 29, which will start at 10am and end by 7pm.

Hail, lightning and strong winds are also expected, alongside an inch of rain which is expected to fall in the space of a couple of hours. In the warning , forecasters said: \"Heavy showers and thunderstorms will spread eastwards this afternoon before slowly fading later this evening. Where storms are particularly frequent 20 to 30 mm of rain may build up over 2 or 3 hours. Frequent lightning, hail and gusty winds will be additional hazards in some places.\" Meteorologists said in their warning: \"Early showers on Wednesday will become heavier and more widespread later in the morning for the afternoon. Where showers and storms develop they could be slow-moving and prolonged, bringing 15-20 mm of rain in less than an hour and potentially 30-40 mm in a few hours. Lightning and hail will be additional hazards.\" Scots are being told to be aware of potential flooding in their area and prepare an emergency kit if they are more susceptible to excess rainfall disrupting their home. Met Office forecasters said: \"Consider if your location is at risk of flash flooding. If so, consider preparing a flood plan and an emergency flood kit. Prepare to protect your property and people from injury. Before gusty winds arrive, check to ensure moveable objects or temporary structures are well secured.

        "content": "As a concerned resident of Honiara, I urge city officials to prioritize the installation of traffic lights and, if feasible, surveillance cameras in the Central Business District (CBD). The current lack of traffic management infrastructure poses significant risks to both public safety and efficient traffic flow. Honiara’s bustling CBD witnesses a constant stream of vehicles and pedestrians, creating a chaotic environment prone to accidents and congestion. Installation of traffic lights would not only regulate traffic but also enhance pedestrian safety, ensuring smoother and safer movement for all. Furthermore, the addition of surveillance cameras would provide valuable monitoring of traffic patterns and serve as a deterrent to reckless driving and criminal activity. By bolstering law enforcement efforts, we can create a safer environment for residents and visitors alike. It’s time for Honiara to prioritize the wellbeing of its citizens by investing in essential infrastructure that promotes safety and order. Let us work together to make our city a model of efficient traffic management and public safety. Sincerely,",

        "content": "Former nominated senator Millicent Omanga has told off a section of Kenyans criticizing the cost of President William plane to United States of America during his state visit. Omanga through her official X account on Tuesday, May 28, 2024, said the focus of Kenyans should not be on the cost of Ruto's US state visit. The politician-cum businesswoman pointed out that Kenyans should look at the benefits that came out of the trip, instead of scrutinizing it. Omanga, a close ally of President Ruto, said Kenyans should not lose the sight of an antelope for the squirrel. \"I think we are missing the point. In as much as it's within Kenyans' rights to scrutinize the president's state visit to the U.S, the focus shouldn't be on the cost of the visit but the benefits that accrued to Kenya. We shouldn't lose the sight of the antelope for the squirrel,\" she posted. I think we are missing the point. Inasmuch as it's within Kenyans' rights to scrutinise the president's state visit to the U.S, the focus shouldn't be on the cost of the visit but the benefits that accrued to Kenya. We shouldn't lose the sight of the antelope for the squirrel. President Ruto has been on the receiving end after he chartered a private jet for his trip to the US. Ruto left the country on Sunday, May 19, 2024, aboard a chartered Boeing 737-700 that was said to be operated by the Royal Jet of Dubai. The jet costs approximately Ksh98 million for a single trip from Nairobi to Atlanta, USA. A round trip could, therefore, surpass the Ksh200 million mark as the president also used the same jet to travel from Atlanta to Washington DC, a trip spanning two hours. Rarieda MP is among those who criticized the trip's cost, terming it extravagant. \"Mr President, let it be said clearly! Your USA trip was extravagant! Many heads of state travel cheaper! Worst of all, you then drag a limping KQ into it!\" the lawmaker posted on his official X account on Monday, May 27, 2024. Ruto, however, defended the cost of his trip, saying it was cheaper to charter a plane compared to using Kenya Airways. “Fellow Kenyans, I have noted concerns on my mode of transport to USA. As a responsible steward of public resources and in keeping with my determination for us to live within our means and that I should lead from the front in so doing, the cost was less than travelling on KQ,” Ruto said on May 26, 2024. Ruto's remarks sparked a debate, with a section of Kenyans criticizing him for justifying his expensive US trip. : :",

        "content": "The Covid-19 pandemic raged between 2019 to 2021, following which small waves of the virus were witnessed across the . As the world is just getting over Covid-19 after four years, a top British scientist warned that another pandemic is “absolutely inevitable”. The former chief scientific adviser to the British government, Sir Patrick Vallance, urged the UK government to prioritise preparations for the pandemic and emphasized that the country is “not ready” for it yet, reported. According to the report, Vallance, speaking at a panel event at the Hay Festival in Powys, stressed that the UK government must implement “better surveillance” to detect the threats of the virus. He also recommended some measures to prevent drastic steps during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatments. The top scientist believes that such measures could be implemented, however, it would require some coordination. “We know we have to have an army, not because there's going to be a war this year, but we know it's an important part of what we need as a nation. We need to treat this preparedness in the same way and not to view it as an easy thing to keep cutting back when there's no sign of a pandemic – because there won't be a sign of a pandemic,” he said, as quoted by The Guardian. According to the report, Vallance also said that by 2023, G7 had “sort of forgotten” his points about the pandemic preparations in 2021. “You can't forget about it,” he said. The British scientist, during the panel event, mentioned the World Organization's (WHO) pandemic accord, calling it a “positive step”. However, he also criticised its “lack of focus and urgency”. Last week, the WHO said that Covid-19 has cut global life expectancy by almost two years, wiping out a decade of progress. According to the UN health agency's world health statistics study, global life expectancy fell 1.8 years to 71.4 years – the same level it was in 2012. The study said that the amount of time an average person can expect to live in good health fell 1.5 years to 61.9 years in 2021. The Covid-19 pandemic raged between 2019 to 2021, following which small waves of the virus were witnessed across the world.",

        "content": "Michael Vi Nokia ( NYSE: NOK ) is set to secure a deal to supply 5G radio equipment to Portugal-based telecom operator MEO, Reuters reported, citing an internal company blog post and two people with knowledge of the matter. Nokia is geared up to secure the contract despite China's Huawei Technologies having being MEO's only supplier of 2G, 3G and 4G Radio Access Network, or RAN, equipment, the report added . The agreement has received a greenlight but has not yet been signed, and an announcement could be made as early as next month, as per the report. MEO, which was formerly known as Telecom Portugal and now a unit of France's Altice, is one of Portugal's leading mobile operators. \"In recent years, MEO ... has been supplied in RAN only by Huawei. In other words, Huawei has had a 100% market share in 2G/3G/4G. We have now been selected to replace Huawei in some of the key markets in Portugal,\" wrote Tommi Uitto, president of Nokia's mobile networks, in the internal company memo. The agreement would mark Nokia's return to Portugal's RAN market after it lost market share to Chinese tech giant Huawei several years ago and has not supplied any communications service providers with RAN in the nation since then, Uitto noted in the blog. RAN tools have generated the majority of telecom sales for companies such as Huawei, Nokia and Sweden-based Ericsson ( ERIC ) ( OTCPK:ERIXF ), however a decline in demand for new tools from telcos since last year has impacted Nokia and Ericsson, pushing them to cut thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, Huawei — which was banned in the U.S. and certain European countries over security concerns — still has some presence in the EU and is a major player in the telecom market in China.

Police in the area are appealing for information after parts of Tofthill Farm in Inchyra were damaged in a vandalism incident. Officers say the damage must have taken place between 5pm on Friday 24 May, and 10 am on Saturday 25 May. Those responsible for the overnight attack have yet to be traced, after the damage left 2,000 bees dead and multiple fresh strawberry plants ruined. The owners of the farm have released a statement saying how disappointed they are with the attack on their property, especially after an ‘incredibly difficult winter’ and during a time when food production in Scotland is becoming harder every year.

Aside from jumping on our equipment and damaging it, the most heart-breaking aspect of it is that some 2,000 bees were killed and dozens of fresh strawberry plants were maliciously damaged. “Bees are truly the most magnificent and efficient pollinators on any farm and it’s thanks to them that we all get fed. “After an incredibly difficult winter for farming, where it is getting harder and harder to produce food, we only have utter contempt for the individuals who have caused thousands of pounds worth of damage’.

        "content": "Judi Dench has suggested she has retired from acting because of her worsening eyesight. Asked by a reporter over the weekend at the Chelsea flower show if she had plans for future roles, Dench responded: “No, no, I can’t even see!” Representatives for the actor, 89, have indicated that there is nothing further to add. In Chelsea, Dench continued by saying she did have other projects in the pipeline, saying: “Our book has come out [ Shakespeare: The Man Who Pays the Rent ], we’re going to Cheltenham book fair and then I’m going to do three shows with Gyles Brandreth.” Dench lives with age-related macular degeneration, which affects more than 700,000 people in the UK. She has been open about her diminishing vision, telling Louis Theroux in 2022: “I don’t want to retire. I’m not doing much at the moment because I can’t see. It’s bad.” She added: “I have a photographic memory so a person saying to me, ‘This is your line ...’ I can do that.” Last year, she told the Sunday Mirror she was still continuing to try to find workarounds, but “I can’t see on a film set any more” ... “and I can’t see to read. But you just deal with it”. She continued: “It’s difficult if I have any length of a part. I haven’t yet found a way.” Dench has long been frank about the effects on her professional life of her condition, and the need for her to memorise lines orally before going on set. In 2021, she received an an Oscar nomination for her role in Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast , and appeared in a key role in Allelujah , Richard Eyre’s adaptation of the Alan Bennett play. Her last screen role was a cameo in 2022’s Spirited . ‘We fetishised being young – it’s just stupid!’: Judi Dench and Richard Eyre on ageing, Covid and saving the NHS Read more Dench has said she continues to work because “I have an irrational fear of boredom. That’s why I now have this tattoo that says carpe diem. That’s what we should live by.” Other key big screen roles include eight James Bond films and Shakespeare in Love, for which she won an Oscar. Dench has also had a sustained and highly successful stage career, winning a Tony and eight Olivier awards. Key TV shows include the sitcom As Time Goes By, with Geoffrey Palmer, and A Fine Romance, with her late husband, Michael Williams. Dench was at the Chelsea flower show being presented by a primary school pupil with the first seedling from the Sycamore Gap tree that was illegally felled last year. “I’ll be naming him Antonius,” she said, “the adopted son of the Emperor Hadrian.”",

        "content": "On Tuesday, UBS has downgraded stock of Asahi Intecc Co Ltd (7747:JP) (OTC: AHICF) from Buy to Neutral, significantly lowering the price target to ¥2,220 from the previous ¥3,660. The revision reflects concerns over the anticipated slow progress in new U.S. market fields and the unlikely improvement in valuation multiples due to substantial quarterly sales volatility in China. According to UBS, the slower-than-expected ramp-up of Asahi Intecc's new fields in the U.S. is due to the prevalence of bundled marketing strategies by leading companies, which may hinder Asahi's market share growth. Consequently, the firm has adjusted its forecast for the operating profit before goodwill amortisation for the fiscal year ending June 2026 to ¥26.9 billion, down from ¥30.9 billion. This figure falls below the IFIS consensus of ¥29.5 billion. In addition to the challenges in the U.S., Asahi Intecc's performance in China is also causing concern. Sales in China have been highly inconsistent, primarily due to the reliance on distributor-based marketing. This erratic sales pattern has led to a lack of earnings visibility, which UBS believes negatively impacts the company's valuation multiple. To align with these projections, UBS has also revised the price-to-earnings ratio (PER) estimate for Asahi Intecc, reducing it from 46.6X to a more conservative 29.6X. This adjustment is a direct reflection of the anticipated difficulties in the U.S. and China markets, which are key factors behind the lowered price target for the company's shares.

        "content": "Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said he is prepared to stay in his current role after the election and urged the country to choose stability over “chaos” by voting for the African National Congress. “If I am asked to serve I will serve,” he said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television with Jennifer Zabasajja. “What these elections are about — are about stability and chaos — and the ANC provides that stability.” South Africans vote on Wednesday, with Godongwana’s ruling ANC facing its toughest election fight since taking power in 1994. Opinion polls show ANC support dipping below 50%, which would force it into a coalition with a smaller rival. But recent rand strength suggests investors see it doing well enough to form a government without hooking up with parties to its left, which could push the country in a more populist and less market-friendly direction. Godongwana voiced confidence that the party will get over the line. “The ANC is working on the assumption that we’re going to have 50 plus one.”",

        "content": "It is \"very unlikely\" more survivors of Papua New Guinea's deadly landslide will be found, a UN agency warned on Tuesday, as thousands at risk from further slips were ordered to evacuate. Some 2 000 people are feared buried by a massive landslide that entombed a remote highland community in the early hours of 24 May. Since then, locals have been picking through a hellscape of metres-deep churned-up earth, uprooted trees and car-sized boulders in the search for loved ones - often using little more than their hands, shovels and digging sticks. But hopes are dimming that anyone is alive underneath the mountain of rubble. \"It is not a rescue mission, it is a recovery mission,\" Unicef Papua New Guinea's Niels Kraaier told AFP. \"It is very unlikely they will have survived.\" READ | 'We are racing against time': Fears of another slide as 670 bodies found in Papua New Guinea Full-scale rescue and relief efforts have been severely hampered by the remote location, the only road link being severed, heavy rainfall and nearby tribal violence. The Papua New Guinea Defence Forces have struggled to access the site with heavy earth-moving equipment. Early on Tuesday, Enga provincial administrator Sandis Tsaka warned the disaster could worsen further, as clumps of limestone, dirt and rock continue to shear off the side of Mount Mungalo. Tsaka told AFP authorities were now trying to coordinate the evacuation of almost 7 900 more people. He said: \"Every hour you can hear rock breaking - it is like a bomb or gunshot and the rocks keep falling down.\" Aid officials said many residents were refusing to leave at-risk areas because they were holding out hope of finding loved ones. Satellite images show the enormous scale of the disaster. A vast smear of yellow and grey debris can be seen cutting through once verdant bushland and severing the region's only road. \"This was an area heavily populated with homes, businesses, churches and schools, it has been completely wiped out. It is the surface of the moon - it is just rocks,\" said Tsaka. \"People are digging with their hands and fingers,\" he said, expressing anguish at the under-resourced government's inability to meet the enormity of the disaster. \"I am not equipped to deal with this tragedy,\" Tsaka admitted. Overwhelmed Papua New Guinea authorities held an online emergency meeting with United Nations agencies and international allies Tuesday, hoping to kickstart the relief effort. Papua New Guinea's national disaster centre has told the United Nations that the initial \"landslide buried more than 2 000 people alive\". According to a letter obtained by AFP, the slide also \"caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country\". The scale of the catastrophe required \"immediate and collaborative actions from all players\", it added, including the army, and national and provincial responders. Australia has announced millions of dollars' worth of aid, including emergency relief supplies such as shelters, hygiene kits and support for women and children. China's President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Joe Biden - more accustomed to scrapping for influence in the strategically located country - both offered assistance. More than 1 000 people have already been displaced by the catastrophe, aid agencies have estimated. UN Development Programme official Nicholas Booth said up to 30 000 people could have been cut off by the disaster across several villages. These communities had enough supplies for the coming weeks, but opening up that road remained essential, he said. \"This landslide has blocked the road westward, so not only are there challenges in accessing the village itself, but it does mean the communities beyond that are also cut off.\" Locals said the landslip may have been triggered by recent heavy rains. Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world, and research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could exacerbate the risk of landslides. The estimated death toll has climbed significantly since the disaster struck, as officials reassess the size of the population. Many people fleeing tribal violence have moved into the area in the past few years. The area is located about 600km from Port Moresby.",

        "content": "NIKKEI 225 (N225) Elliott Wave Analysis Trading Lounge Day Chart, NIKKEI 225 (N225) Elliott Wave technical analysis Counter Trend. Corrective. Orange Wave C. Navy Blue Wave 4. Navy blue wave 5. Orange wave B of wave 4 looking completed, now orange wave C is in play. Wave Cancel invalid level: 41239. The NIKKEI 225 Elliott Wave Analysis on the daily chart focuses on understanding the current market dynamics through the lens of the Elliott Wave Principle. This analysis identifies the function as a counter trend, indicating that the market is currently in a phase that moves against the prevailing trend. The mode of this movement is corrective, meaning it is a temporary retracement or consolidation within the larger trend. The primary wave structure under scrutiny is orange wave C, which is positioned within navy blue wave 4. This suggests that the market is in the fourth wave of a larger wave sequence, and specifically, within the third sub-wave of this fourth wave. The direction for the next higher degree is towards navy blue wave 5, which indicates that once the current corrective phase is complete, the market is expected to resume its primary trend direction in the fifth wave. Details from the analysis highlight that orange wave B of wave 4 is likely completed, setting the stage for orange wave C to come into play. Orange wave C is part of the corrective pattern and represents the final leg of the correction before the trend resumes. The completion of orange wave B signifies a pivotal point in the market, where the correction is likely moving towards its end phase, preparing for the continuation of the main trend. An invalidation level is set at 41239. This level is crucial because if the market price reaches or exceeds this point, it would invalidate the current wave count and necessitate a reevaluation of the wave structure. This invalidation level acts as a safeguard for traders, ensuring they can adjust their strategies if the market behaves unexpectedly. In summary, the NIKKEI 225 Elliott Wave Analysis on the daily chart provides a detailed outlook of the market's corrective phase within a counter trend. With orange wave B of navy blue wave 4 likely completed, the focus is now on orange wave C. Traders should be aware of the invalidation level at 41239, which serves as a critical point for reassessing the wave count. This analysis aids in making informed decisions by anticipating the next phase of market movement within the Elliott Wave framework. NIKKEI 225 (N225) Elliott Wave Analysis Trading Lounge Weekly Chart NIKKEI 225 (N225) Elliott Wave technical analysis Counter Trend. Corrective. Orange wave C. Navy Blue Wave 4. Navy Blue Wave 5. Orange wave B of wave 4 looking completed, now orange wave C is in play. 41239 The NIKKEI 225 Elliott Wave Analysis on the weekly chart provides insights into the market's current behavior using the Elliott Wave Principle. This analysis identifies the market function as a counter trend, indicating that the current movements are against the primary trend. The mode is corrective, suggesting a temporary retracement or consolidation phase rather than a continuation of the main trend. The primary wave structure being analyzed is orange wave C, which is part of a larger corrective pattern. This wave is positioned within navy blue wave 4, indicating that the market is in the fourth wave of a broader wave sequence. Following the completion of this corrective phase, the market is expected to proceed to navy blue wave 5, resuming the primary trend direction. The analysis details that orange wave B of navy blue wave 4 appears to be complete. This completion signals a critical point in the corrective pattern, as it suggests the market has finished the preceding segment of the correction and is now transitioning into orange wave C. This wave represents the final leg of the correction before the market resumes its main trend. A key aspect of the analysis is the invalidation level set at 41239. This level is crucial for traders and analysts because if the market price reaches or surpasses this point, the current wave count would be invalidated. This means the expected wave structure would no longer be valid, necessitating a reassessment of the market's wave patterns. The invalidation level serves as a safeguard, ensuring that strategies can be adjusted if the market does not behave as anticipated. In summary, the NIKKEI 225 Analysis on the weekly chart outlines a corrective phase within a counter trend. With orange wave B of navy blue wave 4 likely completed, the focus shifts to the development of orange wave C. This phase is critical as it marks the final part of the correction before the market resumes its primary trend towards navy blue wave 5. The analysis highlights the importance of the invalidation level at 41239, which helps in validating the current wave count and adjusting accordingly. Malik Awais.

Cheshire Police issued an appeal for information from members of the public after a 43-year-old man absconded from HMP Thorn Cross. He was last seen at the Appleton Thorn prison at around 6.30pm last Wednesday, May 22. The force said that the Arley Road prison inmate had links to Preston, but officers believed he could be further afield. However, Cheshire Police has today, Tuesday, confirmed that the prisoner was arrested in Lancashire last night, Monday. In its appeal, a force spokesman previously said: “Officers are currently carrying out a number of enquiries in a bid to trace him. “We are urging anyone with information as to his whereabouts to get in touch. “Anyone who sees him, or knows of his whereabouts, is urged not to approach him, but to call Cheshire Police immediately on 999.”",

        "content": "Conservative ministers and MPs are failing to \"get behind\" general election campaigning, a leaked memo from Tory headquarters sent days into the campaign has revealed. Rishi Sunak shocked the nation, and many of his party colleagues and supporters, by announcing the election would take place on July 4. It has reportedly led to consternation within the ranks with some candidates still to be selected. In Wales, there are still not candidates for every seat with less than six weeks to go to the election. The Conservatives have selected a number of seats as their priorities for the campaign. They are the Vale of Glamorgan, where Alun Cairns is MP; Ynys Mon, represented by Virginia Crosbie since the last election; Mid and south Pembrokeshire where Stephen Crabb is the candidate and Wrexham , where Sarah Atherton has been MP since 2019.

One was a constituency breakdown with what appeared to be sanitised comments. The other had the unvarnished thoughts of Conservative staff. The email was later recalled. The \"key theme\" identified in the document was that candidates had failed to “get behind” the campaign, with some on holiday or refusing to knock on doors. The email, reported by The Times , said Sarah Atherton, the MP for Wrexham, was accused of “refusing to engage” in the note, which said: “Wants to cancel this week’s campaigning sessions and stop CM [campaign manager] from running pre-scheduled campaigning sessions over weekend.” Ms Atherton, who shared a picture of herself on the campaign trail in Gwersyllt on May 24, has been contacted for comment. Her colleague Craig Williams, who represents Montgomeryshire, said on BBC Radio Wales: \"These internal memos come out from all parties all the time. I know Sarah, she is a class act and has been a terrific MP for Wrexham. I know for a fact, because I'm going up there to help her, that she's campaigning every single day. Whether she's engaging with one person or another person, I think that's immaterial.\" Join our General Election WhatsApp community by clicking on this link , and selecting 'Join Community'.

Disease control: Disease outbreaks pose a significant risk to poultry farms, requiring robust biosecurity measures and vaccination programs. Market competition: Competition from imported poultry products can impact local poultry farms’ market share and profitability. To overcome these challenges, AFPC Group implements several strategies. We invest in advanced technology and infrastructure to mitigate the impact of climate conditions and optimise production efficiency. We have stringent biosecurity protocols in place to prevent disease outbreaks and ensure the health and welfare of our birds. We maintain high standards of quality and safety in our products to differentiate ourselves from imported poultry products and retain customer trust. By proactively addressing these challenges, AFPC Group remains resilient and continues to thrive in Oman’s poultry industry.",

        "content": "LAGOS – Mr. Olaniyi Adigun, the Chairman, Aviation Ground Handling Association of Nigeria (AGHAN), has been conferred with the 2023 Aviation Personality of the Year award. The award was bestowed on Adigun at the 10th edition of the Nigeria Transport Lecture, organised by Nigeria Transport Award, publishers of the Transport Day, held on Thursday at Raddison Blu Hotel, Government Reserved Area (G.R.A), Ikeja, Lagos. The glamorous ceremony convened by Mr. Frank Kintum, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Transport Day, is an annual event where eminent personalities who have distinguished themselves in professional excellence and service to humanity in the private and public sectors are honoured. According to Kintum, Adigun was conferred with the special award in recognition of his huge contribution to the development of the aviation industry, especially the ground handling sub-sector where he has made a huge milestone in over three decades. Kintum explained that Adigun was selected for the award by the board and management of Transport Day after emerging tops in the polls conducted by the team. He specifically said that since Adigun was appointed the Chairman of AGHAN, he had been able to reposition the ground handling companies in the sector and worked endlessly to ensure a review of the former handling rates, which had been in existence in the last three decades. He said: “Mr. Olaniyi Adigun, the President of AGHAN was nominated for this honour after a rigorous exercise, which focused on his activities and achievements in the Nigerian aviation industry, spanning over three decades. Adigun through his works, has consistently promoted safety, which is the hallmark of the global aviation industry. “We want to use this medium to call on Adigun to continue to do more for the growth and development of the Nigerian aviation industry. To whom much is given, much more is expected from him.” In his speech, Adigun thanked the organisers of the event for finding him worthy to be selected for the honour. He also expressed delight at the achievements of AGHAN, but maintained that the association and the successes recorded were not about him, but its entire members. He added that the award had thrown AGHAN up for more good work. He said: “I feel very elated, appreciated and privileged to be awarded as the Aviation Personality of the Year 2023 after a long effort that we put into the sector, especially in the ground handling sector of the industry. “It is unfortunate that the ground handling sub-sector of the aviation industry has not been given fair deal and attention by the government and its agencies, but some organisations in the sector have realised the enormous work that we do and awarded me the honour. “Like I do say, the government and its agencies are always losing money because of unfair competition in the handling sub-sector of the industry, especially between the two major ground handling companies. AGHAN as a body, has been trying to bring the major competitors together for the enhanced Nigerian economy and we pray this will work out very soon and for the betterment of the industry and the country at large.” He regretted that the airlines were taking full advantage of the unhealthy competition between the two major ground handling companies, but said since AGHAN came onboard a few years ago, such unwholesome practice had reduced to the barest minimum. Adigun came into the aviation industry in 1993 as a staff of the defunct national carrier, Nigeria Airways. At the Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO), he rose through the ranks to become its Executive Director, Sales & Marketing from 2018- 2024. During his stay, the department was able to implement various sales and marketing strategies that increased the company’s revenue significantly, while its number of clienteles increased tremendously. Adigun was also appointed the pioneer Chairman of AGHAN in 2021.",

        "content": "It has been almost two years since Joaquin Domagoso became a father to his son, Scott. In his interview on Tuesday's \"Fast Talk with Boy Abunda,\" the Sparkle star shared that the little boy has started schooling. \"I'm happy where my son is. He started school officially, so congrats to little Scott. Every day, new memories are being made,\" Joaquin said. The young actor said that he stands by the decisions he made. \"My career won't stop itself because of my decisions because my will is as strong as my love for my son,\" he said. When asked what he discovered about himself as he goes through fatherhood, Joaquin said, \"That I can work harder than I think I can't. There are things na before, I feel like, 'Hindi, kaya ko 'yon, pabayaan na, 'wag na.'\" Now that he is already a dad, Joaquin said that he has also become a role model. \"Kumbaga if I don't do these things, my son won't—'di niya ako susundan,\" he said. \"And there are other things na, kumbaga, work. Working a 9-5 job, realizing it how other people would go through it. 'Yung tipong you wake up for your son, you do all these things. Tapos 'yung at the end of the day, uuwi ka, hinihintay ka pa rin. All the joys. 'Yung purpose ko sa buhay, nabuo.\" Joaquin did not share much about his current relationship status. \"Sa aking love life ngayon po, I don't want to say anything too much, but right now, I'm in a very happy place,\" he said. Joaquin's dad, Isko Moreno , first revealed in July 2022 that Joaquin had welcomed a baby boy with Raffa Castro . In a previous interview on the show, Joaquin admitted that he felt scared of becoming a father , but his father was supportive about it. \"He was dancing.

Join the debate on our social media channels Manager Martin Paterson has left Burton Albion after the club narrowly avoided relegation from League One, BBC Radio Derby reports. The role at Pirelli Stadium was the 37-year-old former Swansea City, Barnsley and Inter Miami assistant manager's first job in charge of a senior side. Thoughts? “It’s been in the works for a while. I’m really looking forward to getting started. “I had positive chats with the manager and it’s a club with real potential with the project and the plans that he has got in place. “The run the club went on towards the end of last season made everyone pay attention. It’s a good club with a good manager and I’m hoping we can do good things.” League Two champs Stockport County have a new man. Jay Mingi has joined from Colchester. Notts County have signed Bradford City defender Matty Platt on a two-year contract - the League Two club's first summer signing. Platt, 26, moves to Meadow Lane on a free transfer following two years with the Bantams. He moved to Valley Parade after three years at Barrow, who he helped win promotion back to the Football League Two in 2020. \"Jay had a fantastic back end of the League Two season at Colchester,\" \"He showed his versatility and intelligence, switching from a familiar central midfield role to wide centre-back, right-back and right wing-back at times. “We believe he has real potential to develop, whilst immediately having the physical characteristics of being on the front foot, aggressive and quick, which will allow him to flourish in League One.\" \"It became apparent during the review that the club and Pete had different perspectives on the way forward,\" \"So it was mutually agreed that this was the best and most appropriate way to proceed. \"We wish Pete well in his future endeavours.\" What do you make of Pete Wild’s sacking?

        "description": "A landslide that occurred in Papua New Guinea is believed to have buried over 2,000 people. Experts are attributing this disaster to massive tectonic forces, tribal conflicts, and the presence of mosquitoes, trying to understand the severity of the situation. Papua New Guinea is known as one of the most disaster-prone nations globally.",
        "content": "PORT MORESBY: A landslide in Papua New Guinea is feared to have buried more than 2,000 people, with experts pointing to colossal tectonic forces, tribal clashes and mosquitoes to make sense of the crisis. One of the most disaster-prone nations in the world, Papua New Guinea occupies a slice of the southwest Pacific that is frequently battered by earthquakes, flooding and volcanic eruptions. But even by these volatile standards, the emergency unfolding in the highlands of Enga province could rank among the country's most lethal natural disasters . Here's why: The bustling highlands community on the shoulder of Mount Mungalo was destroyed when a landslide struck in the early hours of Friday morning. Scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them were buried beneath an avalanche of boulders, mud and uprooted trees. Papua New Guinea sits atop the seismic Ring of Fire, an arc of intense tectonic activity that stretches through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin. \"Papua New Guinea sits right on a plate boundary, where these large, rigid parts of the earth plough into each other,\" University of Adelaide geologist Alan Collins told AFP. \"This creates mountains, steep slopes and other extreme topography. \"You have these steep slopes located in an area of heavy rainfall, and this can rot the minerals in the rocks, and gradually weaken them.\" Human influences, such as the clearing of native forests, made the slopes of these highland mountains even more precarious. \"You put all of those things together, and you can create a very unstable environment,\" Collins said. Lying just south of the equator, Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world. Research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could further exacerbate the risk of landslides. As disaster workers entered the remote disaster zone, they realised population estimates failed to account for dozens of families seeking sanctuary in the area. Serhan Aktoprak, chief of the United Nations ' migration agency in Papua New Guinea, said the \"internally displaced\" Tulpar people had moved into the village \"as they escaped from another tribal conflict elsewhere\". Highland clans have fought each other in Papua New Guinea for centuries, but a recent influx of mercenaries and automatic weapons has inflamed tensions. The Red Cross estimates as many as 30,000 people are displaced by tribal violence in Papua New Guinea every year. Papua New Guinea has one of the least concentrated urban populations in the world. Some 40 percent of people are thought to eschew its coastal cities in favour of highland regions in the country's interior. The highlands are a mix of rolling jungle mountains, dense tropical rainforests and twisting river valleys. Nestled amongst this unforgiving terrain are some of the fastest growing and most densely packed communities in the country. There are myriad factors that could explain this, including high rates of polygyny, falling death rates and long-formed attachments to ancestral homelands. Most highland communities occupy a kind of \"goldilocks zone\", sitting at altitudes between 1,400 metres (4,600 feet) and 2,600 metres high. Researchers have found this helps them stave off the risk of malarial infections that run rampant through lower-lying areas. Reliable census figures are notoriously difficult to get in Papua New Guinea, hampered by the difficult terrain, severe weather, and remoteness of many communities. While the country's official population is given as 10 million, some demographers suggest the number of citizens could be almost twice as high. Enga provincial administrator Sandis Tsaka said officials had first gauged the size of the disaster-struck community using an outdated electoral roll that only counted those 18 and older. These initial underestimates of the community's population helped to explain why death toll figures have jumped around so much. Early estimates in the immediate aftermath of the landslide suggested a death toll between 100 and 500 people. Days later these figures would be drastically revised by the country's National Disaster Centre -- which stated \"more than 2,000 people\" were feared to be \"buried alive\". It could take weeks before anything near a definitive number emerges. Papua New Guinea's northern coast was swamped by a 10 metre (30 foot) tsunami in 1998, killing more than 2,200 people in one of the country's worst natural disasters.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email In the world of finance where new changes are occurring at a very fast pace, investments through conventional finance and the incorporation of technology like artificial intelligence are not just a trend but a revolution. This fusion is empowering the investment ecosystem for transparency, open access, and future-readiness bringing financial opportunities closer to everyone. At the center of this process, there are two key areas – artificial intelligence and blockchain, which are actively getting involved in the recreation of people’s vision of investments. Big data, through the use of artificial intelligence and other predictive analytical tools, is enhancing the opportunities for making sound investment decisions while blockchain is the godsend for truly secure financial transactions. In parallel, the mentioned technologies are providing the foundation for new trends like tokenized assets, decentralized finance (DeFi), and relatively a new approach – DeFi or Regenerative Finance, based on the investment in social and environmental initiatives. Thus, Tokenized assets with the help of blockchain technology, it is a step forward. In essence, through the tokenization of physical assets using blockchain, investors can own a fraction of the asset because the technology subdivides the ownership rights to the underlying asset into smaller portions. This democratization of assets applies to various fields of the economy and have started with real estate assets, artworks, and even unique rarities. Furthermore, AI occupies a crucial place in this environment because it offers the instruments for the precise analysis of the great amount of information and anticipating market behaviors. For instance, using AI algorithms is possible to detect attractive investments’ options in real-time and thus maximize investment outcomes. We observe this symbiotic relationship between AI and blockchain in such areas such as digital coins and tokens that have become fashionable. These digital assets usually have initial and/or subsequent rewards where more or new coin holders are bestowed with free tokens making the cryptocurrency investment more attractive and easily accessible. This though creates the potential of making huge profits through these unique financial entities. _algoic trading strategies are capable of making trades in a very short time and exploiting gaps in the overall market that may not be apparent to a human trader. While the above mentioned transactions have a lot of possibility of being fraudulent or manipulated, with the use of blockchain, it maximizes the security and transparency as well. This high-performance, high-speed, highly effective system is a significant improvement and will be of tremendous help to experienced investors and newcomers alike. Moreover, establishing ReFi as the trend of investment with an aim is proving to be rather popular. As integrated AI and blockchain solutions, ReFi projects work to create positive social and environmental impacts alongside solutions for money. Such projects may involve climate change solutions like energy generation from natural sources, efficient farming, and social justice products, which give individuals an opportunity to invest in the future and generate profits. Another work in progress key feature of the evolution of the investment landscape is decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. These platforms utilize blockchain technology to dispose of the middlemen and cut the costs but at the same time improved efficacy. DeFi puts people in the position of providing and requesting funds, goods, or services, with others and often presents artificial intelligence solutions to perform the necessary operations. Due to this transparency, all transactions made and captured in the block chain are traceable by the public thereby minimizing on cases of disputations and increasing trust among the players involved. Furthermore, the usage of airdrop has evolved as a vital strategy for attracting the community and involving the users in the DeFi ecosystem. It explains how through providing a variety of tokens users with free tokens DeFi projects can gain popularity very quickly and encourage people to engage in activities within their platforms. Integrating AI into Defi platforms enhances some of the functionality of DeFi platforms in the following ways. AI can be applied to identify users’ behavior and patterns, market trends and fluctuations, and provide recommendations on which investments should be made, how they should be distributed, and which direction the market is likely to take nex so you can make moneyt. Such level of customization and idea of future in financial aspect was beyond the boldest scenario in traditional finance. Furthermore, it is capable of analyzing unstructured data hence can include social feeds, oil price changes, Acts of God, tweets erratically, and any other issues that relate to investment. They integrate this approach to make sure that AI driven investments not only yield higher returns but are also immune to instabilities in the market conditions. To conclude, the integration of the traditional financial industry with top-notch technological solutions such as the use of AI and blockchain technologies is making the investment environment more comprehensive and effective. The decentralization of possibilities and the mitigation of risks, through using Artificial Intelligence in trading, and by means of tokenization, the advent of DeFi, ReFi – these trends are contributing towards a more open and explicable approach to investments. As to the possibilities of earning money through these new financial tools, the prospect can be very high, and it opens a new vista to all those involved in the financial market whether a new player or an experienced investor. It can, therefore, be concluded that as we advance in the future, the promotion and application of such advanced technologies are bound to come up with more groundbreaking specialty investment and consequently yield a positive future for a worthy better future for generations.

        "content": "El Salvador, the smallest and most densely populated country in Central America, is experiencing a significant economic transformation. With over 80 companies establishing their operations in the nation, it’s becoming a hub for diverse business activities. This surge in corporate presence is a testament to the country’s strategic efforts to diversify its economy and create a more conducive environment for business growth. Historically, El Salvador’s economy was heavily reliant on agriculture, with coffee exports being the primary source of revenue. However, the turn of the century marked a pivotal shift as the country adopted the U.S. dollar as its official currency, paving the way for increased trade and financial links. This move, coupled with the expansion of the manufacturing sector, has reduced the nation’s dependence on coffee and positioned it as an attractive destination for international businesses. The list of companies operating in El Salvador is diverse, ranging from financial institutions like the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador to telecommunications giants such as Claro El Salvador and Tigo El Salvador. The country also boasts a vibrant media landscape with entities like El Faro and La Prensa Gráfica, reflecting a robust mass media sector.

In recent years, El Salvador has seen a rise in startups and innovative companies, further enriching its economic landscape. Companies like Cubo, which supports small businesses with digital payments, and intmax, a developer of blockchain platforms, are prime examples of the new wave of tech-driven enterprises flourishing in the country. These startups not only contribute to the economy but also bring fresh ideas and technologies to the forefront. The retail sector in El Salvador is not left behind, with companies like SIMAN and Supermercados Super Selectos providing a wide range of consumer goods. The Unicomer Group, a retailer of durable goods and electronics, signifies the growth potential in the consumer services industry. El Salvador’s commitment to nurturing a business-friendly environment is evident in its support for these companies. The government’s initiatives to streamline business operations, enhance legal frameworks, and invest in infrastructure have played a crucial role in attracting and retaining businesses. The influx of companies in El Salvador is a positive indicator of the country’s economic health and its potential for future growth. It’s a narrative of resilience and strategic adaptation, showcasing how a nation can pivot from traditional economic models to embrace globalization and technological advancements. Moreover, El Salvador’s adoption of the U.S. dollar as its official currency has streamlined financial transactions and bolstered investor confidence. This economic stability, coupled with the government’s efforts to diversify the economy, has made the country an attractive destination for foreign investment. The presence of these companies signifies a positive shift in El Salvador’s economic landscape, promising a future of prosperity and opportunity. As El Salvador continues to welcome businesses from around the globe, it stands as a testament to the resilience and entrepreneurial spirit of its people. As El Salvador continues to welcome businesses from various sectors, it stands as a beacon of economic opportunity in Central America. The country’s journey is a compelling story of transformation, one that other nations looking to revitalize their economies can learn from. El Salvador’s progress serves as a reminder that with the right policies and a focus on innovation, even the smallest countries can make a significant impact on the global economic stage.",

        "content": "PORT MORESBY — Papua New Guinea authorities say nearly 7,900 people living near the site of a deadly landslide are \"at risk\" as rock and debris continue to move down the hillside. An alert for potential evacuation has been put out, with a province official saying the mountain remains \"very active\". Rescuers say it is increasingly unlikely that victims will be found alive in the rubble. The country's disaster agency says it fears about 2,000 people were buried when a mountainside collapsed last Friday. This is much higher than the UN's estimate of about 670 victims. The UN says it has been difficult to establish an exact death toll as access to the site and those buried under the mass remain difficult. Part of that is due to complications around the search and recovery mission, which has now largely turned into a retrieval operation of bodies, various UN officials have said. \"It is not a rescue mission, it is a recovery mission,\" Niels Kraaier from Unicef Papua New Guinea told news agency AFP. \"It is very unlikely they will have survived.\" Only six bodies had been recovered as of Tuesday, according to local officials. Villagers have been using using shovels, sticks and their bare hands to try and remove huge rocks and rubble amid hold-ups in the arrival of heavy machinery, and also cultural sensitivities around the use of such machines like excavators near bodies. Standing in a crowd of mourners on Monday, local resident Jiman Yandam said people would keep digging manually to try and recover victims. \"We don't know where the bodies are buried, but we will not give up, we will keep going,\" the former community leader told Reuters news agency. One woman, standing in the wreckage, described feeling helpless. \"I have 18 of my family members buried under the debris and soil that I am standing on, and a lot more family members in the village I cannot count,\" Evit Kambu said. \"But I cannot retrieve the bodies so I am standing here helplessly.\" The terrain remains dangerous as rocks continue to fall. Videos taken during the day have shown rocks tumbling down the mountain. “It’s still very active. The mountain is breaking up, \" Sandis Tsaka, Enga Provincial Administrator told the BBC. \"There’s continuous movement of rock and debris which is making our search and rescue and recovery operations a challenge,\" he added. The rubble remains 10m deep in some places and the mass of debris is still moving down the hillside, prompting authorities to alert nearby communities to the risk and issuing evacuation notices. \"Because of the landslide, the impact area of the landslide is gradually increasing. So the homes and properties that were not affected by the original landslide area are growing every day,\" Mr Tsaka said. Another village close to the first-hit Yambali village was now also in danger, he said. There is also growing alarm over the risk of infection and disease in the area as the mass of bodies trapped under the rubble begin to decay. The UN had warned that currents were flowing down the hillside under the rubble. \"The water that is stuck between the ground and the debris is flowing - and the bodies are starting to decay. Can you image [the impact] on more than 2,000 bodies buried under this land- unable to be removed,\" UN migration agency official Serhan Aktoprak told the BBC on Tuesday. Amid the treacherous conditions, aid groups say they are focusing on the immediate task of getting basic supplies like food, water and hygiene kits to residents. But there have been several barriers- including the highway to the village being blocked and damaged by the landslide. ​On Tuesday, it was reported that a bridge south of the landslide area, connecting province centers Hagen and Wabeg, had also collapsed making it more difficult for humanitarian groups delivering relief. Australia has pledged an airlift of supplies which is expected to arrive on Wednesday. Local officials say about 3,800 people had been living in the hillside village prior to the landslide, which took place around 03:00 on Friday morning and flattened more than 150 homes. The mountain's collapse has been attributed to weeks of heavy rain and other wet conditions in the area. Prime Minister James Marape had earlier in the week sent his condolences and directed national response teams to the region. The disaster comes as Mr Marape faces political pressure - parliament was expected to vote on a no-confidence motion against him on Tuesday. — BBC < Previous Page Next Page >",

        "description": "Cancer Research UK said around 17,000 melanoma cases every year are preventable",
        "content": "Melanoma skin cancer cases are at an all-time high, with 20,800 people expected to be diagnosed this year in the UK. Analysis by Cancer Research UK shows rates of melanoma have increased by almost a third over a decade, from 21 to 28 per 100,000 people between 2007-09 and 2017-19. Among those aged over 80, there was a 57% rise, while among those aged 25 to 49 there was a 7% increase. Cancer Research UK said around 17,000 melanoma cases every year are preventable, with almost nine in 10 caused by too much ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV from the sun can damage DNA in skin cells and cause skin cancer. The charity advises people spend time in the shade, especially between 11am and 3pm; cover up with clothes, a wide-brimmed hat, UV-protection sunglasses and a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and 4 or 5 stars, applied often. Cancer Research UK's chief executive, Michelle Mitchell, said: \"Survival from cancers including melanoma continues to improve, demonstrating the substantial progress made possible by research. But it's vital that people try to reduce their risk of getting the disease in the first place. \"Make sure to take care in the sun and contact your GP if you notice any unusual changes to your skin whether a new or changing mole, a sore that doesn't heal, or an area of your skin that looks out of the ordinary. Spotting cancer early can make all the difference.\" According to the charity, younger people are more aware of the link between the sun and skin cancer than those who are older, who may have taken advantage of the \"cheap package holiday boom\" from the 1960s onwards. Other factors driving up cases include a growing and ageing population and improved awareness of the symptoms of skin cancer. Figures show, however, that more people are surviving melanoma, with deaths expected to continue to fall. Almost nine in 10 adults diagnosed with melanoma in England will now survive their disease for a decade or more. Dr Claire Knight, senior health information manager at Cancer Research UK, said: \"Getting sunburnt just once every two years can triple the risk of developing skin cancer, compared to never being burnt. Whether you are enjoying the good abroad or here at home, it's important to protect yourself from too much sun, especially if you burn easily.\" \"Remember that sunburn doesn't only happen when it's hot it can happen on cooler or cloudier days too. The best way to protect your skin when the sun is strong is to use shade, clothing and sunscreen together. \"Seek shade in the middle of the day, cover up with a shirt that covers your shoulders, a hat and sunglasses and wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and 4 or 5 stars. Make sure you put plenty on and reapply it regularly.\" Last month, experts told how the world's first personalised mRNA cancer jab for melanoma which also has the potential to stop lung, bladder and kidney cancer is being tested in British patients. The \"gamechanger\" jab, which offers hope of a cure, is custom-built for each person in just a few weeks. A stage 2 trial of the jab, involving pharma firms Moderna and MSD, found it dramatically reduced the risk of the cancer returning in melanoma patients. A final phase 3 trial is now running, led by University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH).",

        "content": "NAIROBI, Kenya, May 28 – The Council of Governors have lauded Members of Parliament for reaching a consensus to allocate Sh400 billion to devolved units following protracted battles between the two houses on the shareable revenue allocation. The County Bosses expressed their gratitude to Senators for remaining adamant to push the shareable revenue to counties upwards by Sh9 billion in the incoming financial year 2024/2025 which commences in June. “Devolution is sacrosanct in the constitution and adequately resourcing functions that counties are mandated to deliver is progressive and a welcome move,” COG chairperson Waiguru stated. The mediation team of the two houses reached a consensus following differing proposal as the Senate initially pushing to have Counties allocated Sh415 billion while the National Assembly wanted the counties allocated Sh391 billion. The stalemate on the matter was ironed out after the Senate and National Assembly reached an agreement over the allocation for shareable revenue in the financial year 2024/2025 following days taken in lengthy deliberations. National Assembly Budget Committee Chairman Ndindi Nyoro who co-chaired the talks exuded confidence that progress had been made. “The Senate has agreed to reduce their figure by Sh15 billion while the National Assembly has agreed to push up its earlier figure by Sh9 billion in the spirit of give and take so that we can resolve this matter and allow Counties to get their increased allocation from Sh385 billion in the last financial year,” Nyoro stated. Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi who co-chaired committee called upon county bosses to ensure championing of development in their respective counties through prudent use of resources. “We have held lengthy deliberations and we are all in agreement that devolution I’d working and that it should be supported by ensuring that counties get sufficient funds to carry out the devolved functions,” Murungi said. Senate Speaker Amason Kingi and National Assembly Speaker Moses Wetangula appointed nine members each to join the mediation team so as to iron out the stalemate that would have affected the counties. Murungi and Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro were elected as the co- chairmen for the mediation committee. Wetangula appointed Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, Teso South MP Mary Emase, Ugenya MP David Ochieng, Alego Usonga MP Samuel Atandi, Kapenguria MP Samuel Moroto,Kitutu Chache North MP Japheth Nyakundi,Samburu West MP Naisula Lesuuda, Kitui Central MP Makali Mulu, and Garsen MP Ali Wario to be members of this team. Kingi appointed Senate Deputy Speaker Kathuri Murungi, Homa Bay Senator Moses Kajwang, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Nairobi Senator Edwin Sifuna, Isiolo Senator Fatuma Dullo, Uasin Gishu Senator Jackson Mandago, Machakos Senator Kavindu Muthama, Marsabit Senator Mohammed Chute and Migori Senator Eddy Oketch to be members of the committee.

Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters A woman was left gobsmacked after scooping an incredible £20million in the lottery - after being given the lucky ticket as a gift. The winner, from the Melbourne suburb St Albans, hadn't rushed to check the QuickPick Powerball results after being given the present, but when she did, her life changed forever. The woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, ended up splitting the jackpot with another lucky player, with them both walking away with a whopping A$40million (£20.8m), The Mirror reports. Speaking after her win in May 2022, she said that she was \"still shocked\" by the stunning turn of events and revealed plans to buy her dream home , support her loved ones, and do some globetrotting . She said: \"I've barely slept since I discovered the win. It's hard to put the feeling of knowing you've won $40million into words. I don't think it's truly hit me yet. \"The ticket was a gift, but I didn't check it immediately. When I did check it though, I immediately called out to my family and they were just as shocked as I was. \"There were definitely plenty of cheers and tears. First and foremost, I'll be looking to help my family and share it with them. \"I'll need some time though to think about what else to do. I'll obviously buy a home, and I'd love to travel to Japan and the United States. I'd love to go everywhere. \"You always wonder about what you would do if something like this were to happen, and now it has happened, I have no idea what to do.\" Yen Le-Mai, the owner of Sunshine Marketplace Lotto where the winning ticket was sold, expressed her delight at the surprising win. She said: \"I was oblivious to it until a friend of mine contacted me to congratulate me on selling the winning ticket. At that moment, I felt I'd personally won. I was so excited and overwhelmed by the news.\" Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

Whatever doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Lauga, the state’s assistant health minister, said in a social media statement on May 4 that hospital tests revealed “the presence of drugs in my body which I did not take”. Those drugs “impacted me significantly,” she claimed. She declined to talk specifically about the night in question in the interview with 7NEWS on Tuesday. Queensland police have confirmed they are investigating her sexual assault complaint. Lauga again thanked the community for its “amazing” support, also saying that “many, many people” have told her of having their drinks spiked “in this region”. “I do think we should be able to enjoy socialising in our towns without this kind of rot happening,” she said.",

The firm directly informed the media following the incident, after it failed to do so previously. To address the breach and mitigate the damage, the firm has brought in cybersecurity experts from Sygnia. Currently, a thorough investigation is underway to determine the full extent of the breach and assess its potential consequences. 2 View gallery ( Photo: Shutterstock ) \"Sygnia, the company handling the cyber incident, is conducting the necessary checks to examine the possible attack. We've instructed them to invest all required resources to complete the investigation as soon as possible,\" the firm said in an email to clients. \"Although the attack isn't confirmed at this point, we found it appropriate to notify our clients. The firm is working closely with the National Cyber Directorate, and the suspected breach has been reported to the Privacy Protection Authority.

        "content": "ONE of the stars from EastEnders has slammed his house builder after being left in an 'unsuitable home'. The soap actor posted a comedy video onto social media as he pranced about in his unfinished new home. Liam Hatch, 27, is one of the newest cast members of the long-running BBC soap. He recently joined the square as bad-boy Logan in a recent storyline where he bullied Amy Mitchell (Ellie Dadd). His group also beat up both Denzel Danes ( Jaden Ladega ) and Yolande Trueman ( Angela Wynter ) in horrific scenes. However, it seems the EastEnders actor and personal trainer had a huge drama of his own at his new home. He took to social media in an attempt to raise attention, after he failed to get adequate answers by the building company. Liam recently moved into a new-build home, but he claims he was left with no flooring and wonky windows. He also claimed that he cannot house his household appliances and that loose screws dug into his feet. The star posted a sarcastic dancing video to the track 'Faith' by George Michael from his abode. The unfinished flooring and lack of furniture was clearly seen as he jokingly praced around the kitchen and garden of the property. In the captions he wrote a long essay which read: \"Bought a new house... 🏡 *CUT THE CELEBRATION* 🎉 ❌. \"We have floors unsuitable to lay on, we have screws digging into my feet, we have wonky windows and a cupboard not straight to fit my washing machine in, and to top it all off they ain’t answering the emails....but...we have faith.\" \"I have seen many negative comments with no reply... I’m here to make sure people’s voices are heard. @taylorwimpey 👀\" After tagging the company, he finished the post with a string of sarcastic hashtags as he lamented the seemingly unfinished job. The Sun has approached Taylor Wimpey for comment. This comes after fans were recently shocked after they discovered Liam's real age and his racy Instagram account . Despite appearing as a teenager in a school uniform in the soap, making him no older than 16, Liam is in fact 27 in real life. When he isn't working as an actor, he has a side hustle as a personal trainer and online coach. Aside from this new video, the rest of his Instagram account is full of shirtless pictures of him working out at the gym. He's also partial to showing off his rear end as A number of pictures on his profile page show him posing outside, facing away from the camera totally naked.",

        "content": "Brooks will stay at Weymouth for a 10th campaign in claret and blue, meaning he could reach the 350-game landmark next term. The Weymouth vice-captain currently has 337 appearances, with 31 goals and 30 assists for the Terras. Brooks made just 25 appearances last season before a serious knee injury put paid to any involvement for the remainder of the campaign. He has undergone surgery after electing to continue playing and confirmed to Echosport last November that he would prefer to finish his career with Weymouth . In a club statement, Weymouth said: “We are delighted to confirm the signature of Calvin Brooks to continue in claret and blue for the 24/25 season. “A man who needs little introduction to the Terras’ faithful, Calvin has become a great part of the club and surrounding community. Originally made his debut back on 27th September 2014. “Marking this upcoming season as his 10th for the club. Impressively, only eight players have featured in more campaigns at the club since World War Two. “Calvin unfortunately missed a large part of the end of last season through injury and has since undergone surgery to aid his recovery. His return is anticipated closer than those may think. “With 337 appearances currently under his belt, 31 goals and 30 assists, it gives a continuation of consistency to this ever-growing new-look Weymouth as we approach the new season.” Brooks is the 10th Weymouth player to commit for the 2024/25 season, with Ezio Touray, Brandon Goodship, Jordon Thompson, Leo Hamblin, Charlie Rowan, Gerard Benfield, captain Tom Bearwish, Keelan O’Connell and Josh McQuoid all pledging allegiance to the Terras.",

        "content": "May 28 2024 iDenfy , a Lithuanian-based RegTech company offering ID verification and fraud prevention solutions, has partnered with Henoscene , a blockchain-based enterprise-first SaaS platform pioneering systematic participatory frameworks for corporations, nonprofit foundations, and their stakeholders. iDenfy’s identity verification solution will enhance data protection and user trust while streamlining Henoscene clients’ onboarding process. Environmental crime is one of the world’s most profitable organized criminal activities and has a major impact not only on the environment but also on human health ranking as the third largest criminal activity with a growth rate of 5-7% and causing losses ranging from $110 to $281 billion annually due to increased pollution, degradation of wildlife, water, air pollution, and chemical exposure. To address this critical issue, Henoscene’s platform needed a verification platform that could measure the companies that look untrustful, stopping them from using the platform for money laundering and other fraudulent activities. Henoscene specializes in providing a systematic campaign framework for mapping, planning, reporting, and analyzing long-term goals for businesses and their clients. Through the use of blockchain technology, the platform empowers brands to conduct impactful campaigns that co-create products, services, and stories while fostering positive social, environmental, economic, political, and cultural outcomes. According to Henoscene, using their platform, brands can create customizable campaigns linked to a chosen project, ensuring clear transparency to consumers regarding fund allocation as real-time metrics allow for tracking and measuring campaigns. Henoscene offers brands full transparency in their impactful campaigns, enabling them to build trust. Despite that, Henoscene has noticed that in their industry and lion of work, privacy and transparency have often been pegged against one another. For this reason, they needed an extra layer of security for building an even more secure ecosystem, with verified known players who are all working toward shared, positive social and environmental goals on a peer-to-peer framework like their blockchain-backed platform. Consequently, to combat the growing risks of financial crime and boost its internal Trust and Safety program, Henoscene was looking for an identity verification provider and chose iDenfy’s service due to its alignment with the company’s business model, offering a cost-effective approach focused only on successful verifications, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently towards actual conversions and active community members. iDenfy accepts more than 3000 types of ID documents from 200 countries, which now helps Henoscene confidently verify new users while enhancing its defenses against fraud. It’s worth mentioning that iDenfy’s AI-powered software completes 96% of ID document verifications in under a few minutes on average, guaranteeing a smooth and compliant Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Leveraging iDenfy’s solution, Henoscene aims to further enhance its mission of promoting positive impact and accountability in both the corporate and nonprofit sectors. “Privacy and transparency are fundamental to our approach. We aimed to automate the onboarding process and reduce costs while still promoting collaboration among verified stakeholders. iDenfy’s verification solution enabled us to meet these objectives effectively,” — commented X, the CEO of Henoscene. “We’re excited to partner with Henoscene to drive positive impact and accountability in the corporate and nonprofit sectors. Through our automated ID verification solution, our partner can create a more transparent and trustworthy ecosystem for all stakeholders involved,” — added Domantas Ciulde, the CEO of iDenfy.

        "description": "Atishi summoned by court in defamation case over 'poaching' remark",
        "content": "Listen to Story A Delhi court has summoned Delhi minister and AAP leader Atishi in connection with a defamation case filed by Delhi BJP's media head Praveen Shankar Kapoor. Atishi has been asked to appear before the court on June 29. This case relates to allegations made by Atishi that the BJP attempted to bribe and poach AAP legislators. Kapoor, who had also named Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in the defamation case, claimed the allegations damaged his and his party's reputation. Taking cognisance of the allegations, the court identified Atishi as an accused and ordered her to appear on June 29. The BJP leader had filed the defamation case on April 30, alleging that AAP leaders failed to furnish any material to substantiate their poaching claims. In his application in the court, Kapoor cited a social media post by Arvind Kejriwal in which the AAP supremo alleged that the BJP had contacted seven AAP MLAs and was offering Rs 25 crore to switch sides. He also cited Atishi's claim that she had received an offer to join the BJP to \"save\" her \"political career\", failing which she would be arrested by the Enforcement Directorate. \"The BJP has approached me through someone very close. They have asked me to join the BJP and said this will save my political career. They have threatened that if I don't switch over, ED will arrest me within a month,\" Atishi said at a press conference in April. The AAP leader also claimed that she, along with party colleagues Saurabh Bharadwaj, Raghav Chadha, and Durgesh Pathak, would be arrested in the next two months. In his petition, the BJP leader sought the withdrawal of the remarks made by Atishi and an apology on TV and social media.",

        "content": "BRITISH households are saving hundreds of pounds each year by introducing efficient upgrades to their home. A poll of 2,000 adults responsible for paying the bills found 63% have invested in home energy efficiencies, with a quarter doing so in the last year. The average household estimates this has made an annual saving of £283.90. Motivations behind these upgrades have been reducing energy bills (49%), making their home more sustainable (36%), and adding value to their property (23%). The most popular home improvements that have been made include draught proofing, boiler upgrades, and insulation. And 3.3 million smart meters were installed in British homes in 2023. The study, commissioned by Smart Energy GB, found that in addition to making savings on their energy, the average bill payer believes they have increased their average house value by £2,934.60 by making certain improvements. Smart Energy GB has teamed up with property website, Rightmove, to reveal this data. It shows that improving a home’s Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) rating from F to C could increase its value by up to 15% - which for the average home means an extra £55,848. Tim Bannister, Rightmove’s property expert, said: “We know upfront costs are the biggest barrier to people making green improvements in their home, especially when it can take time to see the return on investment and lower bills. “Our analysis shows that there’s a green price premium on top of the local house price growth when people sell homes that they’ve been able to make green improvements to, and in the coming years a home’s energy efficiency rating is likely to become an even bigger factor when choosing a home to buy or rent .” The study found exactly three quarters would consider the EPC rating of a property when looking to buy, compared to only 38% who would’ve said the same a decade ago. It also emerged the average adult in charge of household bills would be willing to pay an additional £6,360 for a home equipped with sustainable features, according to the OnePoll.com data. While 26% think making home upgrades to improve energy efficiency are now more important than aesthetic ones. Victoria Bacon, director at Smart Energy GB, said: “Smart home investments can be very good for the bank balance in the long run, but not all upgrades have to be costly. “Smart meters are installed at no extra cost by your energy supplier and are a tool that more and more Brits are using to help them find ways to reduce their energy use day to day, which can have a noticeable positive impact on energy bills over time. “They also open up access to reward schemes which offer money off energy bills for reducing energy use at certain times.” The research also revealed 36% have made eco upgrades to make their property more sustainable, and create energy efficient homes for younger generations (31%). ENERGY bills remain relatively high leaving many worrying over the thermostat. Energy experts have revealed the exact temperature to set it at so that you can save cash and still keep warm. When it comes to your thermostat, the Energy Saving Trust recommends you should set it to the \"lowest comfortable temperature\". For the majority of us, this is between 18 and 21 degrees Celsius. It's just the right balance between keeping your home warm, and keeping those energy bills as low as possible. If you have your thermostat set at a higher temperature you can probably afford to turn it down and still keep cosy. Of course, there are exceptions like anyone who is in ill health , and there is support available to cover extra costs . Just by turning down the temp by a single degree, you could save as much as £100 a year. If you cut it by more you will obviously make even bigger savings. The Energy Saving Trust also says that you don’t need to turn your thermostat up when it is colder outside, the house will still heat up to the set temperature. While 62% claim they think more about how their energy usage around the home will impact the environment than they did 10 years ago. It also emerged 23% of those polled plan to make certain green changes to where they live this year. Steph McGovern, broadcaster and consumer finance expert, said: “I know first-hand how difficult it can be to decide the best way to future-proof a home and make smart investments. “But with so many options out there, it’s reassuring to know that you don’t have to spend a huge amount of money to add value to a property and save on energy bills.” Smart Energy GB has partnered with MoneyMagpie to share tips for people looking to make energy efficient upgrades to their home: Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?

Sabrina recently opened up about her 'fun' and 'messy' love life as she gave an insight into her romance with Barry. The singer and Dunkirk actor were first linked in September 2023, but made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala earlier this month. Sabrina has now said she 'really connects with people who are in touch with their emotions' as discussed her romance with Cosmopolitan magazine. When it comes to dating, Sabrina said: 'A lot of it, for me, has been fate. I know that's super broad, but I don't actively look for it. 'The relationships that I actually want to put my energy into have to be so interesting or invigorating because they take me away from the other things I love. So yeah, it's fun and it's messy.' The songstress revealed she is 'attracted' to someone who becomes her 'best friend' and can bring a lot of 'energy and humour' to a relationship. Discussing her type, Sabrina added: 'I'm super attracted to a lot of the things I look for in friends because I want to be with someone who's going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humour and being genuine. I will say I've always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions.' Sabrina was first linked to Barry last September but they didn't make their first public appearance together until the December. In February, the couple confirmed their romance as they posed at a Grammys afterparty together after posing separately next to each other on the red carpet. Earlier this month, Barry threw Sabrina a lavish 25th birthday party complete with an hilarious meme birthday cake of Leonardo DiCaprio. The singer enjoyed a party with 100 of her friends thrown by the Saltburn actor at DUMBO House in Brooklyn. Barry has also supported Sabrina at a number of her gigs including her first at Coachella music festival. Barry was previously in a relationship with Alyson Kierans, who he welcomed a son with called Brando in August 2022 . The pair are thought to have broken up over the summer of last year. When Barry was asked about the split in GQ early this year, he said only that Alyson had 'done a great job and she’s an incredible mother.' Sabrina, meanwhile, saw her dating life become a hot topic during the summer of 2020, when she was rumoured to be in a love triangle with Joshua Bassett and his High School Musical: The Musical: The Series co-star Olivia Rodrigo . The following year, Olivia poured fuel on the fire by releasing her runaway smash hit single Driver's License, which was widely thought to be about Joshua and Sabrina. 'And you're probably with that blonde girl, who always made me doubt. She's so much older than me,' sang Olivia, who is nearly four years younger than Sabrina. In the interim, Sabrina has at various stages been linked to such names as pop act Shawn Mendes, Teen Wolf actor Dylan O'Brien and YouTuber David Dobrik.

        "description": "Britain's Got Talent fans were left confused during the first live semi-final of the 2022 series, as a number of Golden Buzzer acts took to the stage to perform",
        "content": "enthusiasts were left scratching their heads during the show's first live semi-final. The stage was graced by a medley of acts including Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, and Stardust, with Innocent Massuki wrapping up the evening with a stellar act. But what really threw viewers was the number of Golden Buzzer performers that took to the stage in one night. Traditionally, each judge - , , , as well as show hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly are allowed just one Golden Buzzer pick each. Yet, this time around, it seemed the rules were tossed aside as multiple judges hit the buzzer more than once. The line-up of Golden Buzzer acts like Ssaulabi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, and Duo Stardust all performing in the same semi-final had fans flocking to Twitter with their bewilderment. One fan tweeted: \"Are they doing all the golden buzzers tonight? Seems odd #BGT #BritainsGotTalent,\" while another posted: \"What's with so many golden buzzer acts tonight? #BritainsGotTalent.\" Comments continued to pour in, with one saying: \"May aswell rename it the Golden Buzzer show at this rate, featuring a man in a bag #britainsgottalent,\" and another noting: \"Most of the golden buzzers are on tonight I noticed,\" reports . \"Haven't watched the auditions. How many golden buzzers are there? ! Last time I watched they had one each and out one in each semi-final? ! #BritainsGotTalent,\" a viewer tweeted, clearly puzzled by the number of golden moments this season. Another chimed in with: \"Every act tonight is a golden buzzer act? ? This show is silly #BritainsGotTalent.\" And it didn't stop there, as another fan pointed out: \"Why are they putting all the golden buzzer acts on tonight? There's only meant to be 4 and I'm sure I've seen 3 already #bgt britainsgottalent.\" This year's has upped the ante with a whopping nine Golden Buzzers. Simon Cowell explained his decision, saying: \"Well, the truth is, honestly, when I watched the yes tapes back, I thought there were about another 17 acts who easily could have had a golden buzzer. \"That's how good the talent is this year. But look, I think eight or nine is the absolute limit. I don't think you could ever really go beyond nine, well, maybe 10 at a push! But I always listen to the audience and the feedback I got was they enjoyed seeing more golden buzzers.\"",

        "content": "The Democratic Alliance (DA) wants President Cyril Ramaphosa to pay a fine and the African National Congress (ANC) to be docked a percentage of the national vote. This, they claim in court papers, is because Ramaphosa allegedly abused his office for political gain following his recent “national address”. Opposition parties have lashed out at Ramaphosa over his address to the nation on Sunday night accusing him of campaigning for the African National Congress (ANC) in a last pitch to voters before the polls on 29 May. During his family meeting, Ramaphosa highlighted the “achievements” of the sixth administration, including tackling corruption, handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, tackling corruption and gender-based violence and reducing load shedding, among other issues. Relief sought The DA approached the Electoral Court over the matter. In an application, the DA said Ramaphosa’s Presidential address delivered on Sunday violated Section 94 of the Electoral Act 73 of 1998, read with Item 9(2)(e) of the Electoral Code of Conduct; Section 87(1)(g) of the Electoral Act; and Sections 19(2) and (3) of the Constitution. It asked the court to “direct the first respondent (Ramaphosa) in terms of s 96(2)(b) of the Electoral Act, to pay a fine of R200 000”. It also called for the ANC’s votes in the national election to be reduced by 1%. “Any additional or alternative sanction authorised by s 96(2) that this Court considers just and equitable,” the notice of motion read. The DA also wants Ramaphosa and another respondent that opposes the application, to pay the party’s costs. ALSO READ: DA hauls Ramaphosa to court for ‘abusing office’ in national address Punish wrongdoing In the party’s 36-page founding affidavit, the DA’s Helen Zille said by the time the court was able to adjudicate the dispute, the elections would be over. Zille emphasised that a court must punish the wrongdoing, seek to undo the impact of the abuse of public power and public funds and deter future wrongdoing. “It is, of course, impossible to determine with any degree of certainty how many votes the ANC may have gained as a result of Mr Ramaphosa’s abuse of power. The DA submits that a reduction of 1% of the total votes the ANC received would be a fair reduction. “If the ANC receives 10 000 000 votes, it will lose 100 000 votes. Once the reduction is made, the commission will have to recalculate the number of seats awarded in the National Assembly,” Zille said. Ramaphosa’s “unlawful conduct” Zille argued that the purpose of Ramaphosa’s “unlawful conduct” was to increase the number of votes the ANC received. “Given how close it occurred before the election, it is impossible to unscramble the egg and remedy the unlawfulness by, for example, affording all other parties a similar opportunity. The proper remedy to redress the wrong is to reduce the number of votes. Zille said section 96(2) of the Electoral Act affords this court a range of powers if it decides that Ramaphosa and the ANC breached the Code or s 87(1)(g).

        "description": "Arsenal could bolster their squad this summer after missing out on the Premier League title but sporting director Edu has urged for patience as they try and get their targets in",
        "content": "Edu has admitted Arsenal have to be patient in the summer transfer window and cannot be signing players for the \"sake\" of it as they prepare to do some business. The Gunners are looking to improve their squad after agonisingly missing out on the Premier League title for the second successive season. Mikel Arteta's side were still firmly in the race going into the final day of the campaign but ended up finishing second, two points behind winners Manchester City . Unlike the 2022/23 season, Arsenal had a much better go at winning the title this time around and were unfortunate to come up against an unstoppable City, who had won their last nine league matches. In an attempt to try and win the title next term, the Gunners are hopeful of strengthening their ranks. A new centre forward has been touted with Alexander Isak and Victor Gyokeres among those linked. But Edu has called for patience from supporters as he goes in search to acquire players who represent their first-choice options. Man Utd and Arsenal eye wonderkid that team-mates claim is 'best they have seen' Arsenal transfer news: Star confirms Gunners exit as Joshua Zirkzee drops hint on future When asked about their transfer plans, Edu said: \"You can’t sign for the sake of signing. This has to be a process that takes weeks and weeks. \"On my table, I have reports with over 180 pages of a player. It is really detailed. Physical, technical, mental profile – if you have experience of Premier League, if you will be able to adapt. It has it all. \"We analyse our shortcomings, where we can improve, where we can invest and from there we go in search of this new name. What I am going to do now, we have been discussing since January. It is not my decision or Mikel. It’s from a whole group.\" Arsenal sporting director Edu is planning for a busy summer window ( Image: Getty Images) After their victory over Everton on the last day of the Premier League season, Arteta hinted that the Gunners will do more business this summer having been asked about taking them to the next level. He said: \"It’s the only way, so now we are sitting there and they took it away from us. \"It is the second season so there’s only one way to do it, you have to be more determined, you have to be more ambitious, you need to have a lot of courage and push every limit and everything that we have, because that’s the next step.\" When asked about the plans for the summer, he said: \"Rest, have a beautiful holiday - that’s what we need first, because everybody has put every single drop of energy and passion that we had and now we need to rest. While we decompress, and rest and think we will have to start to think with more clarity.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Speaking with The Mirror, commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said that the Sussexes were accused to have gone “rogue\" after their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey and Harry’s memoir Spare exposed secrets of royal life. As a result, the Prince of Wales, and the monarch no longer trust the Harry and Meghan, the expert said, adding that it was their “biggest casualty.” \"After the Oprah interview, the Harry and Meghan Netflix documentary and the publication of Harry's memoir Spare, as well as the interviews he gave promoting it, the popularity of the royal family suffered and the Sussexes were considered to have gone rogue,” the expert said. \"The biggest casualty was trust. It is unsurprising that King Charles and Prince William no longer trust Harry and Meghan,\" he added.",

Travis's recent fashion statement is under scrutiny after being photographed in a heavily-ripped jeans on Sunday. The NFL player was spotted outside next to Patrick Mahomes and Marquise Brown during Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Dallas Mavericks at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. However, his unique pants stole the limelight as netizens were intrigued by his pants with rips all over when the photos emerged on social media. One witty X (formerly known as Twitter) user proposed that perhaps Taylor Swift's cats were responsible for the look. “What the f*** did taylor cats do with his jeans?” @thisisvertrying quipped alongside a photo of the torn jeans. The joke caught Jason's attention who also endorsed it by reposting it with the caption, “Now that’s funny!” Travis paired the tattered jeans with sunglasses and a white shirt with an apple print. Travis was all smiles as he made the Rock On sign with his hands.",

On Friday, May 24 which also marked Dylan's 83rd birthday, the rare body of artwork was sold for $196,156 at an auction by RR Auction, announced in a news release. People magazine reported that Dylan painted the artwork over 50 years ago, approximately in 1968. At the time the pop icon collaborated with The Brand in Woodstock, New York. Later on, the recorded work was released in 1975 on The Basement Tapes and The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete in 2014. As per the description mentioned on the auction house’s website, Bob Dylan’s painting is a “colorful and energetic abstract composition featuring the large central outline of a bull.” The detailing of the artwork continued, “The canvas is filled in with captivating abstract shapes and patterns combined with recognizable imagery, including music notes, bow ties, animals, and segmented features.” “At the top is the red outline of a man in a brimmed hat—mirroring his own style during his Woodstock days,” the website further noted. The RR Auction site also mentioned that Dylan exchanged his painting to Woodstock’s resident Sandy Lepanto for an astrology chart.",

He said the ordinance was utilised for shameful political purposes and many innocent people fell victim to it. The NAB Ordinance has been amended, under which the period of remanding accused in the NAB cases has been extended from 14 days to 40 days. Acting President Yusuf Raza Gilani Monday signed two new ordinances, NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2024 and the Elections Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024. He signed the ordinances on the advice of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as President Asif Zardari is currently in Dubai. The promulgation came after federal cabinet’s approval of the amendments to the ordinances. Under the amended NAB law, the sentence duration for an officer, convicted for framing cases based on ill will, has been reduced to two years from five years. After the promulgation of the Elections Act (Amendment) Ordinance 2024, the election tribunals will have retired judges as its members, besides the serving jurists.",

        "content": "SHANGHAI: Chinese stocks closed down on Tuesday as traders awaited key inflation data from major economies this week for clues on the path for interest rates , and weighed the effectiveness of China's latest housing policy . The US core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, is due on Friday and will be the biggest focus for the market. Expectations are for the index to hold steady on a monthly basis. Meanwhile, China's commercial hub Shanghai lowered the minimum downpayment ratios for home buyers and relaxed some home purchase restrictions, after the country lowered the national level in a market stabilising effort earlier this month. \"Though it's in a good direction, the overall sentiment channel checks suggest that the recovery in tier-1 cities (except in Shenzhen) is not as strong as it was in last September where the four cities relaxed mortgage restriction,\" UBS analyst John Lam said in a note. At the close, the Shanghai Composite index was down 0.46% at 3,109.57 and the blue-chip CSI 300 fell 0.73%. The financial sector sub-index, consumer staples real estate and healthcare sub-index declined between 0.55% and 2.42%. The Hang Seng index edged down 6.19 points or 0.03% at 18,821.16. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index slipped 0.03% to 6,686.13. The smaller Shenzhen index ended down 1.08% and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was weaker by 1.35%. The CES CN Semiconductor Index edged up against a broadly weak market after China set up its third planned state-backed investment fund to boost its semiconductor industry. The sub-index of the Hang Seng tracking energy shares rose 1.3%, while the IT sector rose 0.2%, the financial sector ended 0.18% lower and the property sector fell 1.04%. Around the region, MSCI's Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.1%, while Japan's Nikkei index closed down 0.11%.",

        "content": "A couple enjoying a \"picturesque\" walk snapped photos of their wander around a gorgeous UK trail and accidentally found an X-rated detail in the process. The pair saw the funny side of their sighting in the Brecon Beacons, Wales, and shared it in a post on Reddit's r/CasualUK forum. User SenorBigbelly wrote: \"Took the missus to Wales for the first time and went walking in the Brecon Beacons. Wonderfully picturesque photo completely ruined by a giant penis-shaped pothole that I only noticed now.\" Fellow forum users flooded in with hilarious comments. Some tried to Photoshop the cheeky pothole out, whereas others made it larger. One user who chose to edit the penis-shaped pothole out of the picture wrote: \"Did a quick fix, not the cleanest but didn't take long either.\" Residents' fury as local beauty spot 'ruined' by tourists leaving their poo behind The original poster thanked them for the edit, writing: \" Ok that's pretty genuinely excellent thank you. Part of me was kinda expecting an actual penis photoshopped in there.\" Another user joked: \"I thought they were going to photoshop out your missus.\" The original poster wrote elsewhere in the thread: \"I appreciate people's genuine wholesome corrections of the photo. Tbh I really just posted it because I find it funny (and got plenty of other good photos).\" Other users made cheeky jokes suggesting they had left the penis-shaped imprint themselves while walking through the Brecon Beacons. One said: \"Sorry lads, tripped over here back in 2018. Been a lot more careful since.\" Another person said: \"The really noticeable part is the the pothole has been filled. Wouldn't happen here in England!\" However, a Welsh Reddit user chimed in, revealing this isn't always the case in Wales either. They wrote: \"Doesn't happen in Wales either! Usually if a local pothole has been filled, it's because someone got fed up with waiting for the council to do it and found some spare tarmac or gravel. I've seen potholes filled with bricks on their sides to reduce the depth of said holes. A bit like the old brick roads or a driveway. If it works, it's better than f**king up your exhaust.\"",

        "description": "The Philippine Heart Association (PHA) on Tuesday called on lawmakers to expedite legislation that would allocate automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places, such as government facilities and schools.",
        "content": "The Philippine Heart Association (PHA) on Tuesday called on lawmakers to expedite legislation that would allocate automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in public places, such as government facilities and schools. In a forum, PHA President Dr. Ronald Cuyco emphasized that AEDs should be in tandem with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order save lives of those suffering from cardiac arrest. An AED is a portable device that helps those experiencing sudden cardiac arrest. It is used to counteract fibrillation of the heart muscle and restore normal heartbeat by delivering a brief electric shock to the heart. “We are praying that this gadget should be available and will be available in public places. That’s what we’re pushing in the Congress. Hopefully, a lot of people will help us, even convince the executive branch to support this,” Cuyco said. In the Philippines, there is already a CPR Law (Republic Act 10871), seeking to make lifesavers out of the youth by making CPR training part of the basic education curriculum. However, bills on mandating AEDs in public areas remain stuck in Congress. At the House of Representatives, several measures have been filed, including House Bill No. 1393 and 7783 that would require the provision of AEDs in places open to the public like schools, workplaces, government offices, and similar establishments. A counterpart measure was also filed in the Senate in 2022 during the 18th Congress, but remained pending at the committee level. Pending the law, Malasakit at Bayanihan Rep. Anthony Golez Jr. recommended the PHA to encourage President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to sign an executive order to institutionalize the placement of AEDs in these public places to help save more lives. He said that the PHA could further suggest adding AEDs in public hospitals and barangay health centers, depending on the budget that could be allocated for such. “When you have that, then it means to say that it’s a priority of this government and the chances of having a Republic Act will be higher,” Golez said. The PHA welcomed the recommendation of the congressman, vowing to be proactive in pursuing other alternatives to push their advocacy. Cuyco said that he is also constantly lobbying to start the deliberations on the said measure in the Senate to the office of Senator Bong Go, who chairs the Committee on Health and Demography. Ischaemic heart disease or cardiovascular disease remains to be the number one killer of Filipinos, with a total of 100,848 cases recorded from January to November 2023. This accounted for 19% percent of the total deaths in the Philippines, based on data by the Philippine Statistics Authority. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Delhi's Karkardooma court on Tuesday rejected the bail application of former JNU student leader Umar Khalid in larger conspiracy of Delhi riots case . Khalid, who is an accused in UAPA case related to 2020 Delhi riots, sought a regular bail in the matter on the grounds of delay and parity with other accused persons. It was his second bail application. He has been in custody since September 2020 in a case under UAPA. The Delhi police alleged that Umar Khalid pre-planned protests at 23 sites in 2020, which culminated in riots. After withdrawing his bail plea from the Supreme Court in February, Khalid moved to the trial court seeking bail based on a change in circumstances and parity with other accused. Senior advocate Tridip Pais, defending Umar Khalid, had questioned the Delhi police's submissions, asking, \"Is sharing messages a criminal or terror act?\" He responded to earlier submissions by the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP), who claimed that Khalid was amplifying his narrative as part of a conspiracy by sharing certain links with people in politics and others on social media. Pais argued that Khalid was sharing the \"correct narrative.\" He also claimed that a vicious media trial was taking place against Khalid, referring to statements from various news anchors who were reading charge sheet all the time. Pais argued that no terror case is made out against Khalid and that the police have no material to this effect. He pointed out contradictions in the statements of prosecution witnesses. Pais also noted that other accused persons, namely Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, and Asif Iqbal Tanha, who had similar roles to Khalid, were granted bail by the high court. Opposing the bail application, Delhi police had said that Khalid's chats revealed a habit of creating narratives on media and social media to influence bail hearings.",

        "content": "Listen to Story At least six Indian-origin men have been arrested in Canada as part of a major crackdown on stolen vehicle trafficking. Peel Regional Police concluded Project Odyssey, a seven-month investigation that targeted a large-scale network responsible for stealing vehicles, transporting them across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and shipping them out of the Port of Montreal. The operation resulted in the recovery of 369 stolen vehicles, valued at $33.2 million. The investigation led to the arrest of 16 individuals and the laying of 322 Criminal Code charges. Among those arrested are Beerpal Singh, 29, Harmeet Singh, 34, Valbir Singh, 49, Guljinder Singh, 29, Gurpreet Dhillon, 41, and Jagmohan Singh, 57. These men face numerous charges, including trafficking in stolen goods over $5000 and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. Some also face firearm-related charges. Canadian police identified a company based in Peel Region that was facilitating the transport of stolen vehicles from a trucking yard in Brampton, Ontario. During the operation, police recovered 369 stolen vehicles valued at $33.2 million, with 255 vehicles found in the Peel Region and 114 recovered at the Port of Montreal. Additionally, three transport trucks and two bobcats were seized under the forfeiture of offense-related property. Chief Nishan Duraiappah of Peel Regional Police commended the investigative work of the Commercial Auto Crime Bureau, noting the significant expansion of the unit in 2023. \"In the last 18 months, we have arrested nearly 200 individuals, laid approximately 1,600 auto theft-related charges, and recovered close to $100 million in stolen vehicles,\" said Duraiappah. The investigation has also led to the issuance of 10 additional arrest warrants. The families of the arrested individuals are seeking legal counsel as they prepare for the legal proceedings.",

        "content": "The One Show host Alex Jones scolded Harry Hill after mayhem erupted live on air. The 59-year-old comedian was on the BBC programme to chat about his tour 'New Bits and Greatest Hits', with host Jermaine Jenas probing him about the fresh content. Harry shared: \"For the first time I'm going to do some old bits..\" Jermaine asked: \"So there is going to be something for everyone.\" In a playful jab, Harry responded: \"Not everyone,\" followed by laughter. The ex-footballer pressed: \"Who are you excluding here?\" Harry quipped back: \"Hopefully, for everyone.\" The conversation took a quirky turn when Harry requested Jermaine to \"say quack\", leaving the presenter baffled. \"Say quack again,\" Harry persisted, leading Alex to interject: \"This is going down a dodgy road.\" Harry ended up throwing bread at the hosts ( Image: BBC) Amidst the quacking, Harry ducked down, emerged with a slice of bread, and started tossing pieces at Jermaine as Alex exclaimed: \"No, thank you!\" Harry teased, \"How do you like it? \" while continuing his bread barrage. Long-time fans might remember this gag from Harry's past gigs, including a memorable moment at the Hay Festival in 2007. Back then, he had an audience member quack before bombarding him with bread. He said: \"It means stop throwing bread at me, that's what quack means. Why would a duck like bread? Where would a duck get a taste for bread? \". Viewers flocked to Twitter to share their thoughts on the comedian's stint on the BBC show, with one posting: \"This Harry Hill interview feels very awkward #theoneshow.\" Dunelm's 'most comfortable' hanging egg chair is 'perfect for British weather' Alex and Jermaine didn't seem too impressed ( Image: BBC) Another chimed in with: \"Harry Hill looking utterly bewildered #theoneshow.\" Earlier this month Harry announced his comeback tour to mark his 60th birthday. Speaking about his joy at getting back on stage to celebrate his 30 years in show business, Harry said: “I’m looking forward to celebrating my diamond jubilee - 60 years of fun - by going round the country and thanking all the people that have supported me over the years. I’ve had a word with the badgers and they’ve agreed that for one last time the parade’s on!” He started his self-penned comedy series on BBC Two and Channel 4 . Harry went on to create the hit, multi-BAFTA-winning ITV series Harry Hill’s TV Burp, which ran for 10 years. The comedian has been the longstanding voice of ITV’s You’ve Been Framed, and is the presenter of Channel 4’s Junior Bake Off. Last year, it was reported the star's iconic You’ve Been Framed show had been axed after 33 years on air. The long-running ITV hit, which compiled home videos of mishaps and funny moments, was launched in 1990. It originally had Jeremy Beadle as the narrator, before Harry took over and fronted an impressive 341 of the 701 episodes.

        "content": "Luciano Benetton, co-founder of the iconic apparel brand, has decided to step down as chairman, he revealed in an interview with Italy's Corriere della Sera. He has decided to leave his role after he discovered losses of 100 million euros ($108.5million) last year, which he attributes to the current team. At 89, Benetton returned to his role as chairman in 2018 after initially stepping down in 2012, only to find himself disappointed by a chief executive and management team appointed in 2020, whom he blames for the financial downturn. \"In short, I trusted them, and I made a mistake,\" Benetton confessed, noting that he first noticed the accumulating losses last September. The brand, headquartered in Veneto and famed for its vibrant knitwear and bold advertising, has faced stiff competition from fast-fashion outlets. Since 2013, unions have reported losses totaling around 1 billion euros despite several attempts at creative and managerial overhauls to reclaim market relevance. Benetton is set to leave his post in June, aligning with the expiration of the board term at Edizione SpA, the Benetton family's holding company led by his son Alessandro. Edizione, with interests spanning transport, infrastructure through Mundys, and food and beverage retail including Autogrill via Dufy, is poised to usher in new leadership. The family holding company offloaded its shares in Autostrade per l'Italia SpA, following intense political scrutiny after the tragic collapse of a Genoa highway bridge it operated in August 2018, which resulted in the death of 43 people.",

        "description": "'Iron Mike' has recently worried fans about his health ahead of the showdown.",
        "content": ", 57, just months before his comeback fight against social media sensation . 'Iron Mike' will take on the social media star on the 20th of July at the 80,000-capacity AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The bout will be screened on Netflix, making it the platform's first move into live boxing. The co-main event will see and Amanda Serrano . The Irish star famously beat the Puerto Rican two years ago in New York in what was one of the biggest fights ever in women's boxing. Tyson, who'll be 58 by the time the fight takes place, suffered a medical emergency during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday, according to magazine. The former heavyweight world champion became nauseous and dizzy - which forced flight staff to ask passengers on board if there was a doctor to provide assistance. Since the news broke, it's sparked concerns about whether or not the fight should go ahead in July. Here, we take a look at six potential replacements for the American should he pull out of the showcase. defeated Paul in Saudi Arabia last year thanks to a after an intriguing battle played out in front of thousands of fans in the Middle East. 'The Problem Child' is keen to stage a rematch with the former Love Island star - but has claimed his rival 'fears' another meeting between the two fighters. The American tweeted the following back in December: \"Had a call with Tommy and his dad John about a month ago. It was clear their main concern was money and not about actually getting the fight done. \"After offering him the largest guarantee on the biggest stage he'd ever receive they have gone silent. I smell fear. Real fighting man would jump at the chance to make his biggest payday ever and actually live up to his claim that he's going to KO me.\" Given how tight the first encounter was, a rematch between the pair makes sense. Fury hasn't fought since he defeated KSI back in October last year. There's no doubt that the Brit will be looking to settle the score once and for all against Paul should the opportunity arise. A fight between and Paul is one that would certainly interest many hardcore fans. The Brit and the pair have been going back and forth over a potential fight since 2018. The popular YouTuber called out Paul in the ring after he defeated fellow YouTuber Joe Weller. KSI ended up fighting Jake's brother Logan instead (twice). The 30-year-old last stepped foot inside the ring back in October, to Tommy Fury in Manchester. While the loss to the Brit was the first of KSI's career, from a marketing point of view, a showdown with Paul still makes sense and will have fans chomping at the bit to witness the bout. 'The Problem Child' back in October 2022 when he defeated legend in Arizona. But the former Disney star did take some punishment from the former UFC middleweight champion, in what was possibly the toughest test during his short boxing career so far. The Brazilian retired from the sport in 2020 but has gone on to have three boxing matches since. In his three boxing matches, Silva was successful in two against and , but was beaten in his most recent match against Paul - as aforementioned. It was announced recently that Silva and will on the 15th of June. Providing 'The Spider' can come away from the bout unscathed and with a win, confidence will no doubt be at an all-time high and will be itching to avenge his loss to Paul. A few days before his clash with Ryan Bourland earlier this year, footage of the former Disney star being pulled up on in a car park went viral online. Indian boxer Neeraj Goyat put his money where his mouth is and face to face. In a clip that has garnered millions of impressions, Goyat steps out of his car, seemingly located at where Jake Paul trains, and makes himself known, shouting: \"I'm here, I'm in your country, I'm in your town.\" Paul dismisses Goyat immediately by claiming he doesn't want to fight, with the Indian boxer returning fire by saying Jake Paul is \"abusing the Indian language.\" Paul, in his typical cocky bravado, asks Goyat if he \"can't handle a little s*** talk, your feelings are hurt. Did I hurt your feelings?\" Paul tells Goyat that he respects him for showing up \"man to man\" before the pair come to blows and the verbal confrontation turns physical. Goyat boasts a record of 18-4, having made his debut in 2011, and with two of those losses coming during his first two years of boxing, he has had a pretty successful decade since. Most of his fights have been in or around Asia, with his fights typically taking place in India, Thailand, and China, but he has stemmed out into the western world of boxing, having fought in Canada and Mexico, with his Mexican fight ending in a loss to the 36-3 Jose Zepeda. Yet to have his breakout moment, it might be that a potential Jake Paul and Neeraj Goyat fight down the line is finally the fight that he needs to break out into the boxing world. Following the recent news about Tyson, boxing star took the opportunity to insert himself into the conversation of replacing 'Iron Mike.' The American is currently in hot water after his drugs test B-samples from his showdown with Devin Haney have . According to boxing journalist Dan Rafael, the American's B sample and A sample both tested positive for Ostarine - which is a banned substance, after tests were conducted by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA). Last month, Garcia shocked the world by knocking Haney down three times in their epic super-lightweight title fight in New York before going on to . He recently said he'd be if need be. Taking to X - formerly known as Twitter - the American uploaded a picture of his Instagram messages to Paul, which read: \"If you down to fight. If Mike can't do it. Let me know I will fill in.\" With everything that's going on with Garcia at the moment, as well as the major weight gap between 'King Ry' and Paul, it seems doubtful that this fight will happen. Former boxing world champion Sakio Bika has put himself forward as an alternate for Tyson and Paul's fight in July. The 45-year-old has not fought a professional contest since 2021 - when he defeated Sam Soliman. Bika, who has a professional record of 35-7-3, recently told : “I can fight Jake Paul at any weight he wants. At the moment, I am staying in shape and ready if the right offer comes my way. \"I have reached the top of the sport, becoming a multiple-time world champion and winning the prestigious Contender series. I have nothing more to prove to anyone, but I would like to have one more big fight.\" British boxing fans may be familiar with the name as he once challenged for Joe Calzaghe's world titles back in 2006 - but lost on points. He added: \"If someone like Jake or his brother would really like to test himself against a recent world champion, I am always ready to fight. Mike Tyson is an all-time great boxer; he was a hero of mine growing up, and even though he looks in great shape, he is almost 60 years of age! If Jake is serious about fighting a former champion, look for someone a lot younger or active within the last decade.\"",

        "content": "A MUM has found herself brutally lunch-shamed after proudly showing off the elaborate meals she prepares for her kid, nine. Alexia Gallegos, from the USA , is a mum-of-three, but it's the eldest daughter's school lunches that have taken the internet by storm. The foodie , who is a proud stay-at-home mum , insists that '' school lunches don't have to be cold and boring'' and regularly shares her lunch-packing routine. One such video posted on her page saw the mother whip up a jacket potato , topped with scrumptious steak bites, some shrimp, broccoli, grated cheese and a sprinkle of herbs to top it off. ''Baked potato for the win,'' Alexia wrote in the caption of the video , all chuffed with her cooking skills. Once she had packed the main dish into a pink lunchbox, Alexia - who's won more than 132k followers - went on to cram in an array of snacks for her nine-year-old daughter. These included the following: a container of delicious pistachio nuts, Haribo Goldbear candy, a packet of chocolate-covered dried strawberries, a packed of roasted seaweed with some sea salt sprinkled on too, as well as a packet of ''Veggie'' straws. Alexia didn't stop there, as she then also added more snacks for the kid, including two Ferrero Rocher chocolates, a Kinder Joy chocolate, a tub of jellied fruit and beef jerky. That little girl is still sitting in the cafeteria eating her lunch The elaborate lunch box for the day was completed with a gummy Pizza candy box and strawberry and cream Tic Tacs. Once she had packed all the food, Alexia included the viral Stanley flask filled with ice cubes in the shape of adorable butterflies, water, as well as a cute handwritten note that read: ''Hey beautiful, you are worth it ALWAYS! Keep being you! Love Mommy.'' But despite the mum's best intentions, thousands of fellow Instagram users have expressed utter shock, mainly criticising the portion sizes and the nutritional value of the sugary snacks. One person said: ''Sorry I feel bad saying it because you look so happy and made all with love... but this is so much food... also so much sugar for one day...'' Another agreed, adding: ''All the plastic waste ... and wouldn't one kind of sweets be enough? No apple, no banana....'' Someone else chuckled: ''Is she going to school or building it?!'' A fourth penned: ''That little girl is still sitting in the cafeteria eating her lunch.'' ''Not sure if we are trying to k**l her with diabetes , or room temperature shrimp,'' a critic wrote. Find all the recipes here , on the NHS website. Keep them fuller for longer As advised by the experts at the NHS , parents should base the main lunchbox item on foods like bread, rice, pasta and potatoes - this will keep the tummies fuller for longer. Choose wholegrain where you can. Cut back on fat Where possible, go for lower-fat fillings, such as lean meats (including chicken or turkey), fish (such as tuna or salmon), lower-fat spread, reduced-fat cream cheese and reduced-fat hard cheese. Another great way to cut back on fat is avoiding using mayonnaise in sandwiches. Ever green If possible, always add salad to sandwiches and wraps too – it all counts towards your child's five-a-day! Always add veggies Cherry tomatoes, sticks of carrot, cucumber, celery and peppers - these are all great options that count towards their five-a-day. Adding a small pot of reduced-fat hummus or other dips may help with getting kids to eat vegetables. Cut down on crisps If your child really likes their crisps see if you can reduce the number of times you include them in the lunchbox. Another great option is swapping crisps for homemade plain popcorn or plain rice cakes instead.",

        "content": "The Government of Ghana, , , , and , with Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and , have announced their partnership on a new shared infra Next-Gen InfraCo. (NGIC). This collaboration aims to deliver affordable 5G mobile broadband services across Ghana. The Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC) has been awarded 5G license and expected to launch 5G services across Ghana within the next six months, followed by expansion to other parts of Africa. Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC) will be the first 5G Mobile Broadband Shared Infrastructure Entity to build a nationwide 4G/5G network. The company will also work with MNO partners to launch affordable 4G/5G-enabled FWA CPEs and smart phones in Ghana within this calendar year. The partnership aims to enhance the lives of Ghanaians by introducing digital services in education, healthcare and digital payment transactions through P2P (peer-to-peer), P2M (peer-to-merchant) and M2M (merchant-to-merchant) systems, thereby reducing digital divide and promoting financial inclusion. Additionally, the multiplayer partnership will support NGIC in the entire deployment of network infrastructure and associated services, as are looking to address enterprise and consumer markets with enhanced digital services. To achieve this, Tech Mahindra will build a Cloud Native Core Network powered by OEM (original equipment manufacturer) platforms. NGIC plans to adopt India’s model of affordable handsets, digital platforms and localised content and applications. The goal is to replicate this high-speed mobile data model across Africa, beginning with Ghana.

        "content": "The Met Office is predicting a pretty miserable June. According to the UK’s national forecaster, it could be even wetter than it is in May. It comes after a tumultuous May, which has seen periods of sun as well as torrential downpours in the capital. This is very bad news for those hoping for a warm and sunny summer. On its website, The Met Office says “on balance, it is probable that a continuation of variable, slow moving weather patterns are likely through much of June, similar to that which has been experienced through May. READ MORE: Forgotten London water park left derelict for a decade where kids used to spend 'unforgettable' summers “However with potentially slow moving weather systems there is still a chance that longer-lived drier, or even wetter, spells are entirely possible too.” The Met Office predicts that today (May 28) will be ‘cloudy to start with some patchy light rain in the south. During the morning all parts will see some rain which will turn heavy at times. Turning drier and brightening up a little later this afternoon. Maximum temperature 18C’. Whereas tonight will be ‘partly cloudy overnight perhaps with the odd shower, most likely before midnight. Many parts remaining dry with long clear spells and mist patches forming later. Minimum temperature 10C’. Tomorrow (May 29) will see ‘variable amounts of cloud with scattered showers and some bright or sunny spells. Showers locally heavy, thundery and prolonged during the afternoon. Breezy near the south coast. Maximum temperature 21C’. And from Thursday (May 30) through to Saturday (June 1) there will be ‘further heavy showers on Thursday, prolonged and thundery at times. Showers much less frequent on Friday and Saturday with lengthy dry sunny periods. Temperatures near normal. Rather breezy at times’. Got a story?

        "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top headlines for May 27 Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Chicago man convicted of murder a decade ago based in part on testimony from an eyewitness who is legally blind is suing the city and the police department. Darien Harris was convicted by a judge in 2014 in connection with a 2011 fatal shooting at a South Side gas station. He was 12 years into a 76-year prison sentence when he was released in December after The Exoneration Project showed that the eyewitness had advanced glaucoma and lied about his eyesight issues. Harris was 30 years old when he was freed from prison. In April, Harris filed a federal civil rights lawsuit accusing police of fabricating evidence and coercing witnesses into making false statements, according to The Chicago Tribune. He told the newspaper that he is still struggling to put his life back on track. 6 MEN CHARGED WITH STAGING STRING OF CHICAGO-AREA ROBBERIES TO GET IMMIGRATION VISAS Darien Harris, who was convicted of murder a decade ago based in part on testimony from an eyewitness who is legally blind, is suing Chicago and its police department. (Chicago Tribune via Getty Images) \"I don't have any financial help. I'm still (treated like) a felon, so I can't get a good job,\" he said. \"It's hard for me to get into school. I've been so lost. ... I feel like they took a piece of me that is hard for me to get back.\" Harris, an 18-year-old high school senior when he was arrested, was picked out of a police lineup and identified in court by the legally blind eyewitness. The eyewitness testified that he was riding his motorized scooter near the gas station when he heard gunshots and observed a person aiming a handgun, adding that the shooter bumped into him.

He said yes but claimed he did not have vision problems. The eyewitness' doctor determined he was legally blind nine years before the incident, according to court records. A gas station attendant also testified in court that Harris was not the shooter. The Exoneration Project has helped clear more than 200 people since 2009, including a dozen in Cook County, where Chicago is located, in 2023 alone.

        "content": "The Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) reports that domestic and foreign portfolio transactions in Nigeria’s equity market totaled N346.23 billion in April 2024. The News Chronicles was provided with a statement from the NGX that included this information. The Exchange reports that as of April 30, 2024, overall transactions at the country’s exchange had dropped from N538.54 billion (about $404.69 million) in March 2024 to N346.23 billion (around $260.24 million). This is a 35.71% fall. The decrease could also be linked to the generally negative attitudes of investors, who have demonstrated cautious actions due to the ongoing volatility in the Nigerian market. A substantial fall in the market value of N3.57 trillion was suffered by the NGX All-Share Index in April as a result of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) policy pronouncements that tended to favor fixed-income assets. A more thorough examination of all the transactions carried out in April 2024 compared to March 2024 showed that there was a 49.27% drop in total domestic transactions from N444.28 billion in March to N225.40 billion in April 2024. However, between March 2024 and April 2024, the total amount of foreign transactions climbed by 28.19%, from N94.26 billion (about $70.83 million) to N120.83 billion (around $90.83 million). Retail and institutional investors Institutional investors outpaced individual investors by 10%, according to the NGX. Retail sales dropped by 54.89% from N223.37 billion in March 2024 to N100.77 billion in April 2024, according to a comparison of domestic transactions. The institutional makeup of the domestic market also declined, going from N220.91 billion in March 2024 to N124.63 billion in April 2024, a 43.58% drop. Performance in more than ten years Domestic transactions plummeted 10.94% between 2007 and 2023, from N3.556 trillion to N3.167 trillion, while international transactions fell 33.28% between 2007 and 2023, from N616 billion to N411 billion. About 89% of all transactions in 2023 were made within the country; only 11% of all transactions during that time were made outside of the country. Things To Note The NGX All-Share Index saw a significant downturn in April, which cost the market value of N3.57 trillion. The Central Bank of Nigeria’s (CBN) various policy decisions had an impact on the index’s notable decline. The new recapitalization plan for commercial banks, which intends to generate an estimated N4 trillion in extra capital over the next two years, was a noteworthy announcement. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN decided to raise the benchmark interest rate by 200 basis points, from 22.75% to 24.75%, and the market responded to this announcement as well. The local stock exchange saw a 6% fall as a result of the significant rate hike, which sparked stronger sell-offs. The benchmark index closed at 98,225.63 points. Notably, the NGX All-Share Index closed at 98,225.63 points, below the 100,000-point mark. This is a sharp contrast to the index’s peak of 104,562.06 points at the end of March 2024.

        "description": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) – Torrential rain brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's remote northeastern state of Mizoram, killing at least 10 people, while harsh weather hampers efforts to rescue those trapped, authorities said on Tuesday.",
        "content": "Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, killing at least 16 and cutting power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighboring Bangladesh. Bitter weather was holding up rescue efforts in Melthum, the site of the quarry outside the state capital of Aizawl, a state disaster management official said. \"There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse,\" the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. There were no immediate details of the number trapped. The heavy rain in Mizoram, which borders Bangladesh, also unleashed landslides in the region. Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity lines in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees. It is the first of the frequent storms expected to pound the low-lying coasts of the South Asian neighbors this year as climate change drives up surface temperatures at sea.",

        "description": "South African National Taxi Council announced on X that taxi-related protests in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, are indefinitely suspended.",
        "content": "Taxi-related protests in Mthatha, Eastern Cape, have been indefinitely suspended, according to a post by the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) on X formerly known as Twitter. The protests, which brought Mthatha to a standstill on Monday, saw taxi operators block major exits, severely impacting local activities. Protests had an effect on the Independent Electoral Commission The protests had a significant effect on the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) , preventing 455 voting stations from opening by 9:00. The blocked roads initially stopped IEC Presiding Officers from accessing storage sites to collect voting materials. However, by midday, the South African Police Services (SAPS) managed to clear some roads, allowing the casting of special votes to resume in several areas. By 13:00 on Monday, an IEC update revealed that 108 of the initially affected 455 voting stations were still closed. The disruption was most severe in Port St. Johns, where 81 out of 135 voting stations remained non-operational. The unrest also saw an IEC officer stabbed during community protests. Medical services were also disrupted The Eastern Cape Health Department reported that the protests also disrupted medical services. Ambulances could not access Mthatha, leaving patients in need of urgent medical care stranded. Spokesperson Mkhululi Ndamase noted that hospital staff from Nelson Mandela Academic Hospital, Mthatha Regional Hospital, and St. Barnabas Hospital were unable to commute due to the blocked roads. Consequently, hospitals operated with minimal staff. Ndamase assured that as soon as the roads reopened, staff would resume their duties. “As soon as roads reopen, those who are supposed to be on duty will go to work to relieve those who worked the night shift. “In emergency cases, the department will use aeromedical services to transfer patients,” said Ndamase. The protests in Mthatha began on Monday morning when aggrieved taxi operators hijacked trucks to block the N2 entry and exit points to the town. This action followed a crackdown on the taxi industry due to a surge in violence, which appeared to violate a recent peace agreement. As previously reported by The South African , additional Public Order Policing units were deployed in KwaZulu-Natal and Mthatha to bolster existing crime combatting efforts. General Masemola emphasised the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment for the upcoming elections. He tasked the officers with preventing and combating criminal activities including protests while ensuring that South Africans can exercise their right to vote in peace. “We are sending you off to maintain law and order. No disruptions and acts of criminality should take place under your watch. We are sending you out there to protect the constitutional right of South Africans and the integrity of the election process,” said General Masemola.",

        "description": "Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag's future is uncertain at the moment, and Mark Ogden has provided the latest update.",
        "content": "manager Erik ten Hag has come under pressure this season after a disappointing campaign, and journalist Mark Ogden has suggested that the situation could be resolved by the end of the week. The future of ten Hag as manager of United has become a subject of intense speculation and debate in recent months. As the 2023-2024 season concluded with the Red Devils securing an eighth-place finish in the Premier League but winning the FA Cup, the club finds itself at a crossroads regarding ten Hag's tenure. In his first season, the Dutch tactician guided the team to a third-place finish in the Premier League and won the Carabao Cup, so there's no doubt they've failed to progress this term. Speaking on the Back Pages podcast, journalist . \"Yeah, Erik ten Hag has known, probably since February, that his position was on the line. INEOS and Manchester United haven't really distanced themselves from the stories that many of us have written, saying they've been assessing other candidates. Gareth Southgate, Roberto De Zerbi, Thomas Frank, Kieran McKenna, Mauricio Pochettino - all these names have been put to United and they've not really been knocked back. So there's been a process going on to to identify whether there's a manager out there who can do a better job than ten Hag. Now I think that process will probably be resolved at some point this week.\" United's victory in the FA Cup final against Manchester City was a significant achievement, especially with it being against their local rivals, but INEOS might be looking at the bigger picture. The trophy might have papered over the cracks of what has been a disappointing campaign, and the fact that the hierarchy appear to be speaking to a host of different managers isn't a good sign for the former Ajax coach. Erik ten Hag's Manchester United record Matches 114 Wins 68 Draws 15 Losses 31 Points per match 1.92 According to a report from The Times, before the FA Cup final, with talks already being held with representatives. With INEOS heading into their first full campaign as partial owners of the club, they might be considering bringing in their own manager to steer them in the right direction. Erik ten Hag has averaged 1.92 points per game during his time at Manchester United. Ipswich Town manager McKenna has done an excellent job with the Tractor Boys, helping them gain back-to-back promotions from League One up to the Premier League. The 38-year-old has previously spent time at Old Trafford as a coach, and he was on United's list to take over from ten Hag. Despite the Manchester club's interest in McKenna, , according to The Athletic's David Ornstein. It's a major statement from the newly promoted side as they look to solidify themselves as a Premier League club next season.",

        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel have nosedived with the diplomatic recognitions by two EU members , and Madrid insisting on Monday that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to rethink their position. Slovenia’s Prime Minister Robert Golob said Monday his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries, including stops in Oslo and Dublin, to garner support for the recognition of a Palestinian state and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “it is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively. “The recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries,\" Norway's top diplomat said. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . ___ Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel and Jan M.

        "description": "Two historically cheap high-octane dividend stocks that have consistently raised their payouts for a quarter of a century are ripe for the picking by opportunistic income seekers.",
        "content": "Over the last century, Wall Street has been a virtually unstoppable wealth creator for patient investors. Although other asset classes have helped build nominal wealth, such as oil, gold, bonds, and housing, none comes close to the annualized average returns over the last 100 years that stocks have brought to the table. With thousands of publicly traded companies and exchange-traded funds to choose from, there's an investment strategy that fits the goals and risk tolerance of just about every investor. But among these countless strategies, few can hold a candle to the juicy returns delivered from buying and holding high-quality dividend stocks over an extended period. Last year, the investment researchers at Hartford Funds released a detailed report (\"The Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future\") that examined the many ways dividend-paying companies have outperformed non-payers over the long run. In a collaboration with Ned Davis Research, recently updated data from this report finds that dividend-paying companies have more than doubled the annual average return of public companies that don't pay a dividend over the last 50 years (1973-2023): 9.17% vs. 4.27% . Further, the dividend payers were, on average, 6% less volatile than the S&P 500 , while the non-payers were 18% more volatile. Perhaps the best thing about investing in dividend stocks is that value can always be found -- even with Wall Street's major stock indexes hitting fresh all-time highs. The real challenge is deciding which dividend stocks to invest in, because not all dividend payers are created equally . Companies with the ability to increase their dividend payouts year after year are typically time-tested, recurringly profitable, and capable of providing transparent long-term growth outlooks. In other words, they're just the type of companies we'd expect to increase in value over the long run. At the moment, two magnificent ultra-high-yield dividend stocks -- \"ultra-high-yield\" stocks have yields that are four or more times higher than the S&P 500s yield -- that are working on base annual payout increase streaks of at least 25 years are ripe for the picking by opportunistic income seekers. Realty Income: 6.04% yield The first high-octane dividend stock with an extensive streak of increasing its base annual payout that's begging to be bought right now is the premier company among retail real estate investment trusts (REITs), Realty Income ( O -0.25% ) . Realty Income has increased its monthly distribution for 107 consecutive quarters. O Dividend data by YCharts . Less than two weeks ago, Realty Income declared its 647th consecutive monthly dividend and has increased its payout in each of the past 107 quarters (that's nearly 27 years). Based on its newly announced monthly distribution of $0.2625 per share, Realty Income's forward dividend yield has, once again, topped 6%. The primary reason the last two years have been challenging for Realty Income's stock is the Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary policy. The steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades sent short-term Treasury bill yields soaring to around 5%. Treasury bills offer effectively no risk to an investors' principle, and have thus been more attractive than higher-yielding REITs in recent quarters. But at some point, the value proposition of REITs begins to outweigh this risk/reward scenario -- and I'd strongly argue we've hit that point with this leading retail REIT. Following the completion of its Spirit Realty Capital acquisition in January, Realty Income ended the first quarter with 15,485 commercial real estate (CRE) properties in its portfolio. It estimates that approximately 90% of the total rent that it collects from these CRE properties is resilient to an economic downturn and the pressures from e-commerce . The secret? Realty Income prominently rents to stand-alone retailers that sell basic necessity goods or provide basic need services. Grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, home improvement stores, drug stores, and automotive service locations make up nearly 42% of its annualized contractual rent. These are businesses that are going to generate predictable cash flow in pretty much any economic climate. The real advantage of leasing to high-quality, stand-alone businesses in basic necessity industries is not having to worry about finding new tenants or getting paid. Since the start of this century, the median S&P 500 REIT has enjoyed a respectable 94.2% occupancy rate. Realty Income's median occupancy rate is 98.2% over the last 23 years and change. It's easy to raise the company's dividend for 107 consecutive quarters when tenants generate predictable cash flow and pay their bills. In addition to its top-tier retail CRE portfolio, Realty Income has been expanding into new verticals . It's completed two deals in the gaming industry over the last two years, purchased Spirit Realty Capital to diversify its revenue stream, and formed a joint venture with Digital Realty Trust to develop build-to-suit data centers for lease. Yes , this means Realty Income can benefit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution over the long run. Best of all, Realty Income's stock is cheaper than it's been in more than a decade . The 11.6 multiple to forward-year cash flow Realty Income closed at on May 24 represents a 33% discount to its average multiple to cash flow over the last five years. Enterprise Products Partners: 7.3% yield The second ultra-high-yield dividend stock sporting a 25-year payout increase streak is energy juggernaut Enterprise Products Partners ( EPD ) . Enterprise doles out its dividend quarterly and has been increasing its base annual distribution since becoming a public company in July 1998. Its forward yield, based on its current distribution, is an S&P 500-crushing 7.3%, and it's returned an aggregate of $53.2 billion to its investors, including buybacks, since going public. To be fair, oil and gas stocks aren't going to be everyone's cup of tea. The fossil fuel industry is viewed a \"sin\" industry by some investors. Further, the historic drop-off in crude oil and natural gas demand four years ago during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns is still fresh in the minds of many investors. Drilling companies were absolutely clobbered when crude oil futures briefly crashed to negative $40 per barrel. Enterprise Products Partners has increased its base annual distribution in each of the last 25 years. EPD Dividend data by YCharts . But if you can overcome this recency bias and have no qualms about investing in the U.S. fossil fuel industry, Enterprise Products Partners has the necessary tools to make patient income seekers notably richer. The reason Enterprise has been such a phenomenal investment for so long is because it's not a driller. It's a vital energy middleman for the U.S. fossil fuel industry. It operates more than 50,000 miles of transmission pipeline, 26 fractionation facilities, and can store 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas and in excess of 300 million barrels of petroleum/refined liquids. The beauty of being one of North America's largest midstream operators is that it's able to secure long-term, fixed-fee contracts with drilling companies . Most of the company's contracts are fixed-fee, which removes spot price volatility from the equation. Being able to transparently and accurately forecast cash flow a year or more in advance is what's given Enterprise Products Partners' management team the confidence to raise its distribution, undertake new projects, and make earnings-accretive acquisitions. In terms of major projects, the company has green-lit nearly $7 billion in spending. Most of these projects, which are focused on expanding the company's natural gas liquids (NGLs) segment, are slated to come online before the end of 2025. Capital spending should decline by $1 billion (or more) in 2026, likely leading to even faster earnings growth. Meanwhile, a steady diet of bolt-on acquisitions has expanded the reach of Enterprise's pipelines and fattened its cash flow. Three months ago, Enterprise Products Partners agreed to pay $375 million to Western Midstream Partners for the remaining 20% interest in the 620,000-barrel-per-day Whitethorn pipeline it didn't already own, as well as the remaining 25% equity interest in two NGL fractionators it didn't own. There's plenty of incentive for Enterprise to add on pipeline and NGL interests in the future. Enterprise Products Partners should also be a clear-cut beneficiary of reduced capital spending by energy majors following the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Years of reduced spending has constrained the global supply of oil and helped to boost its spot price. A higher sustained price for crude oil is liable to encourage more domestic drilling and help Enterprise secure more lucrative contracts. Enterprise Products Partners looks like a screaming bargain at roughly 7 times forward-year cash flow and just shy of 10 times forward-year earnings .",

What we should be worried about as well meaning Nigerians, is how come his family and close friends can’t ward off agents of desperate politicians who are bent on exploiting his medical situation to their advantage, no matter how low it sinks the once respected Nobel Laureate.” SEE POST:",

        "description": "While rumours of ‘peace talks’ circulated last year, the latest Brangelina divorce update tells another story. It’s just the latest complication in their eight year divorce case",
        "content": "Lifestyle Once the most loved-up couple in Hollywood , borne like a phoenix from the ashes of Brad and Jennifer Aniston ’s world-rocking break up, Brangelina has taken quite the tumble. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced their split in 2016, just two years after they tied the knot in Miraval, south east France, where they also co-owned a successful vineyard. Since then, there’s been allegations of abuse, claims of forced NDAs, a revolving door of legal professionals and more than a little crying over spilt rosé. In some of the latest court filings around the ongoing legal battle dubbed “War of the Rosés” Jolie’s lawyers allege that Pitt was abusive toward her prior to the 2016 plane incident that led to her leaving him and filing for divorce. Pitt has denied allegations of abuse and no charges were filed after an FBI investigation. It has also recently emerged that one of the couple’s children, Vivienne, has dropped Pitt’s name from her surname. In the playbill for a new Broadway musical, The Outsiders, produced by Angelina Jolie, the teenage “production assistant” is listed as Vivienne Jolie instead of Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, according to People magazine. From the couple that couldn’t keep their hands off each other to embittered exes, where did it all go so wrong for Brad and Ange? First, let’s go way back. The two actors first met on the set of action comedy Mr & Mrs Smith in 2004. Chemistry between the pair — playing a married couple who both turned out to be assassins hired to kill the other — was said to be palpable. At the time, Brad was married to Jennifer Aniston, making him one half of the most adored celebrity couple. Brad and Jen’s Malibu wedding in 2000 was no small affair (if you’ll pardon the phrasing), it reportedly cost $1 million and was attended by the entire cast of Friends, including David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, Courtney Cox, Matthew Perry, and Matt LeBlanc. He was the biggest movie star in the world and she was the Rachel Green. People from all across the world were obsessed and ate up every available inside detail on the pair’s relationship. Like, for instance, their wedding vows: he promised to split the thermostat bill and Jen pledged to always make Brad his favourite banana milkshake. Their approach to marriage was charmingly liberal. “Neither of us wants to be the spokesman for a happy marriage, for coupledom,” Brad told Vanity Fair. “I’ll tell you what I despise: this two-becomes-one thing where you lose your individuality. We don’t cage each other with this pressure of happily ever after. You figure it out as you go along. We feel it out, rather than setting policies and rules.” Adding: “Jen and I always made a pact; that we’ll see where this thing is going. I’m not sure it really is in our nature to be with someone for the rest of our lives, just because you made this pact. You keep going as long as you keep growing. When that dies, we do. We still have that friendship; we still have a good laugh, which can go in and out depending on the dynamics and outside influences. It’s complicated, but that’s what keeps it interesting.” Enter Angelina, who came with a wild image (kissing her brother on the lips at the Oscars , reportedly wearing a vial of her partner’s blood around her neck, etc) and described herself as having had a ‘dark and dangerous’ youth. She was twice divorced when she met Brad — having been hitched first to British actor Jonny Lee Miller, of Trainspotting fame, and then Billy Bob Thornton, aka Bad Santa and the sleazy American President from Love Actually. During her marriage to Billy Bob, the couple adopted a child, Maddox, from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. US judge denies Alec Baldwin’s bid to throw out manslaughter case ‘We look forward to our day in court’, says Alec Baldwin’s lawyers ‘Mesmerising’ Tom Holland praised in mixed reviews of Romeo and Juliet Enter the AXA Startup Angel competition to win £25,000 Speaking about her divorce , she told Vogue at the time: “It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet.\" After seven years together, and mid-way through the filming of Mr & Mrs Smith, Brad and Jennifer announced their separation on January 7, 2005. A tidal wave speculation was unleashed. Both the media and the general public whipped up a frenzied Team Jen and Team Angelina rivalry, with brands even selling t-shirts for people wanting to pledge their allegiance. Angelina was pitched as the mistress, but both have always strenuously denied their relationship started as an affair. \"To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive,” Angelina said. “I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.\" Not long after their divorce, Jen gave a candid interview to Vanity Fair, saying “I’m not interested in taking public potshots. It’s not my concern anymore. What happened to him after the separation—it’s his life now. I’ve made a conscious effort not to add to the toxicity of this situation. I haven’t retaliated. I don’t want to be a part of it. I don’t have a halo that I’m polishing here; everyone has their personal thoughts. But I would much rather everyone move on. I am not defined by this relationship. I am not defined by the part they’re making me play in the triangle. It’s maddening to me...” In January 2006, Angelina confirmed to People that she was pregnant with the couple’s first child. It was the first time she’d publicly acknowledged their relationship. The pair then started assembling their ‘rainbow’ family, as she called it, at pace. That year, Brad became the adoptive father of Maddox and Angelina’s second child, Zahara. Both of the children's surnames were changed from \"Jolie\" to \"Jolie-Pitt\". Angelina gave birth to daughter Shiloh Nouvel in Namibia, in May 2006. In the spring of the next year, Angelina adopted three-year-old Pax Thien from an orphanage in Vietnam and Brad adopted Pax in the United States about a year later. “We spent a lot of time contemplating and thinking and talking about what we both wanted in life and realized that we wanted very, very similar things,” Angelina said to Vogue in 2007. “And then we just continued to take time. We remained very, very good friends—with this realization—for a long time. And then life developed in a way where we could be together, where it felt like something we would do, we should do.\" At the Cannes Film Festival in 2008, Angelina confirmed that she was expecting twins, and Knox Léon and daughter Vivienne Marcheline were born in July that year. A few years later, speaking to The Telegraph, Jolie said: \"I am very lucky with Brad. He is a real gentleman, but he is also a real man's man. He's got the wonderful balance of being an extraordinary, great, loving father, a very, very intelligent man and physically he's a real man.\" Meanwhile, Brad told Esquire in mid 2013: “I have very few friends. I have a handful of close friends and I have my family and I haven't known life to be any happier. I'm making things. I just haven't known life to be any happier.\" They got married after ten years together with an intimate ceremony at the chapel of their French home and vineyard, Château Miraval, in southeast France. Angelina wore Versace with a veil that the couples’ children had doodled all over. \"It does feel different. It feels nice to be husband and wife,” Angelina told Vanity Fair at the time. Two years later and it was over. In September 2016, Angelina filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. The FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services then confirmed they were investigating Brad for alleged child abuse following an incident on the family’s private jet. The actor was accused by an anonymous person of getting physical with one of his children. According to TMZ at the time, “the details of precisely what happened” were “murky.” But it was reported that Maddox had stepped in to verbally stand up for his mother during a fight with Brad — and that the latter lost his temper. A source close to Brad told People he was “was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,” said the source. “There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.” Brad has since been cleared of all allegations. The actor hasn’t made any comment about the allegations but has been open about his drinking and drug use. In a May 2017 GQ interview, Brad revealed he had quit drinking and smoking cannabis. “I can't remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn't boozing or had a spliff, or something. And I'm running from feelings. I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family. But even this last year [...] I was boozing too much,” Brad told the magazine. “It's just become a problem. You either deny them all of your life or you answer them and evolve.” Brangelina had been wrangling over the split through legal proceedings in California privately and quietly, but in February 2017, Angelina spoke out about the divorce for the first time saying \"we will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it”. According to court documents, Brad had been failing to give her “meaningful support” financially since the split. Brad countered that he had actually loaned her $8 million plus $1.3 million for bills. The next year it was revealed that Angelina had given Brad access to the children — but they were still working towards a full settlement. In an interview with Vogue in 2021, Angelina said she split from Brad for the “wellbeing” of her family. “It was the right decision,” she said. “I continue to focus on their healing. Some have taken advantage of my silence, and the children see lies about themselves in the media, but I remind them that they know their own truth and their own minds. In fact, they are six very brave, very strong young people.” In December 2020, court proceedings had begun in Los Angeles over child custody for the five youngest children, as Maddox was already over 18 and therefore an adult in the eyes of the law. Pax is now 20, while Zahara is 19, Shiloh, 17 and twins Vivienne and Knox are 15. Brad was granted joint custody of his children with Angelina. A source close to the case told PA the judge’s ruling would “significantly increase” Oscar-winner Brad’s time with the children. The decision is said to have been based on “extensive testimony” from those involved with the case, including professionals who had spent time with the children. It marked a major breakthrough for the couple, but as they say: two steps forward, three steps back. It took nearly seven years and millions in legal fees to get to the point that the pair began splitting up their combined assets, including the French vineyard and estate, Chateau Miraval, they bought together for $60 million. In an extra twist, Brad sued his ex-wife for, according to the lawsuit, selling her stake in their co-owned vineyard to a Luxembourg-based spirits manufacturer controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler without his knowledge. Court papers submitted by Brad alleged that Angelina intentionally “sought to inflict harm on” him by selling her stake in the business. He said they had agreed to never sell their respective interests without the other’s consent. He also claimed the wine company grew “into a multimillion-dollar global business and one of the world’s most highly regarded producers of rosé wine” through his work and that Jolie had contributed “nothing to Miraval’s success.” In a revised complaint filed in summer 2023, the Fight Club actor insisted he had first refusal on his ex-wife's share of their idyllic winery, situated in Correns, in the South of France. Pitt’s later submitted legal papers said: “As will be demonstrated at trial, Jolie’s actions were unlawful, severely and intentionally damaging Pitt and unjustly enriching herself.” Jolie denied these allegations. But the dispute, which was dubbed the “War of the Rosés”, raged on. Just a week after Pitt’s revised complaint was filed, Vanity Fair dropped the bombshell accusation that talks about the vineyard sale broke down after Pitt attempted to persuade Jolie into signing an NDA — which would prevent her from speaking about the infamous 2016 private jet incident — in return for her being able to sell her stake. The magazine spoke to the couple's former head of security, real estate brokers and others with intimate knowledge of the couple's time in the south of France to attain this information, but representatives for Pitt claimed that it was actually Jolie who first broached the idea of an NDA. They also claimed that the NDA was purely related to the sale of the winery, “to ensure the seller doesn’t damage the value of the asset after being paid for it.” The Vanity Fair piece claimed to shed a little more light on the private jet incident as well, with the couple’s ex-head of security telling Vanity Fair that Pitt was “drinking quite a bit” at the time it happened. Another source claimed: “Brad was drinking, and the confrontation got out of hand. He was absolutely wrong in how he behaved but immediately apologised and acknowledged that he had crossed a line. He will always regret [it], and right away took steps to address this and try to make amends.” Pitt apparently quit drinking immediately after the incident. Pitt’s lawyer said: “Thankfully, the various public authorities the other side has tried to use against him [Brad Pitt] over the past six years have made their own independent decisions. Brad will continue to respond in court as he has consistently done.” And to top it all off, the Vanity Fair article ended by noting that since September 2016, nobody from either Pitt or Jolie’s family have returned to stay at the French property. In July 2023, Jolie’s legal team accused Brad Pitt of acting like a “petulant child” over the sale of her stake, with claims that Pitt has engaged in a “blatant money grab,” and has spent more time on vanity projects around the site, like building a recording studio and renovating the swimming pool, than on the vineyard and winemaking process. The filing alleges that Pitt “deals in illusions, not dirt and grapes.” “During the years that he allegedly 'built' the business,” the filing reads, “he filmed and appeared in dozens of movies, not to mention making countless promotional appearances, jetting-setting around the world for movie premieres, and attending Hollywood parties. “While he no doubt visited the vineyards to admire the work of the French laborers who actually made the business successful,” it continues, “Pitt is no vigneron.” “Pitt wasted the company’s assets, spending millions on vanity projects, including more than $1 million on swimming pool renovations, building and rebuilding a staircase four times, and spending millions to restore a recording studio.” Pitt did not respond to these claims. Legal documents were then obtained by TMZ which said that Brad and Angelina had agreed to mediation, rather than settling in court, regarding their long-standing vineyard dispute. According to Daily Mail, Jolie has reportedly said she was willing to take part in a settlement conference, while Pitt appointed a ‘provisional administrator’ in a bid to hopefully help negotiations. As you may expect in a situation like this, both Brad and Angelina are represented by highly esteemed LA-based divorce lawyers, who they’ve been working with for years. But it took a while to get here — both Brad and Ange have made changes to the legal teams they initially hired back when the divorce proceedings first began. Brad was initially working with celebrity specialist lawyer Lance Spiegel, who has represented the likes of Charlie Sheen, Michael Jackson, Heather Locklear and Eva Longoria. Angelina was originally represented by lawyer-to-the-stars Laura Wasser , who previously worked with Britney Spears and Kim Kardashian during their divorces. Jolie then ditched Wasser for another lawyer, Samantha Bley Dejean, in 2018, because she felt Dejean had more experience in the “protection of children.” At the time, Jolie's spokesperson, Mindy Nyby, told People: “Angelina has decided to change counsel to Samantha Bley Dejean, as Samantha's expertise is the protection and best interest of children. Angelina appreciates Laura’s cooperation in transitioning the case of the past several weeks.\" For his part, Pitt has transitioned to primarily using the legal expertise of Anne C Kiley (it’s unclear if Spiegel is still involved, though he was initially Pitt’s primary counsel). Kiley even addressed the private jet incident in a statement to The Times in 2022 saying: “Brad has owned everything he’s responsible for from day one — unlike the other side — but he’s not going to own anything he didn’t do. He has been on the receiving end of every type of personal attack and misrepresentation.” There was also beef between Pitt and Jolie’s lawyers when Jolie’s team allegedly attempted to subpoena Pitt at the 2022 SAG awards (where a legal team demands someone’s presence in court by handing them legal papers) à la Olivia Wilde, only to find that Pitt wasn’t present. Representatives of Jolie and Pitt have never responded to these subpoena claims. Pax also became closely linked to the messy divorce battle due to resurfaced comments in late 2023 about Pitt from Father's Day 2020. \"Happy Father’s Day to this world class a**hole,\" he wrote on Instagram under a photo of Pitt receiving an Oscar, seen by MailOnline. \"You time and time again prove yourself to be a terrible and despicable person. \"You have no consideration or empathy toward your four youngest children who tremble in fear when in your presence,\" MailOnline reports the private post as saying. \"You will never understand the damage you have done to my family because you are incapable of doing so. \"You have made the lives of those closest to me a constant hell. You may tell yourself and the world whatever you want, but the truth will come to light someday. So, Happy Father’s Day, you f*****g awful human being!!!” Pitt did not publicly respond to his son's comments, but was cleared of all allegations of abuse. The actor also made a concerted effort to be seen to be bettering himself — he began a public wellness journey, marked by his cashmere company, gender-fluid skincare line, sobriety and foray into sculpture work. Jolie on the other hand eluded to a difficult past few years in an interview with Vogue in 2023, where she said that her children “saved” her. “Having children saved me and taught me to be in this world differently,” she told the publication. She is currently based in Los Angeles (at the former home of Hollywood legend Cecil B DeMille which she bought for $25 million), but appears keen to eventually move away. “I would love to live abroad and will do so as soon as [all of] my children are 18,” she told Harper's Bazaar in 2019. “Right now I'm having to base where their father chooses to live.” In an April 2024 court filing as part of the ongoing battle over Château Miraval, Jolie alleged that Pitt was abusive toward her prior to the 2016 plane incident that led her to filing for divorce. The actress's legal team filed a motion asking to release communications they claim would prove that Brad wouldn’t allow her to sell her share of the winery to him unless she agreed to a \"more onerous\" and \"expansive\" NDA. The topic of the NDA first caused a back and forth last year in court and now it’s rearing its head again with new allegations coming to light. The lawyers claim that, \"While Pitt's history of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family’s September 2016 plane trip from France to Los Angeles, this flight marked the first time he turned his physical abuse on the children as well. Jolie then immediately left him.\" Pitt hasn’t commented in response as yet, though a source reportedly close to him told PEOPLE,\"This is a pattern of behaviour — whenever there is a decision that goes against the other side they consistently choose to introduce misleading, inaccurate and/or irrelevant information as a distraction.” Though conversely, Jolie's lawyers claim that she \"never pressed charges as she believed the best course was for Pitt to accept responsibility and help the family recover from the post-traumatic stress he caused.\" Her attorney Paul Murphy said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE earlier this week, \"Mr. Pitt refused to purchase Ms. Jolie’s interest when she would not be silenced by his NDA. By refusing to buy her interest but then suing her, Mr. Pitt put directly at issue why that NDA was so important to him and what he hoped it would bury: his abuse of Ms. Jolie and their family. After eight months of delays, this motion asks the Court to force Mr. Pitt to finally produce that evidence.\" The team claim that Jolie’s sealed filing which includes emails, summaries of the family’s expected testimony and other evidence, caused Pitt to worry it would become public, meaning that they feel he wanted to \"contractually bind” her to staying silent about his \"personal misconduct, whether related to Miraval or not.\" It remains to be seen if the motion will lead to a trial. Now, further fuel has been added to the fire with the revelation that one of Pitt’s children, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, has chosen to drop his name from her surname, making her Vivienne Jolie. However, it is not clear if Vivienne has legally changed her name. But this is not the first time reports have emerged claiming that members of the Jolie-Pitt family have dropped “Pitt” from their surnames. Eldest daughter Zahara is said to have introduced herself as “Zahara Marley Jolie” when joining a sorority at Spelman College in Atlanta, according to a video of her induction from last year. Elsewhere, people have noticed that Shiloh’s Instagram name refers to themselves as “Shiloh Jolie” with no mention of Pitt.

        "description": "The promising Free to Play penguin-based party game is coming to Steam June 6.",
        "content": "We've already talked a bit about Sneak Out on these here pages . The multiplayer stealth game has been anything but quiet on the internet, making all kinds of noise as top streamers like Annie Fuchsia and PEGTV have been putting it through its paces in the super-successful stress tests. We've already seen giddy streamers running around a haunted castle hiding and sneaking away from a pursuant Hunter, but let's dig into some of the unique mechanics that make these monsters so threatening. The premise of Sneak Out is simple: at the start of a match, six players (who are Penguins, because why not?) initiate a ritual in one of the many eclectic rooms of a haunted castle, with one of the players getting transformed into a Hunter. The other players must then run, hide, and set traps—whether for the Hunter or each other—as they seek to escape the level. It's very easy to pick up and play, but there's a boatload of tricks to master for the three unique Hunters (otherwise known as Seekers) you can play as. First up, there's the matter of movement. Hunters are pretty oafish creatures, leaving footprints and kicking up a racket wherever they go. Thankfully, you can use the 'Sneak' action to offset these giveaways, helping you catch those hapless Penguins off guard. Each Hunter also has a basic attack to deliver the final blow to their victims. So what does each Hunter bring to the table? First up, there's the Reaper, eager to swing his deadly scythe to accelerate a Penguin's path into the afterlife. The Reaper has an excellent 'Blink' ability which teleports him several metres—perfect for springing nasty surprises on your victims. His Death Run, meanwhile, is a speedy sprint that closes the distance when those pesky birds are flitting just out of scythe's reach. Next up is the Scarecrow, who can plant and throw Pumpkin Bombs to turn Penguins into pingu stew. Up to three can be planted around the map at any one time, so try setting them up near breakable walls, tasks, and other spots that your victims might be tempted to traverse. His second skill is his Crow pal, who increases your range of vision and can spot players through walls. Last but not least is the Vampire, the most agile of the Hunters. His Blood Lust ability gives him a temporary speed boost as he ravenously seeks to feed, and he can also transform into a bat, flitting over walls and other obstacles before swooping down on his victims. Within each match, you'll get to upgrade your Hunters with a mini-progression system too. Every time you eliminate a penguin, you'll level up, getting a choice of two randomised upgrades to improve your hunting ability—be that better vision of penguins' footsteps, or a reduction in negative effects caused by traps and other penguin machinations. Then, when just one Penguin is left on the map, your levelling bar will slowly but constantly fill, building your momentum as you bolster yourself with upgrades while your final victim frantically scrambles for the exit. So there are many routes to success for monstrously minded players. There's plenty to do between matches, as you kick back in the village hub where you can gather resources, goof around with fellow players in mini-games, and show off the swag, characters, and outfits that you can buy using the game's card currency. Sneak Out is creeping onto Steam June 6, so wishlist it now if you want to be among the first to set foot in its spooky corridors.",

        "description": "The Bear season 3's latest teaser brings the heat ahead of the acclaimed show's return on Hulu and Disney Plus.",
        "content": "Full spoilers follow for The Bear season 2. The Bear season 3 is less than a month away, so it's high time that someone said \"Yes, chef!\" to our request to see some footage from the hit show's next entry. Last Friday (May 24), FX – the studio behind the acclaimed comedy-drama – duly obliged, with the Disney subsidiary delivering a spicy 30-second trailer to tide us over until the show returns. Given its brief runtime, there's not a lot we can glean from The Bear season 3 's latest teaser but, based on the fast-paced clips we see, it'll serve up another tension-filled mix of melodrama and comedy that threatens to boil over at any moment. This isn't the first teaser we've eaten up ahead of The Bear 's third season being released. Over two weeks ago (May 10), FX revealed The Bear season 3's first trailer , albeit it was one that offered no clues about where the story was heading. Instead, it simply showed Carmen 'Carmy' Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) preparing to cook up another food-based storm at the titular restaurant, which officially opened in the Hulu and Disney Plus show's season 2 finale. The Bear season 3's dual teasers come three months after its June 27 release date – and confirmation that all eight episodes will drop on launch day – was announced. That reveal came three months after The Bear was renewed for a third season . Given the number of plaudits and awards it's received since its June 2022 debut, plus its popularity among general viewers, it was inevitable that one of the best Hulu shows and best Disney Plus shows would re-open its doors to the public. The Bear season 3 might not be the end of the line for the Christopher Storer-developed series, either. First reported by Reel Chicago and later circulated by Deadline , rumors abound that FX has greenlit a fourth installment of the culinary drama, which is apparently being filmed back-to-back with the forthcoming season. An FX spokesperson declined to comment when approached by Variety for confirmation on whether a fourth season was in the offing. It's possible, though, that we'll get an announcement once season 3 has been released on two of the world's best streaming services . Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Regardless, it's a wise move for FX to shoot two seasons of its most popular show – I'm sure Shōgun will argue against that, mind you – simultaneously. Just as Ted Lasso 's cast became sought-after names following the hit Apple TV Plus show's explosion in popularity, some of The Bear 's talented cast have similarly found themselves as some of the hottest prospects in the entertainment industry. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who some viewers might have also know from Andor , is in line to play The Thing in Marvel 's live-action reboot of The Fantastic Four . Ayo Edebiri voiced April O'Neil in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem , will voice another animated character in Pixar 's Inside Out 2 , and was in line to appear in Marvel's Thunderbolts film before scheduling conflicts scuppered those chances. As for White, he recently starred in A24's The Iron Claw (out now on Max ), Apple's Fingernails movie, and was also coveted by Marvel at one point. With some of The Bear 's most notable names becoming hot commodities in Hollywood circles, it's unclear how their increasingly packed schedules might impact development on future installments of the wildly successful show. Shooting two seasons back-to-back, then, makes sense if some of them will be unavailable for long stretches throughout the rest of 2024. Nobody outside of Storer knows how long The Bear will run for, either, so it's possible that its fourth season could be its last. If it is, at least we'll have been treated to a tasty, four course meal, rather than the increasingly common three-season arc that most series deliver. The Bear season 3 debuts on Hulu (US) and Disney Plus (internationally on June 27.",

        "content": "The President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Joe Ajaero , has advocated better pay and better welfare for journalists in the country. He said apart from better salaries, journalists should also enjoy insurance cover and pension. The NLC president made the call during a courtesy visit to the President of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo , in Abuja. Ajaero described journalists as a group of professionals fighting for everyone, but who, unfortunately, have nobody fighting for them. He said he recommends the review of the minimum wage for journalists every two years adding that it is unfortunate some of them are begging for their salaries to be paid. The labour leader pointed out the critical role of journalists in nation-building as people who do not have the luxury of enjoying weekends, public holidays or festive seasons because they have to constantly be at work. “The welfare of journalists is being underplayed. While journalists are a group of professionals fighting for everyone, nobody is for them, they are not even for themselves. “Journalists do not have weekends, public holidays or festive seasons. They work and report activities of people that are enjoying weekends, public holidays and festivities. “Even when a journalist is sacked or not paid for one year, other journalists will not write a story on such injustice. “I am advocating for a consultative machinery that we should hold every two years, to have a negotiation with all media employers in the county to fix minimum wage for journalists. “Also, there should be a pension that all journalists should enjoy after retiring from the job. Insurance cover is another thing that Journalists should enjoy to make them work better,” the NLC President said. While acknowledging the difficult terrains in which publishers work, he stressed the importance of timely payment of salaries for workers, adding that non-payment should be treated as a criminal offence.",

        "content": "shared a stunning carousel of family photos this Memorial Day weekend - and the mother-of-four has never looked better. The cookbook author, 38, joined husband and their four kids – Luna, eight, Miles, six, Esti, one, and Wren, 11 months – at their local Natural History Museum for a fun-filled family outing. Proving she's just like the rest of us, Chrissy shared the good and the bad, including an outtake of her tossing her hair over one shoulder, eyes shut, as she prepared to be camera-ready. \"Beautiful, chaotic hour at the natural history museum!,\" she captioned the post. Chrissy looked unbelievable in a pair of high-waisted jeans and a white lace bralet. The tiny top boasted a halterneck cut and was perfectly paired with her flared mom jeans. She slung a suede, fringe-embellished bag over one shoulder, adding a bohemian edge to her look. The photos showed Chrissy and John sharing special family moments with their kids, with their youngest two Esti and Wren – who was born via a surrogate – taking on a starring role. John was every inch the doting dad in the sweet snaps, which saw him carrying little Wren on his shoulders as they toured the museum and grounds. The couple raise their four kids in their Beverly Hills home. The spacious, 10,700 square foot property, features six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, offering ample space for their whole family. The outdoor area is equally impressive and boasts a 100-foot saltwater infinity pool with panoramic views of the city. John and Chrissy's fans were surprised when the couple last year, just months after Chrissy had . While Chrissy was pregnant with their daughter Esti, Wren was born via surrogate to a woman named Alexandra. Describing the unique experience, the video model said: \"We ate hot pot to celebrate, watched Vanderpump Rules with our growing bellies, our families blending into one for the past year. \"Just minutes before midnight on June 19th, I got to witness the most beautiful woman, my friend, our surrogate, give birth amidst a bit of chaos, but with strength and pure joy and love.\" The kids aren't far off developmentally as a result; it won't be long until Wren joins his sister Esti at daycare, a milestone the family celebrated this month.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON, May 28 — The US government unveiled today its policy for using voluntary carbon credits that seeks to put “guardrails” to boost confidence in a nascent market after some high-profile offset projects failed to deliver the promised emissions reductions. The heads of the Treasury, Energy and Agriculture Departments as well as President Joe Biden’s top climate and economic advisers announced a joint statement of policy and principles to guide participation in voluntary carbon markets as part of its broader efforts to encourage their development. “Voluntary carbon markets can help unlock the power of private markets to reduce emissions, but that can only happen if we address significant existing challenges,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “The principles released today are an important step toward building high-integrity voluntary carbon markets.” Many companies “offset” their own greenhouse gas emissions by buying voluntary carbon credits, which represent the avoidance or removal of emissions via projects largely located in developing countries. But a series of high-profile controversies has shaken confidence in the market for carbon offsets, with several large companies that buy carbon credits retreating from the market as recent studies found that several large forest protection projects failed to deliver their promised emission reductions. Voluntary carbon markets shrunk for the first time last year in at least seven years. The principles for “responsible participation” in offset markets outlined by US officials on Tuesday include strict standards to ensure that projects deliver real and quantifiable emissions reductions, monitoring to ensure projects do not harm local communities and that corporate buyers prioritize decarbonising their own supply chains before opting for credits. The move by the US to ensure “integrity” in voluntary carbon markets comes as several organizations, such as the Integrity Council for Voluntary Carbon Markets, have started to publish principles to define high-quality offsets. The Energy Department announced last year that it would purchase credits from projects that will remove carbon dioxide from the air in a bid to bolster that technology. The Agriculture Department has also created a program to help farmers, ranchers and forest owners to participate in carbon markets by helping them to identify high-integrity carbon offset programs for generating carbon credits. Meanwhile, the State Department set up the Energy Transition Accelerator, a carbon offset program that aims to help developing countries transition away from coal, as well as the LEAF coalition, which aims to stem tropical deforestation. — Reuters",

It will be open to anyone aged 17 and above, and the event is receiving support from local youth-led charity OPEN which will help create a “safe environment” at the gig. Black, who is aged 17, said his set will feature techno, hardgroove and some of his original music. “This is kind of a debut of some of my music – I’ll be playing unreleased music that I’m working on at the moment,” he said. Black said there is also some reggae influence in his music, as well as 90s rave. He does not feel there is a lot of interest in electronic dance music in Shetland but is looking to influence his generation to get more into the scene. Black has been making music since he was around 14, and with a move to Glasgow on the cards for university he is looking to take some further steps up the DJing ladder down south. His ultimate aim is to make a “full career” out of music, and also plans to move to Toronto in Canada later down the line. Tickets for the Trondra event are available from High Level Music and will also be on the door on the night, with the music running from 10pm to 1am.",

        "description": "Orlando Pirates are set to reward their prolific striker, Tshegofatso Mabasa with a new contract extension and a significantly high buyout clause, the Siya crew investigates.",
        "content": "Following , the latest development comes after the striker's outstanding performance as the season's top goal scorer, where he netted a total of 16 goals. The sources have added that the new contract may include a significant R50 million buyout clause, which will apply to both local and international clubs interested in acquiring Mabasa's services. This clause is indicative of Mabasa's high value to the team and is seen as a protective measure to ensure that the club is adequately compensated should he be sought after by other teams, considering his incredible form in recent months. \"All the parties involved are happy about the upcoming new deal. Yes, it's of course an improved contract because the player has proven himself that he could be the best striker in the league and that warrants an improved contract,\" said the Siya source. \"It's not yet 100% done but the club has exercised that option which they had of keeping him for another two seasons as his contract ends in June 30 this year. But now it means he won't be going anywhere. The team exercised the two-year option plus the new two-year contract which means it runs until June 2028,\" the source told Soccer Laduma. Mabasa's goalscoring prowess is undisputed, as he is the reigning DStv Premiership top goal scorer. He demonstrated his talent by scoring six goals in 13 appearances for Moroka Swallows at the start of the season until December, and after returning from his loan spell, he added another 10 goals, this time in 13 games for Pirates. A second Siya source also discussed Mabasa's buyout clause and contract at Pirates. \"It's not just an improved contract but also with a buyout clause of R50 million. That means whichever team wants him have to meet Pirates' demands, they won't let him go for cheap. He is the best striker currently and with interest from local teams as well as Europe it's only fair to have that buy out clause,\" the second source stated. The Siya crew contacted Pirates for comment but the club had not responded by the time this story was published. You must be to read and post comments.",

        "content": "Royal fans are convinced that one royal family member looks \"exactly like\" Prince William as they enjoy throwback snaps of the family as teenagers. Every family tree has it's lookalikes and the monarchy are no different. Many of the royals are the spitting image of their parents or elder siblings, while some look more similar to ancestors from much older generations. Princess Beatrice has often been compared to Queen Victoria because of both of their uniquely shaped eyes and striking lip shape. Plus pictures of Prince Harry have often shown him looking a lot like his father, King Charles. Over the years, as Princess Kate and Prince William have welcomed their children Prince George , Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, and many have often compared them to the late Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Diana, and the Middletons. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle warned they must make a choice if they want to be popular Hundreds of fans have been enjoying looking at throwback snaps of some of the most beloved royals from when they were in their teenage years, thanks to a Reddit forum names 'Royals Gossip'. Photographs include images of Queen Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret, Princess Ann, Princess Diana, King Charles, the Prince and Princess of Wales , as well as Prince Harry and Megan.

I've always seen his mum in him but that picture of Philip is William all over.\" Another said: \"I remember when that photo of William came out. He was so cute as a teenager.\" However, others think he looked just like his mum, with one person saying: \"Prince William looking just like Diana at 15.\" People think William looks just like Charlotte in the picture ( Image: The Prince and Princess of Wales/Kensington Palace/PA Wire) Not only do they think William looks a lot like Philip and his mum, but they also have noticed a striking resemblance between William and Prince Charlotte.

        "description": "The company said the Nightcap offer would not work as it was 'highly conditional'",
        "content": "The embattled hospitality group Revolution Bars has dismissed a takeover bid from its competitor Nightcap, stating the offer is \"incapable of being delivered\". Tameside-based Revolution, which operates the Revolucion de Cuba and Peach Pubs brands, initiated a sale process and significant restructuring efforts last month as it battles to stay afloat. As part of its survival strategy, the company has announced plans for a £12.5m capital raise and the shuttering of 18 establishments. Revolution has critiqued Nightcap's earlier proposal this month for not incorporating the planned £12.5m fundraising, suggesting instead that Nightcap would need to conduct two separate rounds of financing. The company has confirmed that funding for its proposed capital injection is already in place, with commitments from investors including ex-Pizza Express chairman Luke Johnson, pending approval from shareholders at an upcoming general meeting. Revolution has labelled the Nightcap proposition as unfeasible due to its \"highly conditional\" nature, reliance on assumptions about support from Nightcap's financiers, and the associated time and cost implications. However, Revolution maintains that it \"remains open\" to reviewing any new offers from Nightcap or other interested entities. The company stated: \"Without the additional funding proposed to be raised in connection with the fundraising and without the cost savings delivered through the proposed Restructuring Plan, the Board anticipates that the group will face liquidity pressures from Q1 (July, August and September 2024) onwards.\" Nightcap owns 46 UK bars such as the Cocktail Club and Dirty Martini brands.",

        "content": "Der dritte gesamtdeutsche Titel ist nur noch Formsache. Nun peilt der Weltpokalsieger Magdeburg nach dem DHB-Pokal die Titelverteidigung in der Königsklasse an - mehr geht nicht. An ein deutsches Handball-Wunder glaubt keiner mehr. Der hat die Meisterschale fest im Griff. Vor dem letzten Auswärtsspiel der Bördestädter am Donnerstag bei den Rhein Neckar Löwen (20.30 Uhr/Dyn) ist der Vorsprung von vier Punkten und 84 Toren auf die Füchse so groß, dass er nicht mehr einzuholen ist. Das sagen zumindest alle Experten. Und auch der sonst so besonnene und zurückhaltende SCM-Trainer Bennet Wiegert ließ sich nach dem knapp gewonnen Heimspiel am Sonntag gegen den SC DHfK dazu hinreißen, die Feierlichkeiten beginnen zu lassen. \"Ich muss mal schauen, wie wir die Woche strukturieren und Seriosität reinbringen. Die Jungs sollen das jetzt erst einmal richtig genießen und feiern\", sagte Wiegert der Magdeburger \"Volksstimme\". Der SC Magdeburg ist momentan das Nonplusultra in der Bundesliga, in und wohl auch in der ganzen Handballwelt. Der Club könnte nun etwas schaffen, das sehr selten ist: das Quadrupel. Den Weltpokal hat der Club in der Tasche, den DHB-Pokal auch, die Meisterschale bekommt er am Sonntag nach dem letzten Spiel gegen die HSG Wetzlar. Jetzt fehlt nur noch der Pott für den Champions League-Sieg. Im Final Four in am 8. Juni treffen die Magdeburger zunächst auf Aalborg AB und hoffen darauf, am 9. Juni den Titel verteidigen zu können. Einsatzzeiten für Bankdrücker? Deshalb kommt dem Team die frühe Meisterschaftsentscheidung sehr gelegen. \"Wir können uns jetzt ganz auf die Champions League konzentrieren, haben keinen Druck mehr. Jetzt gehen wir all in, wollen alles\", sagte Nationalspieler Lukas Mertens nach dem Leipzig-Spiel. Trainer Wiegert ist sich aber sicher, dass er und seine Kollegen auch die beiden letzten Bundesliga-Partien siegreich gestalten wollen. \"Ich werde jetzt keinen Druck aufbauen. Aber wir wissen, dass die Jungs auch dieses Spiel gewinnen wollen\", sagte der Erfolgscoach. Gut möglich, dass er seinen großen Stars wie Felix Claar, Omar Ingi Magnusson und Gisli Kristjansson eine Verschnaufpause gönnt und dafür ein paar Bankdrückern Zeit gibt, sich zu präsentieren. Denn auch dort steckt viel Potenzial: Welcher Trainer kann es sich schon leisten, Nationalspieler wie Philipp Weber oder Michael Damgaard kaum einzusetzen. Was passiert auf der Torhüterposition? Wiegert ist der Macher des SCM-Erfolgs. Stück für Stück hat er im Laufe der vergangenen Jahre sein Team zusammengestellt, gezielt Spieler verpflichtet, die von ihren Qualitäten und vor allem menschlich in sein Konzept passen. So kann er einen Handball spielen lassen, dem derzeit kaum ein Gegner gewachsen ist. Es ist eine Mannschaft, die sich auch von Rückschlägen nicht aus der Ruhe bringen lässt. Die Unruhe, die nach dem Dopingfall Nikola Portner im Umfeld entstand, überspielte die Mannschaft grandios, holte den DHB-Pokal und zog ins Champions League-Final-Four-Turnier ein. Sollte der Schweizer Torhüter tatsächlich gesperrt werden - seine Erklärfrist endet am 30. Mai - wird sich Wiegert genau überlegen, ob er Nationaltorhüter an die Elbe lotst. Der steht noch in Kielce unter Vertrag. Die Polen sollen dem Vernehmen nach 1,2 Millionen Euro Ablöse verlangen - eine Summe, die im Handball zumindest unüblich ist. Und sie würde etwa ein Zehntel des SCM-Etats bedeuten. Beim sehr sparsam und überlegt wirtschaftenden SC Magdeburg wird man genau rechnen. Aber vielleicht ergeben sich durch die Erfolge zusätzliche Einnahmequellen, die einen solchen Transfer ermöglichen. (dpa) Zwei Wahlkämpfer der Linken sind bei einer Wahlkampfaktion am Lindenauer Markt in Leipzig von einem Unbekannten angegriffen worden. Wie die Polizei am Dienstag mitteilte, wurde ein 46-Jähriger nach... Der Meistertitel ist dem SC Magdeburg nur noch theoretisch zu nehmen. Nach dem Derbysieg gegen Leipzig hat der SCM zwei Spieltage vor Schluss vier Punkte und 84 Tore Vorsprung auf die Füchse Berlin. Die schlechten Nachrichten aus der Wirtschaft im Erzgebirge reißen nicht ab. Diesmal trifft es knapp 85 Beschäftigte in Elterlein. Wie es dazu gekommen ist.

        "content": "Donna Leon lädt literarisch wieder nach Venedig ein: In Commissario Brunettis 33. Fall trifft man auf die altbekannten Figuren, aber trotzdem ist alles anders. Scharfzüngige Kommentare über Touristen, humorvolle Blicke auf das Menschliche und nachdenkliche Betrachtungen der Welt an sich: Pünktlich wie seit 33 Jahren legt Donna Leon ihr neues Buch über Commissario Brunetti in vor. Sie sind alle da: der seit gut 30 Jahren nicht alternde Brunetti, seine Frau Paola und die Kinder, der nervige Chef Patta, die kluge Kollegin Griffoni und die umtriebige Polizeiassistentin Elettra. Und doch ist \"Feuerprobe\" anders als frühere Bände. Es gibt eigentlich weder eine mysteriöse Leiche noch ein Verbrechen, das Brunetti aufklären soll. Donna Leon über den Inhalt \"In diesem Buch geht es um mehrere Dinge: Was wir für die Vergangenheit halten, ist nicht unbedingt die Vergangenheit, die war\", sagt Leon im Gespräch der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. \"Es geht auch darum, was in einem Krieg passiert ist. Und um etwas, das zurückkommt, um dich zu verfolgen. Und es geht um \"Baby-Gangs\".\" Gemeint sind Jugendbanden, die sich in den Straßen Venedigs aus Langeweile gegenseitig an die Kehle gehen. Ein Held und Abgründe Es beginnt alles mit einer Mutprobe unter zwei sogenannten Baby-Gangs, die auf dem Polizeirevier landen. Der Vater eines der Beteiligten war einst bekannt als Held, der Kameraden bei einem Einsatz im Irak-Krieg das Leben rettete. Er taucht zufällig in einem anderen Zusammenhang im Dunstkreis von Brunetti auf, und der beginnt, seine Vergangenheit zu beleuchten. \"Schlichte Neugier\", wie Signoria Elettra richtig feststellt. Seite 108, immer noch kein Verbrechen. Aber Brunetti entdeckt Abgründe, die ihn erschüttern. Die beiden Männer treffen am Ende des Buches auch noch in einem dramatischen Finale zusammen, bei dem es um Leben oder Tod geht. Viel Venedig, wenig Verbrechen Wer einen Krimi sucht, in dem sich alle Details später als Puzzleteile eines Kriminalfalls entpuppen, ist bei Brunettis 33. Fall fehl am Platz. Vieles bleibt einfach als Facette des Lebens in Venedig hängen. Eine reiche Amerikanerin spaziert durchs Bild, ein schmieriger Anwalt, der einer Polizistin Verführung eines Minderjährigen anhängen will, ein einsamer Kollege Brunettis, der Bronzestatuen sammelt und in Gefahr gerät. Die Fäden zum eigentlichen Fall sind denkbar dünn. Das sei Absicht, sagt Leon. Es spiegele die Veränderung der italienischen Gesellschaft wider. Kontinuität schwinde. \"Die Italiener werden immer amerikanischer, große Individualisten.\" Aber die klug beobachteten und elegant beschriebenen Facetten des Lebens in Venedig sind ja genau das, was Donna-Leon-Fans so schätzen an den Brunetti-Büchern. \"In meinen Büchern geht es eher um Menschen und ihre Gedanken\", sagt Leon. \"Die Atmosphäre, die Gespräche und die Interaktionen sind wichtiger als die Handlung.\" Krimi-Zutaten wie Grusel und Horror sind ohnehin nicht Donna Leons Metier. Brunetti als Donna Leons Alter Ego Da sinniert Brunetti nachdenklich über den Frühling, der ihm \"das Gefühl oder die Hoffnung, dass wir noch eine Chance bekommen\", gibt. Da wundert er sich, dass in \"Männerköpfen zu wenig Platz ist für ein Nebeneinander von Liebe und Wut\". Natürlich darf Brunettis Liebe zu den Klassikern nicht fehlen. Es sind dieses Mal die Memoiren des Marquis de Custine, die Leon selbst gerade zum zweiten Mal gelesen hat. In dieser Hinsicht sei Brunetti ihr Alter Ego, nicht seine ebenfalls belesene Frau Paola, sagt Leon: \"Er liest, was ich lese. Er ist mitfühlender als sie, ich mag dieses Sanfte an ihm.\" Touristen und ihre iPhones Donna Leon (81) bringt hier und da auch die Moderne in die eigentlich zeitlose Brunetti-Serie, erwähnt Instagram und Speichern in der Cloud, aber dass sie selbst aus einer anderen Welt stammt, wird nicht nur an der Liebe zu den Klassikern deutlich. Zur Gemütslage der \"Baby-Gangs\" heißt es an einer Stelle: \"Nichts Spannendes im Fernsehen, warum also nicht ein bisschen Randale\" - als ob die jungen Leute noch Fernsehen schauten. Leon tuts nicht, wie sie sagt. Und natürlich bekommen die Touristen, die Leon aus Venedig vertrieben haben, wieder ihr Fett weg: \"Boote vom Lido brachten Touristen, die sich auf ihren iPhones anschauten, wie Venedig aussah\", ätzt Leon schon auf den ersten 25 Seiten.

They say new technology, the dark web, the threat of terrorism and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine mean illegal weapons remain a danger to communities. It comes after two guns produced by 3D printers were recorded by police in Scotland for the first time in the middle of last year. Scottish Police Federation chairman David Threadgold, 49, believes an amnesty – also covering blades such as swords and knives – could make neighbourhoods across the country safer. He said: “There are people that will take a legally held firearm and use it for criminal activity. Experts warn the guns are cheap and easy to produce although unlikely to be an increased risk to the public. “We have got to get that balance right, of course, and the impact on the police is that they do not potentially have to deal with that type of crime. “The impact on the police and community could be significant. “If everything else is in place, bearing in mind that the SPF is the voice of every police officer in Scotland, I don’t think you would have a single cop who would not advocate against potentially making our community safer.” There were almost 20,000 offensive weapon crimes recorded by police in Scotland between 2021 and 2023, data revealed. Any country-wide amnesty would need the approval of the Crown Office and Police Scotland. David Kennedy, general secretary of the group, said that if weapons are not taken off the streets the way Police Scotland operate could change significantly. He said: “If we don’t get guns off the streets the reality is that we are moving closer to police officers in Scotland carrying firearms.” Get all the latest news from around the country Scan the QR code on your mobile device for all the latest news from around the country",

These days, there are so many ways to customize things that it can be hard to find the right print shop to make your ideas come to life. In this article, you will delve into six invaluable tips to help you find the right Custom Print Clothing shop for your needs. 1. Number of T-Shirts to Print Before choosing a custom print clothing shop, consider the quantity of T-shirts you need. Some shops specialize in small orders, while others cater to bulk printing. If you only need a few shirts, look for a shop that accepts low minimum orders. This ensures you don’t pay for more shirts than you require. Conversely, if you need a large quantity, opt for a shop equipped to handle bulk orders efficiently. By aligning your needs with the shop’s capabilities, you can ensure a seamless printing process without unnecessary expenses or delays. 2. Check Printing Quality Before committing to a shop, thoroughly assess the printing quality of their past work. Request samples or browse through their portfolio to evaluate the clarity, color vibrancy, and durability of prints. Look for crisp lines, vibrant colors that don’t fade easily, and smooth application of designs. Additionally, consider the printing techniques used, such as screen printing or direct-to-garment printing, and choose one that best suits your preferences and budget. By prioritizing printing quality, you can ensure your custom T-shirts look professional and withstand repeated washings without deterioration. 3. Know the Printing Costs Understanding the printing costs upfront is crucial for budgeting and avoiding unexpected expenses. Inquire about the shop’s pricing structure, including any setup fees, per-shirt costs, and additional charges for design services or special requests. Compare quotes from multiple shops to gauge the average price range and identify any discrepancies. Additionally, consider factors that may affect pricing, such as shirt quality, printing technique, and complexity of the design. While it’s tempting to opt for the cheapest option, prioritize value and quality to ensure satisfactory results. 4. Look For A Dependable Customer Service When selecting a custom print clothing shop, prioritize one with dependable customer service. A reliable shop will communicate promptly, answer your questions, and address any concerns throughout the printing process. They should be attentive to your needs and guide design options, printing techniques, and order specifications. 5. Check The Return Policy While rare, mistakes or discrepancies in printing may occur, and it’s essential to know the shop’s procedures for addressing such situations. A clear and fair return policy provides peace of mind, allowing you to request corrections or replacements if necessary. Pay attention to any conditions or limitations, such as timeframes for returns, acceptable reasons for returns, and procedures for initiating a return. 6. Go Through The Reviews Prior to finalizing your decision, take the time to read reviews and testimonials from past customers of the custom print clothing shop. Reviews offer valuable insights into the shop’s reliability, quality of work, and overall customer satisfaction. Look for patterns in feedback, paying attention to both positive and negative comments regarding communication, printing quality, timeliness, and customer service. Additionally, consider the shop’s response to any negative reviews, as it reflects their commitment to addressing customer concerns and improving their services.

        "content": "STOCKHOLM, Sweden, May 28 2024 (IPS) - Immigration policies are among the most hotly debated topics in Europe. Xenophobia, combined with curbing immigration, have become the main reason to why ever-increasing large crowds of voters are supporting populist parties. A visit to World War I French war cemeteries might provide a different perspective on import and exploitation of labourers from poor countries in the South, indicating what their suffering have meant to European wellbeing. For hundreds, even thousands of years, Europe has been dependent on a forced and often badly treated labour force – slaves, serfs, indentured labourers, prisoners of war – people who have been captured, or hired, and then transported from areas outside Europe, a practise especially evident during World War I. In Noyelles-Sur-Mernot , we find a Chinese cemetery, not far from the blood-soaked battlefield of Somme, where in 1916 approximately one million soldiers, during less than four months, lost their lives, or went missing. Here rests some of the 100,000 coolies who in China and Vietnam had been contracted by British and French armies to work, fight and die in the mud of the trenches. Coolies , in Chinese written as 苦力, meaning ”bitter labour” or “bitter strength”, went everywhere, from the Arctic to the southern ends of the world. They built railways in the USA, in Alaska, in the jungles of Amazonia, in the Middle East and Siberia. They worked in Peruvian silver mines and the diamond mines of Natal (South Africa), in guano fields in Peru and on sugar plantations in Trinidad, Cuba, and the German Samoa. Chinese workers were hired for pitiful amounts by professional contractors, obtaining advances from their customers and assuming the responsibility for discipline, travel, control, and supervision. After being sprayed head to foot with disinfectants and having their characteristic ponytails cut of, Chinese coolies were shipped off towards harsh work and/or battlefields. A long sea voyage, that could last more than four months, with diseases and insufficient food, killed many of them. Since Westerners found it difficult to distinguish one worker from another and to learn Chinese and Vietnamese names, coolies were deprived of their names and assigned numbers instead. Outside working hours coolies were not allowed into military canteens, or to mix with civilians, most of them lived in guarded and wired camps. Coolies were generally considered to be replaceable and often treated in an inhuman manner. In the 1890’s, a Swedish foreign legionnaire, Bertil Nelsson, described a crossing of a mountain range in Tonkin (Vietnam): Not far from the cemetery of Noyelles-Sur-Mernot we find the cemetery of Chapellete , one of six Indian War cemeteries around Somme and Amiens. The British considered the Indian continent as an integrated part of their empire, recruiting 800,000 Indian soldiers and 500,000 coolies , bringing them to various war zones of World War I, at least 73,000 of them died. This was not only a wartime procedure. Between 1896 and 1901, some 32,000 Indian, indentured labourers constructed a railway linking Uganda to the sea port of Mombasa, 2,500 labourers died during its construction. In the British colony of Natal approximately 200,000 Indians arrived as indentured labourers to work in mines and plantations. Between 1838 and 1920, 230,000 indentured Indian labourers arrived in British Guyana, mainly to toil in the plantations. During the same period more than 135,000 Indians arrived in Trinidad-Tobago. At the same time, the French contracted 30,000 Indians for work in Martinique, 20,000 to work in French Guyana, and no less than 500,000 were destined to Mauritius, whose descendants now constitute more than 65 % of the island’s population. These were just a few examples to indicate how the colonial powers of France and Great Britain spread Indian and Chinese workers around the globe. The great majority of this generally harshly treated labour force remained where they had been brought, in spite of the fact that contracts and enforcement had stipulated they were supposed to be transported back to China and India. Many Chinese, Indian and African coolies , as well as some Europeans, were “indentured labourers”. Since the sixteenth century an indentured servant was usually a labourer contracted to work, without pay, three to seven years in exchange for the cost of transportation, food, clothing, and a place to live. Indentures were quite common in Colonial America and different from slaves in the sense that their captivity was temporary and could be ended if they paid off the debts incurred for food and housing. An indenture could be sold. After arriving at their destination indentures were generally sold to the highest bidder. Like prices of slaves, their price went up or down depending on supply and demand. Indentured labour could also by authorities be used as a punishment, something that befell many European “vagrants” and minor criminals, who were sent off to the “colonies”. Another French cemetery, this one from World War II, situated just outside Lyon, might also remind us of sacrifices endured by people subdued under colonialism. Two days after Marshal Pétain had announced France’s surrender to the Nazis, the 25th regiment of Tiralleurs Sénégalais tried in the small town of Chasselay to hinder the German army from entering Lyon. Tiralleurs Sénégalais was the all-encompassing denomination of sub-Saharan recruits, of whom most came from Senegal. During the days that followed, the Germans experienced heavy losses, before the French and Africans surrendered. Prisoners were divided into two: The French on one side, the Africans on the other. The latter were machine-gunned. During World War I, 200,000 African troops were recruited by the French Army of whom 135,000 were deployed to Europe, where 30,000 were killed. During World War II, approximately the same number of Africans were recruited by France, of whom 40,000 were deployed to Europe. During World Wars I and II, approximately, 4,500,000 African soldiers and military labourers were mobilized by the Brits and French, about 2,000,000 of them died. Inside Africa, during and before these wars several hundreds of thousands of porters were used to transport goods through an often roadless terrain. These porters were often recruited by force and compelled to carry their burdens far from home, harassed by diseases, the cruelty of their leaders and an unhospitable terrain. Furthermore, they were often infected by diseases, previously unknown to them, while spreading sickness themselves. During World War I, 95,000 African porters died while in British service, 15,650 under the Belgians, and 7,000 under the Germans. French and Portuguese porter deaths are unaccounted for, but assumed to be at least 20,000. Also unaccounted for are deaths among “civilians” caused by the spread of diseases and mass migration. A work force similar to indentured labour made its appearance after World War II. During its aftermath several countries were in dire need of a numerous and effective labour force. As an example, in West Germany foreigners were allowed to work for a period of one or two years, before returning to their home country, making room for other migrants. For Turks, Tunisians and Moroccans, special rules applied – only unmarried persons could be recruited; family reunification was not allowed, a health check, and an aptitude test had to be passed. A Gastarbeiter , guest worker, could after two years not be allowed any extension. These harsh rules were mitigated over time and now more than 4 million persons with a recent Turkish migrant background live in Germany. Communist East Germany also had a Gastarbeiter system, with workers arriving from Poland, Vietnam and Cuba. Contact between guest workers and East German citizens was extremely limited. After work, Gastarbeiter were usually restricted to their dormitories, or an area of the city which Germans were not allowed to enter. Furthermore, sexual relations with a German led to deportation. Women Gastarbeiter were not allowed to become pregnant during their stay. If they did, they were forced to have an abortion. Similar systems have been used in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Workers from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan generally pay agents in their own countries, for travel and sponsorship during a limited time period. However, the receiving governments have currently begun to implement reforms to increase labour protection and remove elements of the Kafala (sponsorship) system, although these reforms have so far been insufficient to dismantle the system entirely. Currently, approximately 88% of the UAE population consist of expatriates, most of them migrant workers. Not all migrant workers, i.e. persons engaged in remunerated activities in a state of which they are not nationals, have been recruited through systems similar to the Kafala , some are undocumented workers, but many continue to suffer from uncertainty and an overhanging threat of being expelled from work and livelihood. The number of international migrant workers is currently totalling 170 million. They constitute 4.9 % of the labour force of destination countries with the highest rate at 42 % in the UAE. Among international migrant workers, women constitute 41.5 % and men 58.5 %. Whatever European anti-immigration parties may claim, the immigration of non-European labour is far from a new phenomenon. European war cemeteries, might serve as just one example testifying to the fact that Europeans have a lot to thank such “foreigners” for. Furthermore, Europeans also have reason to be ashamed of the misery their ancestors have caused such “alien workers”, as well as the fact that some are still exploiting and devaluing their contribution to the host countries’ economy and wellbeing.

        "description": "History says buy these stocks on the dip.",
        "content": "Starbucks ( SBUX 0.72% ) and Lululemon Athletica ( LULU 1.09% ) are top brands with a lot of growth left in the tank. However, both stocks recently sold off following weak sales guidance by both companies. Both stocks are currently down about 37% from their previous peak. While these stocks have delivered massive gains for investors over the last few decades, they haven't moved up in a straight line. Lululemon shares have fallen 30% or more off their high six times in the last decade. A dip of this magnitude is rarer for Starbucks shares, which have fallen this much only four times in the last 20 years. Here's why these stocks are worth buying on the dip. 1. Starbucks Starbucks is one of the most iconic consumer brands around. It has more than 38,000 stores worldwide, but management is planning to expand that number to 55,000 by 2030. Starbucks didn't get to where it is today without hitting some bumps in the road. Since 1971, the company has experienced several economic recessions but has kept on growing. It's currently experiencing another rough patch, with weak consumer spending trends sending revenue down 2% year over year last quarter. The issue isn't pinned down to a single geography. Management reported weakness in North America and the Middle East and a slower-than-expected recovery in China. Management still expects to report positive sales growth this year, just not as much as previously estimated. It now calls for full-year revenue to grow at a low-single-digit rate, down from previous guidance for growth between 7% to 10%. Nothing has changed the company's long-term goals. International is still a big opportunity for the brand, which outperformed the North American market last quarter. There's a great opportunity in India, where management is planning to operate 1,000 stores by 2028. The bad news in the near term means the stock is now trading at its best value in years. Investors can buy the stock at a discounted forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22, which is attractive against Wall Street's long-term projection for double-digit annualized earnings growth . 2. Lululemon Athletica Similar headwinds are hurting Lululemon, but it's a testament to this athletic brand's strength that, in a soft-demand environment, the company is still capable of growing revenue at double-digit rates. It posted a revenue increase of 16% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter last year, and management expects this year's revenue to grow 11% to 12% year over year. Lululemon was built from the ground up. Since opening its first store in Vancouver more than 20 years ago, it has used local marketing strategies, such as in-store classes, marathons, and other events, to win loyal customers. This strategy has turned it into a global growth phenomenon. Lululemon can grow for a long time, given that the athletic wear industry is estimated to be worth more than $350 billion, according to Statista, and still growing. There are a lot of places around the world that still don't know about the brand yet. The company plans to open 30 new stores outside of North America this year. The recent sell-off in the shares is undervaluing the brand's long-term opportunity. On the recent earnings call in March, management mentioned that there is a relative lack of brand awareness in most markets. Lululemon has an expanding assortment of products covering a range of activities, including the recent introduction of its first footwear line, that can appeal to a large customer base. The shares trade at an attractive forward P/E of 21, with Wall Street analysts projecting earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 13% per year.",

        "description": "And how President Biden can make that goal a better campaign theme",
        "content": "In 2020 and 2021, under Presidents Trump and Biden, Congress passed more than $5 trillion in COVID relief funding in six separate bills. The March 2020 CARES Act alone, at $2.2 trillion totaling about 10 percent of one year’s GDP, was the largest non-wartime federal stimulus ever. Without that funding, unemployment in the COVID recession would have easily reached 20 percent, as the economy spiraled into a 1930s-style self-deepening depression. Entire industries, such as airlines and restaurants, would have collapsed. The COVID stimulus, which dwarfed the $831 billion stimulus approved under President Obama in 2009 (now widely acknowledged to be inadequate), is a good illustration of government spending sufficient sums to avert an economic disaster. But if you take a good look at where that money went, much of it was money needed for long-deferred, everyday public needs. And 2024 is the year when . For instance, under the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund, the nation’s schools got $190 billion. As that money is exhausted, public schools face a massive teacher shortage, deferred maintenance expenses, and a fiscal cliff. Philadelphia has a budget gap of $407 million. New York’s is at least $700 million. Across the country, there are potential teacher layoffs and program cuts. COVID relief also provided funding of . After decades of chronic underfunding and operating deficits, that emergency money was a godsend. The pandemic sent many transit agencies into a death spiral. Reduced ridership meant reduced income from fares, but increasing fares only reduced ridership further. This downward spiral continues, as the federal funds are depleted. Deferred maintenance and unreliable service also pushed more riders into Uber. Likewise, more people working at home. In California, the relatively modern and efficient Bay Area Rapid Transit system has only 43 percent of its pre-pandemic riders. New Jersey’s state system faces a $1 billion budget shortfall by 2026. In Boston, where the antiquated subway and trolley system dates to the 19th century, the budget shortfall for the coming fiscal year, which begins July 1, is projected at between $567 million and $652 million. COVID relief under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act included . In exchange, states had to maintain continuous coverage, even if an enrollee’s income status changed. Now, states are disenrolling people who no longer qualify, and national enrollment will decline by 8.6 percent in 2024. The good news is that the strong economy lightened the blow that was feared on some of these fronts. For example, the expected “child care cliff” , as labor force participation of mothers of young children is larger than ever, and child care sector jobs remain strong. But the damaging rollbacks of the pop-up COVID safety net still have a significant impact in many areas. pulled back the curtain on public services that are strapped for funds, day in and day out. Biden’s original , blocked by the Republicans with the assistance of Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), would have provided about a trillion dollars more money for public needs, including free and universal pre-kindergarten for all three- and four-year-olds. The refundable Child Tax Credit, which was really a universal child allowance for all kids under 18, was allowed to lapse after one year. During the year it was in effect, it reduced child poverty by over 40 percent. Build Back Better proposed to make it permanent. Next year, Manchin and Sinema will be gone. If the voters return Biden and a Democratic Congress, Biden can take another stab at providing the level of public support that our threadbare public services need. This goal—of better ongoing support for popular public services—also provides Biden with much better talking points. Republicans oppose good public services. They’d rather have tax cuts for the rich. As part of the 2023 deal to increase the national debt ceiling, Republicans demanded and got a “clawback” of unspent COVID relief funds for the states totaling $27 billion. Biden has made a mistake in campaigning on how great the economy is. Though it certainly has improved in many respects since 2022, the economy just isn’t all that great for lots of working people. Build Back Better also proposed expansions in affordable housing and child care, and much more. It would be far better for Biden to campaign on what he could do with a working majority in Congress than brag about how much he has done. Nothing better illustrates the divide between the two parties.",

        "content": "Norway and Spain on Tuesday morning announced their official recognition of the State of Palestine, while Ireland is scheduled to follow suit later today. Before the Spanish government approved a decree recognizing the State of Palestine, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albarez said in a speech, \"recognizing the State of Palestine is a historic step that allows the Palestinians and Israelis to achieve peace.\" \"The adoption of the decision to recognize the State of Palestine is in line with UN resolutions and is not directed against any party,\" stressing that his country will not recognize any change to the 1967 borders, without the agreement of the Israelis and Palestinians, and the only path to peace is the two-state solution. The Spanish Prime Minister reaffirmed Spain's commitment to security in the region, and to working with Arab countries to hold a peace conference. He stressed that the priority now is to put an end to the unprecedented crisis in Gaza, open the crossings, and called for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and the entry of humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, Norway officially recognized the State of Palestine. \"Norways official recognition of Palestine as a state has entered into force,\" the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. The statement added, \"a number of other like-minded European countries will officially recognize Palestine on the same date.\" The three European countries announced this step simultaneously last week, with their leaders saying they hoped other countries would join the initiative, stressing that it would enhance the prospects for peace. With Spain, Norway and Ireland, the number of countries recognizing the State of Palestine rises to 147, out of 193 member states in the United Nations General Assembly.

        "description": "Suffolk Chamber of Commerce is calling for fairer revenue funding for the county and infrastructure upgrades in its 2024 general election \"manifesto\".",
        "content": "Suffolk Chamber of Commerce has drawn up a 15-point list of demands for the county ahead of the general election - including rail upgrades and fixing A14 pinch points. The business group is calling for the Treasury to sign off on Ely-Haughley rail junction improvements as a priority - and for A14 road upgrades including the Orwell Bridge and the Junction 55 Copdock Interchange in 2025-30. Business rates should be replaced by a sales or turnover tax for companies, it said. It wants to see fairer revenue funding for Suffolk and infrastructure upgrades to unlock private sector activity and investment as part of its plan for sustainable economic growth for the county. Chamber chief executive John Dugmore pointed out that its most recent Quarterly Economic Surveys showed many key business indicators such as sales, orders, investment, cash flow, turnover and profitability are generally lower than at any time since the start of the pandemic. “That is why Suffolk’s business owners and management teams need clarity as to what to expect from their local Parliamentary representatives over the next four or five years,” he said. But the county's business community was \"incredibly resilient\", he added. \"As proven over the years since the last General Election, companies across the county have weathered the storms of Covid19 lockdowns, labour and skills shortages, inflation, excessive business taxation and low growth,\" he said. Among the chamber's manifesto asks are \"lower and smarter taxes, reliefs and legislation that incentivise and don’t penalise risk-taking and innovation\". It also wants businesses to be empowered to be at the centre of positive economic and social changes. It calls for public debt to be cut and bureaucracy and supply-side blockages to be streamlined. Devolution of central government functions should be \"deepened\" to maximise an \"agile partnership working between Suffolk Chamber and the public sector\", it said. Other key asks include equal per capita national funding across all key departments for Suffolk - including for adult education, special educational needs and police. Employers should remain at the centre of skills pipeline planning after the end of the Norfolk & Suffolk Norfolk & Suffolk Local Skills Improvement Plan (LSIP), it said. The chamber's head of public affairs Paul Simon said the election would be pivotal for the county. “Let’s be crystal clear - without a strong and consistent pro-business voice in Westminster in the next Parliament, Suffolk will never be able to boost household incomes, attract investment and maximise its contributions to national prosperity. “This is a county with a strong concentration in key twenty first century sectors such as renewable energy, ports and logistics and the land-based economy that has been hobbled for far too long with out-of-date rail, road and communications infrastructure and a corporate tax and state funding system that penalises rather than encourages growth and investment. Suffolk Chamber will be conducting a survey of all Parliamentary candidates standing in the county to find out the extent to which they are in agreement with its 15-point programme. The research results will be shared with its members initially and then the whole of the county’s business community to help them make informed electoral decisions, it said. It is also hoping to host a number of hustings bringing together candidates with local business leaders - including one in Ipswich in partnership with the University of Suffolk.",

It can be prepared with or without meat, mushrooms, and can be based on tomato paste or another sauce. A recipe for mushroom gravy for mashed potatoes, pasta , and cereals was posted on Instagram by one of the cooking blogs (vika_tasty ). Ingredients: Method of preparation: 1. Wash and randomly chop the mushrooms. Fry them in butter for 20 minutes. Add salt. When the liquid forms, put the mushrooms in a saucepan. 2. Meanwhile, chop and fry the onion in butter until golden brown. When ready, add to the mushrooms. Add spices and salt. 3. Mix sour cream and water in a deep bowl. Add to the mushrooms. 4. Dissolve the flour in the water, and stir to avoid lumps. Pour over the mushrooms. 5. Put the pan on the fire and simmer for 20-30 minutes. If the gravy is too thick, you can add water.",

'It is a challenge and we must not get this wrong,' French transport minister Patrice Vergriete told aviation executives, warning 'serious operational problems' could create queues of tourists at airports and lead to the 'disruption' of public order. Mr Vergriete said last week preparations for the summer Olympics in Paris were still taking priority, despite alerting the interior minister to concerns. 'We have little visibility and are doubtful about police numbers and technology,' he lamented. From October, British and non-EU passport holders will have to go through fingerprint checks and face scans under the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES). The system will check each passenger's name and biometric data when they enter an EU country. It will replace the stamping of passports, which began after Brexit when the UK became a 'third country' to the bloc – meaning it is not a member state and does not have the right to free movement within the EU. French transport minister Patrice Vergriete (pictured) said he was 'worried' about the new automated border measures which are set to come into force from October British and non-EU passport holders will have to go through fingerprint checks and face scans under the new EU Entry/Exit System (EES). (File photo) 'I cannot say that we are not working hard to ensure that we are as operational as possible,' he told the French National Federation of Aviation and its Trades (FNAM) conference. 'I cannot say that collaboration with the Ministry of the Interior is going badly, that would be lying... but I fear problems.' The transport minister said he had asked the EU for a delay to the new system being rolled out but he fears this is unlikely. It had been scheduled to come into force before the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, but this has since been delayed. 'I'm even going to ask for a further postponement, but it seems difficult to me to get it from the European authorities,' Mr Vergriete added. 'We will do our utmost to be on time, and we are all aware that things are not going to run totally smoothly'. Mr Vergriete is not the first minister to raise concerns over the new e-gate system. Lord Cameron, James Cleverly and Mark Harper have all raised concerns about the new system with French ministers, noting that the changes could lead to travel chaos, the Telegraph previously reported. Queues at the Port of Dover - one of the locations where the new border checks will be in place People queue for Eurostar train services at St Pancras International station as they make their Easter getaway in London, Britain, 29 March 2024 Each time visitors try to cross into the continent, they will have to show a facial image and provide four fingerprints One senior Government source familiar with the discussions on the new checks told the newspaper: 'The main risk is that we are in the hands of the French in those places where there is going to be disruption on UK soil.' Lord Cameron previously said he was 'really worried' about delays and said the technology 'still needs testing and improving' as he pointed to 'choke points' at Dover and St Pancras. Airlines are set to be concerned that tourists will face severe delays in both departures and arrivals. Meanwhile Eurotunnel estimate that the average time of processing a car at Dover will rise from less than a minute to up to seven minutes - partially because visitors will not be able to have their passports checked at windows and will instead need to exit vehicles and use the e-gates.

        "content": "Majorca tourists have been hit with fresh protests from locals who have told Brits to \"go home\" snd \"get out\". Protesters are demonstrating over the lack of affordable housing in the Balearic Islands, with Majorca the centrepoint for fresh tension following similar protests and movements in the Canaries earlier this year. 15,000 have taken action over UK holidaymakers, chanting \"Go home\" and brandishing banners saying Salvem Mallorca, guiris arruix\", which means \"Let's save Majorca, foreigners out\" in Catalan. Polly Taylor, who was dining with three friends, said that she initially had no idea what the crowd were doing until they started to come closer to the restaurant as armed police began to show up on the scene. \"It was like a storm was coming but we didn’t know what the storm was about....then the noise from the protestors just got louder and louder and we were swamped with them,\" she said. She went on: \"At that point, between the sea of people and..., it felt very intimidating to the point we discussed trying to leave and get out in case it turned nasty.

I understand their cause, being priced out of their own country owing to tourism, but they were targeting the wrong people.' \"They never to target their government and the huge holiday companies. We were simply contributing to their economy by holidaying for a few days.\" Following Saturday's protest, Banc del Temps spokesman Javier Barbero issued a chilling warning. \"This is just the start of things. If measures aren't taken we will continue taking to the streets until we see action,\" he said. \"You are heroes and you have made history. Now our government should open its doors wide open to you and call you to a meeting so that you can present your and our demands. \"With 25,000 people behind you, you are an organisation that should be received this week by Balearic Islands' government president Marga Prohens. She should take note and put urgent measures in place.\"",

While reviews for the game have generally been positive, like any new game, there have been complaints. While the slow weapon progression is probably the most frustrating issue right now, if you've been playing XDefiant, the odds are pretty high that you've been demolished by a sniper rifle. That's certainly been the case for me, and now players have gone to Reddit to complain about the snipers, calling them \"ridiculously overpowered,\" while also suggesting what Ubisoft needs to do to fix them. Getting sniped at close range isn't fun.

Zero flinch or movement punishment. The sniper lobbies make the game unfun.\"This sentiment was echoed by many, with Snooperal saying their \"only gripe with snipers is the fact that they're better shotguns than shotguns,\" while More_Tackle9491 said they \"would do anything for a no sniping lobby,\" as it's \"impossible to compete.\"As for what's causing the issue, the majority of players agree that the lack of flinch on sniper rifles is problematic. Flinch makes your recoil increase when you're being shot, but as snipers don't have it, you can shoot them while they are scoped in and their aim isn't affected. \"They 100% need more flinch. They're already pretty close to being well-balanced with their slow reloads and slow ADS times, and I don't mind being quickscoped either. If they got the drop on me, I think they rightfully earned it. I also don't mind their one-hit kill,\" wrote Ggun_14. \"However, with the lack of flinch, I lost count of how many times I have dumped 4 to 5 rounds into a person and they still one tap me with zero consequence. If I'm the one that initiates the fight and I'm landing accurate multiple shots faster than they can? I'm the one that should have the upper hand, not them. This isn't a skill issue. It's a clear design flaw.\"There's definitely room for snipers in XDefiant, but the fact that they are more potent at short-range than an SMG like the P90 is problematic. With plenty of patches coming down the line, we can only hope that Ubisoft will address this soon.

Talks are still underway between the parties over the scope and location of the investment, and Amazon ( AMZN ) Web Service (AWS) could either create a new facility or expand its existing one in Milan, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. AWS recently revealed a €15.7B (~$17.1B) investment in data centers located in the Aragon region of Spain, replacing its original €2.5B (~$2.72B) 10-year plan announced in 2021. AWS will invest billions in Italy, but that might not be as ambitious as it is for Spain, according to one of the sources cited in the report . More on expanding in Europe: AWS plans to park €7.8B (~$8.4B) through 2040 in Germany. In addition, AWS is developing the infrastructure needed to offer cloud services to telecom clients. In 2020, Amazon ( AMZN ) Web Services originally announced its plans to invest €2B by 2029, including the launch of its first cloud region in Italy. Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Alphabet ( GOOG ) also announced plans for expanding cloud services in Italy in the same year.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: About 27 lakh complaints of cyber frauds were registered in the country in the last one year and an increasing number of such cases are getting detected due to enhanced vigil, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has said. Shah also said that 99.5 per cent police stations in the country are now connected with a central government network (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems or CCTNS ) for the purpose of investigation, data analytics, research, policy making and providing services to citizens. \"About 27 lakh complaints of cyber frauds were registered in the country in last one year,\" he told PTI in an interview over the weekend. The home minister said earlier there was no system to go after cyber frauds but now a toll free number is available for the general public to register their complaints. \"We have made provisions for accounts to freeze. People started registering complaints and within seconds, accounts get frozen (when there is a case of cyber fraud),\" he said. Asked whether cyber fraud cases have gone up in the country, Shah said cases have not gone up but \"frauds are getting detected now. We have also made available a toll free number. That's why it is getting highlighted\". Due to successful resolution of such complaints, people have been calling on that number, he said. Last week, CEO of the Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre (I4C) Rajesh Kumar had said that Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos and a few other South East Asian countries have become hub of trans-national organised gangs which are increasingly carrying out cyber crimes like financial frauds, digital arrests and ATM card scamming in India. The cyber fraud cases are mostly handled by the I4C, which is a wing under the cyber and information security division of the Union Home Ministry. It is mandated to tackle the burgeoning cyber crimes and attacks in the country in a coordinated and comprehensive manner. The I4C has been \"continuously monitoring and blocking\" cyber crime infrastructure like Skype accounts, advertisements on Google and Meta, SMS headers, SIM cards, bank accounts etc, another official said. Referring to the CCTNS, the home minister said the government has made efforts to bring all police stations under the network for the convenience of policing in the country. \"It is almost complete. About 99.5 per cent police stations are now connected with the network. Just 0.5 per cent are left. That is because of connectivity issues. The police stations which are left out may be located in very interior areas, on a hill top or in a jungle,\" he said. The project was started in 2009. It aims to interlink all police stations under a common application software for the purpose of investigation, data analytics, research, policy making and providing citizen services such as reporting and tracking of complaints, request for antecedent verifications by police etc. The project is being implemented in close collaboration between states and the Centre.",

        "content": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Aquaman might not mind if the oceans rise, but moviegoers might. That's one of the takeaways from a new study conducted by researchers who set out to determine if today's Hollywood blockbusters are reflective of the current climate crisis . The vast majority of movies failed the “climate reality check” proposed by the authors, who surveyed 250 movies from 2013 to 2022. The test is simple — the authors looked to see if a movie presented a story in which climate change exists, and whether a character knows it does. One film that passed the test was the 2017 superhero movie Justice League, in which Jason Momoa's Aquaman character says, “Hey, I don't mind if the oceans rise” to Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne. But most movies fell short — fewer than 10% of the 250 films passed, and climate change was mentioned in two or more scenes of fewer than 4% of the films. That's out of touch with a moviegoing public that wants “to see their reality reflected on screen,” said Colby College English professor Matthew Schneider-Mayerson, lead researcher on the study. “The top line is just that the vast majority of films, popular films produced over the last 10 years in the United States, are not portraying the world as it is,” Schneider-Mayerson said. “They are portraying a world that is now history or fantasy — a world in which climate change is not happening.” Researchers at Maine's Colby College published the study in April along with Good Energy, a Los Angeles-based environmental consultancy. The results were peer reviewed, and the authors are seeking publication in scientific journals. The researchers view the test as a way for audience members, writers and filmmakers to evaluate the representation of climate change on screen. Some results were surprising. Movies that at first glance appear to have little overlap with climate or the environment passed the test. Marriage Story, Noah Baumbach's emotive 2019 drama about the collapse of a relationship, passed the test in part because Adam Driver's character is described as “energy conscious,” Schneider-Mayerson said. The 2022 whodunnit Glass Onion and the 2019 folk horror movie Midsommar were others to pass the test. Some that were more explicitly about climate change, such as the 2021 satire Don't Look Up, also passed. But San Andreas, a 2015 movie about a West Coast earthquake disaster, and The Meg, a 2018 action movie set in the ocean, did not. The authors narrowed the selection of movies by excluding films not set on Earth or set before 2006 or after 2100. They found streaming services had a higher percentage of movies that included climate change than the major studios did. The study is “valuable for marketing purposes, informational purposes, data accumulation,” said Harry Winer, director of sustainability at the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts. Winer, who was not involved in the study, said it could also help serve as an incentive to connect audiences with climate stories. “The audience will be more open to hearing a dialogue about what is right and what is wrong,” Winer said. “It's a conversation starter.” The study authors said they see the climate reality check as a kind of Bechdel-Wallace test for climate change. Alison Bechdel, a cartoonist, is credited with popularizing that test in the 1980s by incorporating her friend Liz Wallace's test about gender representation in film into a comic strip. The test asks if a movie includes at least two female characters who have a conversation about something other than a man. Bechdel herself spoke highly of the study's climate test, which she described as “long overdue” in a social media post during this year's Academy Awards season. Bechdel said in an e-mail to The Associated Press that “for a movie set in the present to ignore this existential threat just doesn't make sense anymore\" in the age of climate change. “I do worry that screenwriters might do it in a kind of rote way, which could be counterproductive, just like rote ‘strong female characters’ are,\" Bechdel said. \"But injecting an awareness of our communal plight into the stories we ingest seems like a no-brainer.” Patrick Whittle, The Associated Press",

        "description": "Sheena Palad says she was asked by a FAMAS staff to present the award only that evening, adding that she did not know it was veteran actress Eva Darren who was originally supposed to be the presenter",
        "content": "MANILA, Philippines – Young singer Sheena Palad said she simply followed instructions when she replaced veteran actress Eva Darren as a special citations presenter at the 2024 Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS) awarding ceremony. In a video statement posted on Instagram on Monday night, May 27, Palad detailed what went down during the 72nd FAMAS. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sheena Lee Palad (@sheenaleesp) It can be recalled that Darren’s son, Fernando de la Pena, lambasted the award-giving body after his mother never got to go up on stage despite being told that she would present an award alongside Tirso Cruz III. Instead, Cruz was accompanied by an “[up-and-coming] singer,” who had turned out to be Palad. Palad said she was originally just tapped by the organizers to sing during the dinner proper. After her performance, she said she changed into her second outfit and headed backstage. She then said that she was approached by a staff member who asked her to present an award together with Cruz. “ Sabi [ng staff] (The staff said), ‘Sheena, can we ask a big favor from you?’ Sabi ko (I said), ‘Yes, what’s that?’ Sabi niya (They said), ‘Can you present the award?’ Sabi ko (I said), ‘Okay, sige, sige (sure, sure) no problem,'” Palad recounted. Palad also said that she did not know Darren was supposed to present the award. The young singer recalled that she had been so nervous during her stint as presenter that she had even mispronounced the name of the late German Moreno, reiterating that the slip-up was due to the engagement being arranged at the last minute. She said that she also did not have the chance to go over the script before getting on stage. Palad added she was instructed to proceed to the side of the stage, where she would accompany Cruz to present the award. “I was just following instructions. ‘Yun lang. I hope that you are enlightened with the situation,” Palad said. “She’s totally innocent. She was just following instructions. She was just doing her job,” added Palad’s partner Johann Enriquez, who was a host at the awards night’s main stage. Palad also said because of the fiasco that night, she has been bashed online. “I am being harassed, maligned, called names a nd thrown offensive accusations today online and ALL I CAN SAY IS... Buti na lang may Lord Jesus Christ ako sa buhay ko. Honestly, [h]indi ko kaya ‘to! (Good thing I have Lord Jesus Christ in my life. Honestly, I can’t do this!) It’s also a lesson for everybody to not QUICKLY judge a person. And makes me think too that what I’m going through doesn’t even come close to what my Savior had to go through when He suffered and died on the cross for me,” Palad captioned the post. Palad’s statement comes after FAMAS issued a public apology to Darren on Monday, May 27, where the organization claimed that they replaced Darren as a presenter after they supposedly were unable to locate her. – Rappler.com",

        "content": "BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Spain and Norway moved to formally recognize a Palestinian state with Ireland to follow suit on Tuesday in a coordinated effort by the three western European nations. Israel slammed the diplomatic move that will have no immediate impact on its grinding war in Gaza but adds to international pressure on Tel Aviv to soften its devastating response to last year's Hamas-led attack. Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said the Spanish Cabinet will recognize a Palestinian state at its Tuesday morning meeting. “This is a historic decision that has a single goal, and that is to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace,” Sánchez, standing at the gates of the prime minister's palace in Madrid, said during a televised speech. Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at Spain on X, saying Sánchez's government was “being complicit in inciting genocide against Jews and war crimes.” Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement that “for more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine.” While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so. Still, the adherence of three European countries to the group represents a victory for Palestinian efforts in the world of public opinion. Relations between the EU and Israel nosedived Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition EU members Ireland and Spain , with Madrid insisting that the EU should take measures against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. After Monday’s meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Micheál Martin said “for the first time at an EU meeting, in a real way, I have seen a significant discussion on sanctions” for Israel. Norway, which is not an EU member but often aligns its foreign policy with the bloc, handed diplomatic papers to the Palestinian government over the weekend ahead of its formal recognition. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight behind the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of the Hamas militant group. The formal declaration and resulting diplomatic dispute come over seven months into a grinding war waged by Israel against Hamas in Gaza following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which militants stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage. Israel’s air and land attacks have killed 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry , which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Last week's joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Some 140 countries — more than two-thirds of the United Nations — recognize a Palestinian state. The addition of three western European countries to that group will likely put pressure on EU heavyweights France and Germany to think hard about their continued refusal to follow suit. The United States and Britain, among others, back the idea of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel but say it should come as part of a negotiated settlement. Netanyahu’s government says the conflict can only be resolved through direct negotiations. In his speech on Tuesday, Sánchez said that the recognition of a Palestinian state was “a decision that we do not adopt against anyone, least of all against Israel, a friendly people whom we respect, whom we appreciate and with whom we want to have the best possible relationship.” The Socialist leader, who announced his country’s decision before parliament last week, has spent months touring European and Middle Eastern countries to garner support for recognition and a cease-fire in Gaza. He called for a permanent cease-fire, for stepping up humanitarian aid into Gaza and for the release of hostages that Hamas has held since the Oct. 7 attack that triggered Israel’s response. Sánchez said that the move was to back the beleaguered Palestinian Authority, which lost effective political control of Gaza to Hamas. He laid out his vision for a state ruled by the Palestinian Authority that must connect the West Bank and Gaza via a corridor with east Jerusalem as its capital. Norway's Barth Eide added that “the recognition is a strong expression of support for moderate forces in both countries.” The Western-backed Palestinian Authority administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, cooperates with Israel on security matters and favors a negotiated two-state solution. Its forces were driven out of Gaza by Hamas when the militants seized power there in 2007. The Palestinians have long sought an independent state in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war. The idea of a land corridor linking Gaza and the West Bank through Israel was discussed in previous rounds of peace talks, but no serious or substantive peace negotiations have been held in over 15 years. “We will not recognize changes in the 1967 border lines other than those agreed to by the parties,” Sánchez added. “Furthermore, this decision reflects our absolute rejection of Hamas, a terrorist organization who is against the two-state solution,” Sánchez said. “From the outset, Spain has strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. This clear condemnation is the resounding expression of our steadfast commitment in the fight against terrorism. I would like to underline that starting tomorrow we would focus all our efforts to implement the two state solution and make it a reality.” Israel is also under pressure from the International Criminal Court after its chief prosecutor said he would seek arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defense minister. The ICJ is also considering allegations of genocide that Israel has strenuously denied . Associated Press writers Melanie Lidman in Tel Aviv, Israel and Jan M.

        "content": "After more than a year of deliberation, a task force dedicated to data protection within the (EU) has presented its initial findings on how its data protection rules apply to OpenAI's popular chatbot, . The task force report's key takeaway is that crucial legal matters, such as the fairness and lawfulness of OpenAI's data processing, are still under consideration, leaving decisions pending. Addressing this matter is crucial because penalties for proven breaches of the bloc's privacy regulations could amount to as much as 4% of the company's global annual revenue. According to , regulatory authorities also have the authority to halt any non-compliant data processing activities. Consequently, potentially faces significant regulatory challenges within the region, especially since specific laws governing AI are still scarce, and even within the EU, full implementation is years away. In the absence of clear guidance from EU data protection authorities regarding the application of existing data protection laws to ChatGPT, OpenAI is likely to maintain its regular operations with confidence. Despite facing increasing complaints alleging violations of different aspects of the bloc's , the company is poised to proceed as usual. In a recent development, Poland's data protection authority (DPA) initiated an investigation based on a complaint regarding the chatbot's fabrication of information about an individual and its refusal to rectify the inaccuracies. Similarly, Austria has also recently received a comparable complaint. ChatGPT's operations resumed in Italy after OpenAI implemented alterations to the information and user controls, as requested by the DPA. However, the Italian inquiry into the chatbot, addressing critical matters such as the legal grounds asserted by OpenAI for data processing to train its AI models, remains ongoing. The tool remains entangled in legal uncertainty within the EU. The Irish regulatory body has been recognized for its lenient stance toward enforcing the GDPR on major technology companies. It suggests that \"Big AI\" entities could potentially be the next beneficiaries of Dublin's favorable interpretation of the EU's The GDPR is applicable whenever personal data is gathered and handled, a task that large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT, the AI architecture powering ChatGPT, undeniably perform on a massive scale. They achieve this by extracting data from the public internet for model training, including extracting individuals' posts from social media platforms. Furthermore, the EU regulation grants DPAs the authority to compel the cessation of any processing that fails to comply. Should GDPR enforcers decide to exercise this authority, it could serve as a potent tool in shaping the operational landscape of the AI powerhouse behind ChatGPT within the region.",

        "content": "PATI ang baguhang singer na Sheena Palad ay nadamay sa galit ng mga netizens sa pambabastos umano ng FAMAS sa veteran actress na si Eva Darren . Si Sheena ang ipinalit sa beteranang aktres para mag-present ng isang kategorya sa naganap na 72nd FAMAS Awards Night nitong nagdaang Linggo matapos ngang magkaaberya sa event. Hanggang ngayon ay mainit pa ring pinag-uusapan sa buong showbiz industry at sa social media ang nagawang sablay ng FAMAS organizers kay Eva Darren. Marami ang kumampi at nakisimpatya sa veteran star nang maglabas ng hinaing ang anak nitong si Fernando de la Pena matapos ang pambabalewala at pambabastos na naranasan umano ng kanyang ina mula sa naganap na awards night. Baka Bet Mo: FAMAS nag-sorry kay Eva Darren matapos magreklamo ang anak Nag-sorry na ang FAMAS kay Eva Darren at sa pamilya nito at tinanggap naman ng anak ng aktres ang public apology ng mga taong nasa likod ng nasabing award-giving body. Pero sa gitna nga ng isyung ito, nadamay din sa pambabatikos ng netizens ang newcomer na singer na si Sheena Palad na kung tutuusin ay wala naman daw talagang kasalanan sa nangyari. Sa mga hindi pa masyadong nakakakilala kay Sheena, siya ang nakababatang kapatid ni Felson Palad, ang asawa ni Donita Rose. Isa siya sa mga grand finalist sa “Tanghalan ng Kampeon” ng Kapuso show na “TiktoClock”. Napanood din siya noon sa talent search ng “Eat Bulaga” na “Bida Next.” Dahil sa natatanggap na batikos, napilitan na ring magsalita si Sheena sa pamamagitan ng isang video na in-upload sa Facebook at Instagram. Mapapanood din sa video si Johann Enriquez, ang boyfriend ni Sheena na isa sa mga naging host ng 72nd FAMAS Awards. Paliwanag ni Sheena, “Just to clear the story lang po siguro, because I’ve been receiving messages and also before anything else, I would like to say thank you to my friends and family who messaged me directly and asked me about the situation, what I am feeling right now. “Salamat po sa inyo. Actually, du’n ako naiiyak, e, kasi nakikita ko yung mga kaibigan ko talaga na talagang caring sa career ko, sa life ko, sa journey ko,” aniya pa. Pagpapatuloy pa niya, “I was chosen. I was called by the organizers to perform for the dinner pleasure. “Yun po yung una, so the dinner pleasure is the entertainment for the dinner time. So I sang two songs nung time po na yun. “And that’s what I’m wearing, the yellow dress. So what happened was, eto na po, nagpalit na po ako ng damit. Nagpalit na po ako, second na damit ko na, kulay itim, glitz and glamour,” sabi ng singer. “And then, dumating po ako doon, naka-standby po kami. Tapos po, nung naka-standby po kami, we were called earlier sa backstage, kami pong tatlo (ng hosts). “And then, nung naka-standby, nakaupo po ako, pinuntahan po ako ng staff. Nu’ng pinuntahan po ako ng staff, sabi niya, ‘Sheena, can we ask a big favor from you?’ “Sabi ko, ‘Yes, what’s that?’ Tapos sabi niya, ‘Can you present the awards?’ Sabi ko, ‘Okay, sige, sige, no problem.’ “That’s it. Yun lang po yung alam ko, at hindi ko po alam na si Miss Eva yung magpe-present po,” paliwanag pa niya. Dagdag pang explanation ni Sheena, “Actually, nu’ng time na yun, I was clueless. Hindi po kasi ako nanonood nung awards night because I was in the holding area, so hindi ko po alam kung paano mag-present. “And if you’re gonna be reviewing the videos, nakakatawa pa nga, we were laughing about it because I mispronounced the name of Kuya Germs. German Moreno, which I said na sa sobrang kaba ko ang nasabi ko, Jerman Moreno. “Siguro yun yung isa sa mga pinakakabado, e, magbabasa lang naman ako, kasi nga I was not prepared. Hindi ko man lang po nabasa yung script. As in, wala po talaga,” aniya. Hindi raw niya magets kung bakit pati siya ay inaaway ng netizens, “Kasi before the production, bumaba na po yung dating presenter, kami na po yung sumunod. “Ang instruction lang po sa akin is, ‘Sheena, you’re gonna present after you sing the production number. So, sabi ko, ‘Okay po, sige po.’ “So sabi niya, ‘Once you’re done with the production, punta ka na du’n sa gilid and Sir Tirso will be with you.’ So, sabi ko naman, ‘Okay, sige po, yun lang. So I was just following instructions,” sabi pa ni Sheena. Ito naman ang mensahe niya sa isyung kanyang kinasasangkutan, “I hope that you are enlightened with the situation. Sana nasagot namin ang lahat ng tanong ninyo. Thank you, guys.”",

        "description": "George Fenlon, 23, died three months after being attacked on a night out. His partner was heavily pregnant at the time of the attack and gave birth to their daughter just weeks before he died",
        "content": "A heartbreaking last photo shows a new dad meeting his baby daughter for the first time in hospital just before his life support machine was turned off. George Fenlon, 23, died three months after being attacked on a night out in Blackpool, Lancashire. His partner Beth Turner, 23, was heavily pregnant at the time of the attack and gave birth to their daughter - named Clara Georgia after her dad - just two weeks before he died. While he never regained consciousness, he was able to meet his daughter in hospital and George's heartbroken mum Melissa captured the touching moment. Melissa, 53, said: \"Looking back now, I'm not sure how we all got through it, the range of emotions we had to go through was horrendous. \"Beth wanted Clara to meet George and have a little bit of time with him so she had a C-section and she had a couple of weeks in hospital with him where she saw him everyday. It was important that she did that because we've got memories, we've got pictures. The hospital did a lot, we've also got little prints of Clara's and George's hands together.\" George Fenlon, 23, with partner Beth ( Image: Melissa Fenlon/SWNS) Police were called at around 2am on August 15 last year to a report of an assault at The Strand in Blackpool. They found George, a bartender at Revolution Bar, had suffered serious head injuries. He was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital and put on a life support machine but tragically died in hospital on November 22. An inquest opening heard George collapsed and lost consciousness after the attack. A post-mortem found his cause of death was complications of blunt head trauma. Rhys Jones, 26, of Cannock, Staffs, has been charged with murder and will stand trial in June. Melissa said of the ordeal: \"We were all in shock, we weren't sure what was happening. \"It was one of his friends who phoned, he said something had happened but no one was sure what. Then we heard George had gone to Royal Preston Hospital and we didn't know why but when we got more information, we found out he had a serious head injury so Preston was the best place for him. \"His girlfriend was six or seven months pregnant at that time so we were all just in shock and when we saw him it was pretty horrific.\" Six months after his death, Melissa is now hoping to create a lasting legacy for her 'fun-loving' son. She has organised a fundraising event in July called 'The Fenlon Football Funday' in Stanley Park in the resort, featuring a football tournament and kids entertainment. George Fenlon with mum Melissa when he was a child ( Image: Melissa Fenlon/SWNS) Melissa said of George: \"He just wanted to make people laugh, he was a fun loving guy and very easy going, nothing really fazed him to be honest. Clara's favourite TV show is Teletubbies and he was like a big Teletubby I suppose, just daft and it's sad that Clara will never experience that. So the fun day is for Clara and all of George's friends, to keep his memory alive. \"George was just so popular that it'll be nice for the youngsters of Blackpool not to be sad, but instead remember George through Clara. If it's a success this year, I'm hoping it will be an annual event. It's just what George was, he was a fun loving guy who loved his football, so it's what George would have wanted - for everyone to have a nice day.\" Revolution Bar, where George worked, are continuing the celebrations in the evening and will be creating a cocktail in his name. All proceeds will go towards Elliot's place, a local charity dedicated to supporting young men with their mental health and well being. Melissa added: \"George's friends have been struggling with his loss so the charity just spoke to me, it made sense.\"",

        "content": "In a significant development, contract negotiations between the governments of India and France in the over Rs 50,000 crore deal for 26 Rafale Marine fighter jets is scheduled to begin on May 30 with the arrival of a high-level French team here. The French side would meet with Indian Defence Ministry counterparts to begin official negotiations in the fighter jet deal for the Indian Navy under which aircraft would be operated from both aircraft carriers operated by the force, defence industry officials told ANI. The French team will include officials from their defence ministry and industry including original equipment manufacturers Dassault Aviation and Thales, the officials said. The Indian side would include members from the defence acquisition wing and the Indian Navy. Sources in the government said that they would try to complete negotiations with France and sign the agreement by the end of this financial year. France had submitted its response to India’s tender for buying 26 Rafale Marine jets for the Indian Navy’s aircraft carriers – INS Vikrant and INS Vikramaditya in December itself. The response to India’s Letter of Acceptance had been submitted by France in New Delhi. The Indian side has carried out a detailed study of the French bid for the Indian deal including the commercial offer or price for the aircraft, along with other details of the contract, they said. India will now go in for tough negotiations in the deal with French government officials, as it is a government-to-government contract. The Navy Chief has directed his team to ensure that the timeframe required for the project is squeezed significantly to ensure early finalisation and induction of the planes in the inventory.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — The Biden administration is unveiling a framework for using carbon offsets to drive climate progress, with principles it says are meant to help ensure the trading regimes deliver real emissions reductions — not a green mirage. The documents being released Tuesday by top cabinet officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, take the controversial step of recommending that companies be able to use carbon credits to offset a portion of their so-called Scope 3 emissions, those generated by their suppliers and customers. In other respects, the guidelines largely align with those developed by prominent industry-led governance bodies. They amount to an endorsement of voluntary carbon markets’ potential to create economic opportunities for farmers and ranchers while helping reduce planet-warming pollution, despite the controversies the systems have sparked in the past. “Voluntary carbon markets can help unlock the power of private markets to reduce emissions, but that can only happen if we address significant existing challenges,” Yellen said. The new US guidelines, detailed in a 12-page joint policy statement and outline of principles, target the trading of credits that are meant to represent a ton of carbon dioxide reduced or removed from the atmosphere. Companies, not-for-profit groups and others can buy the credits — which help finance carbon-reducing but non-lucrative initiatives such as planting trees — as a way to compensate for their own emissions. However, their use has been criticized because some crediting methodologies haven’t fulfilled carbon-cutting claims. Fixing that deficiency is seen as critical to assuring corporations seeking to trim their own emissions and meet sustainability goals. The US government principles “will give confidence to businesses that the rules of the carbon market promote best practice in the use and sourcing of high-integrity, project-based carbon credits,” said Chris Leeds, head of carbon markets development at Standard Chartered. “The guardrails that govern project-based carbon credits are moving closer towards being mandatory.” The market for offsets could soar to $1 trillion by 2050, from about $2 billion currently, if standard-setters ease some rules and expand their use, BloombergNEF forecasts. “We need that finance, and we need those solutions,” said Nat Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. But “we only want that kind of scale if it represents real environmental integrity on both the supply and demand sides.” Ensuring the offsets truly compensate for pollution is a particular challenge, since carbon dioxide pollution persists in the atmosphere for centuries. The activities that underpin most credits today often lack that same longevity. For instance, trees that suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere can burn, die or be cut down. Other options — such as injecting carbon dioxide into deep underground rock formations — could offer longer-term promise. The US government envisions the finance sector offering a solution. Insurance mechanisms such as buffer pools and other financial tools can help address permanence shortcomings, said senior administration officials who spoke anonymously to provide key details ahead of the announcement. The government is looking to enable innovation, they said. Read More: Insurers Are Working to Shore Up $2 Billion Carbon Offset Market The US government is recommending carbon credits simply meet their longevity claims, not a specific time frame. That’s a departure from standards developed by the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market, which sets a minimum threshold of 40 years and could expand that to 100 years. While offsets frequently channel capital to nature-based projects today, under the US vision, they would increasingly support more innovative carbon-removal ventures, such as direct air capture. The US framework insists credit buyers should prioritize making “measurable and feasible emission reductions within their own value chains” and that the offsets should be a complement, not a replacement, for that work. But in cases where it’s “unreasonable” to expect companies to be able to fully abate their supply chain emissions within a given time frame, the use of offsets should be considered, the US says. The United Nations-backed Science Based Targets initiative, the world’s leading arbiter of corporate net-zero plans, has drawn scrutiny for plans to relax restrictions and give companies greater leeway to use carbon credits to offset their Scope 3 emissions. The Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative has proposed a similar approach.",

        "description": "Marcus Smith plans to stay in Ukraine 'indefinitely' after his friend was killed in a drone strike.",
        "content": "A British volunteer walked more than 300 kilometres to fight for Ukraine after a close friend serving in the country’s military was killed by Russian forces. Marcus Smith had been in Spain learning the country’s language when he received the devastating news that the soldier had died in a drone strike. The 32-year-old cut his long curly hair and flew from Barcelona to Budapest before spending eight days walking to the Ukrainian border after his money ran out. The recruit, from Manchester, was then helped by a Ukrainian border guard to cross by train from Záhony in Hungary to the city of Chop in the western Zakarpattia Oblast. He told Metro.co.uk: ‘I had a really close friend out here in Ukraine. ‘We used to play video games, hang out online a lot and always talk. ‘He used to tell me about his family. His mother rang me and told me about the drone attack, it made me very angry.’ Marcus, who was born in Blackburn, is currently in Uzhhorod, a city in western Ukraine, where he has enlisted and is undergoing military training so he can take arms against Vladimir Putin ’s invasion forces. ‘I’m going to join the military indefinitely,’ he said. ‘I’m looking for a lifelong career. I believe that it would be more beneficial for me to put my heart, mind and soul into something I am very passionate about. I’m disgusted by what I’m hearing about this war, so I’m doing my best to train, be the best of the best, and hopefully we can end this war.’ The Mancunian said he is a professional hunter who has experience of living in mountains and surviving difficult conditions. Between the ages of 14 and 17 he gained some military experience at a boarding school in the UK. The volunteer described himself as having no family but regarding his friends as his family. ‘I believe the skills I have will be useful in this war,’ he said. ‘I served in the cadets, which was a medical corps, and I was trained with assault rifles and received basic medical training provided by the British government. I’ve been trained with basic weapons in England and have earned a marksmanship badge. ‘I’m very proficient with some of these firearms. ‘Depending on where my talents are needed, I’m prepared to take on any position in the army.’ The would-be legionnaire believes that stopping Russian aggression in Ukraine is a matter of critical importance for the free world. ‘I grew up with stories about the devastation caused by World War One and World War Two in my country,’ he said. ‘It affects people, especially children. ‘I would like to live in a world where we are all at peace, but sadly, that is not the case at the moment, and there are conflicts happening on our planet that I would love to stop.’ Marcus plans to join the Special Operations Forces of Ukraine or the International Legion after medical checks and a training programme. His story was first revealed on Facebook by the Zakarpattia enlistment office, which said his 300km trek from Hungary had taken eight days, six hours, 36 minutes and 14 seconds. ‘I’ve just had my blood taken, my weight checked and a chest X-ray,’ Marcus told Metro.co.uk. ‘The doctors and nurses said that I’m in perfect condition, so the choice will be mine regarding which unit to select. ‘I am going to apply for the special forces, and if I don’t get through, I will then join the International Legion.’ British citizens who travel to Ukraine to fight could be prosecuted when they return, according to UK government travel advice. The stance contrasts with the backing given by Liz Truss to those wanting to take up arms with the embattled nation when she was foreign secretary, although she later distanced herself from the comments. Guidance from the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office states that ‘British nationals fighting in Ukraine have been killed or captured’. A number of UK nationals have become casualties or prisoners of war, including Aiden Aislen, who was sentenced to death after being captured while fighting for the Ukrainian marines in the siege of Mariupol. Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office has established the International Legion for foreign recruits, although others, including Brits, have joined various units in Kyiv’s military structure, including the Georgian National Legion. Around 20,000 foreigners were reported to have poured in to Ukraine to take up arms for the country in the months after Putin launched the unprovoked full-scale invasion in February 2022. Numbers are thought to have declined since but an unknown quota of British nationals are understood to be in frontline combat roles away from the media glare which accompanied recruits at the start of the war. Marcus insisted that he is in for the long haul. ‘I am joining the Ukrainian army indefinitely, and I never plan on leaving,’ he said. ‘I have so much respect for all the Ukrainian people who are sadly affected by this war, and I will fight for their freedom.’ The volunteer spoke as Russian forces continued their brutal ground and air offensive in the northern Kharkiv Oblast. The UK Ministry of Defence said that Putin has ‘currently not succeeded’ in his stated aim of creating a ‘buffer zone’ in the border region.

The US think-tank said the likely aim was to ‘fix and draw’ Kyiv’s forces and prepare for ‘offensive operations’ aiming to expand Moscow’s footprint in the north-eastern border region of Ukraine.

        "content": "As Nigeria joins the rest of the World to mark this year’s International Children’s Day, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Children of Africa Leadership and Values Development Initiative(CALDEV) have expressed willingness to work together to ensure that the rights of Nigerian children are adequately protected. The two organisations made this known when a delegation of CALDEV officials and school children paid a courtesy visit to the headquarters of NHRC on Monday in Abuja. Hon. Bamidele Salam, Founder and President of CALDEV, who led the delegation, said the visit was part of stakeholder’s engagement to rally support for the rights of Nigerian children as they mark the International Children’s Day. According to Salam, who represents Ede North,South/Egbedero/Ejigbo Federal Constituency of Osun State at the Federal House of Representatives, there is a gap on issues affecting children in Nigeria in spite of the Child Rights Act. “One of those gaps is the one that has to do with children’s rights to education, and it is sad that in the whole world, Nigeria has the highest number of out-of-school children today, according to UNICEF, about 17.5 million children do not have access to education. “Children in Nigeria that are involved in forced labor are over 15 million, according to the last statistics also by the UNICEF, and Children have been victims of violence in their homes, violence in schools, violence even in religious places, violence in several spaces, because there are inadequate measures to protect them from abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional trauma that children face. “These are just some of the issues that affect the Nigerian child, and I believe that an occasion like this should be used to drum up the awareness and ask for the intervention of government at all levels on addressing these problems. “So we are here today to further extend to you our hand of collaboration and readiness to work together with the National Human Rights Commission for the purpose of protecting the rights of Nigerian children, advancing their cause, and progressively removing Nigeria from this very odious record which we have obtained everywhere in the world. “Together we can raise awareness and initiate measures that will ensure that there are consequences for those who abuse the rights of children, because where there are no consequences, impunity is bound to continue,” he said. The CALDEV helmsman added that “If a child wants to take a legal action, he needs a guardian, through which he can take some legal action against those who infringe on his or her rights. “This is where we believe that the National Human Rights Commission should come in to ensure that we protect children and give them a very open space to air their views and to lodge complaints about those abuses that they suffer and those rights which are denied them”,he said. While presenting a formal proposal for a collaborative partnership with NHRC to the Executive Secretary, Salam said,” We are going to work together to ensure that Nigeria provides a very brighter future, a very guaranteed future for our youthful population.” In his remarks, Mr Tony Ojukwu, Executive Secretary/CEO of NHRC commended CALDEV for the initiative and expressed his goodwill to Nigerian Children on the celebration of their day. Ojukwu who was represented by Mr Harry Obe, Director in the Department of Economic,Social and Cultural Rights of NHR, said the commission had a department that was dedicated to issues of children and women. He therefore expressed the commission’s readiness to collaborate with CALDEV in protecting the rights of the Nigerian child. “We all agree that in our present-day generation and the circumstances that surround the world now, there is need for all of us to join hands and pay attention to value re-orientation, development of children, particularly if we must actually ensure that the world is preserved and that the value system that our fathers handed over to us is actually taken forward and better developed for the good of humanity. “The fact that children are vulnerable is not in doubt because of their age and circumstances they find themselves, they are subject to control and possible manipulation by older members of the society. “So there must be a dedicated effort like you have shown and then institutions like the NHRC must work with you to ensure that the children are protected from possible violations or abuses. “Our law envisages that we partner with civil society organisations, and for a civil society organisation that is focusing on a particular area that is within our mandate, we will work with you,” he said. Obe added that, “What we need to do is to, after now, set up a committee that will work together to draw the memorandum of understanding that will be signed between the organisation and the commission to ensure that we further protect and drive the objectives of the organisation.”",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Nigeria Air: Unfair to prosecute Sirika without Buhari – Aisha Yesufu Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Nigeria Air: Unfair to prosecute Sirika without Buhari – Aisha Yesufu Published on May 28, 2024 By Francis Ugwu Social activist Aisha Yesufu has suggested that former President Muhammadu Buhari should be prosecuted together with his ex-Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika. DAILY POST reports that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, had charged and arraigned the former minister alongside his daughter, Fatima, his son-in-law, Jalal Sule Hamma, and a firm – Al Buraq Global Investment Limited. The EFCC accused Sirika of conferring undue advantage on his brother and his company, Enginos Nigeria Limited. The contracts for which the sums were paid for were also said to be undone with no trace of work done to date. Yesterday, the Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, also described the controversial Nigeria Air unveiled by the Buhari-led administration as a fraud. He added that it remained suspended. The Minister noted that the ‘national carrier’ that was supposed to be an indigenous project and one that was supposed to spark hope for Nigerians, was flawed with a lot of secrecy and fraudulent activities. However, in a post on her X handle on Tuesday, Yesufu said it would amount to selective prosecution if Sirika is prosecuted alone. “Prosecuting Hadi Sirika without prosecuting Muhammadu Buhari is selective prosecution,” she wrote.

        "content": "A MASSIVE treasure hunt on the \"Holy Grail\" of all shipwrecks has finally got underway 300 years after it first sunk by using clever robot technology. The San Jose Galleon plunged over 3,000ft to the bottom of the Caribbean Sea in 1708 with some experts saying the entire value of the wreckage is incalculable. The recovery project is being done by the Colombian government alongside a set of underwater robots , says Colombia's Culture Minister Juan David Correa . He said the robots are being sent to extract items surrounding the shipwreck just off Cartagena, Colombia , to see \"how they materialise when they come out\". The state-of-the-art machines will work at a depth of 600m to extract materials \"without modifying or damaging the wreck,\" according to Correa. Although the robotic equipment will be submerged, it will be connected to a Navy ship that will use cameras to keep an extensive record of every movement. This is just the first stage of a project that is set to cost the government more than £3.5million. Dubbed a \"characterisation phase\" the bots will be deployed alongside remote sensors that generate images of the site. This imagery will then build up a thorough list of all of the archaeological material left on the seabed, the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History said. The next phases of the recovery mission will be dependent on the results from this initial stage but it is hoped experts will gain a greater understanding into how they can recover the remainder of the wreck. In English, the name of the project translates to “towards the heart of the San Jose galleon”. Correa described the expedition as \"unprecedented\". The site will also be labelled as a protected archaeological area meaning it will remain preserved due to its \"high scientific and heritage value\". It is set to be the biggest, most costly, and most complex recovery mission completed underwater of all time. Despite a number of sources debating the exact value of the sunken treasures, it is thought to be worth at least £12.5billion with some guesses catapulting the figure way past £20billion. Navy researcher Captain Alexandra Chadid explained that after three centuries of being submerged in the sea, most of the treasure would have undergone physical and chemical changes. Meaning the primary objective of the mission isn't just to recover the items but to do it safely with them all staying intact. The biggest fears are that due to the chemical differences the items may disintegrate when pulled out of the water. Back in 2017, the Colombian Navy sent a remotely operated vehicle to a depth of 3,100ft to assess the wreckage . Incredible images showed gold pieces, cannons and perfectly preserved Chinese porcelain cups scattered across the San Jose. Trinkets were seen twinkling under the light of the cameras as bronze cannons, swords, and clay vessels were spotted on the seafloor. Historians dubbed it the \"holy grail\" because it was carrying one of the largest amounts of treasure ever lost at sea. The San Jose was part of a fleet carrying jewels, precious metals and 11 million gold and silver coins from Spain’s South America colonies. The cargo was destined to help Spain’s King Philip V fund his war against Britain. But the British weren’t the only ones with their eyes on the galleons. Frequent voyages by Spanish treasure ships had led to a golden age of piracy — with raiders sinking more than 1,000 Spanish ships off the coast of Colombia during three centuries of colonial rule. The San José’s 600-strong crew knew the voyage would be fraught with danger. But they were barely 16 miles out when they were tracked down by English Commodore Charles Wager, in command of four British ships including HMS Expedition. Wager’s plan was to seize the San José, the largest ship in the fleet. But before it could be boarded, something went terribly wrong and the San José blew up. Writing in his log, Wager described an explosion so intense that he could feel the heat from his own ship. He wrote: “I believe the ship’s side blew out, for she caused a sea that came in our ports. “She immediately sank with all her riches.” Despite Colombia working on the ambitious mission to rescue the San Jose now, a fierce debate over who actually deserves the treasures on board has been ongoing for decades. Due to this insane amount of riches sitting untouched a legal battle over who has the rights to the treasure started up. A row between Spain , Bolivia and Colombia sparked fury over who owned the precious booty. Spain claimed it as theirs as the San Jose was one of their ships when it sunk. But Bolivia's indigenous Qhara Qhara nation believes it's theirs as they were forced to mine the precious metals on board by the Spanish. But, Colombia has taken the lead in the race for the gold as they classed it as part of its cultural heritage as it was found in their territorial waters. Another reason why Colombia led the hunt is as they claim to be the only ones who know exactly where it lies. In 1981, US company Glocca Morra claimed it discovered the lost treasure as they gave Colombia its location in return for a big reward. They were allegedly promised half of whatever was found and sold on but in 2015 Colombia announced they had found the wreck in a different spot and kept it quiet. Glocca Morra — now called Sea Search Armada - sued the government as they think they are being unfairly left out of the hunt. Under the US-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement, the company are asking for either half of the treasures or $10billion, according to Bloomberg . The lawsuit values the treasure at anywhere between £3.1-£16billion.",

        "content": "A MASSIVE treasure hunt on the \"Holy Grail\" of all shipwrecks has finally got underway 300 years after it first sunk by using clever robot technology. The San Jose Galleon plunged over 3,000ft to the bottom of the Caribbean Sea in 1708 with some experts saying the entire value of the wreckage is incalculable. The recovery project is being done by the Colombian government alongside a set of underwater robots , says Colombia's Culture Minister Juan David Correa . He said the robots are being sent to extract items surrounding the shipwreck just off Cartagena, Colombia , to see \"how they materialise when they come out\". The state-of-the-art machines will work at a depth of 600m to extract materials \"without modifying or damaging the wreck,\" according to Correa. Although the robotic equipment will be submerged, it will be connected to a Navy ship that will use cameras to keep an extensive record of every movement. This is just the first stage of a project that is set to cost the government more than £3.5million. Dubbed a \"characterisation phase\" the bots will be deployed alongside remote sensors that generate images of the site. This imagery will then build up a thorough list of all of the archaeological material left on the seabed, the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History said. The next phases of the recovery mission will be dependent on the results from this initial stage but it is hoped experts will gain a greater understanding into how they can recover the remainder of the wreck. In English, the name of the project translates to “towards the heart of the San Jose galleon”. Correa described the expedition as \"unprecedented\".

        "content": "A heart-wrenching story about a six-year-old Chihuahua, found abandoned in a public washroom holding tank at Guelph Lake Conservation Area. The Guelph Humane Society (GHS) says the dog is resting comfortably now, but she was found starved and covered in human urine and feces. “Cleo,” named by the team at the humane society, was found around 10 a.m. Sunday morning. Officials said it isn’t clear how long she was in the bathroom tank, or who left her there. GHS Executive Director Lisa Veit said, “It is very disturbing that a dog could be abandoned in such alarming and dire circumstances .. All of us here at GHS, and we expect the entire community, are extremely distressed as to what may have happened to her had she not been discovered and rescued.” Veit added that pet abandonment is all too common, and stresses anyone who is struggling to take care of their pets should reach out to the humane society. Donations to help with Cleo’s care can be made on the GHS .",

        "content": "Oppo Find X7 Ultra has been awarded the Eye Comfort Display Label and Gold Display Label from DXOMARK. It is the first smartphone to receive the Eye Comfort Display Label, meeting stringent requirements for flicker, brightness, blue light limitation, and color consistency. Oppo Find X7 Ultra has earned both the Eye Comfort Display Label and the Gold Display Label from DXOMARK. The Eye Comfort Display Label is awarded to screens that meet four requirements set by DXOMARK, which takes into account the flicker, minimum brightness achievable, limited blue light, and colour consistency. Notably, the Find X7 Ultra is the first smartphone to receive the Eye Comfort Display Label. Thibault Cabana, DXOMARK’s Display Evaluation Director, highlighted the device’s Bedtime Mode, which efficiently adjusts blue-light filtering based on the time of day. Cabana noted that the device’s circadian action factor, which measures how much artificial lighting disrupts human sleep cycles, reached 0.63, below DXOMARK’s recommended maximum of 0.65. DXOMARK: Eye Comfort Display Label requirement 1) The first requirement is to limit noticeable screen flicker. DXOMARK says the chance of detecting flicker should be below 50% in default or anti-flicker mode. The OPPO Find X7 Ultra has a flicker detection probability of just 10 per cent. 2) For comfortable use in dark environments, DXOMARK sets a minimum brightness of 2 nits. The OPPO Find X7 Ultra can go as low as 1.57 nits, reducing harsh light and making it easier on the eyes, especially in bed. 3) DXOMARK also limits blue light, requiring a circadian action factor of less than 0.65 to reduce sleep disruption. The Find X7 Ultra has a circadian action factor of 0.63, minimizing blue light’s impact on sleep. 4) Lastly, DXOMARK requires at least 95 per cent colour consistency when the blue light filter is on, using the P3 colour space. The Find X7 Ultra achieves 99 per cent colour consistency, maintaining high quality and eye comfort. Oppo Find X7 Ultra: Display features The Oppo Find X7 Ultra features a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 pixels with a density of 510 pixels per inch. The LTPO AMOLED panel supports a refresh rate of 1-120 Hz, for a wide range of smoothness. It has an overall peak brightness of 1,600 nits and a local peak brightness of 4,500 nits. The Find X7 Ultra supports ProXDR for high dynamic range photos and is compatible with Google’s Ultra HDR standard. It also supports Dolby Vision, HDR10, HDR10+, and HLG for high dynamic range video. The X7 Ultra display also comes with O-Sync 3.0 for “ultra-low touch latency”, which works even when wet to prevent accidental touches in the rain or when you have wet hands.",

But how does the Australian star keep looking so young at 56? We can't quite believe her age either! However, Minogue has shared her simple skin secrets, beauty rules and exercise regime that have kept her looking far younger than her years. During a TV interview on ITV's Lorraine back in 2018, the star joked that she needed a lot of help to look that good. function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) She said: \"It takes a team [to look like this], I can tell you.

(Image: Getty) Minogue explained the three beauty rules that she follows, saying: \"This is going to sound like a boring infomercial... \"Tips would be sunblock, cleanse with a cloth, like a muslin [cloth]... I always take my makeup off; I've been wearing makeup for work for a long, long time. \"A good dermatologist, if you've got time to go, and have some treatments.\" Meanwhile, she added that she is a big believer in celebrating birthdays at every age.

Read our Privacy Policy The singer said that's what her fourteenth studio album and 2018 release Golden was about. \"There's a line in the song Golden – 'We're not young, we're not old, we're golden' – it was the only line I wanted to put somewhere in a song on the album, meaning you can't make yourself younger, you can't make yourself older, you are only you, who you are in that moment. \"It could be a great moment in your life; it could be a really crappy moment in your life. \"That's just where you are. Try to shine whatever time it is whether it's a dark time or a bright time.\" However, when it comes to exercise and working out, Minogue isn't a fan. Trending The star previously admitted that she \"hardly ever works out\" but is \"always on the go\". And we can see why Minogue is constantly on the go in the past 12 months, the singer was named Global Icon at the Brit Awards and completed a six-month Las Vegas residency. Meanwhile, she is set to headline the British Summertime Festival in London’s Hyde Park in July as well as the Sziget Festival in Budapest this August. Speaking in an unearthed interview with the Express, she revealed: “I don’t really work out, but I’m constantly on the go”. Despite, going to a Pilates session now and then, her attitude to working out has changed. She recalled: “I loved aerobics and I used to do callanetics. “I would travel everywhere with this home workout on a VHS tape and put it on in hotel rooms.” Despite the singer not being on a strict diet she instead goes for more healthier choices when it comes to eating. Minogue began a low-glycemic index (low-GI) diet several years ago. This is where the foods you eat can affect blood sugar levels and includes items such as nuts, seeds, wholegrains, lentils and beans. These foods release energy more slowly so you'll feel fuller for longer.

        "content": "From early morning when the sun rises to evening as night descends, church bells will ring out, special flags will be flown, schoolchildren will learn stories about their great grandparents, town criers will proclaim the victory, the haunting sound of bagpipes will fill the air and, in a final gesture of homage, beacons and Lamp Lights of Peace will be lit to signify the light that emerged from the dreadful darkness of war. Reverend Neil Redeyoff will be joining hundreds of others from across the world, wanting to remember the brave men and women who took part, not only from our country, but from America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand , Belgium, Norway, Greece, France, Czechoslovakia, Rhodesia, and Poland too. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with an ad-lite subscription to Doncaster Free Press, you get 70% fewer ads while viewing the news that matters to you. Reverend Neil from St Saviour’s Church in Auckley will be reading a tribute to the D-Day heroes at a commemoration event organised by Auckley Parish Council. Neil says to be able to play even a small part in paying tribute is humbling and a great honour. “I feel privileged to be participating in this event because I believe it is so important that we honour the service of those thousands of men and women who sacrificed so much, that we can enjoy the freedoms we have today.” Auckley Parish Council are very grateful to the 4th Doncaster Finningley Scout Group for hosting a bonfire and Lamp Light of Peace lighting ceremony at the scout hut on Hurst Lane in Auckley. Local residents are invited to join them from 8.30pm onwards. Entry is free but to manage numbers, attendees need to book by contacting the Parish Clerk on 07857 568268 or emailing [email protected] Bruno Peek CVO OBE OPR Pageantmaster of D-Day80, said: “In 1944 Allied forces mounted the largest amphibious invasion the world has ever witnessed. Advertisement Advertisement “Operation Overlord, D-Day, saw over 5,000 ships and landing craft set down more than 150,000 troops on the five Normandy beaches that would bring about the liberation of north-west Europe from Nazi occupation. “In order to commemorate the peace and freedom given to us through the bravery and ultimate sacrifice of so many thousands involved in the D-Day landings, and throughout the whole of WW11, beacons and Lamp Lights of Peace will be lit across the United Kingdom, Channel Islands, Isle of Man and UK Overseas Territories - and in a very poignant and unique gesture, special Lamp Lights of Peace lamps will be lit on each of the five beaches in Normandy, at 9.15pm local time that night, to coincide with the lighting of beacons at that time too. “However, at 9.10pm, as night descends - and just before the beacons ignite – the resonant sound of bagpipes will be heard across the capital cities of London, Edinburgh, Belfast, and Cardiff. We will also have a presence in the capital cities of the Allied nations that took part. From Washington DC to the distant shores of New Zealand’s Auckland, from Ottawa to Paris, and from Canberra to Brussels, Athens and Amsterdam, Oslo, Warsaw, and Prague. “The light from the flames from the lamps and the beacons will represent the ‘light of peace’ that emerged from the darkness of war, with the lamp providing a very simple, safe, unique and cost effective way of taking part in this important 80th anniversary occasion, especially as once used, can be lit again at 11am on every Remembrance Sunday thereafter, in tribute to the many millions that sacrificed their lives during WWII.” More details about the plans for D-Day80 can be found on the website www.d-day80beacons.co.uk",

الخصخصة\" وفي قراءته لتلكالوقائع الاقتصادية قال الخبير الاقتصادي والمسؤول المصري السابق بوزارة التجارةوالصناعة الدكتور عبد النبي عبد المطلب: \"بداية فإن سياسة طرح الشركات العامةوالأصول الحكومية كما هو معروف جاءت استجابة للتعهدات المصرية لصندوق النقد الدولي\". وكيل وزارةالتجارة والصناعة للبحوث الاقتصادية سابقا أضاف لـ \" عربي21 \": \"ومنهنا فهي قرارات أُجبرت الدولة المصرية على اتخاذها، وليست وليدة سياسة وضعتهاالحكومة لأجل رفع كفاءة عمل هذه الشركات أو إعادة هيكلتها\". وتابع:\"ومن هنا وفي ظل البحث عن جذب المزيد من الاستثمارات سواء العربية أو الأجنبيةالمباشرة وُجد أن طرح هذه الشركات قد يكون بداية لإغراء عدد من الشركات العربيةوالعالمية للقدوم إلى مصر\". اظهار أخبار متعلقة وفي إجابته علىالسؤال: هل تكشف نتائج أعمال بعض الشركات بعد بيعها عن وجاهة سياسة طرح الأصولالعامة أمام المستثمرين العرب والأجانب؟، قال إن \"مسألة تحقيق عدد من هذهالشركات أرباحا أو أنها تحولت من الخسارة إلى الربح أعتقد أن ذلك يمكن اتخاذهمبررا أو داعما لسياسات الخصخصة\". وأكد أنه\"عندما ننظر إلى نتائج أعمال بعض تلك الشركات نلاحظ الآتي: أولا أن أغلب هذهالشركات رفع قيمة وسعر الخدمات التي يقدمها، ولا أريد أن أتحدث عن شركات بعينها،ولكن المصريين لاحظوا أن بعض الشركات قامت برفع مقابل الخدمة بنسبة تقترب من حوالي66 بالمئة\". \"سياسات عادلة للاستخدام\" وفق رؤيتهالاقتصادية لأسباب تحقيق تلك الشركات أرباحها المهولة، وهل نتيجة أعمال جادةوتطوير وضخ أموال واستثمارات ونجاح إداري إثر فشل الإدارات الحكومية في كل ما سبق؟أم لوجود تلاعب وسياسات خاطئة أفادت الملاك الجدد؟، أشار لتغيير بعض السياسات معالإدارات الجديدة. وأوضح أنه\"إذا أخذنا بعض الأمور التي لا تخفى على أحد عندما تم خصخصة بعض الخدمات، لاأقول إنه كانت هناك كفاءة أكثر، ولكن أقول على الأقل تم وضع سياسات عادلةللاستخدام، وانخفض عدد المستشارين وانخفض ما يتم دفعه من هذه الشركات لعدد منالجهات بدون فائدة معينة\". اظهار أخبار متعلقة وواصل:\"أصبح هناك إلى حد ما كفاءة في الإدارة، بالتأكيد ساهمت في تحقيق أرباح؛ ولكنالأرباح الحقيقية أتت من جيوب المواطنين، حيث أن أغلب هذه الشركات رفعت مقابل أداءالخدمة أو أسعار سلعها\". ولكن، هل تشيرتلك النتائج إلى أن البيع هو الحل الأمثل للتخلص من خسارة بعض الشركات العامةوإنقاذ البلاد من الإفلاس؟ وفي رده، أكدالخبير المصري، أن \"الحديث عن أرباح الشركات التي تم خصخصتها في اعتقادي أنهيحاول أن يوصل الرسالة للمواطن أن الخصخصة قد ترفع كفاءة الشركات وأن البيع قديؤدي إلى أرباح رغم أن الجزء الأكبر من هذه الأرباح لم يعود للخزانة العامةالمصرية\". ولفت إلى أن\"البعض يقول إنه سوف يتم الحصول على ضرائب، وأن رفع كفاءة تلك الشركات سوفيجذب المزيد من رؤوس الأموال، وأنها رسالة إيجابية عن الاقتصاد المصري\". واستدرك:\"لكن في النهاية تم الاستحواذ على قيم أكبر من جيب المواطن نتيجة سياسة رفعالأسعار، سواء نتحدث هنا عن شركة موبكو التي تقدم الأسمدة ورفع أسعارها أو شركاتتقديم الخدمات المالية والتي رفعت قيمة خدماتها من 60 إلى 66 بالمئة\". وحول ما يروجهالبعض من أن \"أسلوب الخصخصة أو نقل ملكية الشركات سواء للقطاع الخاص المصريأو القطاع الخاص العربي هو الحل\"، يرى عبد المطلب، أن \"هذه التجارب لمتؤدي إلى تحقيق تنمية أو رفع معدلات النمو\". اظهار أخبار متعلقة وأضاف:\"وفي اعتقادي أيضا، أن البيانات المتاحة حتى الآن لم تساهم في زيادة عرض فرصالعمل للمصريين، لكن لننتظر نهاية العام المالي ثم نبدأ في قياس أثر هذه التجربةعلى التنمية في مصر\". وختم بالقول:\"ولو أنني شخصيا أعتقد أن مثل هذه الطروحات وهذا النوع من الخصخصة والاستحواذلا يصب ولا يؤدي في مصلحة تنمية الاقتصاد المصري على المستوى القريب أو البعيد\". \"بيع بخس وآثاره السلبية قادمة\" وفي تعليقه قالالخبير الاقتصادي الأردني هاشم الفحماوي: \"للأسف الشديد فإن الحكومة المصريةتبيع بعض الأصول في جلسات بيع بأقل من قيمها الحقيقية، وعلى سبيل المثال شركةالإسكندرية للحاويات\". المحللالاقتصادي للأسواق العربية والعالمية أوضح في حديثه لـ \"عربي21\" أنها\"باعت هذا الأصل بسعر 8 جنيهات تقريبا وكان سعر الدولار حينها نحو 19.65،بينما قيمة هذا الأصل الحقيقية حينها أكثر من 25 جنيه\"، متسائلا: \"فكيفباعته بـ8 جنيهات، ولحساب من، ومن هم المتنفذين خلف هذا البيع؟\"، معتبرا أن\"هذه نقطة سلبية كبيرة\". وأشار إلى أن\"شركة الشرقية للدخان طرحت للبيع بـ 51 جنيه في عام 2011 عندما كان سعرالدولار تقريبا 6 جنيها، ليتم بيعها بسعر 24 جنيهات وبقرابة سعر صرف 35 جنيهامقابل الدولار \". خبير المالوالأعمال أعرب عن تعجبه من \"بيع أصول حكومية تحقق عوائد عالية جدا\"، متسائلا:\"كيف تبيعها بأسعار زهيدة ومتدنية؟\"، موجها حديثه للحكومة المصرية:\"هذا خطأ كبير جدا ترتكبه\"، مبينا أنه \"المفروض أن تقوم بتأسيسصناديق لدى البنك المركزي أو تقوم الصناديق الموجودة لديه بشراء هذه الأصول أوأطرحها أمام شركات خاصة بنظام العطاءات وأبيع جزءا منها\". اظهار أخبار متعلقة وعاد الفحماوي،للاستعانة بالأمثلة متعجبا من \"تصفية الحكومة المصرية لشركة الحديد والصلبحتى تستحوذ على أراضي الشركة المقدرة بـ8 مليارات جنيه ثم إعادتها للتداول، وبدلامن دعم صناعة الحديد والصلب الاستراتيجية تقوم بتصفيتها\". وواصل تساؤلاته:\"هل يعقل أن تبيع سعر السهم بين 8 و10 و15 جنيها؟\"، معتبرا أن \"هذاأمر غير منطقي\"، معربا عن قلقه من \"استمرار الحكومة في بيع الأصول بغيرأسعارها الحقيقية\"، مضيفا: \"أين لجنة التقييمات في الحكومةالمصرية؟\"، مؤكدا أنها \"غائبة وليس لها دراسات حقيقية\"، ومشددا علىأن \"عمليات بيع الأصول الحكومية بأسعار زهيدة يترتب عليها آثار سلبية خلالعام 2025 وعلى النمو الاقتصادي المصري\". وتابع:\"هناك أيضا شركة مدينة مصر، كيف تبيع هذا الأصل بينما يحقق لك إيرادات عاليةجدا؟، وكذلك شركة موبكو أكبر وأعرق شركات الأسمدة، كيف تبيعها وهي تحقق لك عوائدعالية جدا\". وعاد للتساؤل:\"من يبيع الأصول بأسعار زهيدة؟، ثم لمصلحة من؟\"، معربا عن أسفه من أن\"السياسة الاقتصادية المتبعة حاليا في مصر سياسة فاشلة، لعدم وجود الخبرة،وغياب لجان التقييمات\". وأكد أن\"كل ذلك يقدم مؤشرات سلبية تؤثر على سعر صرف الجنيه مقابل الدولار ما يظهرنهاية 2024، ويؤثر على نمو الاقتصاد المصري أيضا عام 2025\"، متوقعا\"حدوث تعويم جديد للجنيه قد يكون إلى 57 أو إلى 60 جنيها مقابلالدولار\"، وفق قوله. اظهار أخبار متعلقة ويرى الباحثالأردني، أن \"الاقتصاد المصري في العام 2024 سوف يواجه أوضاعا صعبةجدا\"، مشيرا في حديث مع \"عربي21\"، إلى أن \"هناك مجرم يحكممصر، وهذا المجرم وُضع لتنفيذ مخطط وضع عام 2014، لتدمير اقتصاد مصر، ومن ثمالهروب من مصر\". وقال إن\"الشعب المصري لو عرف المخطط الحقيقي لهب ضد نظام السيسي\"، مضيفا:\"لكنهم لا يعلمون أن القادم أسوأ مما يتوقعون\"، مؤكدا أن \"المصريينإن لم يلحقوا بأنفسهم قبل شهر أب/ أغسطس المقبل، فلن يكون لمصر أي أصول عامةوحكومية، فكل شيء تم بيعه\" ولفت إلى أن\"الاقتصاد المصري قبل 7 تشرين الأول/ أكتوبر الماضي كان على مشارف الانهيار،طوفان الأقصى أنقذتهم\". \"كرفانات تل أبيب\" وعبر صفحتهبـ\"فيسبوك\"، قال الخبير الاقتصادي عبدالنبي عبدالمطلب عن تحقيق فورىأرباحا بلغت 150 بالمئة بعد بيعها: \"لم يتحدث أحد عن رفعهم (فوري) تكاليفالخدمة، ولم يتحدث أحد عن تخفيض سعر الجنيه بنسبة 45 بالمئة\"، معتقدا أنالرسالة هي أن \"البيع يحقق مكاسب\"، ملمحا إلى أنها تعطي الحكومة مبررالمواصلة عمليات بيع الأصول. وأشار معلقونإلى أن \"المستحوذ الحقيقي والفعلي هو تل أبيب، وأن شركات الإمارات والسعوديةما إلا كرفانات للتعمية على الشعب وعدم استفزازه بشكل عمدي ومباشر لو تم البيعللصهاينة مباشرة\". وتحدث معلقونآخرون عن أن البيع واستمراره ومواصلة حكومة السيسي ذات سياسة التفريط \"خطوةمهمة جدا ومحكمة للغاية لتركيع مصر وإفقارها وتجويعها وتخريدها وتخريبها لصالحالعدو الصهيوني\". وألمحوا إلى دورالسيسي، قائلين: \"الموضوع ليس الحكومة، ولكنه إيلي كوهين الذي يلتزم حرفيابتنفيذ مخطط صهيوني محكم للغاية، ومنضبط بالمازورة، تم وضعه في أضابير الموسادلتدمير مصر وتجويعها وتعطيشها وإفقارها وإفلاسها، والمخطط يسير بنجاح\".",

\"عربي21\"، إلى أن \"المسلمينفي أوروبا ضعفاء سياسيا، وهم المجتمع الأكثر تهميشا، ولا أحد يريد تبني قضيتهمالعادلة، ومن الصعب على أي شخص أن يقوم بالدفاع عنهم\"، مُشدّدا على أهمية معاملة المسلمينعلى قدم المساواة مع باقي المواطنين الآخرين. وأوضح أن \"هناك محاولة من بعض الدول الإسلامية لتصدير فكرتها عن الإسلامالذي تسيطر عليه الدولة إلى الدول الأوروبية والغربية، وهذا يتعارض كثيرا مع فكرة العلمانيةوفصل قوة الكنيسة عن الدولة\". وذكر الأكاديمي النمساوي أن \"هناك نقص بشكل واضح في رغبة أوروبا في معالجةالإسلاموفوبيا؛ فعلى سبيل المثال، لدينا قرار ضد معاداة السامية في البرلمان الأوروبيمنذ عام 2017، ولكن ليس لدينا شيء مشابه فيما يتعلق بالإسلاموفوبيا\". وأكد أن \"هناك مبادرات لوضع تعريف للإسلاموفوبيا لتكون لدينا قدرة علىإصدار قرار مثل القرار ضد معاداة السامية، لكن لا يزال الطريق طويلا جدا، خاصة أنهناك تضاربا وتنازعا في المواقف الأوروبية بخصوص الموقف من قضية الإسلاموفوبيا\". وتاليا نص المقابلة الخاصة مع \"عربي21\": لماذا قمتم برفع دعوى قضائية ضد جامعة جورج واشنطن الأمريكيةوضد الباحث لورنزو فيدينو؟ يتم التشهير وإلحاق الضرر بسمعة الأفراد مثلي الذين كانوا يدافعون ضد الإسلاموفوبيا، ونتيجة لذلك، شعرت بأنني مُضطر لرفع دعوى قضائيةلمحاسبة كل من جامعة جورج واشنطن ولورينزو فيدينيو على أفعالهم. هذه القضية تهدف إلىمعالجة الظلم الذي لحق بي وبالآخرين الذين تم استهدافهم بشكل مشابه، والبحث عن تعويضعن الأضرار التي لحقت بسمعتي المهنية والشخصية جراء إطلاق حملات التشهير ضد الأشخاص مثلي إلى جانبأكثر من ألف آخرين في أوروبا. لهذا السبب قمت برفع دعوى قضائية فيدرالية جماعية تستند إلى القانون المعروفباسم قانون المنظمات المتأثرة والمفسدة (ريكو)، ودعواي القضائية تكشف أساسا عن فيدينو وخدماتشركة الاستخبارات \"ألب سيرفيسز-AlpServices\"، التي نفّذت عمليات استخباراتية وتجسّسية في أوروبا، فضلاعن برنامج التطرف في جامعة جورج واشنطن، وتوضح القضية أنهم أسّسوا مُخططا للاحتيالعلى الجمهور واستغلال الأفراد مثلي بتصويري كمتطرف ومُتشدّد من أجل الحصول على تمويلغير مُعلن من دول أجنبية. والفكرة الموجودة لدى البعض بأن المسلمين يُشكّلون تهديدا للمجتمعاتالأوروبية هي فكرة عنصرية مقيتة ومرفوضة، وليس كل المسلمين إسلاميين كما يزعمالبعض؛ فمعظم المسلمين الذين يتعرضون للهجوم هم أناس عاديون، بل إن هناك في أوروبامَن يرى أن الإسلام السياسي أخطر من القاعدة، وأن جماعة الإخوان المسلمين أخطر من \"داعش\"،وللأسف نجحوا إلى حد كبير في وصم كل شخص مسلم ناشط في السياسة بأنه يجب أن يكون منالإخوان المسلمين. هل ساهمت حرب غزة في تصاعد \"الإسلاموفوبيا\"في الدول الغربية؟ أعتقد أن حرب غزة تُفسّر بحد ذاتها إلى جانب عوامل أخرى من خلال الإسلاموفوبيا،لأن تجريد الفلسطينيين من الإنسانية يتم بشكل كبير من خلال تأطير هذا الصراع على أنهحرب بين حركة حماس وإسرائيل بدلا من كونها حربا بين إسرائيل وفلسطين، وهذا يساعد فيتجريد المسلمين من الإنسانية، خاصة وبشكل مكثف بسبب الحرب العالمية على الإرهاب، وهذا حقا يساعد أيضا في تجريد الشعب الفلسطينيمن الإنسانية؛ لأن كل القضية الفلسطينية تُؤطَر ليس كسؤال حول الهوية الوطنية، وليسكسؤال حول الأرض والسيادة، ولكن تُؤطر كصراع حضارات ديني، ولذلك هناك تغذية كبيرة للإسلاموفوبيا في الطريقةالتي نفهم بها الحرب الحالية في غزة. هل تستغل الجماعات اليمينية المتطرفةحرب غزة لزيادة العداء ضد المسلمين في الغرب؟ أعتقد أنك تعلم، في الصورة الأكبر، أنه لا يوجد فرق كبير بين ما نشهده في العديدمن البلدان الغربية للأسف، وما نشهده أيضا في البلدان المسلمة؛ فهناك حملة قمع شديدةعلى حرية التعبير، وحرية التجمع، والعديد من حقوق الإنسان الأساسية الأخرى. بعض الناس حقيقة لا يمكنهم السفر من مكان إلى آخر لأنهم يُعتبرون مؤيدين للقضيةالفلسطينية، والتي تُعتبر بعد ذلك عملا داعما للإرهاب، وقد قلّص ذلك بشدة من الحريات الأساسية في أوقاتناالمعاصرة. لذا، نعم، أعتقد أن الجماعات اليمينية المتطرفة تستغل حرب غزة لزيادة العداءضد المسلمين، وهذه هي المشكلة الأكبر التي نراها هنا حاليا، وهي مرتبطة بالقضيةالفلسطينية، ولكن بطريقة ما قائمة بذاتها. كيف ترى الجهود الرسمية في الغرب لاحتواء ظاهرة \"الإسلاموفوبيا\"؟وهل هذه الإجراءات كافية أم لا؟ على المستوى الأوروبي، هناك بشكل واضح نقص في الرغبة في معالجة الإسلاموفوبيا،ويمكنك رؤية ذلك جليا؛ فعلى سبيل المثال، لدينا قرار ضد معاداة السامية في البرلمانالأوروبي منذ عام 2017، ولكن ليس لدينا شيء مشابه فيما يتعلق بالإسلاموفوبيا، وهذايشير إلى وجود نقص على المستوى الأوروبي فوق الوطني. وفي نفس الوقت، هناك، في دول مختلفة، محاولات من قِبل عدد من البيروقراطيينوالأشخاص لمحاولة احتواء الإسلاموفوبيا، وللقيام بشيء حقيقيحيال ذلك توجد مبادرات من مجلس أوروبا، على سبيل المثال، لوضع تعريف للإسلاموفوبيالتكون لدينا قدرة على إصدار قرار مثل القرار ضد معاداة السامية، لكن لا يزال الطريقطويلا جدا جدا، خاصة أن هناك تضاربا وتنازعا في المواقف الأوروبية بخصوص الموقف منقضية الإسلاموفوبيا. وهناك أجزاء كبيرة من المعسكر السياسي الأكثر تحفظا اختارت بوضوح أجندةاليمين المتطرف للغاية، والذين يُقدّمون أنفسهم على أساس أنهم المنقذون لأوروباالمسيحية البيضاء، بينما في المقابل نجد المعسكر اليساريالعلماني المنقسم على ذاته، يقول أحدهم إنه ينبغي منح المسلمين مساحة أكبر للمشاركةبناءً على أفكارنا وقيمنا الديمقراطية والمساواة، لكن يرد عليه آخر قائلا: لكنهممتدينون، والدين يُمثل مشكلة بالنسبة لنا؛ فنحن نحارب الكنيسة منذ مئات السنين، وعلينامواصلة هذه المعركة ضد المسلمين الذين يُشكّلون خطرا على دولنا العلمانيةالليبرالية. وماذا عن رؤيتكم للدور الذي تلعبه الأمم المتحدة في مواجهةجرائم الكراهية ضد المسلمين؟ الأمم المتحدة تلعب دورا مهما بشكل واضح، ولدينا الآن يوما دوليا لمكافحة الإسلاموفوبيا،في الخامس عشر من آذار/ مارس، والذي أُنشئ قبل عامين من قِبل الجمعية العامة للأممالمتحدة، وهو خطوة رمزية مهمة، ومع ذلك، لا يزال الطريق طويلا جدا أيضا. لماذا؟ لأن الإسلاموفوبيا في العديد من الدول الوطنية مشكلة حقيقية، وهي جزء لا يتجزأمن الإطار المؤسسي. لذا، علينا أن نأتي بأكثر من قرار رمزي لمحاربة الإسلاموفوبيا. في الأساس، الأمر يتعلق إلى أي مدى، خصوصا فيالغرب، نريد للمسلمين أن تكون لديهم نفس إمكانية المشاركة في البلاد. ما هو برأيكم الأسلوب الأمثل الذي يمكن أن تتبعه الحكوماتالعربية والإسلامية لمحاصرة ظاهرة \"الإسلاموفوبيا\"؟ هناك محاولة من بعض الدول الإسلامية لتصدير فكرتها عن الإسلام الذي تسيطر عليهالدولة إلى الدول الأوروبية والغربية، وهذا يتعارض كثيرا مع فكرة العلمانية وفصل قوةالكنيسة عن الدولة، والتي أعتقد أنها أكثر فائدة لأي مجتمع مدني وأي نوع من التدينالإسلامي أن لا تكون تحت سيطرة أي مؤسسة حكومية أو ما شابه، ولكن أعتقد أنه من حيث الضغط الثقافي والدبلوماسيالذي يمكن أن تمارسه الدول الإسلامية، فإنها بالطبع قوة عظيمة. والسؤال الحقيقي هو هل تريد الدول الإسلامية فقط فعل ذلك عندما تكون هناك بعضالمضايقات المتعلقة بالرموز الأكثر أهمية في الإسلام، مثل أزمة الرسوم الكاريكاتوريةأو حرق القرآن؟، وعندها تكون هناكمظاهرات هائلة في الدول الإسلامية، ويشعر بعض المسؤولين الحكوميين الغربيين بالإجبار على فعل شيء حيال ذلك أم أننا بحاجة فعلا إلى حوار إستراتيجي بين الدولذات الأغلبية المسلمة وشركائها في الغرب لمناقشة عدم التمييز ضد المسلمين في سوق العملوفي مشاركتهم السياسية وفي تعبيرهم الثقافي والديني في الساحة العامة، وهذه هي المجالاتالأكثر أهمية حيث يلزم اتخاذ إجراءات ضرورية خلال الفترة المقبلة. هل تلعب المؤسسات الإسلامية في الغرب دورا رئيسيا في معالجةهذه الظاهرة؟ أعتقد أن الطريقة التي تنظم بها الكثير من المؤسسات الإسلامية والطريقة التيتتصرف بها تجاه المؤسسات الحكومية، تتأثر غالبا بسياسة الخوف، وسياسة محاولة تأمينوحماية عنق الشخص، وبدلا من تحسين الأمورحقا للأفضل يمكنك أن تفهم من ناحية أنه بالنسبة لهم المهم هو مسألة البقاء الديني،ولكن من ناحية أخرى أعتقد أنه من أجل إحداث تغيير فيما يتعلق بالإسلاموفوبيا المفهومةعلى أنها عنصرية ضد المسلمين، وهذا الأمر يحتاج إلى تغيير سياسي بدلا من مجرد تغييرفي الخطاب الديني أو ما شابه. ما هو مطلوب أساسا هو أن يُعامل المسلمون على قدم المساواة، وهذا بالطبع شيء تحاول العديد من المؤسسات الإسلاميةالنضال من أجله وتحقيقه، ولكن في الوقت نفسههو شيء لن تحصل عليه إلا إذا قمت أيضا بممارسة الضغط السياسي والاقتصادي على أحد ما، وهذا ما تضعف المؤسسات الإسلامية لتحقيقه؛ فالمسلمينفي أوروبا ضعفاء سياسيا، وهم المجتمع الأكثر تهميشا، ولا أحد يريد تبني قضيتهمالعادلة، ومن الصعب على أي شخص أن يقوم بالدفاع عنهم. هل «الإسلاموفوبيا» شوّهت صورة المسلمين في الغرب؟ نعم تماما هناك صورة من جانب واحد لما يمثله المسلم. هناك صورة مشوّهة من حيثارتباط المسلمين بالعنف في كثير من الأحيان، رغم أنهم على نطاق عالمي هم على الأرجحالذين يتعرضون للعنف من قِبل الدولة وغير الدولة بشكل أكبر مقارنة بالمجتمعات الغربية،وهذا بالطبع لا يساعد على تحسين الأوضاع. ما مستقبل \"الإسلاموفوبيا\" في الغرب؟ أعتقد أن مستقبل المسلمين والإسلاموفوبيا في الغرب يعتمد كثيرا على ما إذا كانأولئك الذين في السلطة يمكنهم أن يسألوا أنفسهم لماذا لا يريدون أن يكون المسلمون جزءالا يتجزأ من مواطنة متساوية كاملة المشاركة طالما أن لدينا أنظمة مواطنة وأنظمة هجرة وحكوماتمتحيزة على أساس العرق داخل المجتمعات في أوروبا الغربية التي لا تسمح بالمشاركة المتساويةالكاملة، فسنظل نواجه مشكلة. وهذه هي المسألة التي ينبغي أن نجد لها حلا، ويجب أن نجيب عن السؤال الأهم: ما هو شكل المستقبلالذي نريده لأوروبا؟، هل نريد مستقبلا تعمّ فيه المساواة الحقيقية أم نريد مستقبلايتميز بمواطنات

        "content": "RUNSTUDIO/DigitalVision via Getty Images MFA Financial ( NYSE: MFA ) is a mortgage REIT that has a couple of interesting things going for it right now. Its dividend yield trades at a high 13%, and this also comes with a discount to book value. MFA Price/Book 5Y History (Seeking Alpha) At 0.58, this looks like a large discount. During this period as well, the company has made some changes to its strategy to avoid some of the pitfalls of the past. After examining where they are in this process, I ultimately concluded that MFA is a Hold until it's made more progress in its transformation. Financial History When looking at a REIT's financial results, one of its biggest tests is how well it has maintained its dividend per share. In the last few years, we can see that MFA struggled to maintain it. Seeking Alpha After 2020 and the onset of COVID, the dividend was reduced and hasn't returned to previous levels. This is due, in large part, to how the pressures of the pandemic caused them to reduce the size of their balance sheet. Author's display of 10K data 2020 saw the balance sheet fall by more than half. This was not uncommon for mREITs at the time, as the COVID crash created liquidity pinches for many of them that utilize mark-to-market financing and thus experienced margin calls. In Q1 2020 earnings , CEO Craig Knutson said: It was clear to us in late March that our situation was not due to bad assets, but a fragile funding, and the path forward would require more durable forms of financing. We also recognize that term financing margin holiday and/or non-mark-to-market financing would necessarily require higher haircuts and therefore more capital. So while they updated the financing situation, that was not the only change that occurred. In 2021, they acquired Lima One, which originates Business Purpose Loans (\"BPLs\") to real estate investors, and these loans are a growing part of their portfolio. Management continued their strategy of evolving their leverage into 2023, noting in the 2023 Form 10K (pg. 41): ...we believe our commitment to prudent risk management and hedging and prioritization of non-mark-to-market financing allowed us to add $3.4 billion of our target assets at increasingly attractive yields. These additions included over $2.1 billion of funded originations of business purpose loans and draws on existing Transitional loans at Lima One, approximately $880 million of Non-QM loans, and approximately $460 million of Agency MBS. Reflecting the impact of our strategy, for the year ended December 31, 2023, the yield on our average interest-earning assets increased by nearly 100 basis points, while our effective cost of funds increased by nearly 40 basis points from the year ended December 31, 2022. So the company is evolving its means of financing still, and it's worth considering where what kind of business it is currently. Business Model MFA is primarily in the business of originating and acquiring BPLs (through Lima) and non-qualified mortgages (non-QM). The rest of its portfolio contains other types of mortgage assets, largely non-performing whole loans that are bought at a discount. Q1 2024 Company Presentation They have steadily been rotating their assets into these concentrations in BPLs and non-QM loans. Cropped Table of Distributable Earnings (2023 Form 10K) The Lima assets, meanwhile, have had a rising contribution to the distributable earnings (earning available for distribution as a dividend). Q1 2024 Company Presentation About 28% of their liabilities, meanwhile, are these mark-to-market financing sources. Q1 2024 Company Presentation Importantly, though, while delinquencies are up on these loans from Q1 2023, they remain relatively low at 4.3%. Q1 2024 Company Presentation The Lima One loans, meanwhile, have enjoyed a rising yield, low DQ rates, and a steady flow of new originations. Q1 2024 Company Presentation The Lima One loans are largely multifamily, with about half in Texas, Florida, George, New York, and North Carolina. Q1 2024 Company Presentation The non-QM loans, meanwhile, are heavily concentrated in California and, to a lesser extent, Florida. Future Outlook Overall, I see the situation as improving for MFA as they continue to transition out of their old strategy and focus on loan origination itself through Lima One, which I believe comes with some skin in the game that not all mREITs have. There are two concerns I want to highlight, though. Interest Spreads While the coupons on their loans are high, so too are the coupons on their new financing. In Q1 2024 earnings , they mentioned that their newest bonds in April yielded 9%. Regarding asset acquisition, Knutson said: In some cases, it can make sense to call a deal and re-lever the underlying loans in a new securitization. Even if the cost of debt is marginally higher than in an existing deal, a call and re-lever could unlock significant additional liquidity, which we can redeploy at attractive ROEs. These call rights provide an often underappreciated option that we have to optimize our liability framework in the years ahead. While he may have a point here, this is something that creates additional squeeze on distributable earnings. Q1 2024 Company Presentation If interest rates do not decline at a fast enough rate, I worry that these could create unnecessarily losses that require a cut in the quarterly dividend, which right now is equal to DE. Missing Out on Buybacks Management also announced that the Board had approved a $200M share repurchase program, which is currently about a fifth of the market cap. Knutson clarified: I'll also point out that we simultaneously refreshed our share repurchase authorization, and I would characterize both actions...as administrative in nature. So this isn't guiding for buybacks at a really good price. As of Q1, tangible book value per share is $17.79. With a dividend yielding 13%, that's a great return on capital if repurchased. Q1 2024 Company Presentation In the slide above, even management seems to believe there is some underappreciated value on its balance sheet. Yet, considering the tight cash flow situation with DE and the continued shift in their financing, it seems to me that management is not as comfortable as it could be. There are companies using market pessimism to buy back their shares right now, and I see that as a key indicator of a company's financial strength that they can make some space for that. Conclusion A fair value for MFA on the high end reasonably stands at the TBV, $17.79. Over time, with the company's active role in origination and opportunities to re-lever to reduce interest expense, we could even see that and the dividend improve. In the meantime, the discount to book and current price under $11 exists for a reason. The shares are likely fairly valued in the event that interest rates do not change favorably for MFA, and in case the higher rates persist and lead to more DQs going forward. While this may not eliminate the dividend, it does mean the yield on cost may not prove to be the full 13% over the next few years. I think MFA is close to being an attractive investment but needs more time to navigate the present situation. Long-term investors will probably benefit from waiting to see them shed the remaining vestiges of MTM financing and achieving a lower payout ratio of DE. In the meantime, MFA isn't the riskiest investment with the reforms it's made and is at least an adequate Hold.

Her comments were somewhat ambiguous, but they do indicate that the tech giant may be considering aligning the iPad's logo orientation with that of its MacBooks.While Anderson's response was not definitive, Apple's usual policy is to avoid discussing potential changes unless they are seriously contemplated. This suggests a possible redesign of the iPad's logo placement to better suit landscape mode.Also read: Samsung Galaxy F55 5G Launched In IndiaSupporting this likely shift, Apple relocated the front camera to the center for landscape use with the 10th generation iPad that was unveiled in 2022. This change was also implemented in the newly released M2 iPad Air and M4 iPad Pro models. Additionally, since the unveiling of iPadOS 14.5, the Apple logo adjusts to match the device’s orientation during startup.Meanwhile, an update to the iPad Mini, which was notably absent in the recent \"Let Loose\" Apple event, has led some industry insiders to speculate about a potential release later this year. According to Bloomberg's tech analyst Mark Gurman, there is a possibility. He has suggested that a new iPad Mini could make its debut towards the end of the year, potentially replacing the existing 2021 model.According to Gurman's insights shared via @appltrack, the anticipated iPad Mini refresh might not bring groundbreaking changes beyond a faster chip.",

While Anderson's response was not definitive, Apple's usual policy is to avoid discussing potential changes unless they are seriously contemplated. This suggests a possible redesign of the iPad's logo placement to better suit landscape mode. Also read: Samsung Galaxy F55 5G Launched In India Supporting this likely shift, Apple relocated the front camera to the center for landscape use with the 10th generation iPad that was unveiled in 2022. This change was also implemented in the newly released M2 iPad Air and M4 iPad Pro models. Additionally, since the unveiling of iPadOS 14.5, the Apple logo adjusts to match the device’s orientation during startup. Meanwhile, an update to the iPad Mini, which was notably absent in the recent \"Let Loose\" Apple event, has led some industry insiders to speculate about a potential release later this year. According to Bloomberg's tech analyst Mark Gurman, there is a possibility. He has suggested that a new iPad Mini could make its debut towards the end of the year, potentially replacing the existing 2021 model. According to Gurman's insights shared via @appltrack, the anticipated iPad Mini refresh might not bring groundbreaking changes beyond a faster chip.",

        "content": "Frankfurt : The number of people granted German citizenship reached the highest level last year since records began in 2000. The number of naturalisations rose by 19 per cent compared to the previous year, having already risen by 28 per cent in 2022, the Federal Statistical Office reported on Tuesday. In absolute figures, around 2,00,100 people were naturalised in 2023. People from 157 different nationalities were granted German citizenship in 2023, the most common being Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Romania and Afghanistan. Together, these countries accounted for more than half of all naturalisations. Naturalised citizens were 29.3-years-old on average and, therefore, significantly younger than the population as a whole. At 45 per cent, the proportion of women was lower than in the population as a whole. Former Syrian nationals made up the largest group of naturalised citizens, accounting for more than a third of all naturalisations. Their number increased by a further 56 per cent compared to the previous year. In 2022, this figure had already more than doubled compared to the previous year and even increased sevenfold in 2021. \"The high number of naturalisations of Syrians is therefore related to the high immigration of Syrian asylum seekers in the years 2014 to 2016, who now increasingly meet the requirements for naturalisation,\" the office reported. The number of naturalisations of Ukrainians rose by six per cent to 5,900 in 2023 after almost tripling from 1,900 to 5,600 from 2021 to 2022. Naturalisations of Ukrainian citizens accounted for three per cent of all naturalisations in 2023.",

        "content": "Die Übersicht in Kurzmeldungen zu Entwicklungen, Ergebnissen und Einschätzungen rund um die bundesdeutsche Politik: Die Sprecherin für Verbraucherschutz der Grünen im Bundestag, Linda Heitmann, fordert Regeln für politische Inhalte auf Tiktok. Der Erstkontakt mit Politik finde für Kinder und Jugendliche heute oft auf Tiktok statt, ohne Einordnung und mit viel Skandalisierung, schreibt Heitmann in einem Gastbeitrag für das Nachrichtenportal T-Online. \"Wir als Politikerinnen und Politiker müssen speziell TikTok deshalb Regeln geben und Grenzen setzen, anstatt alle halbe Jahr auf jeder neuen Plattform einen Account mit immer stärker verkürzten Darstellungsmöglichkeiten zu eröffnen.\" Heitmann fordert laut den Angaben zum einen \"klare Identifikationsregeln\" für politische Akteure auf der Plattform, selbst auf kommunaler Ebene. Accounts, die die Regeln nicht einhalten, sollen gelöscht werden. Zum anderen will die Grünen-Politikerin den Jugendschutz durch Regeln für bestimmte Altersgruppen verbessern: \"Strenge Altersverifikation bei der Tiktok-Registrierung und das konsequente Ausblenden parteipolitischer Inhalte für Menschen unter 16 Jahren erscheinen mir sinnvoll und klar.\" Der CDU-Außenpolitiker Roderich Kiesewetter unterstützt die Forderung des französischen Präsidenten Emmanuel Macron nach einer gemeinsamen europäischen Verteidigung. \"Wir Europäer sind gut beraten, die Signale aus Frankreich sehr ernst zu nehmen, weil Macron verstanden hat, dass dieses Europa nach dem Krieg gegen die Ukraine ein anderes sein wird\", sagte er in der Sendung \"Frühstart\" von RTL und Ntv. Es werde verteidigungsbereiter sein, innovativer, aber auch östlicher und nördlicher. \"Deswegen ist der Appell, die europäische Verteidigung zu stärken, indem man mehr Rüstungskooperation macht, mehr standardisiert, die Zusammenarbeit verbessert, völlig richtig.\" Die Deutschen trauen laut einer Umfrage des Digitalverbands Bitkom der CDU/CSU am ehesten zu, die Digitalisierung in Deutschland voranzubringen. Auf einer Schulnotenskala erhält die Union in Sachen Digitalpolitik im Durchschnitt eine 2,8 und damit die beste Note unter den Parteien. Nur knapp dahinter folgen die Grünen, die eine Durchschnittsnote von 2,9 erzielen. In der Umfrage liegen die Freien Wähler mit der Durchschnittsnote 3,4 auf dem dritten und die FDP mit einer 3,6 auf dem vierten Platz. Die SPD schneidet unter den drei Regierungsparteien mit einer 3,9 am schlechtesten ab. \"Die Wählerinnen und Wähler setzen ihre größte digitalpolitische Hoffnung aktuell in Schwarz-Grün\", sagte Bitkom-Präsident Ralf Wintergerst. \"Die Ampel-Koalition aus SPD, Grünen und FDP hat sich zwar eine anspruchsvolle digitalpolitische Agenda verordnet, allerdings verfängt dies in der Bevölkerung offenkundig kaum. Die Menschen wollen nicht nur gute Programme, sie wollen praktische Erfolge sehen.\" Der Vorsitzende des Auswärtigen Ausschusses des Bundestags, Michael Roth (SPD), hat die EU aufgefordert, Schlüsse aus der Dresden-Rede von Frankreichs Staatspräsident Emmanuel Macron zu ziehen und die Unterstützung der Ukraine zu verstärken. \"Die Rede Macrons wäre ein historischer Meilenstein, wenn ihr jetzt endlich Taten folgten\", sagte Roth dem Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland. \"Zu Recht hat der französische Staatspräsident die Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik in den Mittelpunkt seiner eindrücklichen Rede gerückt. Hier hat er große Zustimmung verdient. Aber leider klaffen derzeit Anspruch und Wirklichkeit in Europa meilenweit auseinander.\" Wer Europa souveräner machen wolle, wie es der Präsident gefordert hatte, müsse mehr dafür tun, dass die Ukraine ein freier, demokratischer und souveräner Staat bleibe und der russische Imperialismus gestoppt werde. \"Die EU muss unter Führung von Frankreich, Deutschland und Polen mehr Verantwortung in Osteuropa und dem Westbalkan übernehmen. Hier zählen jetzt Taten\", sagte er. Die Krankenkassen erwarten 2025 einen Anstieg des Pflegeversicherungsbeitrags. \"Die Pflegekassen gehen davon aus, dass die Finanzmittel im ersten Quartal 2025 insgesamt weniger als eine Monatsausgabe betragen. Für diesen Fall darf die Bundesregierung den Beitragssatz per Rechtsverordnung anheben\", erklärte der Verband der Ersatzkassen NRW gegenüber der Rheinischen Post. \"Die Sicherstellung der Zahlungsfähigkeit des Gesamtsystems macht nach aktueller Datenlage eine Beitragssatzanhebung voraussichtlich schon zu Beginn des Jahres 2025 erforderlich.\" Unterdessen sprach sich der Sozialexperte Bernd Raffelhüschen angesichts der stark wachsenden Zahl an Pflegebedürftigen für eine einjährige Selbstbeteiligung der Betroffenen an den Kosten aus. \"Die Kostenlawine ist nicht mehr aufzuhalten\", sagte er der Bild-Zeitung. \"Um die Folgen abzumildern, sollte eine Pflege-Karenzzeit schnellstmöglich eingeführt werden.\" Pflegebedürftige müssten dann das erste Jahr die Pflegekosten selbst zahlen, sagte Raffelhüschen. Er schlug eine schrittweise Einführung der Karenzzeiten vor. Die stellvertretende Vorsitzende der Grünen-Bundestagsfraktion, Maria Klein-Schmeink, fordert mehr Steuerzuschuss an die Pflegeversicherung. \"Der demografische Wandel kommt mit Macht und wird unterschätzt. Unser Ziel ist es die Finanzierung der Pflegeversicherung zu stabilisieren und damit eine angemessene Versorgung für alle zu garantieren\", sagte sie der Bild-Zeitung. Es bleibe das Ziel, die Pflege \"gerecht und verlässlich\" zu finanzieren. \"Dafür ist es unter anderem erforderlich, dass Leistungen, die nicht Aufgabe der Pflegeversicherung sind, aus Steuermitteln finanziert werden. Dazu gehören die Rentenbeiträge für pflegende Angehörige.\" Unterdessen warnte die CSU angesichts steigender Zahlen pflegebedürftiger Menschen und höherer Kosten vor der Pleite der gesetzlichen Pflegeversicherung. \"Die Pflegeversicherung ist allen Prognosen nach Ende des Jahres pleite, und wir erleben heute schon Triagesituationen\", sagte die pflegepolitische Sprecherin der CDU/CSU-Bundestagsfraktion, Emmi Zeulner, der Zeitung. \"Deshalb braucht es dringend eine grundlegende Pflegestrukturreform, also eine Revolution in der Pflege.\" Die Mehrheit der Bundesbürger geht davon aus, dass das Renteneintrittsalter mittelfristig auf 69 Jahre angehoben wird. Das berichtete die Bild-Zeitung unter Berufung auf eine repräsentative Umfrage des Instituts Insa. Danach erwarten 38 Prozent der Befragten, dass das gesetzliche Eintrittsalter demnächst um ein bis zwei Jahre über 67 hinaus bis auf 69 angehoben wird. 29 Prozent gehen sogar von einer Anhebung auf mindestens 70 Jahre aus. 24 Prozent erwarten dagegen keine Anhebung. Nur noch eine kleine Minderheit der Bundesbürger sei davon überzeugt, dass die Rente in Deutschland sicher sei. Die absolute Mehrheit von 72?Prozent der Umfrageteilnehmer war nicht der Meinung, dass die Rente in Deutschland für alle sicher ist.

        "content": "Ryuki Suzuki and Georgina Handog shone in the opening round of the Junior Philippine Golf Tour Luzon Series 2, seizing the lead in the 8-10 age category with 72 and 87, respectively, even as Jiwon Lee scorched the Pradera Verde course with an eagle-spiked 66 in the premier division here on Tuesday, May 28. LUBAO, Pampanga – Ryuki Suzuki and Georgina Handog shone in the opening round of the Junior Philippine Golf Tour Luzon Series 2, seizing the lead in the 8-10 age category with 72 and 87, respectively, even as Jiwon Lee scorched the Pradera Verde course with an eagle-spiked 66 in the premier division here on Tuesday, May 28. Both Suzuki and Handog navigated the challenging greens with commendable skill with the former rebounding from early setbacks, securing birdies on Nos. 5 and 14 to edge out Jose Luis Espinosa by one stroke with a 37-35. Espinosa, who led after 12 holes with a two-birdie, one-bogey card, stumbled with a double-bogey on the 16th for a 73, allowing the Splendido Taal leg winner to finish ahead in the 36-hole competition. Monte Andaman trailed in third with a 92. “The course is easy but the greens are very fast,” said Suzuki, lamenting a missed birdie putt on the par-5 No. 12, which he reached in two. “I three-putted it, and it’s really disappointing for me.” Handog, making her debut in the series sponsored by ICTSI, stamped her class in the girls’ side of the youngest division of the three-category event with a 15-over round, nine strokes ahead of first leg winner Maurysse Abalos, who carded a 96. Despite windy conditions, Handog’s birdie on the first hole set the tone for her round. Although she encountered bogeys, a double bogey and a triple bogey, her 87 established a commanding lead. “It’s hot but I started out strong and good,” said Handog, demonstrating her readiness for the top spot. Athalea Espedido carded a 98 for third. In the girls’ 15-18 class spread over 72 holes, Lee positioned herself for another victory, firing an impressive 66, featuring an eagle and six birdies. Lee’s stellar play granted her a 12-shot lead over Reese Ng, who struggled with a 78, while Lia Duque posted an 82 for third. “The game plan is to keep the ball in play to get chances for birdies or pars,” said Lee. Starting at the third nine, she excelled with birdies and an eagle on No. 14, concluding with a remarkable backside 31 with three birdies in the last four holes. She aims for conservative play in the upcoming rounds of the event organized by Pilipinas Golf Tournaments, Inc., focusing on maintaining her lead. Shinichi Suzuki, on the other hand, debuted in the boys’ 15-18 category with a notable two-under 70, overcoming early challenges to claim a six-stroke lead over Mark Kobayashi, who put in a 76. Suzuki emphasized consistency in hitting fairways and greens as his strategy moving forward. “Initially, I struggled to find my rhythm with my shots, especially as the wind picked up during the back nine. Despite these challenges, I maintained consistency by hitting fairways and managing to save par on several holes,” said Suzuki. In the girls’ 11-14 class, Lisa Sarines wrested control with a 75, four strokes ahead of twin sister Mona and Levonne Talion, who matched 79s, as first leg champion Precious Zaragosa wavered with an 83. Lisa adapted to the windy conditions, showcasing resilience and strategic play. Geoffrey Tan, meanwhile, dominated the boys’ 11-14 division with a two-under 70, highlighted by three birdies in the last four holes, establishing a huge 12-shot advantage over Zianbeau Edoc and Aenzo Sulaik, who both shot 84s. First leg winner Vito Sarines carded an 83. “Navigating his course has been challenging primarily due to the strength of the winds. As a result, I had to club up a lot of times, and calculate all of my shots,” said Tan. Participants in the 8-10 and 11-14 divisions tackled the first and second nines of the Pradera Verde complex, while those in the premier 15-18 category played the third and second nines, showcasing their talents in the series held as part of JPGT’s mission to cultivate young talent and enhance the sport’s popularity across the country.",

        "description": "Larry Connor, a billionaire who made his wealth through real estate, is determined to prove that extreme underwater tourism is safe after the tragic implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023",
        "content": "Nearly a year after the catastrophic implosion of the Titan submersible, a daring has pledged to journey to the 's wreck in a new vessel, aiming to showcase the safety of deep sea expeditions. In a chilling turn of events last June, all five passengers aboard an perished when it , casting serious doubts over the safety of extreme underwater tourism. Yet, undaunted by the tragedy, property tycoon Larry Connor is set to embark on a deep sea adventure. He plans to plunge 3,800 feet beneath the waves in a Triton submarine to the iconic Titanic site, accompanied by none other than Patrick Lahey, the CEO of the company. \"I want to show people worldwide that while the ocean is extremely powerful, it can be wonderful and enjoyable and really kind of life-changing if you go about it the right way,\" Larry told . Recalling how they decided on their plan, Patrick explained: \"He [Larry] called me up and said, 'You know, what we need to do is build a sub that can dive to [Titanic-level depths] repeatedly and safely and demonstrate to the world that you guys can do that, and that Titan was a contraption.'\" Patrick revealed how the OceanGate disaster had sent a \"chilling effect\" through the industry, dampening interest in Triton's submarines and rekindling \"old myths that only a crazy person\" would dare such a descent. Larry, a client of Triton, was quick to propose a project just days after the OceanGate calamity, according to Patrick. Larry added: \"Patrick has been thinking about and designing this for over a decade. But we didn't have the materials and technology. You couldn't have built this sub five years ago.\" The dynamic duo is gearing up for their epic voyage in the swanky $20 million Triton 4000/2 Abyssal Explorer, though the launch date for this underwater escapade is still unconfirmed. With a whopping $2 billion net worth reported by Forbes, Larry boasts an eclectic array of escapades. His thrill-seeking exploits include space travel, car racing, jet-flying, and even snagging a Guinness World Record for the highest HALO jump formation, according to his company's site. Alongside Patrick, he's also plunged into the ocean's abyss in a Triton submersible, exploring its deepest recesses. Tragedy struck when the Titan submersible, designed to ferry sightseers to the Titanic's remains, was en route approximately beneath the North Atlantic's waves to the historic site and experienced a devastating implosion on June 18, 2023. British entrepreneur Hamish Harding, Pakistani investor Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman, French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet, and OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush all tragically lost their lives. David Lochridge, the former director of marine operations at OceanGate, had previously voiced safety concerns prior to the incident, and an investigation is currently underway. In a 2018 lawsuit, David alleged that he was dismissed after cautioning that the system used for hull testing wouldn't identify critical flaws, and that any failures could be disastrous due to the intense ocean pressure. OceanGate, which has since ceased operations, stated that they are fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation.",

        "description": "The Belgian squad for the Euro 24 championships has been named with two major shocks announced by coach Domenico Tedesco.",
        "content": "Belgium have recalled Axel Witsel to the squad for Euro 2024 in Germany next month but there is no place for Thibaut Courtois despite the Real Madrid goalkeeper being in line to feature in Saturday's Champions League final. Coach Domenico Tedesco announced his 25-man squad on Tuesday for next month's tournament with Witsel's recall a major surprise. The 35-year-old announced his international retirement last year and his return comes after Tedesco visited the Atletico Madrid defender to persuade him to come back to the team. Witsel won the last of his 130 caps at the World Cup in Qatar, where Belgium were eliminated in the group stage. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Courtois walked out on the Belgian squad last June when he was not named captain following Eden Hazard's retirement, leading to a public falling out with Tedesco. The Real Madrid goalkeeper was criticised by teammates and has since expressed regret, but the rift between him and the coach appears not to have healed. Soon after the walkout, Courtois suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined him for most of the season, returning for Real Madrid only earlier this month and being in the squad for Saturday's final against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. \"Courtois was very clear and honest and early in his communication. The latest information we received is that he is not ready for the European Championships. He knows his body best,\" said Tedesco at a press conference on Tuesday. \"I have had Axel in my mind for a long time, even during the qualification. It's about quality, Witsel offers a lot of quality. \"He is a key player at Atletico Madrid. I met him, wanted to see him, look into his eyes. We need him, he has experience and can help the young players. Experience in that position is important. We are playing a European Championship, that is no small thing,\" the coach added. Club Brugge fullback Maxim De Cuyper is the only uncapped player in the squad. \"I have been following Maxim De Cuyper for a long time but never had the chance to select him before, but he now deserves to be in the squad,\" said Tedesco, who picked 25 players instead of the 26 that UEFA are allowing for each squad. Belgium's most capped international Jan Vertonghen competes at the age of 37 and with 154 caps. The squad also includes top scorer Romelu Lukaku, who has netted 83 times in 114 appearances for his country. Belgium squad: Goalkeepers: Koen Casteels (VfL Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton Town), Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest) Defenders: Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Wout Faes (Leicester City), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Arthur Theate (Stade Rennais), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid) Midfielders: Yannick Carrasco (Al Shabab), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Orel Mangala (Olympique Lyonnais), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Aster Vranckx (vfL Wolfsburg) Forwards: Johan Bakayoko (PSV Eindhoven), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Lois Openda (RB Leipzig), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal).",

        "content": "On Tuesday, Berenberg issued an update on Schoeller-Bleckmann Oilfield Equipment AG (SBO:AV) (OTC: SBOEY) shares, lowering the company's price target to EUR60.00 from the previous EUR70.00, while keeping a Buy rating on the stock. This adjustment follows the release of the company's first-quarter results on May 23, which showcased a strong international business performance despite ongoing challenges in the US onshore sector. The firm observed that Schoeller-Bleckmann's first-quarter bookings reflected modest growth, signaling a return to normalcy, and anticipates a further increase in the second quarter. The company's international exposure, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, is expected to drive further growth. However, due to uncertainties in the US market, the firm has revised its estimates and reduced the price target for the oilfield services provider. According to the analyst's commentary, the solid Q1 performance was balanced by the international focus, which helped offset weaker results from the US onshore operations. The firm remains optimistic about the company's potential for growth in active international markets, yet it expresses caution regarding the prospects for a recovery in the US within the current year. Despite the lowered price target, Berenberg reaffirmed its confidence in Schoeller-Bleckmann by maintaining a Buy rating. The company's stock valuation reflects the mixed outlook, with robust international activity providing a positive counterpoint to the less certain US market conditions. The revised price target of EUR60.00 is now the firm's expectation for the stock's future performance. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

        "description": "The Belgian squad for the Euro 24 championships has been named with two major shocks announced by coach Domenico Tedesco.",
        "content": "Belgium have recalled Axel Witsel to the squad for Euro 2024 in Germany next month but there is no place for Thibaut Courtois despite the Real Madrid goalkeeper being in line to feature in Saturday's Champions League final. Coach Domenico Tedesco announced his 25-man squad on Tuesday for next month's tournament with Witsel's recall a major surprise. The 35-year-old announced his international retirement last year and his return comes after Tedesco visited the Atletico Madrid defender to persuade him to come back to the team. Witsel won the last of his 130 caps at the World Cup in Qatar, where Belgium were eliminated in the group stage. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Courtois walked out on the Belgian squad last June when he was not named captain following Eden Hazard's retirement, leading to a public falling out with Tedesco. The Real Madrid goalkeeper was criticised by teammates and has since expressed regret, but the rift between him and the coach appears not to have healed. Soon after the walkout, Courtois suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined him for most of the season, returning for Real Madrid only earlier this month and being in the squad for Saturday's final against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley. \"Courtois was very clear and honest and early in his communication. The latest information we received is that he is not ready for the European Championships. He knows his body best,\" said Tedesco at a press conference on Tuesday. \"I have had Axel in my mind for a long time, even during the qualification. It's about quality, Witsel offers a lot of quality. \"He is a key player at Atletico Madrid. I met him, wanted to see him, look into his eyes. We need him, he has experience and can help the young players. Experience in that position is important. We are playing a European Championship, that is no small thing,\" the coach added. Club Brugge fullback Maxim De Cuyper is the only uncapped player in the squad. \"I have been following Maxim De Cuyper for a long time but never had the chance to select him before, but he now deserves to be in the squad,\" said Tedesco, who picked 25 players instead of the 26 that UEFA are allowing for each squad. Belgium's most capped international Jan Vertonghen competes at the age of 37 and with 154 caps. The squad also includes top scorer Romelu Lukaku, who has netted 83 times in 114 appearances for his country. Belgium squad: Goalkeepers: Koen Casteels (VfL Wolfsburg), Thomas Kaminski (Luton Town), Matz Sels (Nottingham Forest) Defenders: Timothy Castagne (Fulham), Maxim De Cuyper (Club Brugge), Zeno Debast (Anderlecht), Wout Faes (Leicester City), Thomas Meunier (Trabzonspor), Jan Vertonghen (Anderlecht), Arthur Theate (Stade Rennais), Axel Witsel (Atletico Madrid) Midfielders: Yannick Carrasco (Al Shabab), Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City), Orel Mangala (Olympique Lyonnais), Amadou Onana (Everton), Youri Tielemans (Aston Villa), Arthur Vermeeren (Atletico Madrid), Aster Vranckx (vfL Wolfsburg) Forwards: Johan Bakayoko (PSV Eindhoven), Charles De Ketelaere (Atalanta), Jeremy Doku (Manchester City), Romelu Lukaku (Roma), Dodi Lukebakio (Sevilla), Lois Openda (RB Leipzig), Leandro Trossard (Arsenal).",

        "content": "Prosecutors and defense lawyers in Donald Trump's hush money trial are set to deliver closing arguments to the jury Tuesday, each side looking to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president to be charged with felony crimes. The arguments, expected to last the entire day, will give the attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury hearing the landmark case. After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen , Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial. After the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked. The case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up. When Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday. The nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker , the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions — “Just pay it,” the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying. Prosecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Defense lawyers called two witnesses — neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump’s company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Though jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence — and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued. The New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. The three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it’s unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.",

        "content": "DANIEL DUBOIS is back in a big way as he faces feared Croatian heavyweight Filip Hrgovic this weekend. A win over 'El Animal' could see Dubois be given a world title shot, as Hrgovic is the current IBF mandatory challenger. Dubois is coming off a massive win against Jarrell Miller in December, becoming the first man to beat him and knock him out. Hrgovic's biggest win came against Zhilei Zhang on the undercard of Anthony Joshua vs Oleksandr Usyk 2 in August 2022, but he failed to impress and some even thought he lost the bout. A statement win over Brit Dubois, however, will reminds fans and pundits alike just what he's about. Elsewhere on the Matchroom vs Queensberry card , Deontay Wilder faces Zhang .",

        "content": "Prosecutors and defense lawyers in Donald Trump's hush money trial are set to deliver closing arguments to the jury Tuesday, each side looking to score final points with the panel before it starts deliberating the fate of the first former American president to be charged with felony crimes. The arguments, expected to last the entire day, will give the attorneys one last chance to address the Manhattan jury hearing the landmark case. After more than four weeks of testimony, the summations tee up a momentous and historically unprecedented task for the jury as it decides whether to convict the presumptive Republican presidential nominee in connection with payments during the 2016 election to prevent a porn actor from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump. Prosecutors will tell jurors that they have heard enough testimony to convict Trump of all charges while defense attorneys will aim to create doubts about the strength of evidence by targeting the credibility of Michael Cohen , Trump's former lawyer and personal fixer who pleaded guilty to federal charges for his role in the hush money payments and who served as the star prosecution witness in the trial. After the closing arguments are given, the judge will instruct the jury, likely Wednesday, on the law governing the case and the factors it can take into account during deliberations. The deliberations will then proceed in secret, though some clues as to the jury's thinking may arrive through any notes it sends to the judge with questions. Trump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, charges punishable by up to four years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. It's unclear whether prosecutors would seek imprisonment in the event of a conviction, or if the judge would impose that punishment if asked. The case centers on a $130,000 payment Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 election to prevent her from going public with her story of a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump 10 years earlier in a Lake Tahoe hotel suite. Trump has denied Daniels' account, and his attorney, during hours of questioning in the trial, accused her of making it up. When Trump reimbursed Cohen, the payments were logged as being for legal services, which prosecutors say was designed to conceal the true purpose of the transaction with Daniels and to illegally interfere in the 2016 election, in which Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump's lawyers contend they were legitimate payments for actual legal services, and they say that his celebrity status, particularly during the campaign, made him a target for extortion, points they are expected to revisit during their closing arguments Tuesday. The nearly two dozen witnesses included Daniels, who described in sometimes vivid detail the encounter she says she had with Trump; David Pecker , the former publisher of the National Enquirer, who testified that he used his media enterprise to protect Trump by squelching stories that could harm his campaign, including by paying $150,000 to a former Playboy model to keep her from going public with a claim that she had had a yearlong affair with Trump; and Cohen, who testified that Trump was intimately involved in the hush money discussions — “Just pay it,” the now-disbarred lawyer quoted Trump as saying. Prosecutors are expected to remind jurors of the bank statements, emails and other documentary evidence they have viewed, as well as an audio recording in which Cohen and Trump can be heard discussing the deal involving the Playboy model, Karen McDougal. Defense lawyers called two witnesses — neither of them Trump. They focused much of their energy on discrediting Cohen, pressing him on his own criminal history, his past lies and his recollection of key details. On cross-examination, for instance, Cohen admitted stealing tens of thousands of dollars from Trump’s company by asking to be reimbursed for money he had not spent. Cohen acknowledged once telling a prosecutor he felt that Daniels and her lawyer were extorting Trump. Though jurors witnessed numerous memorable moments, they won't be told during closing arguments about exchanges and rulings that occurred outside their presence — and there were many. Judge Juan M. Merchan, for instance, fined Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order barring incendiary out-of-court comments and threatened to jail him if it continued. The New York prosecution is one of four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to reclaim the White House from Democrat Joe Biden. The three other state and federal cases center on charges of illegally hoarding classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election. But it’s unclear that any of them will reach trial before the November election.",

        "content": "Meringue on a stick is a great alternative to store-bought candy. You only need four ingredients to make this dessert. The result is a budget-friendly treat that your kids will love to eat. The idea of making a sweet meringue on a stick for children was published on the Instagram page of food blogger Daria with the nickname recepti_dariko . Ingredients: Method of preparation: 1. Whisk the whites at room temperature until foam appears (1.5 minutes), continue whisking, add vanilla sugar, then regular sugar gradually a tablespoon at a time. Beat until a dense, stable foam and sugar dissolves for 10-15 minutes (it may not dissolve even after 20 minutes of beating, nothing bad will happen, just the meringue will float). At the end, add lemon juice to make the mass whiter, and beat for another minute. 2. Transfer the whipped whites to a pastry bag (if not, you can use a spoon). Make droplets on the parchment, insert halves of bamboo sticks (you can use whole ones), and drop the meringue into them. 3. Bake in a well-heated oven to 80-100 degrees for 1-1.5 hours. Then leave to cool. A few cooking tips 1. Low temperature and dry air are important for meringues, so do not wash the oven immediately before baking meringues (to avoid moisture). 2. If your oven does not hold low temperatures well, you can bake part of the time with the door slightly open, and you can turn the gas on and off. The main rule is that they should dry themselves.",

        "content": "Polecamy Radosław Nawrot Nieduże afrykańskie państwo Dżibuti, leżące nad Morzem Czerwonym, znalazło się w dramatycznej sytuacji w walce z komarami i malarią. Władze poprosiły o pomoc firmę biotechnologiczną Oxitec, która opracowała zmodyfikowane genetycznie komary. Owady są już w przyrodzie. Zostały wypuszczone jako koń trojański, który ma załamać populację komara roznoszącego chorobę. Ten komar to Anopheles stephensi, jeden z widliszków, których ciała stają się wektorami zarodźców malarii. Gatunek ten pochodzi z Azji, ale opanował północno-wschodnią i wschodnią Afrykę. Podobnym komarem jest chociażby widliszek plamoskrzydły, spotykany raczej w zachodniej części Afryki, a także kilkadziesiąt innych gatunków tych muchówek. Przenoszą one zarodźce malarii, powodujące rozwój tej niebezpiecznej choroby . Poruszenie u sąsiadów Polski. To nie jest ani lis, ani wilk Afrykański kraj zmaga się z groźnymi komarami W Dżibuti sytuacja malaryczna stała się bardzo trudna. Jeszcze w poprzedniej dekadzie ten nieduży kraj nie należał do państw Afryki zagrożonych poważnie chorobą. Ona rozwijała się głównie w tropikalnej Afryce. Jak podaje WHO, w 2012 r. Dżibuti miało zaledwie 27 przypadków malarii na swoim terytorium. Teraz to ponad 70 tys. chorych , zatem wzrost iście kosmiczny. I na ten wzrost władze Dżibuti postanowiły zareagować. Pomaga im firma biotechnologiczna Oxitec, która jest finansowana przez rodzinę Billa Gatesa . Od 2019 r. zajmuje się modyfikowaniem genetycznym komarów. Już wypuszczała je testowo w Brazylii, Panamie, Indiach i na Kajmanach. Według amerykańskiego Centrum Kontroli i Zapobiegania Chorobom (CDC) z obiecującym powodzeniem. Oxitec pracuje na komarach z rodzaju Anopheles, w tym Anopheles stephensi. Gray Frandsen, dyrektor generalny firmy Oxitec, opisuje go na łamach CNN jako owada niezwykle groźnego . Wymyka się bowiem konwencjonalnym środkom, nie reaguje na chemiczne odstraszacze i na dodatek żeruje także w ciągu dnia, nawet bardzo upalnego. To pozwala mu ominąć moskitiery nad posłaniami. Stąd decyzja zdesperowanego kraju, by sięgnąć po technologie genetyczne. Są one w fazie testowej, ale mogą pomóc. Minister zdrowia Dżibuti Ahmed Robleh Abdilleh powiada, że nigdy Afryka tak nie wierzyła w genetykę jak teraz, w obliczu małego, brzęczącego zagrożenia . Zmodyfikowane genetycznie komary. Samice bez szans Modyfikacja genetyczna tych owadów sprowadza się do tego, że do zwalczania komarów używa się... komarów . Oxitec zmienia kod genetyczny zwierząt. Dzięki niemu wyprodukowane samce komarów wyszukują samic, łączą się z nimi w pary i normalnie rozmnażają. Ze złożonych jaj wykluwają się zarówno osobniki męskie, jak i żeńskie. Genetyczny fortel polega na tym, że wyklute samice nie dożywają dorosłości . Giną, a tylko osobniki żeńskie wysysają krew. Jest im ona potrzebna do produkcji jaj w swoim ciele. Samce komarów, także tak groźnych jak widliszki, to ważne w przyrodzie zapylacze roślin. Jedzą tylko nektar i soki roślinne, krew ich nie interesuje. Komary znikają. To wcale nie jest dobra wiadomość Początkowo firma Oxitec produkowała genetycznie zmodyfikowane komary, które tworzyły pary z samicami, ale nie mogły dać potomstwa. Takie owady testowano np. w 2018 r. w Burkina Faso. Nowa wersja tych zwierząt jest w pełni płodna. Gray Frandsen powiedział w BBC, że jego firma wypuściła już w Afryce, Indiach i Ameryce ok. miliarda zmodyfikowanych genetycznie komarów. Skutków ubocznych nie zauważono . Raport WHO z 2023 r. mówi, że 70 proc. przypadków malarii notowanych jest w dziesięciu krajach Afryki. To Burkina Faso, Kamerun, Demokratyczna Republika Kongo, Ghana, Mali, Mozambik, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda i Tanzania oraz jedenastym z Azji, którym są Indie. Strefą poważnie zagrożoną malarią jest też Papua-Nowa Gwinea. Kamerun jest pierwszym krajem na świecie, który od stycznia stosuje u siebie szczepienia przeciw zarodźcowi malarii. Jak mówi Wilfred Fon Mbacham, profesor biotechnologii i zarazem członek jeden z kameruńskich rodów królewskich: \" Całe życie modliłem się o rozwiązanie problemu malarii dla Afryki \". Środek miał pomóc rolnikom. Straciliśmy niewyobrażalną liczbę ptaków Co w trawie piszczy? One mieszkają przy naszym domu. Rozpoznasz? [QUIZ] Polecamy Najnowsze",

        "content": "Portuguese forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has boasted that he doesn’t follow records, but records follow him, after he broke the record for the most goals in a Saudi Pro League season when he struck for the 34th and 35th time in Al Nassr’s final game of the campaign . “I don’t follow the records, the records follow me,” Ronaldo, 39, tweeted afterward. The former Real Madrid and Manchester United star struck in first-half stoppage time and again in the 69th minute with a header as Al Nassr defeated Al Ittihad 4-2 at home on Monday. The previous record for most goals in a single season was the 34 scored by the Moroccan Abderrazak Hamdallah in 2018-19. Al Nassr were already assured of a second-placed finish, coming a distant 14 points behind champions Al Hilal. Ronaldo joined Riyadh-based Al Nassr in December 2022, the start of an influx of overseas players to the Saudi league on lucrative contracts. Ronaldo, who led Portugal to victory at the 2016 Euros, has been selected for the squad for this year’s edition in Germany next month — his 11th international tournament. He is the most capped player in men’s international football with 206 appearances and has scored a record 128 goals, according to AFP report.",

        "content": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ode-Aye Ward 1 of Okitipupa local government area of Ondo State has decided to suspend Folake Omogoroye, a female governorship aspirant in the recent primary election held on April 20, 2024. Naija News reports that Omogoroye joins the ranks of former governorship aspirants who have faced similar disciplinary measures within the party, following the suspension of Ondo South Senator, Jimoh Ibrahim. Four party ward executives, namely Ayesan Tunde, the Organizing Secretary; Jemiken Seyi, Assistant Public Relations Officer; Adebayo Omobayo, Assistant Welfare Secretary; and Eweje Omotayo, Assistant Treasurer, are among those suspended by the party alongside Omogoroye. The decision to suspend Omogoroye was communicated through a letter signed by the APC Chairman in the ward, Akinsowola Awodele, with the support of twelve other executive members. It was shared with the press on Monday evening in the state. The party noted that Omogoroye was suspended for “anti-party activities and flagrant disobedience for the constituted authority of the party”. The female candidate for governor, who claimed there were irregularities in the party, had filed a lawsuit to request the annulment of the party’s governorship primary election, which resulted in Governor Lucky Aiyedatiwa being chosen as the candidate. LP Sacks Edo Exco, Appoints 17-Man Caretaker Committee Meanwhile, the Labour Party (LP) has intervened in the ongoing crisis within its Edo State chapter by dismissing the state executive led by Kelly Ogaloi. In response to the escalating internal disputes, the party’s national leadership, under Julius Abure, has appointed a 17-man caretaker committee headed by former state House of Assembly Speaker, Elizabeth Ativie. This decisive action comes after a contentious period marked by Julius Abure’s suspension by party leaders from Arue-Uromi in Esan North-East Local Government Area on charges of highhandedness and anti-party activities. The suspension, announced on May 25, 2024, followed a formal notification dated May 14 and ratified on May 15, which was subsequently approved by the state executive committee in Benin. Despite these local manoeuvres, the Labour Party’s national body refuted the legitimacy of the suspension, affirming Abure’s continuing role as the national chairman. To stabilize the situation, the national party inaugurated the new caretaker committee in a ceremony led by Deputy National Chairman Dr. Ayo Olorunfemi. During the oath-taking event, Dr Olorunfemi clarified that the restructuring was necessitated by the expiration of the Ogaloi-led executive’s tenure in April. He expressed confidence in Ativie’s capabilities, citing her “result-oriented track record” as instrumental for her appointment as the state chairman. He urged unity and assured that the caretaker committee would lead the party effectively until a new executive is elected in upcoming state congresses. The change in leadership has garnered support from various party members, including Hon. Esosa Iyawe of Oredo Federal Constituency and Osaro Omoruyi of Egor/Ikpoba Okha Federal Constituency. Both emphasized the importance of unity and strong leadership ahead of the September state governorship elections. They also expressed their support for Olumide Akpata as the gubernatorial candidate. In her acceptance speech, Ativie committed to elevating the party’s status in the state and pledged to reconcile all factions within the party to ensure a united front in upcoming electoral challenges.",

        "content": "Manchester United star Marcus Rashford has stated he will leave social media temporarily this summer. Rashford has promised to 'reset mentally' after a hard season with United where he has struggled to replicate his previous form. The England international ended the campaign with eight goals in all competitions, a dramatic decrease on the 30 he netted last year. It saw the Red Devils star lose his spot in the England squad with Gareth Southgate leaving him out of his 33-man provisional squad - even though he featured in the promo . After confessing that it was not his best campaign, Rashford indicated that he would be stepping away from social. He wrote on X: “It’s time to come off socials for a few weeks. \"I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. “Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t, just remember at United, we always stick together.” Rashford has already had to make a response after receiving torrents of online abuse, insisting 'enough is enough'. His last appearance this season saw him help United to the FA Cup as they beat Manchester City 2-1 with goals from Kobbie Mainoo and Alejandro Garnacho. At full-time, Rashford appeared to be in tears and it sparked speculation that he might be leaving in the summer . The Red Devils finished eighth this season in the Premier League - their lowest-ever finish in the competition. There are question marks over whether Erik ten Hag will be sacked or not with Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel linked with the job. However, the Dutchman came out fighting for his job after winning the FA Cup, while Rashford was not the only one to make an emotional plea. Anthony Martial will leave Old Trafford after nine years at the club when his contract expires at the end of next month. In a statement on Instagram, he said: “It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion.”",

        "content": "An 84-year-old gran who turned 'scam hunter' after ditching her Egyptian toyboy has been sent a bomb threat from an online conman. Iris Jones married then dumped Mohamed Ibrahim, 37, and says he left her thousands of out of pocket . She now sets out to expose fraudsters trying to fool women on dating sites and went public with her scam-hunting in a Facebook . Iris, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, has now revealed one online trickster has since threatened to send a bomb to her home. She said: \"His name was David he claimed to be in the American air force, working in Yemen - but his messages didn't sound American. It wasn't 'hi honey', or anything like that, when I asked him what his favourite food was I expected him to say hamburger, or hotdogs or popcorn - but it was rice! \"He asked me to send him $3,500 and I asked him how do I send it over? Just to tease him - I like to taunt them now. I called him something I can't share online - and then he said 'give me your location, I'm going to bomb you - not a love bomb this time, a real bomb. Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress Iris when she was married to Mohamed Ahmed Ibriham ( Image: Iris Jones) \"There must be a conveyer belt in these places where there are all these scammers and gold diggers who have all these women lined up and they pass you from pillar to post. They don't think of your as a person - you're just a name.\" Iris has shared some insights into what to look out for when you're approached by someone on the internet. She added: \"Usually they send a very handsome picture of themselves, often working on an oil rig or in another country or in the army. These pictures are not them - they are are pictures of genuine men and I think some of them know they are being used. Also, a lot of the time they want to come off Facebook, or the dating app or Facebook dating site and then want to go onto WhatsApp because 'it is more private'. \"That is a red flag! I am on scam alert and I would recommend it for people too as they tell you what to look out for. Then there is the love bombing - after a couple of days of messaging they tell you they love you, and they are narcissists. Often they use broken English - and they always ask you 'how was your day, how was your night, what have you had to eat, how's the family. When they ask you to send money they will always tell you to keep it a secret and not go to the bank.\"",

Quelle: Jean-Francois Badias/AP/dpa Die Tui-Stiftung untersucht in ihrer Jugendstudie jährlich die Stimmung junger Leute vor dem Hintergrund des aktuellen Weltgeschehens: Viele junge Menschen fühlen sich politisch nicht repräsentiert. Das drängendste Problem auf EU-Ebene ist für die Jugendlichen derweil nicht mehr der Klimawandel. Grundsätzlich stehen viele junge Europäerinnen und Europäer der EU positiv gegenüber. Mehr als die Hälfte der Befragten findet, dass die Mitgliedschaft ihres Landes in der EU „eine gute Sache“ ist. 39 Prozent wünschen sich engere Verbindungen zwischen den EU-Ländern. Europa-Radar Was in Brüssel passiert und Europa bewegt: Unser RND-Korrespondent liefert EU-Insights und Hintergründe – immer donnerstags. Mit meiner Anmeldung zum Newsletter stimme ich der zu. Während 68 Prozent allerdings nationale Wahlen für (eher) wichtig halten, sagen dies nur 58 Prozent über die Europawahl. Besonders besorgniserregend: Nur knapp über die Hälfte der Befragten (56 Prozent) – in Deutschland 72 Prozent – glauben, dass die Wahlen in ihrem Land (eher) korrekt und fair abgehalten werden. Elke Hlawatschek Geschäftsführerin der Tui-Stiftung Diese Skepsis gegenüber politischen Institutionen zeigt sich auch darin, dass sich nur 17 Prozent der Befragten durch das Europaparlament stark oder sehr stark vertreten fühlen. Auch auf nationaler Ebene sind es nur 17 Prozent, in Deutschland 23 Prozent. „Es besteht eine kritische Repräsentationslücke. Die bedroht die Legitimität der EU bei denjenigen, die doch ihre Zukunft sind. Deshalb bleiben Information und Aufklärung in und außerhalb der Schulen weiterhin ein wichtiges Element politischer Bildungsarbeit“, sagt Elke Hlawatschek, Geschäftsführerin der Tui-Stiftung. Verändert hat sich die Wahrnehmung der europäischen Jugendlichen, welches Problem auf EU-Ebene am drängendsten ist. Das Thema Migration und Asyl ist 36 Prozent der Befragten am wichtigsten, in Deutschland sind es sogar 46 Prozent. Umwelt- und Klimaschutz rücken im Vergleich zu 2023 damit im Problembewusstsein auf Platz zwei mit 26 Prozent - in Deutschland 33 Prozent. Wie in den Vorjahren blicken junge Menschen aus Europa weiterhin negativ in ihre persönliche Zukunft. Ein Drittel (34 Prozent) ist (eher) pessimistisch eingestellt. Deutschland bleibt im Vergleich zum Vorjahr stabil, 56 Prozent der Befragten sind eher optimistisch und optimistisch. Mehr zum Thema „Die Vielzahl an nationalen und globalen Krisen belastet und verunsichert junge Erwachsene in Europa nach wie vor. Eine sichere Zukunft und das Wohlstandsversprechen demokratischer Gesellschaften sind nicht selbstverständlich“, sagt der Politikwissenschaftler Thorsten Faas von der Freien Universität Berlin, der die Studie begleitet hat. „Die Zukunftserwartung ist gedämpft, wird aber insgesamt nicht schlechter, sondern stabilisiert sich in diesem Jahr auf niedrigem Niveau.“",

Nel Rapporto sono stati utilizzati indicatori definiti dal Sistema Informativo Nazionale Dipendenze (SIND), monitorando le quattro tipologie di dipendenza della cui prevenzione, diagnosi, cura e reinserimento si occupano i Ser.D.: tossicodipendenza , dipendenza da alcol , disturbo da gioco d’azzardo e tabagismo . L’andamento annuo degli utenti totali in carico ai Ser.D. in Basilicata nel triennio considerato evidenzia un numero di pazienti nel 2021 pari a 2.244, un considerevole incremento nel 2022, pari a 2.351 ed un ulteriore significativo aumento nel 2023 con 2.495 pazienti. Tra le tipologie di dipendenza patologica degli utenti dei Ser.D. lucani prevale la tossicodipendenza . Nel 2023 gli utenti con una diagnosi di tossicodipendenza sono stati 1.852, seguiti da quelli con una diagnosi di alcoldipendenza, 488 pazienti, di disturbo da gioco d’azzardo, 155, di tabagismo, 25. La componente maschile in carico ai Ser.D. prevale nettamente su quella femminile ed il suo andamento è in linea con quello dell’utenza totale. Nel dettaglio ci sono stati 2.046 utenti maschi nel 2021, 2.131 utenti nel 2022 e 2.263 utenti nel 2023. Anche la componente femminile ha fatto registrare un incremento nel triennio, seppure meno accentuato rispetto a quella maschile: 198 pazienti nel 2021, 220 nel 2022 e 232 nel 2023. L’ età media degli utenti tossicodipendenti è inferiore rispetto alle altre tipologie di utenza, pur attestandosi su valori abbastanza elevati, ovvero 40,8 nel 2021, 38,3 nel 2022 e 40,3 nel 2023. L’utenza con tossicodipendenza si colloca in una fascia d’età abbastanza elevata nonostante il primo approccio alle sostanze avvenga perlopiù in età adolescenziale e ciò può essere spiegato con l’alto numero di utenti in carico ai Ser.D. da molti anni oltre che dall’età media molto alta dei nuovi utenti. Gli alcolisti hanno un’età media molto più elevata compresa tra i 48,9 anni del 2022 ed i 50,2 del 2023; per quanto riguarda i giocatori d’azzardo l’età media è compresa tra 43,2 anni del 2021 e 44,4 del 2023. I tabagisti , invece, costituiscono la tipologia di utenti con l’età media più elevata , anche se in diminuzione nel triennio: da 52,8 del 2021 a 50,5 del 2023. L’età media dei nuovi utenti tossicodipendenti diminuisce leggermente nel triennio considerato, passando da 35,8 anni del 2021 a 35,4 del 2023, valore comunque elevato rispetto al primo approccio alle sostanze che solitamente avviene in età adolescenziale. Gli alcolisti invece si rivolgono ai Ser.D. in età più avanzata, che nel triennio considerato passa da 45,7 anni del 2021 a 49,3 del 2023) e ciò si spiega con la maggiore sostenibilità nel tempo di questo tipo di dipendenza, dovuta soprattutto allo status legale dell’alcol. Particolarmente elevata è l’età media dei nuovi utenti tabagisti nel 2021 (59,2 anni) con una forte flessione nel 2022 (47,1) ed un aumento nel 2023 (49,2). I nuovi utenti giocatori d’azzardo hanno un’età media meno elevata compresa tra 40,5 anni del 2021 e 42,5 del 2023. L’eroina è la sostanza d’abuso primaria nettamente prevalente tra gli utenti totali anche se l’andamento nel triennio è decrescente: 80,4% nel 2021, 76,70% nel 2022 e 75,40% nel 2023. La diffusione della cocaina come sostanza primaria subisce un incremento percentuale tra il 2021 (10,70%) ed il 2022 (12,20%) ed una leggera diminuzione nel 2023 (11,60%). La percentuale di assuntori di cannabinoidi come sostanza primaria fa registrare un costante incremento passando dal 6,30% del 2021 al 6,40% del 2022 ed al 7,60% del 2023. Per quanto riguarda le altre sostanze, il cui peso è sempre stato esiguo, nel triennio si assiste ad una contrazione della percentuale di assuntori che passa dal 2,6% del 2021, all’ 1,65% del 2022 ed all’1,60% nel 2023. Perciò, come si evince dal Rapporto, si può affermare che la dipendenza da eroina, trattata farmacologicamente nei Ser.D., continua a caratterizzare fortemente il profilo dell’utenza dei servizi, anche se la percentuale degli utenti che la assumono diminuisce nel triennio considerato. Tra i nuovi utenti assoluti, invece, il quadro del consumo di sostanze cambia notevolmente, tanto che l’eroina, pur rimanendo la sostanza d’abuso primaria prevalente, subisce un forte decremento tra il 2021 ed il 2023. Tra chi si rivolge per la prima volta al Ser.D. cresce percentualmente l’uso della cocaina e dei cannabinoidi quali sostanze che determinano la richiesta di cura al servizio (questo si deve intendere per “sostanza d’abuso primario”). Per tali sostanze non esiste attualmente un farmaco sostitutivo che ne consenta il trattamento terapeutico, a differenza dell’eroina. Ciò richiede pertanto un approccio di cura e di trattamento specifico. La Regione Basilicata, inoltre, si è dotata nel 2014 di una apposita legge per la prevenzione, la riduzione del rischio e il contrasto della dipendenza dal gioco d’azzardo patologico (GAP) nonché per la cura e la riabilitazione delle persone affette da tale patologia. Nel triennio 2021-2023 il numero totale degli utenti con disturbo da gioco d’azzardo in carico ai Ser.D. è cresciuto costantemente. Tale tendenza è meno significativa rispetto ai nuovi utenti assoluti. Il loro numero dopo essere aumentato tra il 2021 ed il 2022 si è stabilizzato nel 2023. La serie storica 2021-2023 degli utenti con disturbo da gioco d’azzardo patologico presi in carico dai Ser.D. mostra una crescita costante: si passa da 97 individui nel 2021 a 155 nel 2023 con un incremento percentuale pari al 59,8%. Anche per i nuovi utenti assoluti a partire dal 2022 c’è stato un incremento degli accessi ai Ser.D.: da 28 individui del 2021 a 42 nel 2022, con una successiva stabilizzazione del dato nel 2023. Pertanto l’incremento nel 2023 del numero totale degli utenti è dovuto alla maggiore durata del trattamento terapeutico degli utenti già in carico nell’anno precedente. Il Rapporto si è avvalso per la stesura di un gruppo di lavoro composto dal dottor Vincenzo Pernetti, referente Sistema Informativo Regionale Dipendenze – Regione Basilicata, dal dottor Giulio Pica, dirigente sociologo – Ser.D. Potenza e dal dottor Natale Pepe, dirigente sociologo – Ser.D. Matera, con la supervisione del dottor Pietro Fundone, dirigente medico, direttore D.S.M. e responsabile SER.D Melfi, e della dottoressa Lucia D’Ambrosio, direttore U.O.C. Ser.D. – Servizio Dipendenze Patologiche provincia di Matera. Clicca QUI per consultare il Rapporto integrale.",

The music icon shared: \"If the universe took me tomorrow, which hopefully it won't, but if it did, I couldn't really complain.\" Paul has been sober for the last 14 years, and he admits that it's transformed his life. He explained: \"A lot of the demons I thought were there just disappeared once I stopped drinking. So perhaps they were all in that bottle. All imagined. A little safety blanket.\" Paul still relishes the experience of performing live. However, the veteran star doesn't doesn't really enjoy arena gigs. He explained: \"It's a night out for a lot of people, isn't it? Their one big night out. And that's when it becomes a show, not about the music. It's really hard to make contact and I'm not cut out for that. It's not like I'm crowd surfing or putting the mic up for the crowd to sing lalala and all that.\" Paul has performed at various festivals over the years. But the 'Soul Wandering' hitmaker would never attend a festival as a fan. He said: \"I've only been at festivals when they pay me. \"They wouldn't entice me otherwise. Stand in a field of mud and s*** for hours, off my face? Doesn't appeal to me. Call me old-fashioned. I just like a roof on it.\"",

Sabato scorso era stato notificato a un giffonese un divieto d’avvicinamento, con annesso allontanamento dalla casa familiare e applicazione del braccialetto elettronico, per fatti risalenti a gennaio scorso, quando avrebbe cercato di cavare gli occhi alla moglie, provando a strangolarla: in quel caso fu l’intervento repentino della figlia a scongiurare il peggio.",

Contact Stephen.Gibbs@mailonline.com By Stephen Gibbs for Daily Mail Australia Published: 10:16, 28 May 2024 | Updated: 10:27, 28 May 2024 e-mail 2 View comments EXCLUSIVE Legions of Parramatta Eels fans might nostalgically recall James Hardie as the NRL club's major sponsor during its most successful football era in the 1980s. But for many thousands of Australians, the name of the company that for 70 years manufactured lethal asbestos products represents 'corporate bastardry'. Parramatta announced last Thursday that James Hardie would return to the front of its team jerseys as major sponsor next season for the first time in three decades. The club's previous association with the building materials producer ran from 1981 to 1995 and included first grade premierships in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986. The new four-year partnership between the Eels and James Hardie is meant to rekindle memories of Ray Price, Mick Cronin and Peter Sterling during the club's glory days. Parramatta has signed a four-year deal with James Hardie Industries which will put the building material manufacturer back on the front of its jerseys. Ray Price (centre) and Mick Cronin are pictured with then prime minister Bob Hawke after winning the 1986 grand final James Hardie was Australia's largest manufacturer of materials containing asbestos which causes fatal lung diseases including mesothelioma. A social media user has superimposed the face of asbestos disease victim's campaigner Bernie Banton onto a Parramatta jumper Other old Parramatta greats were hauled out to hail the deal as a major boon for the people of greater western Sydney . 'It's fantastic,' said Steve Edge, who captained the Eels to three consecutive grand final victories. 'We were a James Hardie family in the old days and it was just terrific. 'You'd win a comp and the James Hardie truck would be at the leagues club... It just meant so much to the community.' For Barry Robson, president of the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia, seeing Parramatta join forces once more with James Hardie is devastating. 'It's bloody disgraceful,' Mr Robson told Daily Mail Australia. 'People are just shaking their heads. They're just up in arms about it. 'The strangest thing is that Parramatta club members have been victims of Hardie's products - that's the bloody irony of it. 'They've killed some of their bloody supporters.' Parramatta's previous association with James Hardie ran from 1981 to 1995 and included first-grade premierships in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1986. The 1986 premiership team is pictured Since last week's announcement, Mr Robson has been inundated with calls and social media messages from victims of James Hardie products and their families. 'There's 4,000 Australians die each year from asbestos-related disease,' he said. 'Seeing it coming back, seeing James Hardie on the footballers' jumpers again, it's just a trigger that brings back bad memories. 'I fought these bastards for ten years, ten long bloody years. This company, it's the worst example of corporate bastardry.' The decision to welcome James Hardie back to Parramatta has been met with mixed reactions by supporters on social media. 'Now I will have a real reason to buy a new jersey!' one user wrote on the club's X account, with others saying 'Loving the nostalgia!' and 'Lets hope it lifts the curse off Parra and restore the 80s glory'. Parramatta announced last Thursday that James Hardie would return to the front of its team jerseys next season for the first time in three decades (pictured) Those comments were countered by posts such as, 'Was there not a company that kills puppies you could find to sponsor us?', 'Didn't 1000s die of asbestosis because of them?' and 'A breath fresh air. Asbest as it gets'. From the 1950s, James Hardie was Australia's largest manufacturer and distributor of building products, insulation, pipes and brake linings containing asbestos. For decades it was known exposure to asbestos fibres could cause mesothelioma and lung cancer as well as asbestosis and other lung diseases. James Hardie ceased all production of asbestos products in 1987 but continued to resist recognising it was responsible for compensating victims. The company finally acknowledged its liability for asbestos-related disease among its workers in 2001 by establishing a compensation fund with a one-off contribution of $293million. When that fund ran out in 2003, the company - which had moved offshore - refused to provide more money to victims. A public campaign against James Hardie resulted in then NSW premier Bob Carr ordering a judicial inquiry which in 2004 began assessing how much compensation would be needed. Among the social media responses to Parramatta's sponsorship deal with James Hardie was this comment: 'Was there not a company that kills puppies you could find to sponsor us?' That inquiry heard James Hardie had set up a holding company in The Netherlands and severed ties with Australian subsidiaries which had asbestos liabilities. Momentum shifted after father-of-five Bernie Banton, who was diagnosed with asbestosis in 1999, became the public face of the fight against the company. Mr Banton had been a lathe operator working with asbestos from 1968 to 1974 in a James Hardie plant near Parramatta at Camelia. He became known for his television appearances with an oxygen tank by his side and tubes running into his nose as he spoke passionately in front of the cameras. The inquiry found James Hardie had grossly underestimated its future liabilities to asbestos victims which could total $2.2billion. An agreement was reached in 2007 which required James Hardie to make annual contributions to the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund, subject to a cap of 35 per cent of its cashflow. That arrangement, which was estimated to result in total payments of $4.5billion over 40 years, continues. The late Bernie Banton, who worked for James Hardie from 1968 to 1974, became the public face of the fight for compensation against the company. Mr Banton is pictured with wife Karen Mr Robson said the country's second-largest producer of asbestos products, CSR, had acted honourably and stuck to handshake deal on compensation payments made the same year. 'Hardies are going back to the 1980s all right,' he said. 'They pulled the same PR stunt back then when they knew that all these claims were coming. 'They're at it again and we're still having problems with Hardies paying victims.' James Hardie Industries now has its headquarters in Dublin and is listed on both the Australian and New York stock exchanges with its management team in Chicago. Earlier this month it announced record annual sales of $5.85billion and a record adjusted net income of about $1billion. Parramatta CEO Jim Sarantinos told Daily Mail Australia that the club had done its due diligence before entering into the deal with James Hardie. 'We gave careful consideration to the legacy health issues associated with certain James Hardie building products historically,' Mr Sarantinos said. 'This included extensive discussions with the current James Hardie executive team to understand the company's acknowledgement of those historical issues and their commitment to doing the right thing.' That commitment extended to funding all compensation claims as well as asbestos education and medical research, and 'making a positive impact on the Parramatta and broader Western Sydney community into the future'. James Hardie was Australia's largest manufacturer and distributor of building products, insulation, pipes and brake linings containing asbestos. Eels legend Ray Price is pictured Adele Gordon, James Hardie's local head of marketing, said the company needed to remain a 'healthy and thriving business' to continue funding compensation claims. 'We recognise and acknowledge our history, part of which includes the use of asbestos in the building materials products manufactured by James Hardie's former subsidiaries until the mid-1980s,' Ms Gordon said. 'The use of asbestos in the manufacture of James Hardie products ceased in the mid-1980s and James Hardie products continue to be asbestos-free. 'We are committed to do the right thing and have paid approximately $2.2billion to fund compensation payments and asbestos education and medical research. 'To the best of our understanding, no proven compensation claim against James Hardie (or its former subsidiaries) has gone unpaid.' Australians including home renovators continue to be diagnosed with lung diseases after relatively recent exposure to James Hardie products which contained asbestos. Five years ago, an Adelaide father-of-three with terminal cancer was awarded $3,077,187 - the largest compensation payment to an asbestos victim in Australia. Parramatta CEO Jim Sarantinos said before entering into the deal with James Hardie the club had done its due diligence. Mr Sarantinos (left) is pictured with James Hardie CEO Aaron Erter Matthew Werfel received the record amount after James Hardie was found to have failed to warn the public about ongoing risks posed by their former products. Mr Werfel had first been exposed to asbestos dust while working for a fencing contractor as a teenager and then later while renovating his home in the mid 2000s. He was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2017 and sued James Hardie subsidiary Amaca in the South Australian Supreme Court. Read More EXCLUSIVE Westfield Bondi Junction: Rebel pulls Kangaroos jerseys from sale after Joel Cauchi killed six in stabbing spree Judge Leonie Farrell found 'there can be no doubt' that by the time Mr Werfel was exposed to asbestos Amaca knew the risks presented to renovators by its building products. 'Amaca breached its duty of care to a large class of Australians, of which Mr Werfel was a member,' Judge Farrell said a scathing August 2019 judgement. 'The magnitude of the risk of members of this class contracting mesothelioma was vast. The consequences of the risk were the deaths of many Australians. The probability of the risk occurring was certain.' James Hardie appealed against that decision and had Mr Werfel's compensation reduced to $2.23million. It then unsuccessfully sought leave to appeal again to the High Court. Mr Banton was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his services as an advocate for asbestos victims in 2005. He was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma in August 2007 and died aged 61 two months later, a year after he had been given the keys to Parramatta City.

        "content": "1. The monastery was founded by St. Sergius of Radonezh It is not by chance that the monastery is called ‘Sergius Trinity Lavra’. It was founded by Sergius of Radonezh, a monk who lived in the 14th century and, later, became one of Russia’s main saints. While still very young, Sergius chose the path of a hermit and, together with his older brother Stephen, settled in a remote forest, where he built a small hut and a chapel in honor of the Holy Trinity. St. Sergius blessing Soon, Stephen left Sergius. The hagiography of the saint tells how demons frightened Sergius while he lived alone in the small hut in the middle of the forest. But, through prayer and strength of spirit, he overcame the fear. The miraculous monk, who had defeated the evil power, became famous and rumors about him spread. So, other monks began to flock to the monastery, as well as ordinary people, seeking comfort and hope in the midst of the horror of the Tatar-Mongol invasion. The date of the foundation of the monastery is considered to be 1342. Historian Vasily Klyuchevsky believes that Sergius contributed to the beginning of the moral and political revival of the Russian people. After the fragmentation of Russia and centuries of Tatar-Mongol domination, it was Sergius and his monastery that became the center of spiritual unification of the country. 2. Played an important role in the political & military life of the country Sergei Miloradovich. “Defense of St. Sergius Trinity Lavra against the Poles in 1610,” 1894 Because of the regular invasions of the Mongols, entire Russian cities and principalities were plundered, burned and laid in ruins. Moscow Prince Dmitry Donskoy was the first who had the courage to finally fight back the enemy and gathered an army, uniting with other Russian princes. And he went to Sergius for support. The abbot blessed the prince and even sent two of his warrior monks, Peresvet and Oslyabya, to the ‘Battle of Kulikovo’. The victory of the Russian army in this 1380 battle marked the beginning of the liberation of Russia from foreign domination and the unification of the Russian lands under the rule of Moscow. After that, the St. Sergius Monastery was not once in the epicenter of historical events. During the reign of Ivan the Terrible (who was baptized in this monastery), mighty walls were built around the cloister and it became a fortress to protect Moscow from the approaches of the Kazan Khanate. In the early 17th century, during the ‘Time of Troubles’, the monastery was under siege for more than a year, surrounded by the troops of Polish invaders and the impostor False Dmitry. The monastery invested a lot of money to support the militia of Minin and Pozharsky in the struggle for Russian independence. In the late 17th century, Peter the Great sheltered there from political opponents. Under Elizabeth Petrovna in the 18th century, several new churches in the Baroque style were built there. Now, they complement the ensemble of the main Holy Trinity Cathedral of the 15th century and later buildings. Panorama of St. Sergius Lavra: Assumption Cathedral with blue domes, the 18th-century bell tower, and the Church of St. Sergius with the refectory in the foreground Also, the empress granted the monastery the status of a ‘lavra’, that is, the most important spiritual center, a monastery with special significance. Today, there are only two lavras in Russia (the other one is in St. Petersburg and you read about it here ). 3. There was a fundamentally new type of monastic dormitory A priest pictured in front of the Lavra in Sergiev Posad Previously, monks had wandered around Russia and lived mainly on alms (money or food given to poor people). But, Sergius changed this habitual way of life for the first time. He forbade his monks to leave the monastery; they worked and fed themselves and if there was nothing to eat, they prayed even harder for the sending of “daily bread”. When new monks arrived at the monastery, Sergius took them under his wing, taught them good morals and watched each one carefully, so that they prayed diligently and did not fall prey to the temptations of worldly life. Everyone had a strict daily schedule; everyone, including Sergius himself, worked tirelessly - they built churches, cooked food, chopped wood and sewed clothes and fully provided for themselves. At the same time, Sergius fostered a real brotherhood, which showed the laity an example of Christian fellowship. Since the 15th century, Sergius has been honored in Russia as a Venerable saint for his monastic asceticism; that is, as a monk who strove to be like Jesus Christ through prayer, fasting and labor. Now, Sergius is honored as a saint not only by Orthodox Christians, but also by the Old Believers and Catholics. In addition, the Moscow Theological Academy is located within the walls of the lavra and seminarians still live there. 4. The main Russian icon, Andrei Rublev's ‘ Trinity ’ , was born t here Andrei Rublev. The Holy Trinity, 1422-1427 The first chapel of the future monastery was dedicated to the Holy Trinity and, later, the monastery was named in honor of the Trinity. In the first half of the 15th century, the second hegumen (the equivalent of an abbot) of the monastery and disciple of Sergius asked famous iconographer Andrei Rublev to paint an image of the Holy Trinity. His icon, painted between 1422 and 1427, became the most important church relic and a masterpiece of Russian religious art. Rublev was the first who managed to formulate in artistic language the most important Orthodox postulate about the divine trinity. The icon, measuring 141.5 x 114 centimeters, became one of the main sacred objects of the monastery (in addition to the relics of Sergius) and was located on the iconostasis of the Trinity Cathedral. In 1929, Soviet authorities transferred the icon to the Tretyakov Gallery, where it was kept in special conditions for many years, while a copy was later made for the monastery. But, in 2023, by decree of the President of the Russian Federation, the icon was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. Now, it is temporarily housed in the Cathedral of Christ the Savior; however, on the feast of the Trinity on June 23, 2024, it will be moved to the St. Sergius Trinity Lavra. 5. During Soviet times , it was a “showcase” of the Russian Orthodox Church Lavra's Assumption Cathedral, 1971 Many churches and monasteries were closed and destroyed in the Soviet times, but the St. Sergius Trinity Lavra was not so badly affected. None of the ancient buildings were seriously damaged. In 1919, the monks were dissolved and the monastery was closed, many church valuables from precious metals were seized and melted down, including the largest working tsar bell at that time (it was restored in the 2000s). But, Soviet authorities realized that the monastery had a significant historical value. Within its walls, a historical and architectural museum opened almost immediately. Throughout the whole of the 20th century, it was besieged with restorations. Fittingly, a restoration school was also opened in the St. Sergius Trinity Lavra. In the 1940s, Stalin softened his position on the church, defacto rehabilitating Orthodoxy in the USSR somewhat. And monastic life was revived in the St. Sergius Trinity Lavra, with the first hegumen becoming Patriarch Alexy I. The St. Sergius Trinity Lavra soon became a kind of showcase of Orthodoxy for foreigners in the USSR. All delegations and tourists were taken there to have a look at all the \"exotics\". And, although services were resumed, the life of the monastery was completely under the control of the Soviet authorities. Only in the 1990s did the monastery return under the Church's jurisdiction and it's still very much a spiritual center and an important place for all Orthodox Christians.

        "content": "CORNING—On Tuesday, The City Council will discuss replacing the flooring in their council chambers and the City Hall kitchen. Due to damage over time, city staff recognized the need to replace the flooring in both areas. They requested bid proposals from five local flooring companies to perform the work. On May 22, no responsive bids were received for removing and replacing the existing carpet and vinyl flooring. Under the municipal code, staff elected to adopt the California Uniform Construction Cost Accounting Policies and Procedures Manual, of which Section 22038 states that: “If no bids are received through the formal or informal procedure, the project may be performed by the employees of the public agency by force account or negotiated contract without further complying with this article.” Since no bids were received, staff say they contacted the Corning Carpet Store to see if they were interested in the proposed work and obtain a bid proposal to complete it. Corning Carpet Store provided a proposal of $12,433.03 to complete the proposed work, which involves removing existing carpet and sheet vinyl and installing carpet tiles and commercial sheet vinyl. Staff recommends the council award Corning Carpet the contract for the flooring replacement and allow City Manager Brant Mesker to execute the Contract and Change Orders not to exceed 10 percent of the overall contract price. The council will consider renewing City Attorney Collin Bogener for several more years. Bognener has been providing his services to the city since June 2018. The proposed contract consists of a monthly compensation cost of $6,000, monthly administrative expenses of $40, a litigation fee of $150 per hour, reimbursement of lodging, meals, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred during travel on city business as authorized and continuing education classes/events. Staff recommend the council renew Bognener’s contract Tuesday’s meeting will be in person at 6:30 p.m. in City Council Chambers, 794 Third St. Meetings are free and open to the public.",

        "content": "ZURIGO (awp/ats) - Non è più St. Moritz la destinazione turistica più costosa dell'arco alpino, per chi vuole diventare proprietario immobiliare: nel primo trimestre 2024 un'abitazione secondaria di fascia superiore nella località grigionese costava circa 21'200 franchi al metro quadro, valore superato da Verbier (VS), che è la nuova numero uno, con 21'500 franchi. Al terzo posto si classifica Zermatt (VS), dove occorre spendere 19'900 franchi, rivela uno studio periodico pubblicato oggi da UBS. Seguono poi Gstaad (BE), Andermatt (UR), Flims/Laax (GR) e Kitzbühel (A), primo comune straniero. In media nelle destinazioni svizzere prese in considerazione - nessuna delle quali ticinese - i prezzi sono aumentati di poco meno del 4% su base annua. La progressione è quindi in calo, dopo aver raggiunto l'8% nel 2022 e il 6% nel 2023. Arosa ha registrato l'incremento di costo più elevato, pari al 18%. Guardando alle regioni, nei Grigioni i prezzi sono saliti maggiormente, quasi del 6%, mentre la dinamica è stata più debole nell'Oberland bernese, dove si è pagato lo stesso che nell'anno precedente. Dalla fine del 2019 gli appartamenti di vacanze nelle Alpi elvetiche hanno visto il loro valore crescere di quasi il 30% cumulativamente, sulla scia della generale forte domanda di persone che volevano trascorrere le ferie in destinazioni montane nazionali, in tempi fra l'altro caratterizzati da Covid e restrizioni di viaggio. Anche il tasso medio di occupazione dei letti d'albergo si è rapidamente ripreso dopo la pandemia e i prezzi di alloggio risultano superiori di circa un terzo rispetto a prima del 2020. Stando agli esperti di UBS gli hotel pieni sono importanti, perché sostengono il valore degli appartamenti e aumentano la disponibilità a pagare per le proprie quattro mura in montagna. Questo perché l'opzione di poter trascorrere una vacanza in una destinazione top in qualsiasi momento, anche durante l'alta stagione, sta diventando sempre più preziosa. A seguito della forte domanda di immobili degli ultimi anni, il mercato si è prosciugato, il che rappresenta un fattore importante per sostenere il livello dei prezzi. Molti appartamenti di vacanza non sono nemmeno più pubblicizzati, ma offerti direttamente ai potenziali acquirenti dalle agenzie immobiliari. Secondo gli specialisti della banca guidata da Sergio Ermotti per il momento non si prevede che l'attività di costruzione possa dare grande impulso allo sviluppo dell'offerta. È però probabile che un'ulteriore disponibilità derivi dalla conversione delle prime case esistenti: UBS stima che un appartamento precedentemente utilizzato come residenza primaria possa essere venduto con un sovrapprezzo di circa il 20% se viene messo sul mercato come seconda casa. Anche la conversione di hotel non redditizi o la creazione di appartamenti turistici gestiti contribuiscono ad aumentare l'offerta. Il contesto generale potrebbe però presentarsi poco spumeggiante, perlomeno nell'immediato. \"Al momento molti elementi suggeriscono che l'attuale boom dei prezzi non continuerà\", afferma Maciej Skoczek, economista di UBS e autore principale dello studio, citato in un comunicato. \"Il rallentamento congiunturale ridurrà la domanda di seconde case: i potenziali acquirenti probabilmente esamineranno i prezzi richiesti in modo più critico\". Nel caso degli immobili esistenti, la vendita viene presa in considerazione con maggiore frequenza a causa dell'aumento dei costi di utilizzo, anche al fine di realizzare i guadagni di prezzo degli ultimi anni. Data la scarsità dell'offerta, si prevede che i prezzi sul mercato delle seconde case ristagnino quest'anno. A medio termine, l'andamento dei prezzi dipenderà molto dalle preferenze degli acquirenti. Secondo UBS comunque anche tre anni dopo la pandemia le seconde case appaiono in voga. La generazione dei baby boomer, in particolare, potrebbe mantenere elevata la domanda nelle regioni montane ancora per qualche anno. Si tratta di persone che dispongono di un capitale e di un reddito sufficienti, oltre che di tempo, per acquistare una residenza per la pensione, soprattutto nelle regioni con aliquote fiscali più interessanti. Almeno nelle località di fama internazionale anche la domanda dall'estero rimarrà forte e meno sensibile ai prezzi, in quanto gli immobili elvetici sono considerati un investimento sicuro e interessante nonostante il franco forte, concludono gli analisti dell'istituto.

        "content": "Borussia Dortmund face Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday and both teams have some big decisions to make. Dortmund will be eyeing glory in their first appearance in this fixture since 2013 while Los Blancos aim to win their 15th European title at Wembley. Edin Terzic and Carlo Ancelotti are preparing their sides for the final and the managers will be deciding on the best way to approach to the game. It could see some changes to their teams and here, talkSPORT.com takes a look at how both teams could line up for the showpiece ... Dortmund named the exact same team for both legs of their semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain and it paid off for them. Terzic could stick with that line-up with only Ramy Bensebaini and Sebastian Haller unavailable for the trip to Wembley. However, his latest Bundesliga selection could hint at the team for the final. In goal, Gregor Kobel will keep his place while a back four of Julian Ryerson, Mats Hummels , Nico Schlotterbeck and Ian Maatsen will start. Maatsen will be playing his final game for the club before his loan from Chelsea expires this summer. Former Liverpool midfielder Emre Can will likely be at the base of the midfield alongside Marcel Sabitzer who has had an impressive season. Next to them could be Julian Brandt and a final bow may be handed to Marco Reus . He started for Dortmund in the last game against Darmstadt, scoring, assisting and potentially proving he’s ready to start again. Reus will leave the German side after this game, so it would be a perfect send-off if he were to start and win the Champions League for his side. On the wing, Jadon Sancho will start in what could be his last game for the club too while Karim Adeyemi takes his place in the left flank and Niclas Fullkrug leads the line. As for Real, they will likely make a couple of changes from their semi-final win over Bayern in the showpiece. One of them could be enforced with Aurelien Tchouameni a doubt through injury while the other is expected to come in goal. Andriy Lunin has been impressive between the sticks for Real this season with Thibaut Courtois missing out on a large chunk of the campaign. However, Courtois could be preferred as the starting goalkeeper for the final with Ancelotti still undecided on who will play. In defence, Dani Carvajal , Antonio Rudiger, Nacho and Ferland Mendy should start. In front of them will be Toni Kroos who will play the final game of his domestic football career, eyeing another Champions League trophy to go out on a high. If Tchouameni misses out, Eduardo Camavinga will likely take his place and join Federico Valverde in midfield. Jude Bellingham will sit ahead of them while Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior lead the line. Joselu came off the bench to score the winner in the semi-final and he will be ready to do the same if needed at Wembley this weekend.",

        "content": "Bambu Productions Overview I've covered some other Collateralized Loan Obligation funds here, but they've usually had a focus on below investment grade credit quality in order to provide double-digit yields. Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF ( NYSEARCA: JAAA ) takes a different approach by providing exposure to the CLO space while simultaneously offering exposure to these debt instruments that have a majority of focus on triple-A rated quality. The primary objective of JAAA is to provide high-quality CLO exposure and to deliver risk-adjusted returns that are comparable to traditional fixed income assets while having a lower level of volatility. Something very notable here is that this level of CLO exposure was not possible for retail investors until the creation of this fund. We can see how the price has remained relatively stable while the total return profile soared to new heights once interest rates began to increase. JAAA's CLO exposure is floating rate debt and can pull in higher levels of net investment income as a result. While this has a positive effect with rates rising, the opposite would play out if rates were to decrease over time. I fear that the train has already left the station and the best chance for entry was already missed as interest rates are expected to now decrease in the near future. Data by YCharts The current dividend yield is about 6.3% and the main appeal of JAAA is the high level of dividend income that it can provide. This is an asset that is best utilized by income-focused investors that may be nearing or at retirement age and depend on the income generated from their portfolio of investments. If you are looking for some level of price growth, JAAA is probably not the fund for you. JAAA is a newer fund with an inception in 2020. The net annual expense ratio of JAAA sits at a very reasonable 0.21%. With the exception of 2022, the price of JAAA has remained relatively stable and within the same consistent price range. The dip during 2022 may be linked to the fact that interest rates were aggressively hiked during the mid-point of that year. However, the price has moved back up since then and still presents an attractive opportunity for entry. CLOs are an interesting asset class that tends to be perceived as more risky than they actually are. CLOs fared quite well through most of the uncertain times in recent history, such as the Covid fall and the global financial crisis. Risk Profile & Portfolio For some brief context, CLOs are an asset class that pools together different collections of loans and labels them each into different tranches at different levels of risk. CLOs are typically designed to provide higher returns than bond alternatives. When it comes to collateralized loan obligations, they typically have a reputation of containing below investment grade holdings within. This is how they are able to produce such a high yield most of the time, as higher risk can result in higher rewards for investors. However, that is not the case for JAAA as the majority of the holdings within are rated AAA, the highest credit rating possible. Janus Henderson Despite popular belief, CLOs above a BBB rating rarely go through defaults. S&P Global analyzed the default rates for 2022 and 2023 and discovered that the average default rate was only 1.3% for 2023. We can also see that most of the defaults happen within the 'below investment grade' range, where the credit quality is rated BB+ and below. Since over 95% of the debt within JAAA is rated AAA, we don't have to worry about there being a large possibility of defaults within this ETF. We can see that the default rate increased from 0.5% in 2022, up to 1.3% in 2023. However, it seems that the rate of upgrades is greater than the rate of downgrades here year over year. S&P Global Additionally, the debt investments within JAAA are mostly made up of floating rate loans. This focus on floating rate debt means that as interest rates rise, so does the interest income that JAAA can collect from borrowers. Even though higher interest rates can translate to higher income, it can also put additional stress on borrowers as their obligated debt payments rise. If the business is not performing as expected, these debt payments can become troublesome and cause defaults. Taking a look at the 2023 annual report , we can see that net investment income for the year was $3.16 per share, which fully covered the distribution of $2.84 per share. We can see that net realized gains also totaled $1.02 per share, which helped the fund's NAV grow year over year. JAAA 2023 Annual Report The fund's assets sit around a value of $9.8B and remain highly diversified across industries. This focus around diversity also helps mitigate any sort of concentration risk or vulnerability to one specific sector or industry, thereby decreasing the risk of defaults. There are currently 367 individual holdings within the ETF. We can see that the breakdown includes a majority focused on service-based businesses, amounting to 13.75% of the fund. This is followed by high-tech industries at 10.75% and healthcare and pharma making up 9.96%. JAAA Factsheet This level of diversity if further built upon on an individual holding basis, as none of the top holdings account for a weighting of more than 1.5%. JAAA Factsheet Dividend As of the latest declared monthly dividend of $0.2743 per share, the current dividend yield is 6.3%. The monthly aspect of the dividend is what makes this such a great tool to be utilized for income investors nearing or at retirement age. If you depend on the income generated from your portfolio, JAAA would be a great option to ride out the higher interest rate environment. This is due to the floating rate exposure within JAAA. As interest rates rise, JAAA is able to pass along the higher interest income along to shareholders with increases to the dividend. The dividend has raised by a whopping CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 112% over the last three-year period. For reference, the dividend throughout Q1 of 2021 was about $0.0521 per share and since grown by over 5x this to the current $0.2743. While the higher rates have definitely been a benefit to JAAA, the opposite would be true if rates start to come back down from these highs. Firms like Morgan Stanley believe that interest rate cuts may happen as soon as September of this year. However, other estimates see rates remaining unchanged for the year, since inflation still remains higher than expected and the labor market remains strong. I personally think that the days of near-zero rates are behind us, and we are likely to remain in a higher interest rate environment. Even if rates do happen at the end of the year, I believe that they will likely be very light and may reduce the dividend by a bit. Janus Henderson One thing that should be considered is that the dividends received from JAAA are not tax-friendly. These distributions have historically been entirely classified as ordinary income, which is taxed at higher rates. Ordinary income has much less favorable tax treatment compared to qualified dividends received, and should be considered if you are depending on this income to fund your lifestyle expenses. Therefore, JAAA may be best utilized when held in a tax-advantaged account such as an IRA. Interest Rates - Valuation & Vulnerability It's no coincidence that the distributions began to massively increase around the same time that interest rate hikes begin. JAAA's price initially retracted when rates started to rise, but then ultimately rose to new heights as they were able to pull in higher amounts of net investment income through higher interest payments. Since the inception of this fund is so short, we don't really have a set of historical data to reference in a decreasing rate environment. Data by YCharts With this in mind, I believe the train had already left the station and the best time for entry was already missed. As rates increased, investors started looking for ways to benefit from this move. Look at how quickly the assets under management started to rise here alongside the rise of interest rates. I do not expect the Fed to continue raising rates here, so I believe the best time for entry was over a year ago when rates initially started to get hiked. Data by YCharts While the price range is admittedly small, I still believe that the best way to take advantage of these sorts of funds is to get the best entry price as possible. I stay cautious of recommending to start a position at this current level because you'd essentially be entering at all-time highs while there looms the possibility of dividend cuts as a result of lower interest rates. This would be a double negative and because of the short history here, it's difficult to determine exactly how much the dividend may get cut. Takeaway JAAA has greatly benefited from the rise of interest rates, but I fear that the train has already left the station here. I do not expect further interest rate increases that can propel the dividend higher. Even though we are likely to remain in a higher interest rate environment due to higher level of inflation and a strong labor market, there's still the possibility that interest rate cuts ultimately reduce the dividend and share price. Since the credit quality within this ETF focuses on the top quality debt, the risk profile here is quite attractive with a low level of historical defaults. While the monthly dividend can be highly appealing to investors that are specifically focusing on income generation, a fund like JAAA should probably not be utilized by an investor looking to capture the total return of price appreciation.

        "content": "A new food and drink spot is proving 'really popular' with passengers travelling through Dublin Airport since its opening. Phoenix Lane is the latest food and drinks outlet to open at the airport's south gates, offering holidaymakers and visitors alike hot breakfasts, draught beer and Guinness, coffee and salads. This is just one of the many new places to open at the airport, with 23 new and improved bars, cafes and restaurants to open over the course of the year. These will include big names such as Supermacs, Papa Johns, Pret A Manger and Insomnia Coffee. When the 23 new food and beverage places are established, it will bring the total number of outlets to 42. “Passengers will soon be able to enjoy everything from Italian, Asian and Mexican outlets through to loved local favourites and up-and-coming Irish brands,” said Vincent Harrison, chief commercial and development officer at daa, the operator of Dublin Airport. The news of a revamped food hall throughout terminals 1 and 2 of the airport came at the beginning of the year, with more than half of the new units expected to be opened by June.",

The pier has a handful of slot machines and a pub overlooking the beach. The Great Orme Tramway is also a popular pastime for visitors, which takes passengers to the tall limestone headland. There is also a cable car. “It’s a beautiful place to live,” says Helen Parkes, 37, who moved here two years ago from London with her husband and three children. “We sometimes say it’s like a holiday that never ends.

        "content": "Hiába időzítették az Egyesült Államokban egy nemzeti ünnepre az új Mad Max film megjelenését, ez nem sokat segített a végeredményen. A Furiosa: Történet a Mad Maxból című mozi súlyos vérszegénységgel küzdött a debütálásakor. A Memorial Day ünnepi hétvégéjén négy nap alatt mindössze 31 millió dollárt – mintegy 11 milliárd forintot – hozott, ami nem sok jóval kecsegtet a Warner Borthers számára, tekintve, hogy az alkotás gyártási költségei egészen 168 millió dollárig (59 milliárd forint) rúgnak. A nemzetközi piacon sem robbant nagyobbat a film. A Variety beszámolója szerint további 75 régióból is mindössze 33 millió dollárt szerzett a hétvégén, így világszerte nagyjából 60 millió dollár bevételről beszélhetünk. Kiadási oldalon ehhez még hozzájönnek a sajtókörutak és a plusz reklámköltségek – köztük a kiutazás a Cannes-i fesztiválra –, ami még inkább tragikus képet fest a Mad Max-film helyzetéről. Történt ez annak ellenére, hogy mind a szakmai, mind a közönségértékelés elég magas a filmnél. A Rotten Tomatoes oldalán cikkünk megjelenésekor mindkét tétel 90 százalékon áll – az Indexen megjelent kritika is 8 pontot adott rá a 10-ből. Három évtizede nem volt ilyen Az sem mentette meg a filmet, hogy komoly alkotói gárdával dolgozott. A címszerepet az elmúlt években egyre nagyobb népszerűségnek örvendő színésznő, Anya Taylor-Joy alakította, akit olyan filmekben láthattunk többek közt, mint A vezércsel , a Széttörve , vagy az Utolsó éjszaka a Sohóban . Mellette a Thor-filmek sztárja, Chris Hemsworth látható a vásznon. A rendezői székben a Mad Max-filmek legendás alkotója, George Miller foglalt helyet. A szakértők szerint a probléma sokrétű, aminek egyik oka, hogy olyan színészekkel kellett eljátszatni a filmet, akik nem voltak részei az eredeti, legendás franchise-nak, de még csak nem is játszottak korábban Mad Max filmekben. Hasonlóra volt már példa több, a Disney égisze alatt született Star Wars alkotásnál ha csak a Han Solo-filmet nézzük – minden minőségi vitát félretéve. De még akkor sem könnyű az eredeti filmek bevételét hozni, ha egy új alkotásnál jól állnak a csillagok. A legfrissebb Éhezők viadala-film, amiben már nem Jennifer Lawrence játszott, több mint 300 millió dolláros bevételével noha jócskán behozta 100 milliós költségeit, meg sem közelíti az eredeti, 2012-es film majd 700 millió dolláros sikerét. Mindennek ellenére a Warner Borthers nem húzott a film gyártási költségein, így a majd 170 milliós kiadás, plusz a reklámköltségek nagy vállalásnak számítanak, amit az eddigi számok alapján úgy tűnik, nem biztos, hogy képes lesz behozni a film. A történet pikantériája, hogy a Furiosa egy hétvégén debütált az új Garfield-filmmel, amit szintén nem sikerült lenyomnia. Mindkét alkotás 31 millió dollárt hozott be a nyitó, ünnepi hétvégén, csak míg a The Garfield Movie 60 millió dollárból készült, és a nemzetközi bevételekkel már most behozta gyártási költségeit, a Mad Max-film még küzd ezzel. A Variety információi szerint az elmúlt mintegy harminc évben nem volt ilyen alacsony a Memorial Day hétvégéjén a mozik bevétele, amin minden friss alkotás keményen elhasalt. Mindazonáltal a szakemberek bizakodnak abban, hogy a nyári bluckbuster filmek már az elvárt bevételeket hozzák a kasszáknál, de némi aggodalom még mindig van a levegőben.

        "content": "Amid reports of pork being sold at P420 per kilo, the Department of Agriculture said that more affordable options are available and appealed to traders not to take advantage of the recent typhoon. DA Undersecretary D.V. Savellano visited several supermarkets on Tuesday to check the prices of chicken and pork. He found that kasim (pork shoulder) was being sold at P263 per kilo to as much as P380 per kilo, while liempo (pork belly) retailed at P345 per kilo, but the earlier reports were affirmed by its price reaching as high as P420 per kilo. Chicken was selling at P160 per kilo. \"Available, affordable and accessible,\" Savellano said. North Star Meat Merchants, which supplies meat to hundreds of stores nationwide, said it is able to provide cheaper products thanks to its familiarity with the industry and the use of technology. \"We know when and how to order po our stocks,\" said North Star president Anthony Ng. \"Hindi tayo sasabay sa mga [We don't go with] price fluctuations ng local at imported na meat. Being in a retail-centric setting, kailangan day in, day out available ang stocks [stocks must be available day in, day out]. Aided by technology po 'yan and experience natin [We are aided by technology and our experience].\" Savellano also appealed to traders not to take advantage of Typhoon Aghon's effect on agricultural products to raise prices. \"Pakiusap namin, huwag naman mag-take advantage sa situation, especially ngayon sinabi kanina may bagyo na nagyari sa Quezon. Baka may mag take advantage, huwag naman.\" (We are asking them not to take advantage of the situation, especially now that we're hearing about a storm in Quezon. Some might want to take advantage.

Despite making appeals on social media and in local newspapers, Lisa and other residents were unable to locate Penny's owners. Lisa said: “Nobody came forward for her and we knew we needed to capture her for her own safety.” Penny then moved to the Ollerton area, where Lisa and Cheryl Martins, the founder of Mansfield Wildlife Rescue, worked together to safeguard the much-loved bird. Advertisement Advertisement Lisa said they achieved this by monitoring Penny's behaviour and realising that she was lonely, which led to a “lightbulb moment”. “We noticed Penny was looking for a mate as she often looked at herself in the reflection of windows,” she explained. Lisa then used a mirror and a dog cage to capture Penny, before taking her to the Pleasley-based centre. The founder of the Beauty’s Legacy said that her experience with animals such as horses, dogs, and cats had helped her catch Penny, even though working with birds was new for her.

Upon Penny’s arrival at the rescue centre, Penny quickly formed a bond with resident peacock Peter, who was also in need of a mate. Now, Penny and Peter are a “match made in heaven”, according to Lisa and Cheryl. A fundraising page launched earlier this year – – for the wildlife charity to raise funds to save its site.

        "content": "Funds to be deployed to expand presence across Indian & global markets Indya raises INR 50 Crore funding led by Mrs Sangita Jindal: High Street Essentials (HSE), the parent company of renowned women’s fashion brands Indya and FabAlley, has raised INR 50 Crore in equity and debt infusion. The funding round was led by Mrs Sangita Jindal, Chairperson of JSW Foundation with participation from esteemed family offices of SRF Group, Krishna Bodanapu of Cyient Technologies and Timmy Sarna from Pure Home + Living. This fund infusion enables Indya to undertake strategic business expansion of its premium occasion wear range “Weddings By Indya” and chart a growth roadmap for a significant play in the occasion and wedding wear market. “ Weddings By Indya ” is a curated collection catering to the discerning tastes of India’s vibrant wedding segment and offers meticulously crafted ensembles for various ceremonies. Indya is democratizing luxury fashion through strategic collaborations with well-known Indian designers including Rohit Gandhi + Rahul Khanna, Varun Bahl, Ashish N Soni, Nikhil Thampi, and these partnerships bring designer elegance to fashion enthusiasts at high street prices. Commenting on her investment in Indya brand, Mrs Sangita Jindal, Chairperson of JSW Foundation said, “Indya’s core strength lies in their unique designs that cater to the Indian as well as global diaspora. Shivani & Anurag have built strong back-end capabilities and this investment will empower them to fuel Indya’s global expansion while allowing them to take a larger share of the vast Indian wedding wear market. Beyond the investment, we are both committed to take India’s heritage textile artistry to the global markets.” The India wedding wear market is valued at US$ 15 billion. In order to capitalize on the growing wedding wear segment, Indya has plans to expand its business presence across the country with 10 new wedding stores in this financial year. Indya is currently retailed through 12 exclusive brand outlets in 8 cities, and 150 large format retail outlets, including Lifestyle, Shoppers Stop, Centro and Ethnicity. Its global retail footprint continues to expand with a second store in Malaysia with plans to also open outlets in USA and South Africa within the next 18 months. However, Indya’s largest volumes come from its international direct-to-consumer ecommerce business spanning more than 43 countries. With over 1.5 million customers globally, this business segment has posted a 50% year-on-year growth. Shivani Poddar and Anurag Murali, the co-founders of HSE, commented, “We see an immense opportunity to build a strong presence for Wedding By Indya in the US$15 Billion wedding wear market, a large part of which is still unorganized. Backed by the unwavering support of our investors like Mrs Sangita Jindal, we are poised to aggressively expand, and build the biggest and most loved brand in the wedding wear industry.” High Street Essentials posted EBITDA profitability in April 2024 and brand Indya has been growing at more than 30% YoY. In FY25, the company has set an aggressive target of achieving 50% YoY growth, while being PAT positive. The key growth driver will continue to be the international ecommerce business. Indya will be expanding to new geographies while investing in on-ground brand & marketing initiatives. The other big leg of growth will come from Indya’s large wedding stores. Over the next few years, Indya plans to open 100+ wedding stores across the country. For more than 30 years, Mrs Sangita Jindal and JSW Group have built symbiotic relationships between women entrepreneurs and traditional craft communities. Mrs Sangita Jindal’s team at JSW reaches out to thousands of woman artisans enabling them to develop meaningful collaborations and interventions for making their crafts contemporary. Beyond this investment, Indya also offers a strategic opportunity to collaborate with these artisans for sourcing & integrating India’s heritage designs in luxury wedding ensembles. Mrs Sangita Jindal along with Shivani Poddar & Anurag Murali are committed to take India’s heritage textile artistry to global markets. Indya was advised in this fundraise by Lighthouse Canton.",

        "description": "Ronan posted about a ‘challenge ahead’.",
        "content": "Ronan Keating has worried fans as he shares a cryptic message about his wife and her ‘challenge ahead’. Ronan, 47, has been married to his wife Storm, 42, since 2015 after the couple met on The X Factor Australia in 2010. The pair share two children , a son named Cooper Archer Keating, seven, and a daughter named Coco Knox Keating, four. The pair frequently share life updates about their family and insights into their busy lives with their two youngsters. In a recent post, the Life is a Rollercoaster singer worried fans as he spoke about his wife being a ‘warrior’. Ronan shared a photograph of his arm tattoo which showed a warrior with long hair carrying a sword. The caption of the post read: ‘For you my warrior today and every day. My Stormy. A challenge ahead but your strength blows my mind. With you every step. Love you baby.’ Fans were immediately concerned by this post and rushed to the comments to send their support to the singer and his wife. @Tasha46757 commented: ‘Hope stormy is ok.’ Another fan,@Tracy27kelly said: ‘Hope Storm is ok, love the tattoo. Sending lots of love and positive prayers ❤️xxxx’ A more inquisitive fan, @Lucyclarkitsme asked: ‘I’m missing the story here, could someone fill in the blanks please 🙏🏻’ It’s unclear exactly what the Australian television producer is currently going through and she has yet to give any updates to her followers. This weekend the star revealed that she cancelled work in order to spend more time with her children. A caption on social media read: ‘One of those days when you spontaneously decide not to rush back to the office and instead, clear the afternoon so you can detour to the playground ☀️🍦💛.’ Doting dad Ant McPartlin pushes newborn son in pram on stroll with wife Anne-Marie Corbett Anne Robinson, 79, confirms romance with Queen's ex-husband, 84, in stern seven words Cannes security guard in Kelly Rowland clash has another red carpet argument Kate Beckinsale shares harrowing four-word response to 'too thin' weight concerns The image showed her children looking delighted as they ate ice cream in the park and sat on the grass with their mother. In previous years, the star had surgery on her spine and fought Cauda Equina Syndrome , where the nerves at the bottom of the spine become compressed and cause serious problems and even paralysis if not treated. At the time this occurred in 2021, she called the ordeal the ‘most frightening week of her life’ and said: ‘I’m very lucky but I wouldn’t wish what I’ve been through on anyone.’ She also said that she wanted to be transparent on social media: ‘We share our highs on Insta but sometimes it’s good to share our lows too,’ suggesting she is likely to share more health updates in the future.

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email As you carefully put on a shimmering gold necklace around your neck, picture how classy and elegant you will feel. It is the perfect way to dress up any outfit and make a statement. Gold necklaces are classic pieces of jewelry that are beautiful and hold sentimental value. However, picking the right one requires a lot of thought. In this article, you will delve into six essential things to consider when selecting the perfect gold necklace for yourself or a loved one. 1. Understanding Gold Karats Gold jewelry is often categorized by its purity, measured in karats (k). Pure gold is 24 karats, but it’s too soft for everyday wear, so it’s often mixed with other metals to increase durability. Understanding gold karats helps you gauge the purity of the gold in the necklace. Common karat options include 18k, 14k, and 10k, with higher karats indicating higher purity and value. 2. Choosing the Right Design When buying a gold necklace, consider the design that best suits your style and preferences. Necklaces come in various styles, such as chains, pendants, chokers, or statement pieces. Choose a design that complements your wardrobe and reflects your personality. Pay attention to details like length, width, and texture to ensure the necklace fits your aesthetic and comfort preferences. 3. Evaluating Gold Color Options Gold necklaces come in different colors, including yellow, white, and rose gold. Each color is achieved by mixing gold with other metals like silver, copper, or palladium. Consider which gold color complements your skin tone and personal style. Yellow gold has a classic warmth, white gold offers a modern and sleek look, while rose gold exudes a romantic and feminine vibe. 4. Assessing Necklace Weight and Comfort The weight and comfort of a gold necklace are important factors to consider, especially if you plan to wear it regularly. Choose a necklace with a weight that feels comfortable around your neck without being too heavy or cumbersome. Pay attention to factors like chain thickness and pendant size, as these can affect the overall feel and wearability of the necklace. 5. Checking for Hallmarks and Certifications When buying a gold necklace, look for hallmarks and certifications that authenticate its quality and purity. Hallmarks are markings stamped on the necklace that indicate the metal’s purity and manufacturer’s mark. Additionally, certifications from reputable organizations like the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) assure the necklace’s authenticity and value. 6. Understanding Maintenance Requirements Gold necklaces require proper care and maintenance to preserve their beauty and shine over time. Understand the maintenance requirements of the necklace, such as cleaning methods and storage practices. Hard chemicals, extreme temperatures, or rough surfaces can damage the gold, so do not put the necklace near them. Regular cleaning and occasional professional inspections help maintain the necklace’s appearance and longevity. Have the Best Gold Necklace Today Armed with these essential considerations, you’re now ready to embark on your journey to find the perfect gold necklace. So, embrace the elegance and significance of a gold necklace, and enjoy the process of finding the one that resonates with your style and personality. Here’s to adorn yourself with the finest craftsmanship and timeless beauty of a gold necklace.

Hal itu merespons kenaikan uang kuliah tunggal (UKT). \"Justru kehebatan pemerintah itu adalah apabila menghadirkan pendidikan yang bagus dan terjangkau, murah,\" kata Cak Imin di Kompleks Parlemen, Senayan, Jakarta, Selasa, (28/5).

Russia-Taliban : रूस एक बड़ा फैसला लेने वाला है, कहा जा रहा है, कि रूस तालिबान को प्रतिबंधित आतंकी संगठनों की लिस्ट से हटाने वाला है. बता दें, कि रूस की स्टेट न्यूज एजेंसी RIA नोवोस्ती ने इसकी जानकारी दी है. रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, रूस के विदेश मंत्री सर्गेई लावरोव ने कहा कि कजाखिस्तान ने हाल ही में तालिबान को लेकर यह फैसला लिया है और हम भी जल्द ही इसे लागू करेंगे. साथ ही लावरोव ने कहा, कि तालिबान असली ताकत है. हम उनसे अलग नहीं हैं. सेंट्रल एशिया में हमारे सहयोगी भी उनसे अलग नहीं हैं. अफगानिस्तान पर तालिबान के कब्जे के 3 साल बाद रूस ने यह फैसला किया है. दरअसल, पिछले साल के अंत में कजाखिस्तान ने तालिबान को बैन किए गए आतंकी संगठनों की लिस्ट से हटा दिया था. बताया जा रहा है, कि रूस ने भी तालिबान पर तमाम पाबंदियों के बावजूद उससे अपने संबंध बनाए रखे हैं. हालांकि, उन्होंने अब तक तालिबान को अफगानिस्तान की सरकार के तौर पर मान्यता नहीं दी है. रूस ने तालिबान को सेंट पीटर्सबर्ग में होने वाले इंटरनेशनल इकोनॉमिक फोरम के लिए भी न्योता दिया है. यह इवेंट 5-8 जून को होगा. रूसी मीडिया TASS की रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, अफगानिस्तान ने रूस से तेल खरीदने की भी इच्छा जाहिर की है. पश्तो भाषा में तालिबान का अर्थ 'छात्र' होता है. इस संगठन की स्थापना साल 1994 में अफगानिस्तान के कंधार शहर में हुई थी. यह उन गुटों में से एक था जो सोवियत संघ की वापसी के बाद अफगानिसतान पर कब्जे के लिए गृह युद्ध लड़ रहा था. इसके सदस्य अफगानिस्तान के मुजाहिद्दीन लड़ाके थे, जिन्होंने 1989 में अमेरिका की मदद से सोवियत सेना को खदेड़ा था. तब दोनों पक्षों के बीच 9 साल तक जंग चली थी. 1999 में UNSC ने एक रिजॉल्यूशन अडॉप्ट किया था. इसमें कहा गया था तालिबान दुनियाभर के आतंकी संगठनों को पनाह देकर उन्हें प्रशिक्षण देने का काम करता है. इसके कुछ महीने बाद रूस के राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन ने एक प्रस्ताव पर हस्ताक्षर किए थे, जिसमें UN रिजॉल्यूशन को स्वीकार करते हुए तालिबान पर पाबंदियां लगाने की बात कही गई थी. इसके बाद साल 2003 में रूस की सुप्रीम कोर्ट तालिबान को आतंकी संगठन घोषित कर दिया था. रूस ने कहा था कि रूस के चेचन्या में तालिबान के अवैध संगठनों के साथ संबंध हैं. वह उज्बेकिस्तान, ताजिकिस्तान और किर्गिस्तान पर कब्जा करने की कोशिश कर रहा है. इसके बाद साल 2017 में रूस ने अफगानिस्तान की तत्कालीन सरकार और तालिबान के बीच समझौता कराने की कोशिश की थी, जिससे अफगानिस्तान में शांति आ सके. इस कोशिश में चीन, ईरान, पाकिस्तान समेत कई देशों ने रूस का साथ दिया था. लंबे समय तक चली बातचीत के बाद भी अफगान सरकार और तालिबान के बीच सहमति नहीं बन पाई थी. अमेरिकी सेना के साथ लंबे संघर्ष के बाद तालिबान ने 15 अगस्त 2021 को काबुल के साथ ही पूरे अफगानिस्तान पर कब्जा कर लिया था. इसके बाद से वो लगातार दुनिया से उसे मान्यता देने की मांग करता रहा है. तालिबान के कार्यकारी रक्षा मंत्री मुल्लाह मोहम्मद याकूब मुजाहिद ने अल-अरेबिया न्यूज चैनल को एक इंटरव्यू दिया था. इस दौरान उन्होंने कहा था- सरकार ने मान्यता हासिल करने के लिए सारी जरूरतों को पूरा किया है. इसके बावजूद अमेरिका के दबाव में आकर दूसरे देश हमें मान्यता नहीं दे रहे हैं. हम उन देशों से मान्यता की अपील करते हैं जो अमेरिका के दबाव में नहीं हैं. हम चाहते हैं कि दुनिया के ताकतवर इस्लामिक देश हमें सरकार के तौर पर पहचानें.",

        "content": "Girls Aloud’s huge arena tour across the UK and Ireland , which hits 12 cities in 30 days, is coming to Sheffield tonight (May 28). Along with the pop bangers that fans know and love, concert-goers tonight should expect some intense and emotional moments, too. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital Subscription to The Star, you can get unlimited access to the website including our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. Tributes to band member Sarah Harding, who passed away from breast cancer in 2021, aged 39, have been scattered throughout the shows. Her distinctive vocals singing words from The Promise, ‘here I am, walking Primrose , wondering when I’m gonna see you again’, paired with visuals of her on the screens, left bandmates Cheryl, Nadine Coyle, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh holding back tears when performing in her hometown of Manchester. They have not released any new music or filmed any music videos, but have opted to celebrate their rich back catalogue and groundbreaking success they achieved as a five. Sarah’s spirit has been prominent throughout the tour so far, not only in the intense and emotional moments, but in the exciting, lively and funny moments too. Advertisement Advertisement In a show on BBC Radio 2 on Monday (May 27), Kimberley Walsh said: “For me, I just love, I can see it in my mind whenever I want, seeing her perform Footloose on tour. “To me, it just epitomises everything about her that was just so electric and wild. And the way she moved, like everything! If I need to feel Sarah that's what I watch.” Sign up for our free newsletters today And lighthearted moments have been present in the shows, particularly when things are not quite going to plan - one wardrobe malfunction saw Cheryl’s dress fail to inflate with the rest of the band, and Nadine Coyle endured a lyric slip-up in their Dublin show. Mid-way through their cover of The Pointer Sister’s Jump, she appeared to be getting the lyrics wrong before singing in their place, “I’m singing the wrong words,” and laughing as she carried on with the performance. Advertisement Advertisement Here is everything we know about the emotional, exciting, and hopefully mistake-free performance that Sheffield fans should expect tonight. The tram maintenance works provide a bit of an obstacle to some concert-goers tonight. Instead of taking the tram from the city centre to the Arena stop, use the temporary Green service. It will operate from Sheffield Station to Meadowhall , and will take you directly to the Arena. Advertisement Advertisement Car parking tickets at the arena have sold out, but Meadowhall have agreed to let Girls Aloud fans park in their Blue and Green car parks until 12.30am on May 29. Meadowhall has direct access to the Arena tram stop via tram (seven minute journey from the Tinsley Tram Stop), or it is a 25 minute walk. More information on the specific tram disruptions can be found here . The timings, approximately, are as follows: Car park and box office: 4pm Doors open: 6pm DJ Mr Theo: 8pm Interval: 8:30pm Girls Aloud on stage: 8:45pm Curfew: 11pm For the shows so far, fans have documented the setlist as follows: Untouchable The Show Something New Love Machine Can’t Speak French Biology Whole Lotta History Wake Me Up Sound of the Underground Girl Overboard No Good Advice Graffiti My Soul Long Hot Summer I’ll Stand by You Sexy! No No No... On the Metro Jump (For My Love) Call the Shots Something Kinda Ooooh The Promise Yes - head over to Ticketmaster to grab last-minute tickets, some of which have been reduced in price.",

        "content": "DUA pekan periode keberangkatan asal Indonesia, maskapai masih mengalami masalah keterlambatan. Terkait hal tersebut, ( ) akan kembali melakukan evaluasi atas kinerja maskapai plat merah tersebut. Pemberangkatan jemaah haji sudah berlangsung sejak 12 Mei 2024. Sampai 26 Mei 2024, tercatat sudah ada 287 kelompok terbang (kloter) yang diberangkatkan ke Tanah Suci. Garuda Indonesia memberangkatkan 152 kloter, sementara Saudia Airlines 132 kloter. \"Sampai 26 Mei, kami melihat Garuda Indonesia masih sering mengalami keterlambatan. Dari 152 kloter, ada 60 kloter yang terlambat atau sekitar 39,47%,” terang Juru Bicara Kementerian Agama Anna Hasbie, Selasa (28/5). \"Sementara Saudia Airlines, dari 132 kloter, ada 16 kloter yang mengalami keterlambatan atau sekitar 11,85%,\" sambungnya. Keterlambatan paling parah, lanjut Anna, dialami oleh jemaah haji kloter 42 Embarkasi Solo (SOC-42) akibat adanya kerusakan mesin pesawat yang memberangkatkan jemaah SOC-41. Ini merupakan kloter terakhir dari Embarkasi Donohudan yang berangkat pada gelombang pertama, mendarat di Bandara Amir Muhammad bin Abdul Aziz (AMAA) Madinah. Keterlambatan SOC 42 juga berdampak pada perubahan jadwal SOC 43, bergeser hingga 17 jam dari rencana semula. \"Akibat mesin rusak Garuda Indonesia, SOC-42 terlambat hingga 7 jam 10 menit. Ini jelas sangat lama dan menjadikan jemaah makin kelelahan,” jelas Anna. Selain itu, ada 13 kloter dengan keterlambatan Garuda Indonesia pada kisaran satu sampai dua jam. Sementara yang di atas dua jam, ada tujuh kloter. \"Untuk Saudia Airlines, keterlambatan terlama dialami kloter pertama Embarkasi Jakarta-Bekasi atau JKS-01, sekitar 47 menit,” lanjutnya. Proses evaluasi atas ontime performance Garuda Indonesia dan Saudia Airlines akan terus dilakukan setiap pekan. Saat ini, tahap pemberangkatan jemaah memasuki musim puncak atau peak season. “Ini tentu menjadi tantangan bagi maskapai penerbangan. Kami minta Garuda Indonesia menyiapkan mitigasi menyeluruh agar problem keterlambatan penerbangan yang masih cukup besar bisa segera diselesaikan dan tidak berkelanjutan,” pinta Anna. Fase kedatangan jemaah haji gelombang kedua sudah berlangsung sejak 24 Mei 2024. Gelombang pertama sudah usai dengan 229 kloter dan 88.987 jemaah. Pada fase gelombang kedua, ada 325 kloter dengan jumlah jamaah lebih dari 124ribu. Pada penerbangan gelombang kedua, jemaah haji Indonesia dari berbagai embarkasi di Tanah Air akan mendapat di Bandara Internasional King Abdul Aziz Jeddah. Fase ini akan berlangsung hingga 10 Juni 2024. (Z-8)",

        "content": "\"От тази гледна точка някой ги рекламира тях. Трябва да са доволни, че някой безплатно им прави реклама\", категоричен е Денков Централната избирателна комисия (ЦИК) нареди агитационни билборди на ПП-ДБ да бъдат премахнати. Решението е взето снощи след жалба от страна на ГЕРБ-СДС за нарушение на Изборния кодекс (ИК). На спорните плакати има снимки на бившия премиер Николай Денков, както и на Бойко Борисов и Делян Пеевски, а посланието гласи \"Какъв искате да е вашият премиер?\". Решението, че те нарушават ИК е взето почти единодушно на заседание на ЦИК, като \"против\" е гласувал само Цветозар Томов, който е от квотата на ПП-ДБ. В жалбата на ГЕРБ-СДС се твърди, че в гр. София на бул. \"България\" и в гр. Пловдив на ул. \"Сава Муткуров\" са поставени агитационни материали, в които КП \"Продължаваме Промяната - Демократична България\" използват лика на председателя на ПП ГЕРБ и представляващ коалиция \"ГЕРБ-СДС\" Бойко Борисов без негово знание и съгласие, уронващо престижа и в нарушение на добрите нрави - деяние, представляващо нарушение на правилата на предизборната кампания. Към жалбата е приложен снимков материал, от който е видно, че на билбордове е поставен материал с номера в бюлетините в изборите за членове на Европейския парламент и за народни представители на КП \"ПП-ДБ\". На същия материал е изписан въпрос \"Какъв искате да бъде Вашият премиер\" и са поставени снимки на Николай Денков Денков - кандидат за народен представител от КП \"ПП-ДБ\", Бойко Борисов - кандидат за народен представител от КП \"ГЕРБ-СДС\" и Делян Пеевски - кандидат за народен представител от ПП \"ДПС\" в изборите на 9 юни 2024 г. \"Използването на лицата на други кандидати, предложени от други партии и коалиции за същия вид избор в един и същ агитационен материал - билборд, представлява призив за гласуване в подкрепа на кандидата на партията или коалицията от чието име се разпространява агитационния материал, съответно за неподкрепа за другите кандидати. Освен, че с описаното използване на агитационни материали се накърняват добрите нрави по смисъла на чл. 480, ал. 2 във връзка с чл. 183, ал. 4 ИК, е налице и призив за неподкрепа на кандидат по смисъла на §1 т.17 ИК\", пишат те. Централната избирателна комисия е приела, че изложеното в жалбата съдържа достатъчно данни за извършено нарушение на чл. 183, ал. 4 ИК, според която се забранява използването на агитационни материали, които накърняват добрите нрави, честта и доброто име на други кандидати. ЦИК установява нарушение по чл. 183, ал. 4 ИК, във вр. с § 1 т.17 ИК, извършено от Николай Денков Денков, кандидат за народен представител на КП \"Продължаваме Промяната - Демократична България\" в изборите за народни представители на 9 юни 2024 г., и възлага на областните управители на области с административни центрове гр. София и гр. Пловдив незабавно да премахнат съответните материали на териториите на двете области, съобщиха на сайта на институцията. Централната избирателна комисия също така оправомощава председателя си да състави акт за установеното нарушение на Денков. Днес сутринта бившият ротационен премиер също коментира казуса пред bTV: \"Аз не съм го поръчвал този плакат, вероятно е някой от партията, но по тази логика не бива да съм глобяван само аз, а и останалите от билборда. След тези избори по никакъв начин няма да бъдем в коалиция с Пеевски и Борисов. \"Борисов през последните седмици каза, че е единственият готов за премиер. Казва си, че иска да управлява с Пеевски. От тази гледна точка някой ги рекламира тях. Трябва да са доволни, че някой безплатно им прави реклама\", каза той в отговор на думи на Бойко Борисов от понеделник по повод билборда. \"Не виждам каква страна съм в тази дискусия. По същата логика трябва да съставят акт на Борисов и Пеевски. Техните лица също са там. Това е реклама за тримата\", допълни Денков. Снощи и съпредседателят на ПП Кирил Петков пусна спорния плакат в своя фейсбук профил и написа: \"След тези избори по никакъв начин няма да бъдем в коалиция с Пеевски и Борисов. За 9 месеца разбрахме, че тяхната визия и маниер на управление е коренно различна от нашата мечта за България. Средно положение няма! Аз направих своя избор, а какво избираш ти?\", пише dir.bg.",

        "content": "По ирония на съдбата тъкмо Вълчанова дава ценен урок на младата красавица, а покрай това и старт на кариерата й Сега вече става ясно защо Маги Вълчанова и Алекс Богданска бяха дълги години в лоши отношения. В основата на раздора им са стоели много пари! Носителката на титлата \"Мис Вселена България\" за 2000 г. преди години осъди благоевградската красавица за сумата от 10 000 лева, но към днешна дата двете май са подновили приятелството си, въпреки всичко. По ирония на съдбата тъкмо Вълчанова дава ценен урок на младата красавица, а покрай това и старт на кариерата й. Двете се срещат на конкурса \"Мис Национален отбор\". Вълчанова е организатор на събитието, а Богданска – една от трите победителки в състезанието през 2012 г. Този успех бил солиден тласък за благоевградчанката да сбъдне мечтата си да стане модел. БЛИЦ Скоро обаче тя осъзнала, че й е нужна по-голяма гръдна обиколка, за да е конкурентноспособна. Някои рокли и бански костюми го изисквали, така че за да има по-солиден шанс за договор с брандовете им, Алекс решила, че трябва да увеличи бюста си. Тъй като родителите й нямали възможност да я финансират, красавицата, която тогава още учела в УНСС, заминала да работи в Кипър. През нощта Алекс била сервитьорка в дискотека, а през деня ходела на кастинги за модели в кипърска агенция. Пестяла от всичко, дори от храна, за да събере нужната сума за силикон в гърдите, а именно 5000 евро. Богданска се снимала за два каталога за дрехи и участвала в ревю на дизайнер, което било на високо ниво. Красавицата обаче сгрешила, като преценила, че не е нужно да предупреди мениджърката си. Маги Вълчанова някак научила за страничните моделски ангажименти на Богданска и веднага предприела мерки. Малко след като благоевградчанката се върнала в България, щастлива и доволна, че има пари за силикон в гърдите, била неприятно изненадана. Съдия изпълнител цъфнал пред дома й с писмо, разказвала е моделката - покана за съд, инициирана от агенцията, представлявана от Маги Вълчанова. БЛИЦ Разтреперана и пребледняла, Александра научила, че ще бъде съдена за това, че имала моделски ангажименти и не е дала дължимия процент на мениджърката си, която държала правата й за цял свят в продължение на 6 години. Тогава Богданска вече не била талисман на баскетбола, за какъвто била избрана, вече имало нов, както и на футбола, и на волейбола. Само че договорът й все още не бил изтекъл. Манекенката плакала с дни, както и родителите й, защото трябва да плати неустойка с парите, изкарани за три месеца работа в Кипър. Това е голям урок за Богданска, която оттогава чете точка по точка всеки договор, преди да го подпише, и преговаря, без притеснение, за интересите си. Тя вече има опита и самочувствието да изисква да й се плаща според заслугите. Богданска загубила парите, изкарани за корекцията на бюста си, но пък с плащането на неустойката договорът й бил прекратен предсрочно. Тя продължила да работи като модел, като често участвала в различни холивудски продукции и реклами, снимани у нас. Така й потръгнало, че за кратък срок изкарала същата сума, която изгубила. Не след дълго, с течение на обстоятелствата, осъзнала, че започва да се специализира и в набиращата все още популярност нова професия – инфлуенсър. Парите за увеличаване на гърдите си пък Богданска спечелила в Италия, където известно време била хостеса. Тогавашният й приятел Дани Петканов - по-късно неин съпруг, вече бивш, я изтипоса във фейсбук, че му е изневерила с италианец. Докато ги деляло разстояние, Дани също имал забежки, но фокусът останал в изневярата на Алекс. Яростни критики и подригравателни колажи, чийто главен герой бе моделката, заляха социалната мрежа. В резултат тя потърси даже психологична помощ, заради нервен срив. В този момент, когато стотици я хулеха в интернет, тъкмо Маги Вълчанова бе сред първите, които скочиха в нейна защита, пише \"Хотарена\". Въпреки че отношенията им не бяха особено топли, предвид предисторията им, миската защити публично моделката, след като преди това я посети в болничното заведение, в което бе настанена. Това явно е доведело до нов обрат, защото после изглеждаше, че двете са се сближили наново. Пак бяха засичани по събития, а в социалната мрежа дори се появиха кадри, че спортуват заедно, пише show.blitz.bg.",

Sementara itu, Luluk mengatakan dirinya belum mengetahui ada atau tidaknya komunikasi dari Fraksi PDI Perjuangan DPR RI ke PKB untuk menolak RUU MK guna mencegah pasal-pasal yang diselundupkan. “Saya belum tahu, mungkin saja antar pimpinan ya,” terangnya. Sebelumnya, Fraksi PDI Perjuangan DPR RI mengaku buka komunikasi dengan fraksi partai politik lainnya untuk menolak Revisi Undang-Undang (RUU) Mahkamah Konstitusi (MK) guna mencegah pasal-pasal yang diselundupkan. Anggota Fraksi PDIP DPR RI Djarot Saiful Hidayat mengatakan bahwa pasal-pasal yang akan ditolak itu adalah yang melemahkan MK.

        "content": "Pakistan has demanded the Taliban government in Afghanistan to hand over outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) , who were involved in the attack on Chinese engineers in Shangla district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported ARY News. The attack, which took place on March 26 in Bisham city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Shangla district, claimed the lives of five Chinese engineers along with one Pakistani citizen. The incident took place when the convoy was travelling between Islamabad and a hydroelectric dam construction site in Dasu in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The District Inspector General (DIG) of Malakand said that a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of Chinese nationals, as reported by ARY News. Addressing a press conference along with officials of the National Counter-Terrorism Authority (Necta), Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said Pakistan has taken up the issue with the Afghan interim government and urged them to take action against terrorist activities being carried out on their land. The interior minister added that the TTP orchestrated the Shangla terror attack from inside Afghanistan. “We have requested the interim government in Afghanistan to arrest the leadership of banned TTP,” he said. Following the attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif instructed the concerned authorities to conduct a thorough joint investigation into the Shangla suicide attack on Chinese nationals, utilising all the resources of the state. PM Sharif chaired a high-level emergency meeting in the aftermath of the attack on Chinese nationals, further appreciating the alacrity with which law enforcement agencies and locals responded to the attack, saving many lives that could have been lost. “Terrorism is a transnational threat that has been instrumentalized by the enemies of Pakistan to stymie Pakistan’s progress and development. The acts targeting Pakistan-China friendship are particularly aimed at creating mistrust between the two iron brothers,” he said. However, on Sunday, while briefing the journalists, Interior Minister Naqvi said that the probe agencies have prepared an investigation report, adding that they had concrete evidence that the TTP used Afghan soil to carry out the terror attack on Chinese engineers, reported Al Jazeera.

        "description": "Restaurant owners pledge to work with food safety officials to make eating out scare free",
        "content": "For the first time, it is not Hyderabad’s favourite biryani that is making news. It is more about contaminated food, unhygienic kitchens, use of synthetic colours and whatnot. Raids by food safety officials of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) have brought out a rather ugly picture that raises serious concerns about whether the food being served at restaurants in Hyderabad is safe for consumption. As a consumer, I only see, smell and taste what is served to me. As an initial thumb rule, in the current situation, should we or should we not eat out? How can one decide which eateries are safe? The best choice is to stick to your favourite trusted place and order dishes that have to be made fresh. Avoid cut fruits outside during summer. Next, look for the smell and taste of food at the first bite. But then we worry how does one know what is happening in the kitchen? Can consumers walk into restaurant kitchens to see for themselves? Balaji Raju, Assistant Food Controller at GHMC, says while there is no rule on kitchen visits by a customer, a diner can question the food hygiene and taste in case of doubt. Balaji Raju says, “In case of doubt, any consumer can bring a food sample to the state food lab at Nacharam and submit it for a test for a nominal fee of ₹200. The colour of foods can be questioned outright. Food colour is only permitted for use by bakeries and sweets shops. The food scientific committee allows 100 parts per million (ppm) colour per kilo only for bakery and sweets.” Wake up call Many eateries in the city have been fined or have been served notices for issues ranging from cramped wash areas, lack of ventilation, and untidy kitchen floors, as well as for more serious issues such as the use of expired dairy products, improper storage of food, food infested with fungus, use of stale oil and many more similar health hazards. How can restaurants minimise the concerns of consumers? Nishant Sinha, of The Roastery Coffee House says they were served notice for an uncovered dustbin. “The notice was a shocker, however, after we started working on it, we realised the importance of the checks by the GHMC; how important it is to stick to the guidelines of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. That allowed us to pull up our socks and improve. It keeps us in check.” Anumula Shashank, managing director, Cafe Niloufer looks at complaints as constructive criticism. He says, “Consumers have every right to raise their doubt. Only then do we get the opportunity to show them the BTS (behind the scenes). We had a complaint about part of a pista shell on one of our dishes. That complaint led us to create a separate section for sorting. Problems make us work better. The food safety checks are a good opportunity for the restaurant industry as a whole to up our game.” Be prepared Shashank suggests that restaurants plan their inventory for stored goods (dry items) in such a way that there is no scope for expired goods. “There is no point in stocking huge quantities. As a food establishment, we also have separate cleaning staff for different sections and floors,” he said. The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) Hyderabad chapter is doing everything possible along with GHMC to educate food handlers on various stages of food handling — from receiving raw materials to storage, cold storage and handling of food in the kitchen — before it reaches the chef. Sampath Tummala, Chapter head, NRAI Hyderabad says, “A special task force formed by the NRAI has already been working on raising food and safety standards. We conducted Food Safety Training and Certification (FOSTAC) training for over 120 food handlers. While the ongoing raids have caused concern across the city, NRAI Hyderabad has clearly stated its intent to continue its work with the government and restaurateurs to improve hygiene and health standards. In the coming weeks, we will be setting up a variety of seminars and workshops to involve, update and educate all the parties involved on the standard requirements.” Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit Hyderabad / food and dining (general) / food safety",

In a letter addressed to Tinubu and seen by DAILY POST, the staff argued that “the bill in its current form poses significant constitutional bottlenecks and raises concerns about opacity in the legislative process.” Writing on behalf of the aggrieved staff, legal adviser to Foundation for Rights Enforcement Enlightenment and Defence, Akobo Teinye Tonbo Seddon, noted that the “bill’s provisions while they seek to extend the tenure of the clerk beyond the established retirement age, undermine the principles of fairness, equity and justice, it sets a dangerous precedent , potentially leading to a culture of tenure elongation for other public officials, hereby compromising the integrity of our democratic institutions.” In the letter, which was also sent to the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation, AGF, the petitioners further argued that the “bill violates the clear provisions of the constitution, which establish the National Assembly and define the terms and conditions of service for its officials. “Specifically, Section 51 of the Constitution states that ‘There shall be a clerk to the National Assembly and such other staff as may be prescribed by an act of the National Assembly, and the method of appointment of the clerk and other staff of the National Assembly shall be as prescribed by that act. “Therefore, the clerk of the National Assembly is a creation of the constitution, a constitutional office holder, and terms and conditions of service, including the retirement age as specified in the constitution. “Any changes to these terms and conditions will require a constitutional amendment as outlined in section 9 of the Constitution. “The National Assembly can legislate on matters related to the administration of the National Assembly, but cannot unilaterally alter the constitutional provisions relating to the clerks’ service years without following the proper procedure of constitutional amendment.” Related Topics: NASS tenure elongation Tinubu Don't Miss State police may clash with federal police – Shehu Sani You may like May 29: Tinubu to address National Assembly on Wednesday Tinubu’s litigation against governors on LG autonomy appropriate – Senator Kawu Kano Emirship tussles: Don’t allow anybody violate court orders – Buhari’s ally tells Tinubu Tinubu’s first year in office: There is hope for Nigerians – Wike Emirates Crisis: Gov Yusuf begs Tinubu to move deposed Emir Bayero out of Kano Children’s Day: Tinubu urges parents to reinforce honesty, modesty, hardwork in family unit Advertise About Us Contact Us Privacy-Policy Terms Copyright © Daily Post Media Ltd",

        "content": "(Alliance News) - Revolution Bars Group PLC martedì ha dichiarato di aver rifiutato un'offerta di acquisizione da parte della collega Nightcap PLC, quotata all'AIM, dopo che il consiglio di amministrazione ha ricevuto una consulenza legale e ha concluso che il piano non era realizzabile. La catena di bar con sede a Manchester, che gestisce i marchi Revolution e Revolucion de Cuba, ha annunciato ad aprile che l'azienda stava affrontando difficoltà finanziarie derivanti dalla crisi del costo della vita e dai recenti scioperi dei treni nel Regno Unito. A seguito di ciò, le azioni dell'azienda sono state temporaneamente sospese dalle negoziazioni sull'AIM dopo la mancata pubblicazione dei risultati, e la direzione ha dichiarato di aver avviato un piano di ristrutturazione. Il piano prevedeva la chiusura di 18 sedi e una raccolta di fondi di 12,5 milioni di sterline attraverso un collocamento fermo, una sottoscrizione, un collocamento e un'offerta aperta, il tutto a un prezzo di emissione di 1,00 pence per azione. Le azioni Revolution sono scese del 6,3% a 1,41 pence a Londra martedì mattina. Nightcap era in calo del 10% a 3,50 pence. Revolution ha dichiarato di essere disposta a prendere in considerazione offerte per l'azienda e a maggio ha avuto colloqui esplorativi con Nightcap, un operatore di bar con sede a Londra e proprietario di marchi come The Cocktail Club. Questi colloqui hanno portato a una proposta non vincolante che avrebbe richiesto a Revolution di procedere con il suo piano di ristrutturazione, ma non con la raccolta fondi proposta. Secondo Revolution, la proposta era condizionata a due raccolte di capitale anziché una, e prevedeva \"tempi significativi, costi materiali e potenziali questioni legali e procedurali non testate\". Nonostante il rifiuto dell'offerta di Nightcap, il consiglio rimane aperto a proposte alternative da parte di Nightcap e di altri, ha dichiarato.

Deze gesprekken leidden tot een niet-bindend voorstel dat Revolution zou hebben verplicht om door te gaan met haar herstructureringsplan, maar niet met de voorgestelde fondsenwerving.

Ondanks de afwijzing van het aanbod van Nightcap blijft de raad openstaan voor alternatieve voorstellen van Nightcap en anderen, aldus Revolution.

        "content": "Giovedì 30 maggio alle ore 18, presso la Biblioteca civica di Varese, in via Sacco 9, Gianni Biondillo, autore del volume Quello che noi non siamo (Guanda, 2023 ), dialogherà con Eugenio Guglielmi, Storico dell’Architettura e del Design, e con Michele Mancino, vicedirettore di VareseNews. Gianni Biondillo racconta, in questo suo romanzo corale, Premio Bagutta 2024, la storia di uomini e donne che presero coscienza del crollo delle false ideologie e che decisero di schierarsi nel nome della Resistenza e della libertà , spesso pagandone le conseguenze: carcerazioni, torture, campi di concentramento. Il ritratto profondo di un’epoca, che ci somiglia più di quanto vogliamo ammettere. Protagonista è quella generazione di architetti che credette nel fascismo perché si illudeva fosse una vera rivoluzione, come quella artistica che propugnavano con la scelta del razionalismo. Milano fu la fucina di quelle tensioni artistiche, che guardavano all’Europa come a una liberazione dall’asfissiante passatismo provinciale del resto della nazione. Venivano da tutta Italia: irredentisti istriani come Pagano, maestri comacini come Terragni, napoletani inquieti come Persico. E poi tutti gli altri, figli del Politecnico: Figini, Pollini, Bottoni, Banfi, Belgiojoso, Peressutti, Rogers... Nelle trattorie, nei salotti, alle vernici, incrociavano poeti, galleristi, critici, artisti, e di anno in anno l’adesione al regime si faceva sempre più labile, sempre più critica. Ci pensò la Storia a fare il resto: dalle leggi razziali alla disfatta di Russia, fino al cataclisma dell’8 settembre 1943. L’iniziativa è promossa dall’assessorato alla Cultura del Comune di Varese in collaborazione con l’Ordine degli Architetti Pianificatori Paesaggisti e Conservatori della Provincia di Varese. Agli Architetti che parteciperanno all’incontro verranno riconosciuti 2 crediti formativi.",

        "content": "Iberdrola ha puesto en marcha sus primeros 126 puntos de recarga en supermercados y centros de trabajo de Mercadona en Castilla y León y alcanza los 2.000 en España, construyendo así la mayor red de recarga semi-rápida del país. Los puntos, que se encuentran en cerca de 450 ubicaciones del grupo de distribución en todas las comunidades autónomas de España, se enmarcan en el acuerdo de colaboración al que llegaron las compañías el pasado año. Con esta alianza, Iberdrola se encargará del suministro, puesta en servicio y operación de hasta 3.500 puntos de recarga en 800 supermercados en España y Portugal. Con esta infraestructura los usuarios pueden recargar la batería de sus coches mientras realizan sus compras con hasta 22 kW de potencia, lo que les permite, por ejemplo, recargar 100 km en 45 minutos, o lo que es lo mismo alcanzar una autonomía suficiente para el uso medio diario del vehículo. En concreto, los 2.000 puntos de recarga se encuentran en todo el territorio nacional donde la cadena líder de supermercados está presente, lo que impulsa el objetivo de Iberdrola de llevar la movilidad eléctrica a todos los rincones de la geografía española con el fin de alcanzar la descarbonización del sector. Todos los puntos cuentan con energía 100% verde, procedente de fuentes renovables con certificado de garantía de origen (GdOs). Todos los puntos están disponibles en la aplicación de recarga pública de Iberdrola, la más valorada del sector, en la que se puede visualizar y geolocalizar información verificada de todos los cargadores, comprobar su operatividad en tiempo real y reservar y pagar desde el móvil. Con esta iniciativa, Iberdrola sigue acelerando su estrategia de transición de la movilidad hacia un sistema libre de emisiones y su plan de movilidad sostenible. Pionero en ponerse en marcha en 2016, prevé la instalación de 100.000 cargadores eléctricos hasta 2025 en hogares, empresas y en vía pública. Para ello, su diseño de infraestructura pública se desarrolla tanto en autovías y corredores como en ciudades y pequeñas poblaciones con el objetivo de contar con, al menos, una estación de recarga rápida cada menos de 50 km. Iberdrola es líder en infraestructura de recarga con una red de más 50.000 puntos de recarga operativos, de los que 6.500 puntos son públicos, y promueve la movilidad sostenible como parte de su estrategia de impulso a la transición energética.",

        "content": "A MAJOR car brand has been forced to make a significant design change - ending a 70-year tradition. The firm will have to rearrange the front end of its new models thanks to new pedestrian safety laws drawn up by the EU. The bloc is introducing a new set of regulations designed to better protect anyone who is hit by a car. But the small print means big change for Alfa Romeo , where designers have found themselves scrambling to relocate number plates on the brand's motors . Way back in 1955, the beloved Italian manufacturer began a tradition of having its plates off-centre, usually set out to the right-hand side. This began with the iconic Giulietta Spider and continues to this day with the latest Giulia , Tonale and Stelvio models. The idea is to allow more room for the sleek triangular grille that has become a staple of Alfas down the years. Now though, the rules have forced design teams to overhaul the front end to accommodate a centrally-mounted plate . Their solution has been unveiled in the form of the new Junior electric SUV. The car features a deeper front with the grille raised higher and the plate set right along the bottom edge of the bumper. Alejandro Mesonero-Romanos, head of design for Alfa , said: \"We cannot put the number plate on the side any more because of the homologation regulations for pedestrian [safety].\" He also confirmed that the change would apply to the upcoming electric replacements for the Giulia and the Stelvio. The latter is set to debut next year, with the former following in 2026. How the fresh design applies to the traditionally more streamlined models in the range is yet to be seen, with the Junior providing a little more space to fit the plate into than most. Mesonero-Romanos confirmed that the new cars would feature a \"fresh interpretation\" of the grille but would not be drawn on exactly how it would be changed. He added: \"Some die-hard Alfisti, who think an Alfa Romeo isn’t an Alfa Romeo unless it has the numberplate on the side won’t be happy, but there are plenty of beautiful Alfa Romeos in history which have the number plate in the middle. \" I own an Alfetta and a 1968 Giulia which have a central plate and look beautiful. \"This will allow us to have symmetry anyway, so I am happy - I’m one of the guys who likes the plate in the middle.\" It comes after Alfa was ordered to change the original name of the Junior following a heated row with the Italian government.",

Nature can be a constant and enthralling neighbour if you are lucky enough to call this village your home, including the complex of beach sand dunes, the National Trust-owned limestone headland known as Port Eynon Point, and of course the stunning beach and foam topped waves.

Called The Bower Cottage the beautiful white-washed stone and thatched property is thought to date back to the 1700s. The cottage can be found in the pretty coastal village of Port Eynon, one of the most popular sandy beaches and sweeping bays on Gower Peninsula. Nestled into the meandering little streets of this attractive village, The Bower Cottage stands out for its historic beauty crowned by the magnificent thatched roof. In through the cute stone porch and into the first of the reception rooms that can boast beautiful exposed ceiling beams and an impressive inglenook fireplace that's home to a robust log burner. Currently it is being uses as a dining room but would make a very inviting lounge too. The cute bay window sets this historic cottage apart from others, offering a high level of detailing that elevates it to an even more impressive level. The current lounge is a cosy and welcoming space, happily hosting a large corner sofa that is waiting to snuggle you as you relax in front of the log burner. The three reception rooms in the cottage are all versatile spaces so this could easily become a dining room too. The third reception room is a peaceful snug and reading nook but, again, can offer up its services as a home office, children's playroom or a cosy dining room. The galley kitchen is found within a single-storey rear extension and offers the cook distracting views of the garden. The main family bathroom is on the ground floor and it's a luxurious space created from tasteful and timeless décor choices in a neutral colour palette and a well-placed mirror that effortlessly gives the illusion of more space. Bedroom three is on the ground floor via a side extension and is a perfect addition to the cottage to facilitate multi-generational living as it comes with its own ensuite too. The ground floor bedroom ensuite is a thoughtful addition as it means people do not have to traipse through two reception rooms in the middle of the night to get to use the facilities. Up the charming staircase accompanied by exposed wall beams that remind you of the vintage of this delightful cottage to discover what lies beneath the thatched roof. The two double bedrooms on the first floor are both stunners, each boasting a wonderful white-washed panelled ceiling to give the space a feeling of airiness, light and space that combines beautifully with the section of exposed stone wall. The second bedroom on the upper floor is another cosy yet light-filled space and can also boast an ensuite shower room. The upstairs ensuite continues the tasteful and understated luxury bathroom décor found in the other two bathrooms and the slope of the thatched roof gives this space an extra layer of delightful character. There's off-road parking to the side of the house which is a bonus as the cottage sits on a small lane and the majority of the garden is at the front where you can relax and enjoy alfresco dining any time of the day or night, watching the Port Eynon world go by.",

The Mayor of London has called the Government ’s failure to deliver the Criminal Justice Bill and ban zombie knives a “betrayal” of the safety of young people and communities. Sadiq Khan called for Home Secretary James Cleverly to put an end to the delay in the legislation and bring forward the laws to ban the sale of the weapons . “The Government’s failure to deliver the Criminal Justice Bill is a betrayal of the safety of our young people and our communities,” Mr Khan said. “After years of delaying vital legislation that has allowed these dangerous weapons to continue being sold on our streets and having talked the talk about banning zombie knives for years, they have failed to deliver on their promises. “But it’s clear my calls, along with the voices of survivors, loved ones of victims and campaigners, have frustratingly fallen on deaf ears. The Government are not taking this crisis seriously enough. These weapons have no other use than to cause maximum harm. They must be banned.” Mr Khan says he has invested £151 million in this year’s budget for policing and crime prevention in London. London Victims Commissioner Claire Waxman also lamented the government’s “failure” to follow through with the Bill. She said: “The failure of the Government to follow through with the Criminal Justice Bill is a betrayal to everyone who has campaigned tirelessly to get victims of crime the justice they deserve, including many victims and families who have already failed in the most unimaginable way by a justice system not fit for purpose. “Victims and families will feel that these hard-fought commitments have amounted to nothing. It is a terrible blow to all of us who continue to campaign for a better, fairer justice system. I urge the next Government to deliver these overdue commitments as quickly as possible.” It comes as the national lead for policing knife crime said underage teenagers buying knives online remains “a really concerning picture” for police, with illegal dealers selling weapons via social media. Commander Stephen Clayman said earlier this month that forces in England and Wales are keen to cut off the supply of weapons as part of efforts to stop injuries and deaths.

        "content": "Mumbai: Bollywood superstar Salman Khan is all set to grace the silver screen once again, this time in AR Murugadoss’ action-packed film, Sikandar, which is scheduled for an Eid 2025 release. But what’s even more exciting is that veteran actor Sathyaraj, fondly remembered as Kattappa from the epic Baahubali franchise, will be playing the film’s antagonist. Sathyaraj, known for his powerful performances, will step into the shoes of the lead antagonist opposite Salman Khan. His portrayal of Kattappa in SS Rajamouli’s magnum opus Baahubali left an indelible mark on audiences worldwide, and fans are eagerly awaiting his transformation into a villainous character in Sikandar. Director AR Murugadoss has promised that Sikandar will have a pan-India appeal. The film combines high-octane action sequences with a strong social message, making it a must-watch for fans of both Salman Khan and Sathyaraj. Murugadoss also revealed that the audience will get to see a new side of Salman Khan in this film. The film’s budget is estimated to be around Rs. 400 crore, making it one of the most ambitious projects in recent times. Sikandar will be shot in Portugal, other European countries, and various locations in India. Producer Sajid Nadiadwala is backing this grand venture, and the team is gearing up for an exciting shoot. Apart from Salman Khan and Sathyaraj, the film also features Rashmika Mandanna as the leading lady. Suniel Shetty and Prateik Babbar will play pivotal roles, adding further depth to the ensemble cast.",

        "content": "Nigeria’s aggressive foreign currency reforms under President Bola Tinubu have failed to produce the outcomes many predicted, with detractors blaming implementation. In the first year of Tinubu’s government, the naira lost 65 percent of its value versus the US dollar on the official market due to two devaluations that the Central Bank carried out inadvertently in an effort to move toward a rate set by the market. The value of the naira decreased from N463 quoted in May 2023 to N1,339 per dollar as of May 27, 2024, according to data obtained from the FMDQ Securities Exchange Limited. The abolition of the gasoline subsidy and the unification of FX windows, two of President Tinubu’s initiatives, were criticized by Olusegun Obasanjo, the former president of Nigeria, as being improperly carried out. “Today, the government has made three decisions, two of which are necessary but were improperly carried out, impoverishing the Nigerian people and the economy,” stated Obasanjo. In a statement released on Sunday, Obasanjo stated, “These are the removal of subsidies, closing the gap between the black market and official rates of exchange, and the third is dealing with a military coup in the Niger Republic.” The naira has lost 49.47 percent of its value in the last year in the parallel market, sometimes known as the “black market,” where the dollar is currently trading at N1,500 against N758/$1 in April 2023. The CBN’s settlement of foreign exchange commitments due to manufacturers and local banks, along with the introduction of more transparent naira pricing, originally caused the naira to appreciate. Although the CBN’s aggressive approach to interest rate policy, which has resulted in a total increase of 750 basis points this year alone, has helped attract foreign investment and reduce the negative real return on naira investments, it hasn’t been able to control inflation, which is at a 28-year high. Nigeria’s foreign reserves decreased over the same period, falling 7.21% to $32.763 billion on May 22, 2024. A number of issues, including the high need for foreign exchange to cover the costs of goods imports and services, low trust, limited investment inflows, and low sales of crude oil due to oil theft, all contribute to the pressure on external reserves. “For an extended period, the currency exchange was prohibited from altering to mirror the variations in the rates of inflation in the United States and Nigeria,” Charlie Robertson, Head of Macro Strategy at FIM Partners UK Limited stated. He claimed that as economic realities set in, Nigeria saw a severe currency shift. “This has been difficult for Nigeria because, in contrast to Egypt and perhaps Ethiopia in the near future, Nigeria lacked the safety net of an IMF program, which could have lessened the blow,” Robertson stated. “The road is harder because Nigeria is determined to act alone, but the appropriate measures have been passed to improve the situation. The naira’s recovery will be aided by the low, competitive currency, which will also enhance the current account and foreign exchange liquidity. As a result, external reserves should increase,” Robertson concluded. The CBN has instituted various foreign exchange reforms, such as unifying the exchange rates window, liberalizing the foreign exchange market, clearing bank and airline FX backlog obligations, introducing the Price Verification System (PVS), limiting banks’ net open position, lifting the daily cap of N2 billion on remunerable Standing Deposit Facility (SDF), and restructuring the BDC segment. Other actions taken to restore stability, improve transparency, increase supply, and encourage price discovery in the Nigeria Autonomous Foreign Exchange Market include eliminating all margin caps for International Money Transfer Operator (IMTO) remittances; implementing a two-way quote system; and implementing extensive reforms in the Bureau De Change (BDC) sector of the market. After taking office on May 29, 2023, President Bola Tinubu did not waste any time in declaring that there could be a comprehensive cleaning of the financial system. A few days later, he suspended Godwin Emefiele, the Central Bank’s former governor, whose unconventional monetary policy had drawn much criticism. Emefiele’s suspension resulted from an investigation into his office and allegations of money laundering. Folashodun Shonubi, who had served as the CBN governor since Emefiele’s suspension, resigned, and all of the deputy governors of the CBN under the former governor also tendered their resignations. To alleviate the pressure on FX demand, boost the supply of dollars, and stabilize the Naira, Cardoso has implemented new policies and modified some of the ones that were already in place since taking office in September 2023.

        "content": "أكد وزير الزراعة والسلع الماليزي، داتوك سري جوهاري عبدالغني، على إمكانية التعاون مع مصر في صناعة زيت النخيل، موضحًا أنه ناقش مع السفير المصري في ماليزيا استراتيجية تحويل مصر إلى مركز لصناعة زيت النخيل، من خلال خطوات مدروسة بين البلدين، بهدف إنتاج زيت نخيل عالي الجودة يتم تصديره إلى كل دول العالم، إضافة إلى تأسيس مركزين لزيت النخيل في قناة السويس، للوصول إلى الأسواق التي لا يستطيعون الوصول إليها. وقال الوزير الماليزي إن بلاده ثاني أكبر منتج زيت على مستوى العام، مؤكدًا أن منطقة شمال إفريقيا توفر فرصًا كبيرة لإنتاج منتجات ذات قيمة وجودة عالية من مشتقات النخيل في قطاعات متنوعة مثل الأدوية، ومستحضرات التجميل، والصناعات الغذائية. وأكد أن أسواق الشرق الأوسط وإفريقيا تدعم التوسع في إنتاج زيت النخيل، مشيرًا إلى أن زيت النخيل يمثل 3% من الدخل المحلي في ماليزيا، ويمثل 73% من الصناعة، وينمو بنسبة كبيرة باستمرار، ويشغل حوالي مليون شخص. وأضاف، خلال منتدى زيت النخيل الماليزي- مصر 2024، أن اللاعبين الرئيسيين في صناعة زيت النخيل الماليزي يمكنهم التعاون من خلال إقامة شراكات جديدة وبناء تحالفات استراتيجية. وأكد أن هذه الجهود ستساعد في الاستفادة من أسواق جديدة لزيت النخيل الماليزي وتوسيع تواجده في المنطقة. وأوضح الوزير الماليزي أن النخيل يحتل مساحة كبيرة من المحاصيل الماليزية، حيث يمثل 32% من الإنتاج العالمي، مشيرًا إلى أن زيت النخيل سهل الإنتاج ولا يتأثر كثيرًا بالتغيرات المناخية، وهو أمر مهم في ظل التحديات المناخية الحالية. وأكد أن ماليزيا ملتزمة بالوصول إلى صفر انبعاثات كربونية في كل الأنشطة، وأن صناعة زيت النخيل هي من الأنشطة الرئيسية التي تركز فيها البلاد على تحقيق الحياد الكربوني. وأضاف سري جوهاري أن المرافق التي سوف يقوون بها سوف تكون في عدد من الدول، ولكن مصر تعتبر من أهم المواقع الاستراتيجية في العالم، حيث إنها متوسطة العالم ونستطيع من خلالها غزو جميع الأسواق. من جهتها، قالت بيلفيندر سرون، الرئيس التنفيذي لمجلس زيت النخيل الماليزي، إن زيت النخيل يتصدر قائمة واردات الزيوت النباتية في مصر، حيث بلغت واردات زيت النخيل 1.08 مليون طن في عام 2023، وهو ما يمثل 58٪ من إجمالي واردات الزيوت والدهون لمصر. وأشارت إلى أن السوق المصرية تتطور بوتيرة متسارعة، ويعد زيت النخيل من الزيوت الغذائية الضرورية اقتصاديًا والمتعددة الاستخدامات في الصناعات الغذائية وغير الغذائية.",

        "content": "كشف عامر العمايرة خبير اللوائح الرياضية، عن موقف رمضان صبحي صانع ألعاب بيراميدز، بعد قرار المنظمة المصرية لمكافحة المنشطات، بإيقاف اللاعب من قبل اللجنة لمدة 10 أيام، وخضوعه لجلسة استماع فيما نسب إليه من تناوله مواد محظورة. وقال العمايرة خلال مداخلة هاتفية له ببرنامج \"صباحكو رياضة\"، المذاع عبر أثير إذاعة الشباب والرياضة وتقدمه الإعلامية نجلاء حلمي: \"لن يخضع رمضان صبحي لعينة أخرى جديدة، والعينة التي تم سحبها منه وأثبتت إدانته، كافية لتحليلها وظهور نتيجتها وهو ليس موقوفا لمدة 10 أيام، بل هي تحديد معاد لجلسة استماع بين اللاعب ولجنة مكافحة المنشطات، وسيتم سؤال اللاعب عن تعاطيه لعقار معين لأي سبب من الأسباب، وفي حالة إنكار اللاعب لنوع العقار سيتم طلب عينة أخرى وفحصها، من قبل لجنة متخصصة وإذا تطابقت العينة الأولى، مع العينة الثانية سيتم وقف اللاعب وإصدار عقوبة مشددة عليه\". وأضاف العمايرة: \"سحب عينة رمضان صبحي تمت تحت أنظار طبيب مختص في أخذ العينات، وكان معه اللاعب وطبيب نادي بيراميدز وتم غلق العينة بالشمع بعد ذلك، أي ما يعني أن ليس هناك أي تزوير في العينة أو يستطيع الطبيب التلاعب بها، ولن تفسد العينة إلا بمرور 90 يومًا، فقط عليها، ولم يمر على بداية الأزمة حتى الآن سوى 40 يوما فقط، والعقوبات متفاوتة في هذه الأمور، وتترواح بين 4 شهور أو 6 شهور أو سنتين و4 سنوات أو حتى 6 سنوات، على حسب العينة الثانية إذا تم أخذها وموقف اللاعب سواء بالاعتراف أو النفي\". وأردف خبير اللوائح:\"هناك حل وحيد لخروج رمضان صبحي من هذا المأزق، وهو الطعن على المعمل الذي تم تحليل العينة به، ويطالب بأخذ عينة B قبل إعادة تحليل العينة A، ويطلب أن يتم عمل دمج أو مزج بين أجزاء العينتين وإذا كان هناك نتيجة غير متطابقة، هذا يعتبر تزويرا وإفسادا للعينة وإذا كانت متطابقة فذلك تثبت أدانه اللاعب، في حالة الطعن على المعمل للشكوك يجب أن يتم إيجاد نماذج سابقة، مثلما فعل حسام غالي من قبل في أزمة إيقافه بسبب تناول المنشطات\". وزاد:\"في حال إقرار اللاعب بالذنب سيتم تخفيف العقوبة، مثلما فعل الحارس الكاميروني أندريه أونانا بعد إيقافه لمدة عام، عقب تعاطيه دواء خاص بزوجته عن طريق الخطأ وهو نفس حال عدد من اللاعبين المصريين، والذي تناولوا بعض العقارات عن طريق الخطأ كدواء تخسيس، مثل كريم بامبو ومحمد هلال ثنائي فريق البنك الأهلي، أما لو كانت متعمدة مثل حالة عبد الرحمن عامر حسين لاعب إنبي السابق، فستكون العقوبة نهائية دون تخفيف مثلما حدث معه وإيقافه سنتين”.",

        "description": "Dr Donald Grant has also advised how much water you should drink during the warmer months",
        "content": "Summer is on the horizon and while we’re hoping for warm weather , there’s a range of illnesses that become more prevalent throughout the summer season, a doctor has warned. Dr Donald Grant, GP and senior clinical advisor at The Independent Pharmacy , has looked at some of the most common summer illnesses and how to treat or avoid them. Dr Grant, who has worked as a GP around Bristol for 35 years, said: “As we approach summer, it’s important to be aware of the more widespread illnesses during the warmer months. Understanding the conditions with an increased risk throughout summer can help identify them early - or avoid them altogether.\" Heatstroke Dr Grant said: “One illness that is more frequent in summer is heatstroke. This heat-related illness can affect anyone with prolonged exposure to high temperatures and direct sunlight. Heatstroke is an incredibly dangerous condition that can be fatal, so I advise anyone who feels they may be suffering from the illness to seek urgent medical attention. “Symptoms of heatstroke include high body temperature, altered behaviour, nausea, rapid heart rate, and headache. Moving to a cooler environment and hydrating can help ease symptoms until medical attention arrives. To avoid falling ill with heatstroke, drink sufficient amounts of water in the heat - I recommend at least three litres on a hot day - limit sun exposure and wear appropriate clothing to help regulate body temperature.\" Hay fever Dr Grant said: “Moving on, hay fever is a less dangerous illness but still extremely common in summer. Hay fever is a condition caused by an allergy to airborne substances such as pollen. It affects our nasal passages and causes sinus pressure, sneezing, nasal congestion, and watery eyes. If you’re suffering from these symptoms while enjoying a day out in the sun, the chances are you’ve got hay fever. “While it’s difficult to avoid hay fever completely, especially if you’re prone to allergies, there are ways to manage exposure to pollen to reduce the symptoms. Keeping windows closed during days with high pollen counts, using a dehumidifier, cleaning regularly, and changing clothes after exposure to pollen are great ways of minimising hay fever triggers. “For medical treatment, I recommend Chlorphenamine Tablets , an antihistamine used to treat symptoms associated with allergic reactions, such as hay fever. Additionally, Benacort Nasal Spray is an effective medicine for reducing nasal congestion caused by the allergic reaction.” Migraines Dr Grant said: “While they’re not technically a summer illness, migraines are commonly experienced throughout the warmer months. Dehydration, changes in humidity, and exposure to bright sunlight often trigger migraines, hindering the enjoyment of summer activities. “To reduce the risk of summer migraines, prioritise hydration, particularly when outdoors or exercising. Wear sunglasses with UV protection to shield your eyes from bright sunlight, and use air conditioning or fans to maintain a comfortable temperature, decreasing the likelihood of a migraine. “For those prone to migraines, I recommend Migraleve Pink Tablets . This over-the-counter migraine treatment contains a combination of paracetamol, codeine, and buclizine, effectively alleviating migraine symptoms while also preventing nausea.” Food poisoning Dr Grant said: “Next, food poisoning is a common illness experienced throughout summer. Warmer temperatures create the ideal environment for bacteria to grow rapidly, so handling and storing food incorrectly can quickly lead to foodborne illnesses such as salmonella. “Symptoms of food poisoning include nausea, diarrhoea, fever, and abdominal pain. To avoid this illness, maintain cleanliness—washing hands before and after handling food. It’s also important to store and cook food correctly, ensuring it’s refrigerated if necessary and avoiding cross-contamination while preparing food.\" Dehydration An all-too-common condition during the summer season is dehydration, caused by a lack of water, excessive sweating, and illness. As mentioned above, dehydration can lead to much more serious illnesses such as heatstroke and contribute to intense migraines. Dr Grant said: “Common symptoms include dizziness, increased thirst, a dry mouth, and dark yellow-coloured urine. It’s important to look out for these signs to spot dehydration and avoid worse conditions. To prevent dehydration, stay on top of your water intake, monitor physical activity in warm conditions, and prioritise a balanced diet. Over-the-counter medicines such as Dioralyte Sachets are extremely effective in replacing fluids and electrolytes lost through illness, preventing the risk of dehydration while recovering from a condition.\" Norovirus Dr Grant said: “Lastly, norovirus is present year-round, but the risks can increase during summer through food contamination and increased person-to-person contact. Side effects of this stomach bug include vomiting and diarrhoea. The condition is also highly contagious. “Luckily, there are several medical treatments available over the counter that can assist with these symptoms. Firstly, Imodium Instant Melts are extremely effective, providing diarrhoea relief in as quickly as an hour. Additionally FyboCalm Diarrhoea Relief Capsules are effective at providing long-term relief.\" Dr Grant qualified as a doctor in Bristol in 1985. He has wide clinical experience as a GP in and around Bristol. He has a particular interest in orthopaedic medicine.

        "content": "Maria Angela Danzì si ricandida. È membro del con il dal 2022, quando è subentrata al posto di Eleonora Evi (diventata membro della Camera dei Deputati). Nell'Eurocamera è membro titolare della Commissione per l'ambiente, la sanità pubblica e la sicurezza alimentare, ed è anche membro supplente nella Commissione per i bilanci e la Commissione per lo sviluppo regionale. Intervistata da Fanpage.it ha elencato in questi anni e quelli, invece, su cui come il diritto alla salute , il raggiungimento dell’uguaglianza delle persone Lgbtqia+ e l'efficientamento energetico. Tra i temi che le stanno più a cuore ci sono la che, secondo Danzì, deve \"diventare prerogativa pubblica\". L'esponente del M5S afferma di aver puntato l'attenzione su questo tema perché è \"un problema in continua crescita, che non risparmia classi sociali, che riguarda tanto i giovani, sempre più chiusi nei loro problemi, quanto gli adulti\". Fondamentale per lei anche la pace nel mondo, raggiungibile creando una Difesa europea comune: \" \". Pace, salute, ambiente, benessere animale, giovani, diritti, sono le mie priorità. Sono i temi del nostro programma: qui ne voglio trattare due, quello della pace e quello della salute, che tengono insieme tutto. La pace non è un’utopia, ma una strategia. Lo abbiamo detto sin da subito sulla guerra in Ucraina. La soluzione non erano le armi, ma la diplomazia. Come Movimento pensiamo che la Difesa comune europea debba essere centrale nella ridefinizione dell’Europa, ma diciamo anche che deve essere uno strumento di peacekeeping, ruolo che questo continente, e l’Italia in particolare, ha tra le ragioni fondatrici. Con il conflitto alle porte dell’Unione Europea abbiamo visto come la nostra dipendenza da altri paesi in campo energetico può essere un problema cruciale. Una dipendenza che spesso ci pone di fronte a contraddizioni dal momento in cui siamo legati a governi che non rispettano i diritti umani che devono essere criterio centrale di ogni nostra politica. Il tema della salute ne comprende tanti altri, forse tutti. One Health è il significativo nome dell’approccio europeo: la salute è una sola. Comprende il benessere dell’ambiente, degli animali e degli esseri umani. In quest’ottica, per esempio, il consumo di suolo e ogni opera pubblica devono avere come principio guida le conseguenze che avranno sulla salute dei viventi, esseri umani, fauna, flora. Quello che mangiamo, e come e dove viene coltivato o allevato, è importante tanto quanto la qualità dell’aria che respiriamo. La tutela della salute dovrebbe essere prerogativa pubblica per noi. Io ho puntato l’attenzione sulla salute mentale, un problema in continua crescita, che non risparmia classi sociali, che riguarda tanto i giovani, sempre più chiusi nei loro problemi, quanto gli adulti. In Europa, secondo i dati di Unicef, oltre 11 milioni di giovanissimi sotto i 19 anni soffrono di problemi di salute mentale. Per l’Eurocamera sono 150 milioni gli europei che ne soffrono. A dicembre, in plenaria, abbiamo votato il report sulla salute mentale, finalmente riconoscendo nella tutela del benessere emotivo, psicologico e sociale dei cittadini europei una priorità. Io ho presentato 60 emendamenti e con grande orgoglio posso affermare che il testo ne riprende molti: l’invito ai Paesi membri a presentare e adottare una strategia nazionale di prevenzione dei suicidi, il potenziamento della ricerca sull'interazione tra farmaci, alcol e sostanze stupefacenti e gli effetti sulla salute mentale e, infine, il supporto psicologico agli studenti nei programmi di scambio. La salute mentale è stata per troppi anni sottovalutata o addirittura ignorata dai sistemi sanitario nazionali e questo ha contribuito a causare, assieme ad altri fattori, un boom dei disturbi psichici. Adesso passiamo dalle parole ai fatti perché quella della salute mentale è un’emergenza europea. A marzo 2024 il Parlamento ha adottato la propria posizione sulla modifica alla direttiva quadro rifiuti che rende obbligatoria in tutta l’Europa la raccolta differenziata dei prodotti tessili. Ad aprile è stata finalmente approvata la normativa sull’ecodesign per prodotti più sostenibili, riutilizzabili e riciclabili. Con le imprese, le associazioni di categoria e le scuole del comparto Comasco ho portato avanti una battaglia per una etichettatura di garanzia del tessile Made in Italy, per una qualità dei tessuti per tutti, non solo per chi si può permettere abiti costosi. Importante è stata anche la battaglia per ridurre la plastica che ci soffoca negli imballaggi e via via nella catena alimentare e per proporre modelli di sviluppo compatibili con la natura e l’ambiente e con le vocazioni dei territori. Inoltre, con associazioni ambientaliste e con imprenditori sensibili ho presentato diversi emendamenti utili davvero nell’efficientamento energetico, nella transizione necessaria e possibile. Si continuano a dire fake news per spaventare i cittadini e non ne capisco il motivo. L’adeguamento degli stabili a parametri più rispettosi dell’ambiente è un investimento perché migliora la qualità di vita di chi vi abita e perché riduce le dispersioni e i consumi, con un risparmio nelle bollette. Oltre ad aumentarne il valore di mercato. Invece di aiutare i singoli e le imprese a muoversi al meglio, i disfattisti seminano terrore. Il Movimento 5 Stelle condivide gli obiettivi della direttiva europea per l’efficientamento energetico degli edifici. Edifici con classi energetiche più alte comportano un aumento del loro valore, un risparmio in bolletta per i cittadini e meno inquinamento. A me tutto questo non sembra un libro dei sogni, ma la realtà che già vivono sulla loro pelle molti cittadini in tutta Europa e in Italia grazie al Superbonus. È evidente tuttavia che bisogna fare i conti con la realtà. Non possiamo cambiare il parco edilizio del nostro Paese dall’oggi al domani: servono gradualità e politiche come il Superbonus che si sono rivelate pioniere in Europa. Oggi in Italia gli edifici rappresentano il 40% dei consumi energetici e il 36% delle emissioni nocive, è dunque necessario intervenire così come ci indica l’Europa. Anziché negare questa realtà il governo Meloni batta i pugni in Europa per ottenere un nuovo debito comune europeo al fine di sostenere incentivi e investimenti. La nostra proposta è quella di un Recovery Fund strutturale che finanzi la transizione energetica anche in questo campo Per garantire il diritto alla salute è fondamentale procedere a una revisione dei trattati: per noi la salute deve diventare una competenza concorrente tra Unione e Stati Membri. I campi di intervento sono numerosi: dalla ricerca sulle malattie rare alla resistenza antimicrobica, dai vaccini all’acquisto congiunto di medicinali critici. Purtroppo la riforma del settore farmaceutico europeo non prevede una filiera europea di ricerca e produzione dei farmaci necessari anche a chi è portatore di malattie rare, considerate non remunerative dai privati. Avevamo anche chiesto la razionalizzazione delle competenze delle varie agenzie che hanno molti compiti e troppo spesso sovrapposti. Purtroppo questo emendamento è stato bocciato, ma noi non ci arrenderemo così. Bisogna poi fare di più sui diritti civili e trasformare in provvedimenti legislativi la strategia per l’uguaglianza delle persone Lgbtqia+: il 43 per cento denuncia di subire discriminazioni e non è accettabile. In questi giorni ho firmato con piacere una richiesta d’impegno sottoposta dell’Arci Gay, ma tutti gli altri diritti civili sono sotto scacco: dal 2008 gli Stati governati dalle maggioranze di destra bloccano in Consiglio la direttiva sul principio di parità di trattamento fra le persone indipendentemente dalla religione o le convinzioni personali, la disabilità, l’età o l’orientamento sessuale. L’Unione Europea deve diventare davvero un’unione sociale e lo può e lo deve fare ridefinendo le colonne del welfare comunitario: per esempio la prossima legislatura dovrà agire sui criteri di parità retributiva, stabilendo i criteri dei redditi minimi e istituendo un reddito di cittadinanza, per affrontare il diffuso fenomeno del dumping sociale e salariale. In Italia quello del salario è un tema importante, i salari sono fermi al 1990, anzi secondo i dati Ocse oggi si guadagna meno di allora, i salari reali sono addirittura scesi, unico caso in tutta Europa. Altra priorità, sempre in questo campo, è la formazione dei giovani, ma anche degli adulti, per fornire le competenze specifiche richieste dal mercato del lavoro che sta cambiando velocemente, dopo la pandemia e per effetto della doppia transizione ecologica e digitale.",

This article explains when the Valley of Flowers was discovered and when it got the UNESCO World Heritage tag. New Delhi: Nestled amidst the majestic Himalayan ranges, the Valley of Flowers offers a breathtaking view and an unforgettable experience for visitors. This UNESCO World Heritage Site spread over 87 sq km in the Chamoli district, Uttarakhand, is a testament to the beauty and serenity of nature. It forms one of the two core zones of the Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve; the other is the Nanda Devi National Park. Explore the Valley of Flowers and its journey to becoming a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Campanula Latifolia in the Valley of Flowers (Photo credit: Andrea Robinson/Photodisc/Getty Images) Valley of Flowers: Location and Height It is located in the Pushpawati River valley, in the upper expanses of the Bhyundar Ganga River, near Joshimath, Garhwal. The Valley of Flowers lies between 30° 41′ to 30° 48’N and 79° 33′ to 79° 46′, and it is 20 km northwest of Nanda Devi National Park. The Valley of Flowers, which runs east-west, is approximately 15 km long and has an average width of 6 km. The Valley of Flowers is at a height of 3,352 to 3,658 meters above sea level and complements the rugged mountain wilderness of Nanda Devi National Park to the east. The park is open from June to October and is covered by heavy snow for the rest of the year. Valley of Flowers: History Due to its inaccessibility, the Valley of Flowers was little known to the outside world. Let us look at how the world knew it. 1931: Three British mountaineers, Frank S Smythe, Eric Shipton, and RL Holdsworth, lost their way while returning from a successful expedition to Mt Kamet and happened upon a valley full of flowers. All three mountaineers were so attracted to the beauty of this valley that they named it the “Valley of Flowers”. Smythe had authored a book of the same name. 1939: Botanist Lady Joan Margaret Legge visited the valley to study flowers. While traversing some rocky slopes to collect flowers, she slipped and died. Later, her sister visited the valley and erected a memorial near the spot. 1993: Botanist deputed by the Wildlife Institute of India, Prof Chandra Prakash Kala, also went to the valley and conducted a research study on the floristics and conservation of the valley for a decade. Kala made an inventory of 520 alpine plants that were exclusively growing in this national park and authored two books – “The Valley of Flowers – Myth and Reality” and “Ecology and Conservation of the Valley of Flowers National Park, Garhwal Himalaya.” Bistorta affinis captured in the Valley of Flowers (Photo credit: Andrea Robinson/Photodisc/Getty Images) Valley of Flowers: A Timeline Flowing river cascading through mountain mist in the Valley of Flowers (Photo credit: Andrea Robinson/Photodisc/Getty Images) Valley of Flowers: Flora and Fauna With over 650 different flower varieties, it is magical and entirely covered in flowers of all hues and varieties. Flowers like Blue Poppy, Cobra Lily and Brahmakamal can be found here. Established in 1982, the Valley of Flowers National Park is home to rare and endangered animals like the Asiatic black bear, snow leopard, musk deer, brown bear, and red fox. The park also contains birds, including the Himalayan monal pheasant and other high-altitude birds.",

        "description": "U Deklaraciji koju je potpisalo 65 ozbiljnih ličnosti: naučnih, kulturnih, stručnih i privrednih, navedeno je da će se na strategiji raditi dvije godine i da će biti objavljena 2026. na dvadesetogodišnjicu obnove nezavisnosti Crne Gore",
        "content": "Nedjeljnik \"Monitor\" objavio je intervju sa privrednikom Vladimirom Nikaljevićem, koji je govorio o „Strategiji za evropsku i građansku Crnu Goru“. Nikaljević navodi da je, u Deklaraciji kojom je najavljena njena izrada i koju je potpisalo šezdeset pet ozbiljnih ličnosti: naučnih, kulturnih, stručnih i privrednih, navedeno da će se na strategiji raditi dvije godine i da će biti objavljena 2026. godine na dvadesetogodišnjicu obnove nezavisnosti Crne Gore. Zapamtio sam dobro, raspad u krvi, velike, uvažene i nesvrstane države Jugoslavije. Ne mogu zaboraviti granatiranje olimpijskog grada Sarajeva i granatiranje Dubrovnika, grada pod zaštitom UNESCO-a, razaranja, na desetine hiljada ubijenih, raseljenih, kao i genocid u Srebrenici. Politička scena iz početka devedesetih me podsjeća na sadašnju u Crnoj Gori. Medijski pritisak iz Beograda, ugroženi srpski narod... A dodatno, agresija Rusije na Ukrajinu i neki narativi kao: „Crna Gora mala Ukrajina“ i „ujedinjenje ili ukrajinizacija“ zatim očigledne aktivnosti na razjedinjavanju društva i teritorijalnom rasparčavanju, uznemirile su me. Na osnovu sjećanja iz devedesetih i informacija koje dobijam iz suprotstavljenih izvora, ubijeđen sam da je ponovo na sceni velikosrpski projekat koji je mijenjao nazive: „Načertanije“, „Memorandum“, „Srpski svet“, ali koji nije odustajao od cilja i koji je poslije Referenduma promijenio taktiku i iznutra, kroz institucije sistema, a posebno preko političkog krila Srpske pravoslavne crkve i medija, napao sve sfere života i državnosti Crne Gore. I ne samo život već je SPC prisvojila i nezakonito uknjižila i naše mrtve pretke i njihove grobove. Ne govorim o vjerskom dijelu aktivnosti SPC već o političkim aktivnostima koje su u suprotnosti sa sekularizmom i kanonskim pravom. : Upravo nezakonita uknjižba grobova je bila „okidač“ i pokrenula nas, nekoliko prijatelja, da se organizujemo i osnujemo NVU i da ispitamo kako se desila ova nezakonita uknjižba. Uložen je ogroman rad. Pregledano je na hiljade posjedovnih listova, Podnijeta ustavna inicijativa za ocjenu nezakonitosti, zatim krivična prijava protiv ovlašćenog lica iz katastra, podnijeti zahtjevi za hronologije upisa nepokrenosti, obraćanja zaštitinicima imovinsko pravnih interesa države i naišli smo na zid i muk. Nakon ovoga mogli smo da odustanemo ili odemo dalje da se borimo za funkcionisanje pravne države. Institucije kao katastar i ne samo on, rade protiv interesa Crne Gore.Tako smo došli do toga da treba se angažujemo. Očuvanje i prosperitet Crne Gore od svih nas zahtijeva odbacivanje svijesti koja očekuje da „neko drugi završi posao“. Sada je ponovo vrijeme da damo doprinos za prosperitetnu i građansku Crnu Goru i iskoristimo šansu da budemo prva naredna članica EU. Ne obazirući se na političke elite i na institucije koje su to već trebale uraditi pokrenuta je izrada strategije za građansku i evropsku Crnu Goru. U Deklaraciji kojom je najavljena njena izrada i koju je potpisalo šezdeset pet ozbiljnih ličnosti: naučnih, kulturnih, stručnih i privrednih, navedeno je da će se na strategiji raditi dvije godine i da će biti objavljena 2026. godine na dvadesetogodišnjicu obnove nezavisnosti Crne Gore. Prijedlog za naslov dokumenta je NOVA STEGA, pri čemu bi STEGA bila skraćenica od „Strategija za evropsku i građansku Crnu Goru“, a istovremeno asocijacija na istorijsku STEGU Petra I. Kada bude objavljena STEGA će biti svjedočanstvo o viziji i nastojanjima crnogorskog društva da se priključi EU, odnosno najrazvijenijim evropskim narodima u vremenu ozbiljnih geopolitičkih kriza koje će oblikovati novi svjetski poredak. Put do samog djela će biti jednako važan zbog nastojanja ovog Projekta da pokrene i integriše sve reformske, građanske i evropske grupacije i pojedince koje žele bolju, pravedniju i napredniju Crnu Goru. Svi koji žele da Crna Gora bude zajednička kuća i imaju što da kažu, pozivaju se da se uključe u ovaj Projekat. Potencijalni autori moraju potisnuti svoj ego. Rezultat mora biti zajednički i biće djelo svih koji ga budu osmislili, prihvatili i sprovodili do cilja. Zajednički cilj mora biti Crna Gora u Evropskoj uniji i evropski standardi u Crnoj Gori, oslonjeni na našu istoriju, tradiciju, specifičnosti i interese. Ranije strategije, projekti i programi razvoja pisani na ovu temu od vrlo stručnih autora, sa vizijama i rješenjima koja su bila dobra, uglavnom su završavali u bibliotekama i ladicama, jer ih ni vlast ni neke druge snage nijesu imale namjeru sprovesti. Inkluzivni način izrade ove strategije, odnosno da svi zaiteresovani mogu dati doprinos, omogućava da se da širi doprinos njenoj izradi i da se od šire društvene zajednice osjeća svojom! Ovaj Projekat treba da se vodi i realizuje policentrično – da ljudi shvate da moraju da se angažuju, da znaju pravce djelovanja i zajednički cilj i zato je inicijativa, kreativnost i angažovanje na njima. Za svaku od policentričnih aktivnosti treba da postoji tim – lider i saradnici, koji imaju konkretne zadatke i aktivnosti (ideološki tim, socijalni, kreativni, medijski tim, itd.). Policentrično djelovanje treba tematski diversifikovati jasno, na primjer: borba za očuvanje tekovina suverene, međunarodno priznate države Crne Gore, aktivnosti koje obezbjeđuju socijalnu pravdu, obrazovanje mladih kao čuvara Crne Gore, kultura, zdravstvo, ekonomija ... Ali da bismo obezbijedili što šire učešće autora, mora se jasno istaći: ovo nije i neće biti partijski program. Partija ima dovoljno već će biti objavljen i predstavljen kao javno dobro! Takođe vjerujemo da nudimo i model za prevazilaženje podjela i nepovjerenja! Dugačka je lista crnogorskih podjela. Nepovjerenje, razjedinjenost i svrstavanje uzela je tolikog maha da svaka inicijativa, akcija, a posebno „neka“ strategija, mora da prođe filtere: nacionalne, vjerske, partijske, pa i po odnosu prema bivšoj vlasti. Ocjena tridesetogodišnje vlasti je gotovo crno-bijela. Za jedan dio građana: bilo kakva apologetika bi izazvala podozrenje i neprihvatanje ove strategije. Nedvosmislen otklon i kritika svega lošeg vezanog za dugu vladavinu bivše vlasti su „moralna ulaznica“ projekta u današnju političku zbilju. Bez toga, za njih, ova strategija će biti doživljena samo kao još jedan pokušaj odbrane vrha bivše vlasti. Za drugi dio građana: po treći put u posljednjih 100 godina, ponavlja se rušenje vlasti organizovano iz Beograda, sa namjerom da se posrbi Crna Gora. Ovi građani čak i ne osporavaju: sve što je bilo loše, nezakonito, itd. kod bivše vlasti. Ističu, da nije bilo rata u Crnoj Gori, da je stečena nezavisnost i članstvo u NATO. O ovom periodu istorija će dati svoj sud. Birači će na izborima pokazati svoj politički odnos. Za konkretne nezakonitosti institucije neka urade svoj posao. Ali promjena vlasti je bila prije skoro četiri godine. Novi su zadržali stare loše prakse, a rezultata još nema. Zato će ova strategija postupati po principu diskontinuiteta. Raskid sa prošlošću, objedinjavanje progresivnih snaga i usmjeravanje ka budućnosti. Naša vlast nije samostalna i ne može misliti o interesima Crne Gore, odnosno pod pritiskom je velikosrpskih snaga u Srbiji, iza kojih stoji ruski uticaj. To se jasno vidi iz aktuelnih događanja vezanih za Rezoluciju o Srebrnici i nastojanjima da se što je moguće više naruše odnosi sa Hrvatskom, stavljanjem na dnevni red Rezolucije o Jasenovcu. Promjenom taktike (tzv. „meki put“) i preko SPC, „kadrova po dubini“, medija iz Srbije, prosrpskih partija i provjerenih kadrova koji su instalirani u vrh vlasti, nastavlja se sa urušavanjem i obesmišljavanjem institucija, izazivanjem nestabilnosti, kako bi stvorili nefunkcionalnu državu i nepouzdanog NATO partnera. Upitna je otpornost ove vlasti na otkazivanje podrške prosrpskih snaga kao i na ostale aktivnosti na destabilizaciji države koje se sprovode od instaliranih velikosrpskih snaga u institucijama ili organizovanih u raznim organizacijama i udruženjima. O ekonomiji se ne misli i ne govori kada je u toku borba za ostajanje na vlasti. Ekonomski program nije ni objavljen. Ovo što se s vremena na vrijeme čuje, to je prosto inercija rada institucija i službi u njima.Tako, rekao bih, da se jasno ne vidi kojim se putem ide. A ono što se jasno vidi je da postoji snažan proces koji vuče nazad i drugi, bojim se više verbalni i deklarativni, koji gura prema prosperitetu za sve građane a to može bit samo priključenje Evropskoj uniji!",

        "content": "Many people are familiar with the situation when buckwheat sticks to the bottom of the pan while cooking. And then washing the dishes is very problematic. And the product itself gives off a burnt flavor. Therefore, to prevent this from happening, FoodOboz will tell you how to cook crumbly buckwheat correctly. How to cook buckwheat in a saucepan so that it does not stick to the bottom: 1.Put buckwheat and water in a saucepan. 2. After boiling, turn down the heat. 3. Turn off after 20 minutes – this is how long it takes for the buckwheat to be fully cooked. 4. You can also throw the groats into boiling water and cook for up to 20 minutes over low heat without stirring the porridge. What should be the proportions to make buckwheat crumbly? Traditionally, groats are cooked in a 1:2 ratio. That is, you need 2 cups of water for a glass of cereal. For thicker buckwheat porridge, take more water – up to three glasses. What happens if you put buckwheat in boiling water: 1. It does not turn into mush, does not stick together, and does not sour. 2. High temperatures are favorable for this cereal. So if you put buckwheat in boiling water right away, it won't spoil it.",

        "description": "Myrie replaced his colleague on BBC’s News at Ten and is a favourite to replace him during election night coverage",
        "content": "Clive Myrie has said that it was “weird” reporting on the allegations surrounding his former colleague Huw Edwards. The former BBC News at Ten presenter resigned on “medical advice” after he was accused of paying a teenager thousands of pounds for sexually explicit images. Myrie replaced him in the role soon after. The 62-year-old, who had been off-air since the scandal broke in July last year , was alleged to have paid the young person £35,000. South Wales Police and the Metropolitan Police found no evidence of criminal conduct. In a new interview with Radio Times , the 59-year-old broadcaster, reportedly named “Saint Clive” by colleagues due to his impeccable reputation, spoke about the experience of reporting on his coworker. “When you end up doing a story that involves you reporting on your colleagues, it’s weird. That’s actually the best description,” he said, “It’s just weird. Because you’re not usually there to be talking about the staff in your newsroom.” Myrie, who has worked at the BBC since the 1980s, has been rumoured to be the favourite to replace Edwards as host of the BBC’s election night coverage. But the presenter said he was just appreciative of what he’d been able to achieve so far. “I’m incredibly pleased with what I’ve got,” he said. “And given that my parents were convinced that I’d made a big old mess of my career choice, they’re now very proud of me.” He added: “What I’m doing now is brilliant. I’m loving it. It’s amazing to be invited into people’s homes at 10pm.” Last month, it was revealed that the BBC had warned Edwards about his online conduct two years before the scandal that led to him being taken off air, according to confidential documents. According to documents seen by The Sunday Times , a woman in her late 40s urged the BBC to halt contact between herself and Mr Edwards after they exchanged messages on Instagram and email. The corporation spoke to Mr Edwards about his “ actions and social media use ” and understood the interactions were “to stop”, according to documents seen by the newspaper. The BBC said: “As set out in our statement earlier this week, Huw Edwards resigned on 22 April on the basis of medical advice from his doctors. The BBC accepted his resignation and we do not believe it appropriate to comment further.”",

        "content": "Megaworld Corporation's hospitality arm Megaworld Resorts and Hotels (MHR) is fortifying its existing partnership with international travel firm Trip.com Group to market its services to a wider group of travelers around the world. MRH and Trip.com Group, represented by MHR’s Head of Distribution Pebbles Caramat and Trip Group’s Managing Director and Vice President for International Markets Boon Sian Chai, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on May 28. As a major player in the Philippine hospitality and real estate industries, Megaworld aims to utilize Trip.com’s online platform to expand its customer reach and promote its services, which may hopefully attract more foreign visitors to travel to the country. \"We would like to be known as well globally, and the platform of Trip.com will be able to do that for us, given their global reach, given their tools, and technology,” said Caramat in a press conference after the signing. Bookings can already be made at majority of MRH’s signature hotels and resorts such as Savoy, Belmonte, and Richmonde. However, through the partnership, Chai explained that it will be able to help Megaworld acquire data on consumer behavior and marketing to showcase its properties worldwide. “Megaworld Hotels and Resorts is now going to be in our preferred partner program. The preferred partner program is a very unique program and only specific program for selected hotels who are able to offer competitive product, great service, as well as good offerings to our customers and we will feature them on Trip.com, so that they will get additional traffic and additional visibility,” said Chai. He mentioned that Trip.com’s recently launched “Mega Grand World” product on its online platform, is one of its top-selling attractions. Caramat emphasized that their properties provide value added services, catering to both fostering high-class hotel experiences through their “sampaguita” branding, that seeks to present the local heritage and culture through the hotels’ services and amenities. Most of MRH’s properties are centered in Manila, Cebu, Mactan, and Boracay. However, Caramat said they are “also expanding across other of the islands that are untapped but has very culturally rich and also enticing for leisure travels.” “ \"We are able to provide whatever is needed in the online landscape to be able to provide those hotels availability and experience that will require either business or leisure travelers to the Philippines,” added Chai. MRH currently has more than 10 hotels, seven brands, and is the holder of over 8,500 keys, making it the largest hotel chain operator in the Philippines. It is set to open The Grand Westside Hotel, its largest and premier hotel, at the Entertainment City, in Paranaque City.",

        "content": "Home Alone actor Daniel Stern has said he and members of the crew racked up a 7,000 dollar (£5,480) bar bill for Donald Trump after filming a cameo with the former US president. Stern is best known for his role as hapless criminal Marv in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. The second film was shot at the Plaza Hotel in New York, which was owned by Trump at the time, and the mogul has a brief cameo in one scene. Discussing his night with The Apprentice star, he told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I had met him that day on the shoot and that night, me and the stunt guys and some crew guys were at the hotel bar and Mr Trump walked through. It might be May but we're living our Christmas dreams 🎄 One-half of Home Alone's 'Wet Bandits', Daniel Stern AKA 'Marv' talks about starring in the iconic movie. — Good Morning Britain (@GMB) “He pointed and was very appreciative and said ‘drinks are on me’ and so we bought drinks for the entire bar, for the entire night. We hit him pretty good on the bill. “Liam, my stunt guy, we figured it was about 7,000 bucks which is a drop in the bucket to the man and he felt good about it, we felt good about it so that was a win win.” Stern has since appeared in shows such as Manhattan and For All Mankind but is still best known for his role as one half of the Wet Bandits, alongside Joe Pesci, in the classic Christmas comedies. Despite the fact the films are festive staples, Stern, who has written an autobiography called Home And Alone, said he has only ever seen the film once. He said: “It was funny because when I wrote the book, and I was writing about the tarantula scene, I wrote out how I remembered it, what happened and what was funny and then my daughter read the book for me and said ‘that’s not what happens in the movie’ and I went ‘oh’ and I had to go back and watch the scene again to see how it actually went. “Since the movie came out, I go through my life with people saying ‘we love you, we watch you, you’re a big part of my holiday’ and it’s so overwhelming sometimes. I don’t know why it’s happened but it’s a blessing of a lifetime.” Recalling working with star Macaulay Culkin, who played central character Kevin McCallister, Stern said he was more like an adult than a child. He said: “He was a professional actor. That’s what you give up a lot of times when you’re working as a kid and living in New York. “I love him, I loved him then – he was the same age as one of my kids and I was very protective of him. We all went to the park to play... but he was under the microscope. A kid actor is a dangerous situation.”",

We hit him pretty good on the bill. “Liam, my stunt guy, we figured it was about 7,000 bucks which is a drop in the bucket to the man and he felt good about it, we felt good about it so that was a win win.” Stern has since appeared in shows such as Manhattan and For All Mankind but is still best known for his role as one half of the Wet Bandits, alongside Joe Pesci, in the classic Christmas comedies. Despite the fact the films are festive staples, Stern, who has written an autobiography called Home And Alone, said he has only ever seen the film once. He said: “It was funny because when I wrote the book, and I was writing about the tarantula scene, I wrote out how I remembered it, what happened and what was funny and then my daughter read the book for me and said ‘that’s not what happens in the movie’ and I went ‘oh’ and I had to go back and watch the scene again to see how it actually went. “Since the movie came out, I go through my life with people saying ‘we love you, we watch you, you’re a big part of my holiday’ and it’s so overwhelming sometimes. I don’t know why it’s happened but it’s a blessing of a lifetime.” Recalling working with star Macaulay Culkin, who played central character Kevin McCallister, Stern said he was more like an adult than a child. He said: “He was a professional actor. That’s what you give up a lot of times when you’re working as a kid and living in New York. “I love him, I loved him then – he was the same age as one of my kids and I was very protective of him. We all went to the park to play... but he was under the microscope. A kid actor is a dangerous situation.”",

        "content": "By V Sajeev Kumar Comments READ LATER International Nut and Dried Fruit Council (INC), forecast an 8 per cent rise in world tree nut production for 2024-25 at 6.2 million tonnes (kernel basis, except pistachios in-shell) from 2023-24. Although, it is still very early in the season to anticipate the outcomes, the 41st World Nut and Dried Fruit Congress noted that most tree nut crops are expected to increase. Pine nuts, almonds and hazelnuts are projected up by 76 per cent, 22 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Macadamias, pistachios, Brazil nuts and walnuts foresee productions between 8 per cent and 2 per cent above the previous season. According to early estimations, 2024-25 peanut production is expected to amount to around 50 million tonnes (in-shell basis), and dried fruit production 3.4 million tonnes, up 4 per cent from 2023-24. The event was held at Vancouver with the participation from 60+ countries to share ideas on key topics shaping the industry landscape. Pratap Nair, who is the member of Board of Trustees of INC, said the Congress stressed the need to properly tailor marketing strategies to meet new challenges. INC Executive Director Goretti Guasch underlined the need for unlocking consumer potential to drive demand for nuts and dried fruits worldwide. INC Chairman Michael Waring has called for collaborative approach across the sectors in identifying industry opportunities and in laying out strategy as INC is represented by the entire supply chain. The Nutrition Research Seminar featured talks on how nut-containing diets may improve cardio-metabolic health and the role of nuts and dried fruits in improving diet quality. The Sustainability seminar explored key challenges facing the industry, ranging from climate change to geopolitical tensions. Comments",

        "content": "DICK and Angel Strawbridge have addressed their imminent return to Channel 4 - a year after being axed. The TV couple were sensationally dropped from the broadcaster after Angel's vicious row with a producer. A leaked recording exposed the mother-of-two's behaviour towards a producer , which she branded a \"f***ed up little c***\". Following the explicit rant Channel 4 bosses announced they were cutting ties with the pair. But now Dick and Angel back on air with their final series Dick and Angel's Secret France . In a social media update to fans, the couple said: \"We have some very exciting news & we want you to be the first to know! \"We are back on Channel 4 with our brand-new travel series ‘Secret France with Dick & Angel’ starting Sunday 2nd June at 8pm. \"It’s been an voyage of discovery and we wanted to find places that were off the beaten path, where tourism hasn’t overshadowed the local culture. \"We hope you join us on our journey ❤️ \"Love Dick & Angel.\" Delighted fans flooded the pair with well wishes, with one writing: \"Fantastic you two will deffo be watching.\" A second wrote: \"Oh wow!!! Brilliant you’ve all been missed.\" \"It is so wonderful to have you back on our screens again, I just cannot wait until 2nd June,\" said a third. While a fourth commented: \"I am so pleased your back on TV can't wait.\" The Sun revealed how the new series was filmed before Angel's explicit was leaked and are remaining stern on their ban. The TV couple shot to fame in 2016 when their series Escape to the Chateau launched on Channel 4. Running for nine series, it followed Dick and Angel as they renovated their 19th century French mansion. They have two children together, Arthur and Dorothy, who featured in the show It quickly became a fan-favourite show of the schedule as millions tuned in to see the couple tackle each corner of their 45-bedroom chateau. Escape to the Chateau came to a natural end in October 2022 by mutual agreement between Channel 4 and Dick and Angel. Despite the broadcaster and the pair working together on other projects, they were axed from the channel following a recording leaking appearing to capture Angel in a foul-mouthed exchange with a producer .",

By Telangana Today Updated On - 28 May 2024, 02:46 PM Hyderabad: Surgeons at Asian Institute of Nephrology and Urology (AINU) , Banjara Hills, on Tuesday announced successful removal of a rare, giant dumbbell-shaped testis tumor measuring over 40 cm from a 39-year-old patient from Kadapa. The complex surgery was challenging as the patient had undergone kidney transplantation about a year ago and was on high-dose of immunosuppressants and powerful steroids. Recently, he noticed swelling in his left testis, which he initially dismissed as a simple hydrocele. However, the swelling rapidly grew. Tests revealed a large tumor that extended from the left testis into the abdomen, surpassing the belly button. Abnormally high levels of Beta HCG, a testis tumor marker, elevated to more than 20 times the normal value, were also found. However, a PET scan showed no signs of tumor spread to other parts of the body. Dr. Rajesh Kumar Reddy Adapala, senior uro-oncologist led the surgery with surgical support from Dr. Dinesh, Dr. Nithyananda, Dr. Shifa and Dr. Srikanth. He was discharged on the third day after the surgery, Dr. C Mallikarjuna, MD, and Dr. PC Reddy, ED for AINU, said.

        "content": "Fortnite, the battle royale title, keeps introducing more and more crossover events for its fanbase. Epic Games’ title is laden with a variety of playable skins and there have been many unique collaborations across pop culture. A new leaked Fortnite survey has revealed that Epic Games has a long list of possible crossovers they might introduce in the near future, and there are some pretty exciting names on the list. The leaked Fortnite survey was posted on X by prominent data miner HYPEX (via X user JeayBR). It features a wild list of possible Fortnite collaborations that Epic Games might target to keep the party rolling in the game. This list contains the likes of Jessie Pinkman from Breaking Bad, and it would personally be a delight to see Pinkman do a 360-no-scope kill and the scenes would be wild indeed. NEW FORTNITE SURVEY !!️ Sukuna, Suguru Geto, Jessie Pinkman, Link, God of War 2005, Blue Lock, Spy x Family, Freddy Fazbear, PinkPanthress, CJ, Nicki Minaj, J Cole, Vinicius Jr, Johnny Depp, and more.. 👀 [Thanks for sending me this] — HYPEX (@HYPEX) God of War 2005 is mentioned, which is the first title in the God of War series. The classic, lean but muscular form of Kratos doing Fortnite celebrations? Bring it on. There are several fun names on this list including Real Madrid and Brazil superstar footballer Vinicius Jr., and Manchester City and Belgium footballer Kevin De Bruyne. Given that football players engage in Fortnite, it would be interesting if this collaboration becomes true and opens the door up for more crossovers. Actor Johnny Depp, and musicians Nicki Minaj and J Cole are also mentioned. A couple of anime such as Blue Lock, and Spy x Family are also apparently on Epic Games’ list for possible collaborations. Lethal Company-themed Fortnite collaboration The leaker also posted a potential Lethal Company-themed collaboration as Fortnite might soon introduce cosmetics based on the hit co-op horror indie game. The leaked image shows a Lethal Company-inspired suit, an oxygen tank back bling, alongside a pickaxe in the shape of a stop sign. LETHAL COMPANY x FORTNITE SKIN 🔥 — HYPEX (@HYPEX) While the possibilities seem endless, it is vital to remember that the leaked posts are not an official announcement that these collaborations would see the light of day, but the Lethal Company leak might just turn out to true, given HYPEX’s track record.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email In today’s fast world, smartphones have become an essential part of our lives, from managing work tasks to maintaining personal connections. However, as technology rapidly advances, it can be challenging to determine when to upgrade your phone. Knowing the signs that your phone is reaching the end of its useful life can help you make an informed decision, ensuring you’re not left behind by outdated technology or hindered by a device that no longer performs efficiently. Battery Life Deteriorates Significantly One of the most noticeable signs that it might be time to consider getting a new phone is when the battery life deteriorates significantly. If you find your phone can’t hold a charge throughout the day or requires multiple charges within a 24-hour period, it’s a strong indicator that the battery is nearing the end of its lifespan. While battery replacements are an option, they can sometimes be as costly as purchasing a new, basic smartphone, especially when combined with other aging phone issues. Phone Performance Slows Down Over time, you may notice that your phone doesn’t operate as smoothly or quickly as it used to. Frequent app crashes, slow response times when tapping or swiping, and a general delay in performance are common frustrations that signal it’s time for an upgrade. For iPhone users, consider the benefits of an iPhone trade-in . Many retailers and service providers offer programs where you can trade your old device for credit towards a newer model, making the upgrade more affordable and straightforward. Operating System Updates Are No Longer Supported Operating systems evolve to offer better security, more features, and improved performance. If your phone can no longer support the latest updates, it’s at a higher risk for security vulnerabilities and may not perform optimally. When manufacturers stop supporting updates for older models, it means your device is falling behind current standards. Upgrading to a newer model ensures that you benefit from the latest security patches and operating features, keeping your data safe and enhancing overall usability. Out of Storage Space Modern apps and updates consume a lot more storage space than ever before. If you find yourself constantly managing storage space—deleting apps, photos, or videos to make room for new content—it might be time to upgrade to a phone with more storage capacity. Persistent storage issues can hinder the functionality of your phone, affecting everything from capturing photos to downloading necessary software updates. Newer phones offer significantly larger storage options, and some even provide better solutions for cloud storage integration. Poor Photo Quality Smartphone camera technology has made substantial leaps over the past few years. If you notice that your photos and videos look grainy or poor in quality compared to newer models, or if you’re missing out on features like night mode, ultra-wide lenses, and better zoom capabilities, it may be worthwhile to upgrade. A new phone can dramatically improve your multimedia capabilities, which is particularly valuable if you rely on your smartphone for capturing important personal or professional moments. Screen Damage or Hardware Issues Physical damage can significantly affect your phone’s usability and aesthetics. If your screen is cracked, it can make reading and interacting with your device difficult, potentially leading to further issues like moisture damage or screen malfunction. Similarly, if the hardware buttons are unresponsive or the charging ports are unreliable, it compromises the functionality and safety of your device. While some of these issues can be repaired, the costs can add up quickly. Sometimes, investing in a new phone is a more economical and hassle-free solution. Connectivity Issues If you frequently experience problems with your phone’s connectivity, such as dropping calls, inconsistent Wi-Fi connections, or poor cellular reception where others do not, it may indicate a failing antenna or outdated network technology. Newer phones are equipped with the latest technology designed to offer more reliable connections and faster data speeds, essential for effective communication and internet usage in today’s digital age. Phone Regularly Overheats Phones may become warm during heavy use, but if your device regularly overheats, it could be a sign of internal damage or battery failure. Excessive heat can degrade your phone’s performance over time and in severe cases, might even pose a safety risk. Upgrading to a new model ensures you have a device that operates within safe temperature ranges and maintains optimal performance without the risk of overheating. High Repair Costs As your phone ages , the cost of maintaining it can become prohibitive. If you’re facing a significant repair bill, compare the cost of these repairs against the price of a new phone. Often, for the cost of one or two major repairs, you could purchase a new device with updated technology and a full warranty. This can provide better value for money in the long run and spare you from recurring repair issues. Better Technology Available Advancements in smartphone technology are continuous and often worth the upgrade. New phones offer improved cameras, faster processors, better screens, and newer features like facial recognition and waterproofing. If your current device feels outdated and is missing features that could benefit your daily life, it’s a clear sign to consider an upgrade. Embracing newer technology can enhance your productivity, provide better entertainment, and offer greater convenience. Conclusion Waiting too long to replace an old phone can often lead to frustrations and missed opportunities to benefit from technological advancements. Recognizing the signs that it’s time to upgrade—ranging from physical damage and poor performance to outdated technology—can help you make an informed decision. Keep an eye on these signs, consider your needs, and evaluate the financial options like trade-in programs to make getting a new phone a worthwhile investment. Upgrading your device at the right time can enhance your daily life by providing a faster, more reliable, and more enjoyable user experience.

        "description": "\"I don't think that you'll see these kind of high scores in the T20 World Cup, because there is no Impact Player Rule\": Mitchell Starc.",
        "content": "Put through the wringer in the IPL, can bowlers hope to breathe a bit easy in the T20 World Cup next month? The genesis of this question lies in the transformation that T20 batting underwent in the latest edition of the IPL. The 250-mark was breached only once in the league till this season, but teams went past that point eight times in the just-concluded edition. Many of the batters who led that revolution, such as Australian Travis Head and West Indian Andre Russell, will be seen in action in the ICC showpiece in the Americas next month. So, it's quite natural for fans to expect another batting waltz. But their approach cannot be as one-dimensional in the World Cup as it was in the IPL for a variety of reasons. To begin with, teams will not have the luxury of an Impact Player in the World Cup. So, they will have to be ready to switch to an attritional style of cricket as and when the situation demands. Mitchell Starc underlined that point after playing a big role in guiding Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL title. \"There is an Impact Player Rule here (in IPL) and not in the T20 World Cup. You are going to rely more on your all-rounders. You cannot put your batting all-rounder at No. 8, like you did in the IPL. \"I don't think that you'll see these kind of high scores in the T20 World Cup, purely because there will be one batter less,\" said Starc. In the earlier part of the IPL, Chennai Super Kings used Shivam Dube, a pace bowling all-rounder, exclusively as a batter through the Impact Player rule, though he usually walked in at No. 4 or 5 in place of a bowler. Dube produced a couple of match-winning knocks against Royal Challengers Bengaluru and the Knight Riders. But in the World Cup, the left-hander will have to showcase his bowling skills too to get a slot in the eleven as vice-captain Hardik Pandya plays a similar role and remains the first-choice. Skipper Rohit Sharma has made that bit quite clear already. \"I will be expecting if we need Shivam to ball a few overs, he will. Same with Hardik, he has come and bowled whenever needed. All-rounders must do that whatever their role is,\" he had said after the announcement of India's squad. However, that's just one part of the story. The batters will also have to negate pitches that will be very different from the ones they got used to in the IPL. \"The West Indian pitches are no longer what they used to be in the '80s or in the '90s. They are now slower, and at times gripping,\" a veteran curator told PTI. \"I am sure the bowlers, particularly spinners, will have much more say than in the IPL, especially from the second week of the tournament. \"India have included four spinners in their squad. It was maybe because of the nature of the pitches in the West Indies. Hence, I don't think we may see all those 250 totals there,\" he added. In the USA, only Florida has prior experience in hosting high-profile cricket matches. New York and Texas are bracing for their maiden foray into the sport Will that have an impact on the scoring rate? \"Yeah! it can be as initially the teams might be looking to assess the pitch and other conditions. I think these drop-in pitches that are being used in some of these venues are more consistent than the natural pitches. So, we may see a few high scores in that round,\" he said. David Warner, who has immense experience in playing international and franchise cricket in the West Indies, concurred. \"The pitches in the Caribbean being dry, the ball will get roughed up and it's going to spin. I don't think they're going to be as compact as they are here (in the IPL). The lacquer on the ball is staying longer (in IPL) and hence it's not getting chewed up and hence very little turn on offer. \"I've played a lot of cricket over there and played in the CPL (Caribbean Premier League). The wickets tend to get lower and slower,\" Warner pointed out. The average run-rate in this IPL was a whopping 9.56, the highest ever in the history of the tournament, and the average score remained upwards of 180. The average first innings score in Hyderabad was in the vicinity of 230. However, the stadiums in the West Indian islands are cut from a different cloth as some statistics will reveal. The average T20 score in Antigua is a dawdling 123 and at Barbados it is 138. It is even bleaker in Guyana at 124, at 115 in Trinidad and at 118 in St. Vincent. Gros Islet tops the chart with a princely 139. By the look of things, the bowlers are set to be royalty in T20 at least for a month.",

        "content": "Presenter returned to TV this morning he and wife were parting ways. However, despite their plans for a divorce after 14 years of marriage, the 64 year old was still wearing his wedding ring. Eamonn said the support shown by fans following the announcement had \"meant so much\" to himself and Ruth. He explained: \"Just before we move on we'd just like to thank people for your support for Ruth and I over the last few days as to the news of our separation. Your support for both of us is very much appreciated.\" On Saturday, a spokesperson for the couple told The Sun on Sunday they had called it quits. They said: “Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.” Ruth - who is yet to comment on the split - and Eamonn While a reason for their divorce has not yet been revealed by Ruth nor Eamonn, a number of reports are swirling on what caused the relationship's demise. Claiming that Eamonn's health battle has played a large part in the relationship, one source has explained that Ruth felt more a 'carer' than wife. A friend of the couple has now claimed: \"Ruth has become more his carer than a wife. Eamonn has been thoroughly miserable.\" Talking to , they continued: \"He has had a torrid time with his health, he's in constant pain, and the truth is he can't contain how miserable it makes him.\" Continuing that Ruth began to get the brunt of his frustrations, the source explained that the dynamic became too much for the couple. They added: \"In the end it just started to get her [Ruth] down more than she could accept. She needs her own life. It's a case of her wanting to get out and enjoy herself. Women at Ruth's age realise that they only have ten, 20, 30 years max left and they want to have some fun.\"",

        "content": "In den vergangenen acht Jahren entwickelte sich das Crankworx-Festival zu einem richtigen Besuchermagneten. In gut zwei Wochen findet die achte und damit letzte Auflage in Mutters statt. Der Vertrag läuft aus, bestätigte Veranstalter Georg Spazier. Dabei sei es eher zufällig, dass das Vertragsende mit der Umwidmung der Flächen und dem Baustart in den kommenden Monaten zusammenfalle. Veranstaltung soll wenn möglich in Tirol bleiben Noch laufen Verhandlungen darüber, das Event an einem anderen Platz in Tirol durchzuführen. Immerhin sei die Werbewirkung von Crankworx enorm, so Peter Paul Mölk, der Obmann des Innsbruck Tourismus. Wenn man das Event nun weiterziehen lasse, sei das schade. Aber das Event an einen Ort hineinzuzwängen, wo es nicht hinpasse, davon habe man nichts. Es müsse schon Sinn machen, so Mölk: „Das muss dann schon wieder aus einem Guss sein, wo man sagt, genau da können wir das transportieren, was uns wichtig ist und auf das wird man sicher schauen.“ Bei der diesjährigen Ausgabe in Mutters gibt es einige Änderungen. Es gibt zwei neue Strecken und erstmals starten sechs Frauen im Slopestyle – unter anderem die Deutsche Kathi Kuypers – die in Tirol trainiert. Start für die Crankworx World Tour ist am 12. Juni, das Festival dauert bis 16. Juni. Mit dabei sind Athletinnen und Athleten aus rund 30 Nationen.",

        "description": "Annabel Nugent and Louis Chilton pick out 15 of the most surprising finales ever to grace our screens – expect major spoilers ahead",
        "content": "T here are many things that go into a memorable season finale : mystery; pace; character development. More often than not, however, audiences want a surprise – something intriguing enough to justify carrying on next season. Some of the most shocking moments in TV history have come during season finales. With another instalment on the horizon, there’s no need to offer audiences catharsis or resolution – if anything, the best season finales actively deny viewers those feelings. And the most straight-forward way of doing that? A good shock, usually followed up with a cliffhanger: a one-two punch that guarantees return customers. Shock value – while not always equatable with great storytelling – will always provoke some Twitter conversation in its wake. Look at the recent conclusion to season four of ITV’s Unforgotten – a masterclass in detonating a perfectly timed cataclysmic plot-bomb. But countless others before Unforgotten have triumphed in the art of shock too. Here’s our selection of the 15 most shocking season finales of all time... (As is to be expected, MAJOR SPOILERS lie ahead! You have been warned!) 15) Unforgotten, season four Viewers were left open-mouthed by the conclusion to Unforgotten ’s fourth season, which saw DI Sunny Khan (Sanjeev Bhaskar) solve the case of Matthew Walsh’s death, only to learn that his partner, Nicola Walker’s DCI Cassie Stuart, had succumbed to injuries she sustained in a car accident. Shortly after the episode aired, ITV confirmed that the series was renewed for a fifth series, which will see Sunny paired with a new partner – Cassie is gone, but certainly won’t be forgotten. 14) Spooks , season 10 British spy drama Spooks finally came to an end in 2011, having run on BBC One for nine years. The season 10 finale featured no shortage of incidents, but fans will most remember the tragic death of Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker) in the arms of Harry Pierce (Peter Firth). The unfortunate and surprising nature of Ruth’s death – being stabbed with a shard of glass while trying to stop Sasha Gavrik from killing Harry – made this finale a savage blow for many Spooks fans. 13) Buffy the Vampire Slayer , season five Buffy was another show that liked to end its seasons with a bang. Season two saw superpowered schoolgirl Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) stab her vampire boyfriend in the heart, while season three saw her destroy her high school during a fight with the town’s demonic mayor. But season five remains the most shocking finale of all, as Buffy ended up sacrificing her life to save the world. The character was ultimately brought back early in the next season, but ending on the sight of Buffy’s tombstone made this episode a shocker for the ages. 12) Line of Duty, season three You’re pretty much guaranteed high drama in every Line of Duty finale – but the closer to season three probably stands above them all. Too much happened in the episode to aptly summarise here, but the excitement peaked when duplicitous DI Matthew Cottan (Craig Parkinson) was caught out by Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure), and managed to escape capture – only to be shot dead by his associates, jumping in the way of gunfire to save Fleming’s life. This unexpected moment of redemption capped what might be the finest season of Line of Duty to date in gripping, explosive style. 11) Game of Thrones , season five By the time season five rolled around, viewers knew that no character was safe from George RR Martin’s death grip but still Jon Snow’s murder came as a surprise. But bar the ending’s shock value – which fans of the book had already anticipated anyway – Jon’s “death” was almost instantly reversed in the second episode of the next season when he is resurrected by Melisandre. The event ended up having little consequence on the rest of Game of Thrones and actually undermined the show’s no-holds-barred approach to death that it had successfully set up in previous seasons (ahem... The Red Wedding). 10) Breaking Bad , season four Breaking Bad ’s fourth season saw the series’ best villain – fastidious meth baron and fried chicken restaurateur Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) – meet an appropriately memorable end. The deadly cat-and-mouse game that Walter (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse (Aaron Paul) had been playing with Fring all season had one final surprise in store, as the pair recruit the help of the loathsome Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis) to blow their nemesis in half. If that weren’t enough, the episode also deployed a shocking last-minute twist, as it hinted that Walt is responsible for poisoning the six-year-old son of Jesse’s girlfriend, Andrea.

The last scene sees Kevin Spacey’s machiavellian Frank Underwood entering the Oval Office, kicking away his incumbent’s chair and rapping his knuckles on the table. Cliché? Maybe, but still gratifying to watch. More shocking than Frank’s new presidency, however, was the prospect of Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) showing any semblance of emotion. The sight of Frank’s ruthless partner-in-crime crying while perched on the staircase was the finale’s truly shocking moment. 8) Lost , season three After three seasons of Lost , audiences had grown extremely familiar with the flashbacks format of the show – so when creator Damon Lindelof flipped the script on us, we didn’t see it coming. The two-hour long special interspersed what we thought were cursory flashbacks, only for them to be revealed as “flashforwards” in a surprise twist ending. The flash sequences, in which Jack is depressed, addicted to Oxycodone and wishing to return to the island, take on a new meaning in this new, disturbing light. Suffice to say, the third series finale went down with fans a lot better than the show’s actual end three seasons later. 7) Homeland , season one Throughout the entire first season of Homeland , you’re left guessing whether or not Damian Lewis’ US Marine Nicholas Brody had in fact returned to the US as a radicalised terrorist. In the high-octane finale, it is revealed that Brody was in fact recruited by al-Qaeda, and had been planning a large-scale attack. A malfunction with his bomb jacket prevents him from going through with it, however, and the character ultimately survives for another two seasons – before another shocking finale saw Brody executed by Iranian authorities. 6) The West Wing , season four Aaron Sorkin went out with a bang on his final episode as writer of the political drama before he left in 2003. The hour-long episode sees Bartlet (Martin Sheen) invoke the 25th Amendment – in which the vice president steps in if the president is unable to do their job – after his daughter Zoe (Elisabeth Moss) is kidnapped. Given that the VP office is vacant due to John Hoynes’s sex scandal, this allows the Speaker of the House, Glen Allen Walken, to assume power, telling Barlet: “You are relieved, Mr President.” Chills. 5) Battlestar Galactica , season three The Sci-Fi Channel’s Battlestar Galactica reboot had fans reeling at the end of its third season, when it was revealed that four of the show’s popular characters had in fact been Cylons (the robotic nemeses of humanity) all along. Previously unaware of their identities, Chief Tyrol, Samuel Anders, Saul Tigh, and Tory Foster all come to the simultaneous realisation about their identities in a montage set to “All Along the Watchtower” – a moment that had massive ramifications throughout the remainder of the series. 4) Dexter, season four The most surprising series finales often coincide with the most heartbreaking, which was certainly true of Dexter ’s fourth series. Fans will remember the scene perfectly: Dexter comes home to find his wife Rita dead in the bathtub, murdered by Arthur (aka The Trinity Killer, played brilliantly by John Lithgow). While there were a few clues interspersed in the minutes leading up to the tragic reveal – the baby crying, lingering shots – Rita’s death was one of the biggest shocks to rock Noughties TV. 3) 24 , season one There was hardly a dull moment on 24 , a viewing experience that can be compared to a day-long heart attack. But out of all the twists and turns, it is hard to live up to the bombshells dropped at the end of its first season. Not only was Nina Myers, the distinguished federal agent and confidante of our hero Jack Bauer, revealed to be the mole selling government secrets – but in her attempts to keep her cover she murders Jack’s wife Teri. Cue the hysterical crying. 2) The Good Place , season one There are few shows that actually catch you by surprise. Most of the time, the viewer has some inkling that a twist is on the way, but it’s safe to say that jaws dropped worldwide at the season one finale of The Good Place . We found out that despite appearances, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) and her cohort aren’t living it up in heaven but are actually the victims of a newfangled means of torture in hell. Even the film’s cast – minus Bell and Ted Danson – weren’t clued in on the afterlife-altering twist. 1) Dallas, season three It was the season finale to end all season finales. The third season of CBS’s hit Texas soap opera Dallas concluded with the shooting of amoral oil baron JR Ewing (Larry Hagman) by an unknown assailant. For eight months (between the airing of \"A House Divided\" in May 1980, and the start of the fourth season in October), the character’s fate and shooter were left in limbo. The US was consumed with the mystery of “Who shot JR?” The episode left a lasting imprint on pop culture; years later, the famous cliffhanger was still being parodied on series like The Simpsons , which ended its sixth season with “Who Shot Mr Burns?”",

        "content": "Un accord sur la mise en place du « dispositif territorial pour la prise en charge des enfants en situation de précarité » a été signé lors d’une cérémonie organisée lundi à Rabat à l’occasion de la Journée nationale de l’enfant. Signé par la ministre de la Solidarité, de l’Insertion sociale et de la Famille, Aawatif Hayar, le président du Ministère public, El Hassan Daki et les représentants d’autres départements ministériels, ce protocole dont les dispositions s’appliquent sur tout le territoire national vise notamment à renforcer la coordination entre l’ensemble des intervenants dans le domaine de la protection de l’enfance. L’accord signé en présence de représentants du Fonds des Nations Unies pour l’enfance (UNICEF) aspire à une meilleure protection des enfants en situation de précarité, à travers l’élaboration d’un document référence qui trace le processus de prise en charge de cette catégorie. La cérémonie de signature de ce protocole a eu lieu lors d’une rencontre organisée par le ministère de la Solidarité, de l’Insertion sociale et de la Famille, en partenariat avec la présidence du Ministère public et avec le soutien de l’UNICEF pour présenter le deuxième programme national exécutif de la politique publique intégrée pour la protection de l’enfance 2023-2026. Ce document définit les missions et les responsabilités de chaque intervenant, ainsi que la qualité des services à fournir à chaque enfant en fonction de sa situation, tout en garantissant la convergence et la complémentarité des interventions. Il couvre aussi toutes les catégories d’enfants en situation de précarité, y compris les enfants en situation difficile, les enfants délaissés et ceux exposés à la négligence, à la violence, à l’exploitation et au mariage précoce. Sont également concernés les enfants en conflit avec la loi et les enfants victimes d’actes criminels, quelle que soit leur nationalité. La finalité de cet accord est d’assurer à toutes ces catégories une meilleure protection qu’elle soit sociale ou judiciaire. Dans une allocution de circonstance, Mme Hayar a souligné la mobilisation de tous les intervenants, gouvernement, associations, enfants et acteurs territoriaux, dans ce chantier majeur sous le leadership de Sa Majesté le Roi Mohammed VI qui accorde une attention particulière à la protection des droits de l’Homme en général et des droits de l’enfant en particulier, ainsi qu’avec l’adhésion effective de SAR la Princesse Lalla Meryem, Présidente de l’Observatoire national des droits de l’enfant. La ministre a également mis l’accent sur la mobilisation de son département dans le cadre de la stratégie « GISR pour un développement social inclusif, innovant et durable » et son ouverture continue sur tous les partenaires nationaux et internationaux en vue de contribuer à l’aboutissement des chantiers engagés par le Royaume en matière de promotion des droits de l’enfant. Evoquant les réalisations du ministère, Mme Hayar a cité la généralisation de la mise en place de dispositifs territoriaux intégrés pour la protection de l’enfance dans toutes les provinces, le but étant d’instaurer un système inclusif à même de prémunir les enfants de toutes les formes de violence, d’exploitation et de négligence. Elle a, de même, relevé que le Royaume a réalisé de “grands progrès” dans le domaine de la protection de l’enfance malgré des défis et contraintes qui appellent un effort conjugué de l’ensemble des intervenants, y compris les mécanismes gouvernementaux, les institutions et organismes nationaux, la société civile et les collectivités territoriales. L’objectif, selon la ministre, est de renforcer la convergence des politiques et des programmes afin de contribuer au renforcement des mécanismes de l’Etat social. De son côté, le Procureur général du Roi près la Cour de Cassation, président du Ministère public, a indiqué que les lois nationales ont renforcé la protection des droits de l’enfant comme en témoigne l’adoption d’une politique publique intégrée en la matière qui vise à promouvoir les normes sociales de protection et à renforcer les instances territoriales chargées de les protéger. Il a fait remarquer que les services de justice n’ont pas été en reste dans cet effort visant à faciliter l’accès des enfants à la protection judiciaire, sans se soucier des raisons qui les ont mis en contact avec la loi, citant à ce propos le renforcement des rôles des cellules d’accueil des femmes et des enfants dans tous les tribunaux du Royaume, ainsi que le rôle des commissions régionales et locales qui veillent à la coordination avec les différents départements gouvernementaux et non-gouvernementaux concernés par la protection des enfants. Concernant le “dispositif territorial pour la prise en charge des enfants en situation de précarité”, M. Daki a précisé que cette initiative tient compte de toutes les étapes qu’un enfant en besoin de protection peut traverser, en commençant par la prévention comme mécanisme essentiel à même de lui épargner le contact avec la loi. Pour sa part, le ministre de l’Education nationale, du Préscolaire et des Sports, Chakib Benmoussa, a indiqué que son département s’est engagé dans la mise en oeuvre des politiques et programmes gouvernementaux relatifs à la protection de l’enfance et a contribué à la mise en œuvre de tous les droits de l’enfant stipulés dans la Convention des Nations Unies afférente, notamment en ce qui concerne l’éducation, la formation et la santé. Il a estimé que la mise en place d’un dispositif national unifié pour la prise en charge des enfants permettrait notamment d’améliorer les services fournis aux enfants et de garantir leurs droits. Dans la même veine, le ministre de l’Intégration économique, de l’Entrepreneuriat, de l’Emploi et des Compétences, Younes Sekkouri a mis en avant l’importance de ce dispositif qui va permettre de réunir les conditions propices à l’intégration économique de l’enfant dès qu’il atteint l’âge légal. Abondant dans le même sens, le ministre de la Jeunesse, de la Culture et de la Communication, Mehdi Bensaïd, a indiqué, dans une allocution lue en son nom par la directrice de l’enfance et des affaires féminines au département de la Jeunesse, Kaoutar Mansouri, que cette rencontre se veut l’occasion pour réaffirmer l’engagement du Maroc en faveur de la promotion des droits de l’enfant. Il s’agit aussi de faire le point sur la mise en oeuvre des politiques et programmes nationaux y afférents, tout en renforçant les acquis engrangés par le Royaume en la matière. La représentante de l’UNICEF, Speciose Hakizimana, elle, a estimé que cette rencontre constitue une étape importante dans le processus de renforcement du système national de protection des enfants. Elle a, à ce propos, mis en avant la pertinence de la politique intégrée pour la protection de l’enfant et son programme national exécutif ainsi que le protocole cadre pour la prise en charge des enfants en situation de précarité ou en contact avec la loi.

        "content": "'We're Southern, born and raised, and we would never let a female walk to their car by herself,\" his brother states General Hospital actor Johnny Wactor was protecting his female coworker when he was fatally shot on Saturday (May 25) morning in Los Angeles , his brother has revealed. Grant Wactor, the younger brother of Johnny, spoke to Daily Mail yesterday (May 27) about the tragic incident. He said Johnny had finished his side job as a bartender and left his place of work with a coworker when “he came across [the three men] and he thought his truck was being towed”. “So he said something to the guys, like, ‘Hey, are you towing?’ And then once he turned around, he saw what was happening and he put his coworker behind him,” Grant recounted. “And that’s when they shot him.” The younger Wactor confirms that his brother was shot in the chest as he protected his coworker. The armed thieves were reportedly attempting to remove a catalytic converter from Wactor’s vehicle. Grant was told by police that Johnny did not fight the thieves, opting instead to back away and protect his coworker as the shot was fired. Grant told Daily Mail he’s unsurprised his brother looked out for his coworker during the incident. ‘We’re Southern, born and raised, and we would never let a female walk to their car by herself,” he said. Upon initial news of his death, tributes from former colleagues poured into social media – his agent David Shaul called Wactor “not just a talented actor” but a “real moral example to everyone who knew him.” NBC4 followed up yesterday with responses from Wactor’s friends in the industry. “This guy deserved the front page on Deadline for his talent, his skill and his art – not this,” said actor Micah Parker, who recently worked with Wactor on his now-final project. “I’m very angry that this kind of stuff is tolerated.” Parker shared a still image of the two from the project, which was left unnamed in the post. “RIP big dog. Heaven got a real one,” he writes. “Long live the legend of Johnny Wactor.” A post shared by Micah Parker (@micahjoeparker) Film director Mike Silver, who worked with Wactor on his 2016 short film The Interrogation , told NBC4 : “This guy was just a true team player. He had no sense of his celebrity or what he had accomplished. He was always just wide, curious and interested.” NBC4 also reports that Wactor had frequently taken part in the Hollywood actors’ strike of 2023, which ended in November .",

        "content": "KASSEL/MÜNCHEN (dpa-AFX) - In Kassel schätzen sich die deutschen Großstadtbewohner einer Umfrage zufolge als am glücklichsten ein. Die nordhessische Stadt schafft es in einem Ranking unter den 40 größten Städten mit je mehr als 200 000 Einwohnern auf Platz 1. Dahinter folgen Erfurt und Aachen, wie aus dem \"Glücksatlas\" der Süddeutschen Klassenlotterie (SKL) hervorgeht. Schlusslichter der Auswertung sind Rostock, Karlsruhe und Wiesbaden. Für das Ranking hat das Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach insgesamt 25 557 Einwohner zwischen Januar 2021 und April 2024 befragt. Da in allen Städten im Zeitverlauf gleichmäßig befragt wurde, können Corona-Effekte den Angaben zufolge ausgeschlossen werden. Gewertet wurde, wie die Befragten ihre Lebensqualität wahrnehmen, keine Rolle spielten objektive Kriterien wie Einkommen, Infrastruktur oder Grünflächen. Ein Vergleich des Glücksindex mit von den Forschern ausgewählten objektiven Indikatoren zeigt jedoch, dass sich die Menschen in den gut platzierten Städten glücklicher fühlen, als sie eigentlich nach messbaren Kriterien sein müssten. \"Die Spitze des Glücksrankings bilden überwiegend kleinere, beschauliche Städte\", sagte Umfrageleiter Bernd Raffelhüschen von der Universität Freiburg. \"Keine dieser Städte ist besonders wohlhabend, bei den Wohlfahrtsindikatoren liegen sie nur leicht über dem Durchschnitt. Vielmehr vereint diese Städte eine eher kleinstädtische und familiäre Atmosphäre, oft ein studentisches Umfeld, außerdem sind sie eher ruhig, besitzen viele Grünflächen und haben eine gute Luftqualität.\" Umgekehrt finden sich Städte, die nach den laut \"Glücksatlas\" objektiven Kriterien ganz oben sein müssten, wie München, Freiburg im Breisgau und Karlsruhe, im Ranking auf mittleren bis schlechten Plätzen wieder. Die höchsten Effekte auf die Lebenszufriedenheit erzielten laut den Statistikern Städte mit einer guten Familien- und Bildungspolitik. Dahinter folgen Gesundheitsversorgung, Kaufkraft und Umweltqualität. Ein höheres Bruttoinlandsprodukt, mehr Kultur und Freizeit oder eine bessere Verkehrsinfrastruktur fallen den Angaben zufolge schwächer ins Gewicht./sax/DP/jha Zinsen: Ein Goldlöckchen-Szenario dauert nie ewig Währungen: Wie viel?

        "content": "Despite being just nine years old, has a surprisingly refined taste in food, as revealed by her mum, . While most children would typically prefer sweet-tasting snacks, this young royal's favourite nibble is decidedly more mature. Perfectly fitting for a member of the , Charlotte's culinary preferences are already quite sophisticated. Kate revealed her daughter's preferred snack during a visit to a school in North London back in 2019. During her visit to Lavender Primary School, Kate shared that \"Charlotte loves olives\". The Princess was at the school to commemorate Children's Mental Health Week and was asked to bring an item that 'makes her happy'. In 2018, revealed during a visit to Great Ormond Street Hospital that she loved munching on olives as a child, hinting that might have inherited her taste. \"I used to eat lots and lots of olives when I was little as well,\" she shared with a four year old patient. Elsewhere during her visit to the school, Kate shared that her three children love to help their mum out in the kitchen and enjoy getting their hands messy and working together. Their speciality is cheesy pasta, which they all have designated jobs in making. “One stirs the flour, one puts the milk and butter in,” Matthew Kleiner-Mann, chief executive of the Ivy Learning Trust, said after a visit to the school in 2019. “She was telling us how much her children love cooking and how they cook for her,” he added. While has such as avocados and green smoothies, there are a handful of other healthy treats that she always keeps well-stocked in her snack cupboard. Kate has been known for satisfying her hunger cravings by sticking with raw fruit and vegetables, including immune-boosting goji berries. She is also said to opt for popcorn, which can be a brilliant and tasty low-calorie snack to keep you going in between meals - as long as it is not coated in too much sugar.",

        "content": "El amianto, también conocido como asbesto, es un grupo de minerales fibrosos que ha sido ampliamente utilizado en la construcción debido a su resistencia al calor, durabilidad y propiedades aislantes. Sin embargo, a pesar de sus ventajas industriales, el amianto representa un riesgo significativo para la salud pública y el medio ambiente. La inhalación de fibras de amianto puede provocar enfermedades graves como la asbestosis, el cáncer de pulmón y el mesotelioma pleural. Debido a estos riesgos, la legislación sobre el amianto ha evolucionado para proteger la salud pública. En este contexto, el censo de amianto se ha convertido en una necesidad urgente para los ayuntamientos en España. La elaboración de este censo permite a las autoridades identificar la presencia de amianto en edificaciones y estructuras, facilitando su control y eliminación segura. Esto no solo ayuda a proteger la salud de los ciudadanos, sino que también cumple con las obligaciones legales impuestas por el Gobierno. El amianto es un material compuesto por fibras minerales que pueden descomponerse en partículas microscópicas. Estas fibras son peligrosas cuando se inhalan, ya que pueden alojarse en los pulmones y provocar daños irreversibles con el tiempo. Debido a su uso extendido en materiales de construcción como techos, paredes y tuberías, el amianto representa un riesgo omnipresente, especialmente en construcciones antiguas. El censo de amianto es una herramienta esencial para mitigar estos riesgos. Consiste en la identificación y registro de todas las edificaciones y estructuras que contienen amianto. Este inventario es vital para planear su retirada segura y controlar la exposición de la población a estas fibras dañinas. La Ley de Residuos 8/2022 establece un marco legal para la gestión de residuos, incluyendo el amianto. Esta legislación, que entró en vigor en 2022, impone a los ayuntamientos la obligación de elaborar un censo de amianto en sus respectivas jurisdicciones. La ley exige que los ayuntamientos identifiquen todas las construcciones y estructuras con contenido de amianto y mantengan un registro actualizado. El plazo original para completar este censo era de un año desde la implementación de la ley. Esto significa que, a más tardar a finales de 2023, todos los ayuntamientos deberían haber realizado el censo de amianto. No obstante, a pesar de esta obligación, muchos ayuntamientos enfrentan desafíos significativos para cumplir con esta normativa. A día de hoy, casi ningún ayuntamiento ha cumplido completamente con la obligación de realizar el censo de amianto. Diversos factores han contribuido a este incumplimiento, incluyendo la falta de recursos técnicos y financieros, así como la falta de personal formado y especializado en la identificación y manejo del amianto. Algunos ayuntamientos han iniciado el proceso, pero se enfrentan a numerosos obstáculos. La identificación de estructuras con amianto requiere inspecciones detalladas y la realización de pruebas específicas, lo que puede resultar costoso y laborioso. Además, en muchas ocasiones las autoridades locales no cuentan con el apoyo necesario para llevar a cabo estas tareas de manera eficaz. El primer paso para realizar un censo de amianto es la identificación de edificaciones y estructuras que potencialmente contengan este material. Esto puede incluir edificios públicos y privados, tanto residenciales como comerciales, así como infraestructuras como puentes o túneles. La identificación inicial puede basarse en registros históricos de construcción y en inspecciones visuales preliminares. Durante el censo de amianto, es crucial recolectar información detallada sobre cada edificación o estructura. Los datos específicos a incluir son: Estos datos permiten a los ayuntamientos planificar de manera efectiva la retirada y gestión segura del amianto, minimizando los riesgos para la salud pública y el medio ambiente. El censo de amianto trae consigo múltiples beneficios, tanto para la salud pública como para la gestión municipal. En primer lugar, mejora significativamente la salud pública al identificar y controlar las fuentes de exposición al amianto. Esto reduce la incidencia de enfermedades graves relacionadas con este material, protegiendo así a los ciudadanos. Además, cumplir con la obligación de realizar el censo de amianto reduce los riesgos legales para los ayuntamientos. Aquellos que no cumplan con la normativa pueden enfrentar sanciones y demandas legales, lo que puede tener un alto costo financiero y reputacional. Por otro lado, los ayuntamientos que cumplen con la ley no solo evitan estos riesgos, sino que también pueden acceder a subvenciones y ayudas gubernamentales para la gestión y retirada del amianto. Algunos ayuntamientos han logrado cumplir con las obligaciones del censo de amianto de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, el Ayuntamiento de Alcobendas en Madrid ha destacado por su diligencia en la identificación y gestión del amianto en su jurisdicción. Gracias a una colaboración estrecha con empresas especializadas y a la implementación de una política de comunicación transparente con los ciudadanos, han podido completar el censo dentro del plazo estipulado y han comenzado las labores de retirada del amianto de manera segura. Otro caso de éxito es el del Ayuntamiento de Bilbao, que ha desarrollado un programa integral de gestión de amianto. Han utilizado tecnología avanzada para la identificación de estructuras con amianto y han establecido un protocolo claro para su retirada y control. Gracias a estas iniciativas, Bilbao se ha convertido en un referente en la gestión del amianto, sirviendo de ejemplo para otros ayuntamientos. Para obtener más información sobre el proceso de censo de amianto y obtener asesoramiento especializado, se puede consultar el recurso del Censo de Amianto para Municipios . Este servicio ofrece información valiosa y apoyo técnico a los ayuntamientos que buscan cumplir con esta obligación legal de manera eficaz. En conclusión, el censo de amianto es una necesidad imperiosa para los ayuntamientos en España. No solo cumple con una obligación legal, sino que también representa un avance significativo en la protección de la salud pública y la gestión ambiental. A pesar de los desafíos, con el enfoque y los recursos adecuados, los ayuntamientos pueden implementar estos censos de manera efectiva, asegurando un entorno más seguro y saludable para todos.",

        "content": "In the digital age, our lives and businesses are intricately woven into the fabric of the online world. From financial transactions to client communications, much of our business activity takes place in the digital realm. Yet, many small business owners overlook a crucial aspect of estate planning: the digital estate. Digital estate planning is a critical aspect of overall estate planning for small business owners. Here, we outline essential considerations for your planning process. In the digital landscape, passwords are the keys to the kingdom. Many small business owners fail to keep track of their myriad passwords, leading to potential complications during estate settlement. Make a comprehensive list of all your online accounts, along with their passwords. Consider using a password manager to store this information securely. A few years ago, no legal guidance on dealing with digital assets existed. However, most states have passed a version of the Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA), which helps govern access to digital assets by fiduciaries in the event of incapacity or death. Ensure your estate planning documents, such as wills, trusts and powers of attorney explicitly address RUFADAA provisions. Designate a trusted individual to manage your digital assets and give them the legal authority to access and manage them on your behalf. Generally, digital asset ownership is first governed by the terms of service agreement set when you set up the account. Access to these assets post-death can be impacted by using an online digital estate tool and your estate documents. If you do not update these documents you will likely cut off access to many of your digital assets upon death, leaving a permanent mess for heirs. Designate fiduciaries, such as executors or trustees, and ensure they have access to your digital accounts. Provide them with usernames, passwords, and any additional authentication methods required to access them. Communicate your wishes regarding the management of these assets to your designated fiduciaries. And, let them know your wishes for digital assets whether to preserve, destroy, or transfer them. Angela Wagner, attorney, and wealth director for Bryn Mawr Trust says, “Today, with family living in other states and traveling, it is vitally important that those named to act in your Health Care and Durable General Powers of Appointment have access to those documents virtually. In an emergency, they can immediately act on your behalf.” Ensure that all your digital accounts are correctly titled in the name of your business entity. This is crucial for clarity and legal compliance, especially in the event of business succession or transfer of ownership. Review the ownership details of all your digital accounts and make updates to ensure they are properly titled in the company’s name. Guard against single points of failure by diversifying access to your digital assets. Avoid relying solely on a single individual to manage or access critical accounts. Instead, designate multiple trusted individuals and establish clear protocols for accessing and managing these assets in your absence. Digital estate planning is a critical aspect of overall estate planning for small business owners in the digital age. By proactively addressing issues, you can ensure the seamless transition of your digital assets and protect the interests of your business and loved ones. Consult with legal and financial professionals experienced in digital estate planning to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to your needs and circumstances.",

Provide them with usernames, passwords, and any additional authentication methods required to access them. Communicate your wishes regarding the management of these assets to your designated fiduciaries. And, let them know your wishes for digital assets whether to preserve, destroy, or transfer them. Angela Wagner, attorney, and wealth director for Bryn Mawr Trust says, “Today, with family living in other states and traveling, it is vitally important that those named to act in your Health Care and Durable General Powers of Appointment have access to those documents virtually. In an emergency, they can immediately act on your behalf.” Ensure that all your digital accounts are correctly titled in the name of your business entity. This is crucial for clarity and legal compliance, especially in the event of business succession or transfer of ownership. Review the ownership details of all your digital accounts and make updates to ensure they are properly titled in the company’s name. Guard against single points of failure by diversifying access to your digital assets. Avoid relying solely on a single individual to manage or access critical accounts. Instead, designate multiple trusted individuals and establish clear protocols for accessing and managing these assets in your absence. Digital estate planning is a critical aspect of overall estate planning for small business owners in the digital age. By proactively addressing issues, you can ensure the seamless transition of your digital assets and protect the interests of your business and loved ones. Consult with legal and financial professionals experienced in digital estate planning to develop a comprehensive plan tailored to your needs and circumstances. Jamie P.

        "content": "To most residents of Kujigbi, a remote settlement in Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), the most pressing challenge has been how to put three square meals on their table. They are more interested in anything that could provide an escape route out of poverty and hunger. Although residents of the community can be said to living very close to the seat of power in Nigeria, hunger and poverty had been a major enemy they contend with on a daily basis. They seem to have no connection with the sophistications that go with modern life because they lack access to social development and can be said to be disconnected from the larger society in Nigeria. Apart from hunger and poverty, the community, suffers from acute deprivation of basic social amenities. The people seem to have learnt to live their lives with or without government’s intervention. While they may not be presently facing food shortage, they definitely cannot boost of a resilient food system. However, they will live to remember this year’s United Nations’ World Food Day because the celebration has undoubtedly brought them the kind of message that soothes the heart. The message of the World Food Day, became more meaningful to them, when an Abuja based nonprofit organisation, Princely Kids Foundation and other partners stormed the community to propagate the ideals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which the celebration highlights. The event featured talks to sensitise the people about how to meet their basic food needs and meet the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Inside Abuja learnt that the Foundation deliberately chose the occasion of the World Food Day 2020 to highlight how food and agriculture are an essential part of the COVID-19 response, and how it could support the efforts towards economic recovery, especially for people who are limited by many socio-economic factors. Princess Jombo, who led the team to the community , stated that fighting hunger and poverty is an essential part of nation building. Jombo who struggled to hold back emotions on seeing the economic conditions of these rural people, called on privileged Nigerians to make more commitment towards empowering the less privileged members of the society. She said that an egalitarian society where citizens are empowered to actively participate in the governance process, cannot be achieved when basic needs of humanity like food and shelter remain an unaffordable luxury. She revealed that over the years, her Foundation with the support of some individuals and partner organisations have reached out to vulnerable communities, to bridge the ever widening gap between the poor and the rich. “Poverty breeds hunger and hunger breeds much more. We need to create a playing field for everyone, because we all need a chance for a better future. Let us empower each other to become much more,” she said. Jombo noted that when people have access to decent food, the mind would have been empowered to contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of their community. She explained that delivering food items to over 500 indigent residents in Kujigbi community was a part of the efforts of her Foundation and partners to support the well articulated objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) According to her, the noble objectives which the proponents of SDG seek to achieve cannot be left for the government alone, but must be the collective responsibility of all stakeholders. Jombo noted that her team identified the community as one of the most vulnerable segments of the population in dire need of assistance in Abuja. Inside Abuja learnt that the Foundation in collaboration with other partners were working out measures to reach out to more vulnerable communities both within the FCT and other parts of the country. It was further learnt that there were some programmes already articulated to meet special needs of vulnerable children and women in hard-to- reach remote villages across the country. “Today we stand with over 150 countries and we promote global sensitization and an undertaking for those who suffer from hunger and malnutrition. This day creates a view for us to look into our future. Let us grow, nourish, and sustain because together, our actions are our future. “Today, we take collective measures and we say no more. We say: NO! to hunger, NO! to poverty, No, No, No. The covid-19 pandemic has been a time to reflect. The World Food Day 2020 is a call for global cooperation and solidarity. This year gives clarity and explains the uttermost need to help the most vulnerable recover from the crisis”, Jombo said. Inside Abuja gathered that one of the critical points of SDGs is to fight hunger and poverty, with reliable dietary plans for rural families. Seeing the crowd of Kujigbi residents who gathered to receive food and other assistance from the visiting team, was a resounding evidence that hunger could be a more lethal weapon to humanity than the pandemic. The confessions of some residents of the community gave credence to the fact that what the rural people need to become productive members of the society, could just be food on their table. While Lukas Japhet said that the rice gift, members of the community received from the team was an unaffordable commodity to most of them, Esther Kunegi noted that many families had gotten an unquantifiable solace..",

Shafira Cendra Arini - detikFinance Selasa, 28 Mei 2024 16:15 WIB Menteri Perhubungan Budi Karya Sumadi/Foto: Shafira Cendra Arini/detikcom Jakarta - Menteri Perhubungan Budi Karya Sumadi bertemu dengan pejabat negara Asia Pasifik. Dalam pertemuan tersebut, dihasilkan Jakarta Declaration on Sustainable and Intelijen Urban Mobility. Budi Karya mengatakan, populasi dunia terus berkembang pesat dan pada 2050 diproyeksikan 2/3 penduduk akan tinggal di perkotaan. Hal ini menghadirkan tantangan yang berat terhadap transportasi, seperti kemacetan lalu lintas, kecelakaan, terhambatnya logistik, hingga polusi gas karbon. Oleh karena itu, menurutnya sistem transportasi cerdas dapat mengatasi masalah ini dan membantu mengatasi tantangan urbanisasi yang pesat, perubahan iklim, hingga kemajuan teknologi. Selaras dengan itu pula, disepakati pembentukan Deklarasi Jakarta untuk mendorong pengembangan transportasi cerdas di Indonesia. ADVERTISEMENT SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT \"Pagi ini kami para menteri, duta besar, perwakilan internasional dan juga beberapa pemerintah daerah melakukan diskusi meja bundar tingkat tinggi untuk berbagi pengalaman dalam mencapai visi mobilitas perkotaan berkelanjutan dan cerdas.

        "content": "Congress National President Mallikarjun Kharge said on Tuesday that if the INDIA bloc comes to power at the Centre, they will exclude agricultural equipment from the GST ambit. Addressing a press conference here today, Kharge targeted PM Modi-led BJP government at the centre and said that when farmers tried to enter Delhi to put forward their demands, tear gas shells were fired at them. \"Punjab and Haryana, despite having less land geographically, produce the most in the entire country. The country gets food from these two states. The farmers here think that their prices should be good and fair according to the MSP. Farmers agitated (2020-21) and put forward their demands before the BJP government. But still, the government did not agree. Tear gas shells were fired at them. The farmer remained sitting on the streets for the whole year,\" Kharge said. \"We will give legal guarantee to MSP which is one of our five Nyay (Justice),\" he added. The Congress President also mentioned that their government will also provide 10 kg of free grains to the people. \"Along with five Nyay, our party has also given 25 guarantees. We will give 10 kg grains free to the people. We will work to pay the crop insurance compensation amount within 30 days. We will exclude the agricultural materials from the GST ambit,\" he said. Various agricultural equipment currently attracts GST at 5-12 per cent. Further, Kharge pointed out the drug problem in the state and termed it as the biggest challenge for the future of Punjab. \"Today there is frustration among the youth of Punjab because the drug addiction here has become the biggest challenge for the future of the state. It is because of this, that law and order in the state is getting worse day by day. Farmers are selling their land and sending their children abroad due to the fear that they may fall into drug addiction because employment opportunities are not available here,\" the Congress President said. \"Demonetisation and wrong GST have caused great harm to the MSMEs of Punjab. If our government comes, we will make it very simple and whatever steps are required to run small-scale industries, we will implement them,\" he added.",

When will SEC approve spot eth ETF registration statements?*Nobody* knows for sure, but my expectation would be next few weeks.2-3 months max.IMO, heavy lifting already done following spot btc ETFs & eth futures ETFs.Just a matter of how long SEC wants to string this out. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) May 28, 2024 Geraci expected that the full approval of spot ETH ETFs might occur in the “next few weeks.” However, the ETF Store president suggested that the maximum time for approval can even be 2–3 months, adding: “IMO, heavy lifting already done following spot btc ETFs & eth futures ETFs. Just a matter of how long SEC wants to string this out. ” Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas remarked July 4th, Independence Day, could be a good “over/under.” Geraci replied that he appreciated the suggestion, noting that he believes the SEC will approve the S-1 filings from American asset management firms at least by July 4. With digital assets becoming a major political topic, an X user pointed out that the Democratic Party needs a win on cryptocurrencies with President Joe Biden’s approval rating declining against his competitor, Donald Trump. The approval of spot ETH ETFs would be the easiest way to win the confidence of digital asset enthusiasts, the user said. The post When Will You Buy Ethereum ETFs?

        "content": "By Lilit Marcus , May 28: A five-month-long slumber party. A college dorm. An introvert’s hell. Those are just some of the words residents of Antarctica use to describe life in the world’s coldest, most mysterious continent. In 1959, 12 countries - including Chile, Japan, Australia and the United States – signed the Antarctic Treaty, pledging that the seventh continent would only be used “for peaceful purposes only.” As a result, there are no military bases there, although military planes and ships can bring people and supplies. That means that only a few thousand humans can say that they have lived in Antarctica. And yet, despite bunking with strangers, taking 90-second showers and having zero privacy, there are intrepid travellers who believe all the challenges are worth it. Keri Nelson is one of them. The Minnesota native first went to the White Continent in 2007 to work as a janitor at McMurdo Base, one of the three US outposts there. Now a veteran of 16 Antarctica seasons, she has done stints at all three stations – in addition to McMurdo, the largest and most active, there are Amundsen-Scott Station at the geographic south pole, and Palmer Station, north of the Antarctic peninsula. “If I was going to describe it in musical form,” Nelson says, “I would say McMurdo was like gritty, dirty bluegrass and the South Pole was like symphony music and Palmer is like really corny, fun pop music.” Summer camp for grownups In the summer months from October to March, there can be as many as 1,000 people at McMurdo Base, from scientists to carpenters to dishwashers. Many support staffers have multiple jobs. For example, Evan Townsend, creator of the Antarctica Flag, worked in the kitchen, tended the bar and managed the craft room during his stint there. “It is an entire town,” Keri Nelson says of McMurdo. “You could go whole seasons and never meet a lot of people there, and it’s just very busy at those stations. It’s just bustle, bustle, bustle all the time.” That’s due to McMurdo’s size as the biggest base, but also due to the rotation of staff, since people will move between other stations or go out on expeditions and research trips throughout the season. While there are some modern amenities – a room for watching DVDs, a craft room, and a gym – the clubhouse feel of the base offers lots of opportunities for socializing. Nelson has organized fashion shows complete with a runway and played music in the “ice bands” that often form during a season. Just three kilometres (two miles) from McMurdo is New Zealand’s Scott Base, and sometimes staffers will make the trip across Ross Island to visit their US counterparts – joining in on their jam sessions, book club meetings and movie marathons. Some staffers even volunteer to teach classes in yoga, languages or other interests. Keri Nelson and friends stand at the Geographic South Pole marker at Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Keri Nelson “That was the thing that I learned in Antarctica, hip hop dancing and Thai massage,” says Chris Long. Long, who claims to be from “the most remote living family in New Zealand,” has spent more of his life living off the grid than on it. As a 19-year-old, he took a last-minute gig working in the galley (kitchen) of a Russian ice breaker ship going to Antarctica. He “absolutely hated” the job, but found his calling along the way. After those disastrous few months, during which the unforgiving waters of the Southern Ocean regularly sent the ship bobbing at 45-degree angles, Long was redirected into a job managing logistics for the scientists at Scott Base and now works as support staff for travellers who visit Antarctica by ship. It’s an unconventional life, spending half the year going back and forth across the notoriously chaotic waters of the Drake Passage to South America, but Long says he can’t imagine any other way to be. Laura Bullesbach (far right) and her colleagues at Port Lockroy. Bridie Martin-West/UKAHT The other side of the ice Laura Bullesbach doesn’t see anything of her own experience in the stories of fashion shows and book clubs. Her own Antarctic season, which concluded in March 2024, was more serene. She was one of half a dozen people staffing the world’s southernmost post office, UK Antarctic Heritage Trust-administered Port Lockroy. “The island is the size of a football field, so it’s tiny. And you live in a hut together where there are basically two rooms,” she says. “We don’t have any running water and therefore no showers, no proper flushing toilets, and you’re always on top of each other. “When I said goodbye at the airport to one of my colleagues, we hadn’t been without each other since the end of October for longer than maybe what it takes to take a shower on a ship. You’re close friends and you’re roommates and you’re colleagues and it’s everything at once.” One common misconception, Bullesbach says, is that life on the remote continent is boring. At Port Lockroy there were daily tasks that kept everybody busy, from basic life admin like taking turns cooking meals to more serious tasks like surveying the water for any plastic that may have washed up and keeping track of the island’s penguin colony. Plus, there’s an educational component. When private, scientific or commercial ships visited Port Lockroy, which is the first scientific base established by the UK in Antarctica, Bullesbach and other team members would go on board to give educational talks, sell souvenirs and pick up mail. But there were perks – they could often use the onboard showers and sometimes, there were fresh fruits and vegetables they could take back to the island to supplement their supply of tinned and dried foods. Competing for the opportunity to clean up puke Unless you’re a scientist in a very specialized field, your best bet for living in Antarctica is by applying for a support role at one of the stations. Nelson was so gung-ho about going to the White Continent that she went to Denver to attend a McMurdo job fair. After initially being rejected for a job as a dishwasher, she emphasized her training as a registered nurse when applying to be a janitor. One of the interview questions, she says, was “What’s the grossest thing you’ve ever cleaned up?” It worked. Since that first stint as a cleaner, Nelson has held a variety of Antarctic jobs, eventually working her way up to a station administrator. The pay was low, but Nelson didn’t care. She wanted the experience of living in Antarctica, and she notes that despite the small paychecks, all meals, room and board, and transport to and from the continent are covered. Counting penguins is one of the roles Port Lockroy staff have during their time in Antarctica. UKAHT But landing an Antarctica job isn’t just about having the right CV. Living in close quarters for long periods requires a certain kind of personality. “You can be an amazing engineer or scientist, but if you can’t live in a small hut or a small station with three other people or maybe on a station with 40 other people for the summer, then you’re no good for the job,” says Long. “Doesn’t matter how good you are at the job. Being able to fit in with the team is the most important. You don’t want to make enemies in that kind of environment.” When Bullesbach reached the final round of interviews for the Port Lockroy jobs, she and other candidates went out to a rural area for what she calls a “selection camp.” There, applicants were put into different teams and given assignments like building a tent while blindfolded. The purpose was two-fold: to measure everyone’s practical skills and abilities while also judging how well they could problem-solve and work with others. Another consideration for working “on the ice” is what country you’re from and if your country has a base in the Antarctic. Bullesbach is German, but she has the right to work in the UK, which made her eligible for the Port Lockroy job. However, if you’re not a citizen of a country with an Antarctic program there are still some options to spend time in Antarctica, mostly by working in tourism. Once you get the Antarctica bug, Long and Nelson say, it’s pretty hard to get rid of. Getting in the first time is difficult, but since so few people have Antarctica work experience it’s easier to keep returning after multiple seasons. One member of Bullesbach’s team, Clare Ballantyne, had a previous season at Port Lockroy under her belt and served as a mentor to some of the first-timers. “My expertise is living and working in the most uninhabitable places on Earth,” Long says. “[A resident] might be a scientist, very smart person, knows a whole lot about whatever their area of expertise is, but if you send them down to Antarctica, they’re gonna die tomorrow. So you need someone who is good at looking after and training people to live in that environment.” Planning for every eventuality It’s one of the most common questions for someone about to move to Antarctica: what to pack? For Bullesbach, the answer was “not much.” She and her colleagues were limited to two bags each. “You have three jumpers, two pairs of trousers, lots of socks, and then that’s kind of enough,” she says. “Then we got to send a box down with some other personal stuff. Any kind of hygiene products we might need, we got to send down beforehand and then everyone brought one or two board games or stuff to keep us all entertained in the evenings.” Those living at larger and more established camps have the benefit of using what previous residents have left behind. At McMurdo, Nelson says, there was a lending library of books and DVDs, plus gear, clothing and other odds and ends that one might find useful. There were also medical supplies, from basic bandages and gauze to more serious equipment like a defibrillator. Electronics have also been helpful when it comes to packing for the edge of the world. Bullesbach could just bring her fully stocked Kindle instead of physical books to save space and, thanks to solar panels, there was always enough power to keep it charged. There was internet access at Port Lockroy thanks to Starlink, but the team voted as a group not to use their phones during mealtimes. Zodiac boats are one of the more common ways to travel or bring supplies to Antarctic bases. Keri Nelson Long says he’s also a minimalist. After some trial and error during his earlier seasons, he now has his packing routine down to a science. “Now I have the gear that I like, so I don’t need to take so many things. I have exactly the pair of salopettes that I like and the warm jacket that I like and the hat that I like. That way, the more you know your gear, the less that you have to think about yourself, the more you can do your job.” Still, there are risks in choosing to live and work in, as Long puts it, the most uninhabitable place on earth. At larger camps like McMurdo, there are trained medical professionals on base who can do a wide variety of procedures. But if someone needs a more serious operation or an urgent treatment, the patient will need to wait for a ship or boat to take them to the closest city – which could take anywhere from two to 10 days. Long gives several examples of serious injuries that happened in Antarctica. In one case, he says a cruise ship vacationer fell on the ice and broke her arm. Luckily, the onboard doctor was able to put her arm in a cast, and the traveller continued the next two weeks of the trip as planned. In a more serious case, a Russian scientist – who was also a medical doctor – realized that his appendix had burst and performed emergency surgery on himself. “He knew what he was doing and so he knew he was going to die if he didn’t. So he tried and he did it and lived,” says Long. “That’s what you do when there’s no other option.” Leaving the ice behind Antarctica can have a powerful spell on the people who visit. Both Nelson and Long say they can’t imagine not spending time there, and Bullesbach was already applying for a second expedition the week after returning from her first. Meanwhile, Nelson has launched a podcast, Antarctica Did That For Me, to share her experiences. In a fast-paced globalized world where everyone is on their phones all the time, Antarctica offers a rare opportunity to live a different kind of life. However, climate change is already affecting the seventh continent, and not only by shrinking glaciers. More and more countries who weren’t part of the initial Antarctic Treaty, namely China, are trying to lay claim to part of it as the planet warms. “[Antarctica] is set aside by treaty right now for science and peace and projects that benefit humanity. It’s one of the things I love personally about working in the program. It’s why I’m an Antarctica devotee,” says Nelson. “Stuff just keeps being taken from Antarctica. Information, ice, resources like seals and whales and fish,” Klaus Dodds, professor of Geopolitics at the University of London, told CNN in 2021. “Antarctica’s fragility, I think, represents the fragility of the wider world. I think the Antarctic represents, in essence, not just the idealism that the treaty represents, but it also represents the supreme contradictory nature of humanity more generally.” Nelson says that Antarctica gives her a sense of peace that she can’t replicate anywhere else. “When I’m there, I can feel exactly as tiny as I am in this universe, no smaller than I am in this universe, but no bigger.”",

Ce projet de morcellement date de 2012, avec trois phases, deux projets non clôturés (non-gated) et un clôturé (gated) . La centaine de familles qui ont construit des maisons dans les deux morcellements durant ces 12 dernières années vivent une scène de désolation depuis quelque temps. «C’est l’abandon total» , affirme un résident.

Après avoir reçu la pétition, nous avons averti les autorités de la situation.

        "content": "International donors led by the EU have pledged five billion euros ($5.4 billion) for Syrian refugees, as Brussels insisted they should not be \"pushed back\" to their war-torn homeland. An annual gathering hosted by the EU and chaired by its foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saw the European Union commit 2.12 billion euros for 2024 and 2025. That figure included 560 million euros already promised this year for Syrians displaced inside the country and in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, and the same amount for 2025. The bloc also pledged one billion euros for Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey. \"The situation in Syria is more dire today than one year ago. In fact, it has never been so dire and humanitarian needs are at all time high,\" Borrell said. \"Today 16.7 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance, the highest level since the start of the crisis over 13 years ago.\" EU humanitarian chief Janez Lenarcic said that on top of the five billion euros in grants, a further 2.5 billion euros was promised by donors in loans. He said the EU and its member states overall accounted for three quarters of the grants pledged. The United States said it had also pledged nearly 545 million euros ($593 million) in humanitarian assistance for Syria. Washington \"remains committed to assisting the Syrian people and encourages other donors to continue their support for Syrians,\" a State Department statement added. The donor drive came after the United Nations refugee agency warned its operations to support displaced Syrians remained \"significantly underfunded at 15 percent almost six months into 2024.\" \"While we welcome the pledges made today, the discussion remains far removed from the harsh realities Syrians face,\" Oxfam's Syria director, Moutaz Adham, said. \"Funding still fails to match the scale of needs and year after year, the number of people relying on aid grows.\" - Not be 'pushed back' - In the face of the shortfalls, regional countries hosting millions of refugees from Syria have been increasingly pushing for \"voluntary\" returns to the country. But Borrell cautioned about any efforts to make people move back to Syria. \"We make a warning about the so-called voluntary returns of Syrian refugees to Syria,\" he said. \"Voluntary returns mean voluntary. The refugees should not be pushed back to Syria.\" Borrell insisted that the international community should not \"incentivize this by any means.\" \"We consider that there is not the safe, voluntary, informed and dignified returns of refugees to Syria for the time being,\" the EU's top diplomat said. Syria's war has killed more than half a million people and displaced millions more since it erupted in 2011 after Damascus cracked down on anti-government protests. More than a quarter of Syrians live in extreme poverty, the World Bank said Saturday, 13 years into a devastating civil war that has battered the economy and impoverished millions. Borrell said that efforts to find a political solution to the conflict remained at an \"impasse.\" \"The Assad regime has shown no intention of engaging in any meaningful political process,\" he said. \"We request everyone, including partners in the region, to use their political leverage to encourage a renewed impetus on the political process.\"",

        "description": "Artistic, unorthodox and independent are three of the words curator Silke Schmickl uses to describe what’s coming in the inaugural four-day Asian Avant-Garde Film Festival at the M+ museum in Hong Kong.",
        "content": "The inaugural edition of the Asian Avant-Garde Film Festival at M+, Hong Kong’s museum of visual culture, begins on May 30 and offers a diverse four-day programme of screenings, exhibitions, performances, talks and workshops. Supported by the Chanel Culture Fund, the festival is a place for creators and the general public to discover “more nutritious” works – films, videos and artworks that are rich sources of inspiration – says Wing. by Wing Shya x nnscya brings together a range of the veteran photographer’s 35mm film images, some never seen in public before, alongside an experimental soundscape crafted by musician Nnscya, real name Annisa Cheung Ching-yu. The collaboration between two generations of Hong Kong creatives will be enhanced by interactive media artist Samson Wong Sing-wun, whose audio-reactive design technology will transform Wing’s photography in real time, in response to Nnscya’s performance. Wong, who has worked on international blockbusters including the Transformers and X-Men franchises, won the prize for best visual effects at the 55th Golden Horse Awards for work on Zhang Yimou’s (2018). Silke Schmickl, Chanel lead curator for moving image at M+, says the newly commissioned is an “unusual, machine-generated activation of still photography” with live-performed sound frequencies, in a collaboration that allows artists of different generations to “experiment with new formats and respond to each other’s sensibilities”. Before the performance of Wing’s work at sunset, the festival’s first-day afternoon programme will comprise screenings of “Touch Me, Touch Me Not” (a compilation of nine short films) and “Fearless & Fierce: the Female Gaze” (nine moving-image works), a screen-printing workshop with artist-printmaker Kinchoi Lam, and a vinyl-only DJ set. The screenings and workshop will repeat on each day of the festival. The festival’s main objective is to champion independent moving-image practices from across Asia, from original visual languages to cross-cultural dialogues, “and their interconnections with other art forms such as visual art, photography, design, performing arts and music”, says Schmickl. The festival, she adds, will highlight “formal and conceptual correspondences between historical and contemporary works” through various mediums, such as experimental and expanded cinema, performance films, investigational documentaries, and animation. “The films are indie, as the vast majority of them have been produced independently and without a commercial distribution purpose in mind, yet their artistic qualities and unorthodox nature set them apart from, let’s say, indie art-house cinema,” she says. “Avant-garde is a signifier for the experimental ideas and new approaches these artists introduced through their works at the time of their making.” Existing M+ collections informed the basis of the festival’s film selection, says Schmickl. “A good example is ‘Secrets and Lies’, a programme that features three speculative essay-films by award-winning M+ collection artists Ho Tzu-nyen, Bo Wang and Lee Kai-chung, who investigate chapters of Asia’s unresolved Cold War history using Hong Kong as a vantage point.” Other Asian artists to feature include Nick Deocampo, an award-winning filmmaker, film historian and pioneering advocate of queer cinema in the Philippines; Lu Yang, an internationally acclaimed, Shanghai-based new media artist; and Zhang Peili, a mainland Chinese contemporary artist and video art pioneer.",

        "content": "A NEW restaurant priding itself on serving “different flavours from different countries” has opened in Rhyl. Fulla’s Kitchen – Bar and Grill, based at 215 Wellington Road, celebrated its grand opening on Friday (May 24), having initially held a “soft opening” earlier last week. It has been opened by Rhyl resident Humphrey Muleba, who also runs the Fullaflavourz takeaway in the town, on Vale Road. Open from Wednesday to Sunday, the restaurant is seen by Humphrey as an “expansion” on Fullaflavourz. He said: “It’s been great so far. We’ve had great feedback on food and the menu, and people seem excited for something different in Rhyl, which excites us, as well. “Our menu is quite diverse – I love different flavours from different countries, and I think it’s great to have a place in Rhyl like that. There’s nothing quite like that in Rhyl. “Our Neapolitan-style pizzas have been really popular so far, and so have our South African Chakalaka tacos, and our cocktails. “Once we get all of our kitchen staff extremely familiar with the menu, we’ll slowly expand into opening more days a week. “This is like an expansion on Fullaflavourz; from a takeaway service to a dining experience.” Though bookings are preferred at Fulla’s Kitchen, the restaurant also accepts walk-ins. Its opening hours are 2-10.30pm on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays, and 2-11pm on Fridays and Saturdays.",

HORNBACH Gruppe bindet Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie erfolgreich in Konzernfinanzierung ein Bornheim (Pfalz), Deutschland, 28. Mai 2024. Die HORNBACH Gruppe (HORNBACH Holding AG & Co. KGaA; ISIN: DE0006083405) hat ihren bestehenden Konsortialkredit erfolgreich um eine Nachhaltigkeitskomponente ergänzt. Die im September 2022 vereinbarte Finanzierung über 500 Mio. EUR beinhaltete eine sogenannte Rendezvous-Klausel, welche die nachträgliche Verknüpfung der Kreditmarge mit konkreten ESG-Kennzahlen erlaubt. „Nachhaltigkeit ist eine der Kernvoraussetzungen für unseren langfristigen Erfolg und die Zukunftsfähigkeit der HORNBACH Gruppe. Ich freue mich sehr über diese für uns relevante, erfolgreiche Verknüpfung unserer Konzernfinanzierung mit unserer ESG-Strategie”, kommentierte Karin Dohm, CFO der HORNBACH Management AG. Mit Abschluss der ESG-Ergänzungsvereinbarung werden die Finanzierungskosten des Konsortialkredits nunmehr auch von drei sogenannten Key Performance Indicators beeinflusst, welche die Nachhaltigkeitsleistung des Unternehmens in den Bereichen CO2-Reduktion im eigenen Betrieb, Sortiment und Erhöhung des Anteils weiblicher Führungskräfte abbilden. Damit steht die Finanzierung im Einklang mit einigen der wesentlichen Handlungsfelder der Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie der HORNBACH Gruppe. „Nachhaltigkeit ist zu einem zentralen Faktor unserer Kundenbeziehungen geworden“, betonte Tim Austrup, Bereichsleiter Corporate Banking bei der Helaba. „Wir freuen uns deshalb sehr, dass wir die HORNBACH Gruppe bei der Entwicklung und Strukturierung der ESG-Komponente maßgeblich unterstützen durften.“ An der bis zu sieben Jahren laufenden Konsortialkreditlinie sind insgesamt neun Kreditinstitute aus dem In- und Ausland beteiligt. Die Strukturierung der Nachhaltigkeitskomponente wurde von der Helaba als ESG-Koordinator begleitet.

        "content": "Cyriel Dessers will undergo scans this week to determine the length of time he will be out of action after injury in the Scottish Cup Final defeat to Celtic on Saturday. The Gers manager Philippe Clement had to withdraw the 29-year-old forward during half-time at Hampden Park following an ankle injury, and Glasgow World reported that Dessers left the stadium wearing a protective boot on the right leg. Speaking post-match, Dessers said, “I got injured in the first half, after around 25 minutes, it’s my ankle. “I tried to go on because obviously it was the game of the year, the big final at the end of the season, one big push. But I had to come off. I’ll get it assessed in the next few days.” But Dessers injury may force Clement’s hand in his search for a new striker in the summer transfer window. If, as Clement expects, he has torn ankle ligaments, the Nigeria international may not be back in full training until the start of next season. Dessers has been the Gers’ focal point this season, particularly since Clement’s arrival at Ibrox in mid-October, and scored 22 goals in all competitions as the club’s leading striker However, his profligacy in the box has seen him receive significant criticism from both pundits and fans, particularly in recent weeks as the Gers’ push for the Premiership title fell away at the final hurdle. As such, despite breaking the 20-goal barrier during his debut campaign with the light blues, the consensus amongst pundits is that Clement must upgrade his attacking stocks this summer – a consensus established well before Dessers’ ankle injury. With Scotland’s player of the year Lawrence Shankland reportedly set to become the subject of a bidding war between the two Old Firm rivals, Rangers must ensure they win that particular race if they want to overcome Celtic next season. A fit-again Dessers playing in tandem with or as an alternative to Shankland would give Rangers an embarrassment of riches up front, and with Danilo and potentially Sam Lammers to add to the mix, the Nigerian’s ankle injury could prove to be a blessing in disguise for the Gers, forcing them to speed up their most necessary piece of summer transfer business.",

        "content": "From October 6 this year, people travelling to Europe will have to register their fingerprints and a photograph alongside their passport. The introduction of the new scheme for people travelling to and from the UK at airport and ferry terminals could cause delays of up to 14 hours, and the possibility of civil unrest, separate warnings from both sides of the channel have suggested. The European Commission says the new entry/exit system, known as the EES, is an automated IT system that will register travellers, visa holders and visa exempt holders every time they cross an EU external border. The system will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit. It will also record refusals of entry. The system will replace the current system of manual stamping of passports, which the commission say is time consuming, does not provide reliable data on border crossings and does not allow a systematic detection of those who have exceeded the maximum duration of their authorised stay. It will also prevent irregular migration, it is claimed. READ MORE: Girl, 12, scarred for life in 'prison napalm' accident READ MORE: Travellers to Italy warned over 'unexpected' tax The EES applies to anyone who is a non-EU national travelling to a European country using the EES for a short stay of up to 90 days within any 180 day period. Non-EU passport holders will register for EES — either at a kiosk or in-person with a border officer — on arrival in Europe. Eurostar passengers, those taking ferries at Dover or catching the Eurotunnel shuttle at Folkestone in Kent, will give their information on British soil. Last week David Cameron, the UK's foreign minister, warned of disruption to passengers. He said: “I think we’ve made some progress, but there are some big choke points at Dover and St Pancras — and I’m really worried about there being long delays for people. I think it’s clear to me that the technology still needs testing and improving.\" The new scheme could cause waits of up to 14 hours at border controls from Britain including the Port of Dover and St Pancras, where the Eurostar runs from. Ashford Borough Council told Parliament's European scrutiny committee that 14-hour delays were not \"unrealistic\" and that could be even longer if there were \"extra aggravating factors\" such as weather . Delays of up to 15 hours were recorded in summer 2022, Roger Gough, leader of Kent County Council said. There have been multiple episodes of gridlocked traffic at the Port of Dover and surrounding roads in recent years, with post-Brexit checks adding to waiting times. There is also a new warning that there could civil unrest at airports, according to French officials. The Times has reported today there are serious concerns about backlogs at airport arrival halls. The foreign secretary recently said he was “really worried’ about “long delays” for travellers. This has been echoed by officials in France, where there is increasing concern that “serious operational problems” could lead to backlogs of holidaymakers and a subsequent collapse of public order, The Times has reported today. Patrice Vergriete, a French transport minister, told aviation executives last week that he “fears problems”, adding: “We are aware of the risk in terms of passenger fluidity. It is a challenge and we must not get this wrong.” He added that “disruption to public order” could not be ruled out in event of long delays or a technology failure.

        "description": "Larry Bird and Bill Walton were close during the short time they were teammates.",
        "content": "Larry Bird’s affection for Bill Walton has never been a secret. While they played together only a short time, Walton was one of Bird’s favorite teammates. After Walton died Monday at age 71 after a battle with cancer. Bird issued a statement mourning his loss : “I am very sorry about my good friend, Bill Walton. I love him as a friend and teammate. It was a thrill for me to play with my childhood idol and together we earned an NBA Championship in 1986. He is one of the greatest ever to play the game. I am sure that all of my teammates are as grateful as I am that we were able to know Bill, he was such a joy to know and he will be sorely missed. My family and I extend our sincere condolences to the Walton family.” The fast friendship that emerged between the two men during their short time as Celtics teammates was well-chronicled. The gregarious Walton helped bring Bird out of his shell and even brought him to a Grateful Dead concert. Walton and Bird led Boston to the 1986 NBA Championship together before the recurrence of foot problems left to Walton’s retirement a year later. “If Bill could’ve finished his career from start to finish healthy, there’s no telling where he would be ranked in the best players ever,” Bird said in ESPN’s 30-for-30 on Walton.

        "content": "Jennifer Lopez has expressed her alarm after her image was used in fraudulent AI scams. The star, who is currently starring as the central character in Netflix's newest sci-fi flick Atlas - a film concerning issues of AI - voiced trepidations about technology's rapid progression, particularly considering her public persona. J-Lo, 54, remembered adverts falsely \"selling skincare that I know nothing about\", featuring doctored images of her face complete with aged wrinkles.

Right away we had them stealing our faces. So, yes, [AI] is really scary.\" However, she also acknowledged that AI carries potential benefits and encouraged a balanced perspective towards both its positive and negative aspects. She added: \"I think you should be respectful of AI...We have to be open to all possibilities.\" Emphasising on the last note, the Hustlers star said, \"These movies that are talking about AI - especially this one - do a really good job of showing both sides.\" As for 'Atlas', J-Lo, who portrays a data analyst employing AI to shield Earth from an evil robot played by Simu Liu, highlighted how the movie presents both sides of the AI debate. She clarified: \"I think this movie does a good job of showing how AI could go incredibly wrong, and this is how it could go really right.\" Recently, Jennifer made her worries known regarding the abrupt emergence of AI in our daily lives, while also discussing filming some of the film's more intense sequences. Speaking to Extra, she expressed her concerns: \"I am. I'm worried about that. I think it's a scary thing and we have to kind of be careful about it and really think about where it's going.\" She recalled her initial expectations: \"I thought it would be me, by myself, do the takes, be so fast, don't have to worry about anybody else not remembering their lines... First day, you're falling through the planets. It's all going crazy.\" Reflecting on the intense filming process, she said: \"Now, your leg's broke... It was so high-intensity every day, and without having another actor kind of to give you half the energy, it's just all you. I was exhausted.

        "description": "Results and guidance indicate consumers are under pressure.",
        "content": "2024 has been a great year for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite . But home improvement behemoths The Home Depot ( HD -0.55% ) and Lowe's Companies ( LOW -1.04% ) are down on the year after reporting weak guidance. Here's what's challenging both companies and whether either dividend stock is a buy now. A tough road ahead Expectations were low heading into recent reports by Home Depot and Lowe's. Home Depot has an extra week in its current reporting year. Once factoring that in, it was guiding for a slight decrease in sales and earnings . Lowe's was guiding for lower sales and profits as well . In its first-quarter 2024 earnings release, Home Depot reaffirmed weak guidance. Management discussed challenged consumer spending and a tight housing market as reasons for low margins and a sluggish overall performance. Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail said the following on the Q1 2024 earnings call: Home Depot only bought back $649 million in stock, compared to $2.89 billion in the same quarter last year. The decision to allocate more earnings toward cash instead of buybacks is a defensive signal for Home Depot investors. Lowe's is facing similar challenges. In its Q1 2024 earnings release, Lowe's said it is guiding for $84 billion to $85 billion in full-year sales and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $12 to $12.30. For context, it earned $86.4 billion in 2023 sales and an all-time high of $13.20 in diluted EPS. Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison said the following on the company's recent earnings call: Despite the challenges, Lowe's made progress in reducing its operating expenses and ensuring it was prepared for weaker quarters ahead. Follow the macro story Home Depot and Lowe's are similar yet different businesses. Home Depot, for example, has made sizable acquisitions in recent quarters and is going on the offensive during this slowdown, specifically pertaining to catering to professional contractors . But in general, both companies depend heavily on the business cycle, consumer spending, and macroeconomic factors affecting the housing market. It's one thing to listen to what a company says in a shareholder presentation or during an earnings call, and another to see if the data backs it up. A convenient aspect of Home Depot and Lowe's is that it's rather easy to see where the macro trends are going, and whether either company is facing a slowdown for business-specific reasons or is part of a broader slowdown. There are a lot of metrics to choose from, but some of my favorites are consumer credit card debt, home prices, and mortgage interest rates. US Credit Card Debt data by YCharts As you can see in the chart, U.S. consumer credit card debt has completely erased the progress made during the pandemic and is now at an all-time high. Meanwhile, mortgage rates have barely come down from their 10-year highs, and the Case-Shiller Home Price Index is now at an all-time high. The index measures residential real estate prices across the U.S. Let's take it a step further and look at the volume of home sales and housing affordability. US Existing Home Sales data by YCharts U.S. existing home sales are at around a 10-year low, indicating weak demand as potential buyers are discouraged by high interest rates and high prices. Perhaps the most useful metric is the U.S. fixed housing affordability index. This tool blends home prices and mortgage rates to gauge the affordability of a home with a 20% down payment. A level of 100 indicates that a family earning a median household income can afford a mortgage with a 20% down payment. Ideally, everyone could afford a home. Seeing the index hovering around a 10-year low around that 100 threshold is a bad sign, because it indicates fewer available buyers in the market and that housing is relatively unaffordable for many Americans. Home Depot and Lowe's benefit when people buy and improve homes, not when the market is bogged down by high interest rates and low demand. The narrative could reverse if consumers paid down debt and could afford discretionary expenses or if interest rates or housing prices came down. But for now, all the macroeconomic indicators are working against Home Depot and Lowe's. An opportunity for patient investors There's no sugar-coating it -- the stage is set for Home Depot and Lowe's to have poor near-term performances. Both stocks could continue slipping and fall out of favor among investors, even if the broader market continues to rally. However, the good news is that both companies are a good value and pay growing dividends. Home Depot has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.2 and a dividend yield of 2.7%, compared to a less expensive 16.8 P/E ratio for Lowe's but a lower yield at 1.9%. Again, Lowe's expects a more severe downturn than Home Depot. Historically, both companies have traded at around the same valuation, with Home Depot sporting a 22.7 median P/E over the last decade compared to 22.1 for Lowe's. Both stocks are not no-brainer buys, but they are reasonable buys at current levels. My preference leans toward Home Depot. It's the larger, more dominant player, and I like the long-term potential of its recent acquisitions. That said, investors should only consider either stock if they are comfortable with the possibility of a further sell-off and have the patience to endure a multi-year downturn.",

Plus de peur que de mal pour Laurent Paganelli. Ce vendredi 24 mai 2024, le célèbre consultant de Canal + a été victime d'un malaise alors qu'il assistait au match 2 des play-off de Ligue 2 qui opposait Saint-Étienne à Rodez au stade Geoffroy-Guichard. L'ancien footballeur, aujourd'hui âgé de 61 ans, a alors dû se résoudre à se rendre à l'hôpital le plus proche où il a été placé en observation. Il a cependant pu quitter l'établissement dès le lendemain, tenant à rassurer sur son état de santé. Laurent Paganelli a effectivement rapidement pris la parole sur son compte Instagram, postant quelques photos de lui à l'hôpital, entouré du personnel soignant, ce samedi 25 mai. En légende, le consultant osait même quelques blagues : \" Photos souvenirs de la victoire de l'AS Saint-Étienne. J’ai juste senti l’odeur du Chaudron (le surnom du stade Geoffroy-Guichard, ndlr) pendant quelques minutes. Mais quand je me suis réveillé, c’était gagné. Tout va bien, je vous embrasse \", a-t-il écrit, rassurant ainsi ses fans, ravis de le voir si souriant : \"Même à l'hôpital toujours bien entouré et avec ce grand sourire, bon rétablissement notre Paga\" , \"Force à notre Paga national\" , \"Reviens-nous en forme !\", ont commenté plusieurs internautes. Un soutien unanime qui a visiblement fait chaud au cœur de Laurent Paganelli. Ce lundi 27 mai 2024, l'ancien footballeur a tenu à montrer sa gratitude : \" Merci à tous les supporters, joueurs, présidents de clubs, amis etc... pour tous les messages \", a-t-il écrit sur son compte Instagram , en légende d'un cliché de lui en plein bain de foule. Ce mardi matin, Laurent Paganelli a à nouveau prouvé qu'il était en forme, s'affichant à l'extérieur, en train de boire son café dans une tasse \"Monsieur heureux\" : \" Bonjour ensoleillé à tous, je vais de mieux en mieux, je vous embrasse \", a-t-il légendé la photographie, accompagnant son message d'une série d'émojis en forme de cœur et de baiser.

        "content": "Источник: Елизавета Горячева / NGS.RU Капитальный ремонт Октябрьского моста завершили наполовину, объект обещают сдать в ноябре этого года, но мэр Новосибирска попросил подрядчиков поторопиться. Сейчас строители завершают работы на тротуарах, после перейдут на ремонт самой дороги, полосы обещают перекрывать постепенно. НГС побывал на стройке объекта и узнал, что осталось доделать подрядчикам. Сейчас на Октябрьском мосту работает от 60 до 80 человек, в будущем обещают вывести на ремонт еще 10 человек, правда, половина рабочих будут заниматься ремонтом в нижней части объекта, поэтому их новосибирцы не заметят. 15 мая один из подрядчиков — «СпецТрансСтрой» уже завершил свою часть работы в нижней части моста. Позже компания займется перильным и барьерным ограждениями. Источник: Елизавета Горячева / NGS.RU Мост длиной более чем в 1 км ввели в эксплуатацию 68 лет назад, как отмечает директор МКУ «Гормост» Иосиф Кодалаев, к капитальному ремонту приступили из-за аварийного состояния объекта. — Проектные решения предусматривают полную замену мостового полотна, включая выравнивающие слои. Один из основных видов работ — усиление тротуарной консоли, то есть проводится новый участок бетонирования, что позволит обеспечить нормативную ширину тротуара, — рассказал Иосиф Кодалаев. Источник: Елизавета Горячева / NGS.RU Кроме того, рабочие должны заменить ограждения. Например, историческое чугунное перильное ограждение полностью сохранили и даже произвели на том же заводе, что и десятки лет назад. Контактную сесть также заменят и установят праздничную подсветку — светодиодные гирлянды. — Самая трудоемкая часть — тротуарная консоль, ручная, кропотливая работа. Уже приступили к заливке четвертого пролета, осталось ровно половина и мы переходим на работы по проезжей части, — объяснил директор МКУ «Гормост». Мэр Новосибирска Максим Кудрявцев на это ответил, что ремонт в любом случае тормозит транспортные потоки, новосибирцам, отмечает он, неудобно ездить с одного берега на другой, поэтому стоит ускорить работы. — Капитальный ремонт проводили в прошлом веке в 1998 году. Буду нацеливать подрядчиков на раннюю сдачу объекта. Срок сдачи — ноябрь этого года. Будет полная реконструкция, новый асфальт, в ноябре мы должны увидеть мост в новом состоянии, — заключил Максим Кудрявцев. Источник: Елизавета Горячева / NGS.RU Общая цена ремонта — 2 миллиарда 247 миллионов рублей, рабочие вышли на объект в 2022 года, в прошлом году ремонт ускорили, теперь все обещают закончить в конце 2024 года. МКУ «Гормост» заключило контракт с ООО «СпецТрансСтрой» и ООО «ДК Клевер». ООО «СпецТрансСтрой» («Специальное и Транспортное Строительство») образовано 1 октября 2009 года. Предположительные конечный владелец — Сергей Дмуха. На конец 2023 года компания заработала 1,6 миллиарда рублей, чистый убыток организации — 412,4 миллиона рублей. ООО «ДК-Клевер» образовано в 2015 году в Иркутске, генеральный директор компании — Александр Батрамеев, он является единственным учредителем компании. На конец 2023 года выручка организации составила 218,9 миллиона рублей, чистая прибыль — 6,2 миллиона рублей. Кроме Октябрьского моста в городе ремонтируют Димитровский мост и строят четвертый мост, его срок сдачи перенесли на конец 2024 года. Как ранее объяснила группа «ВИС» проблемы возникли из-за документации, в которую внесли изменения, потому что с российского рынка ушли некоторые производители материалов и оборудования. Эти изменения необходимо согласовать в госэкспертизе. 20 мая стало известно, что компании выделили более 460 миллионов рублей на строительство. В то же время власти Новосибирска начали обсуждать строительство пятого моста, он станет дублером дамбы ГЭС и пройдет от Советского шоссе в районе Краснообска до Восточного обхода.

        "content": "A Melbourne man was in a brief but violent relationship with Maryam Hamka before he murdered her and disposed of her body in bushland, sending her a series of threatening messages in the lead-up to her death, prosecutors allege. Toby Loughnane is fighting a murder charge in the Victorian supreme court, after instead admitting to Hamka’s negligent manslaughter – a charge prosecutors say does not go far enough. Loughnane’s barrister Daniel Sala on Tuesday flagged he would argue Hamka succumbed to a drug overdose rather than violence. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup He urged a jury to consider the evidence dispassionately after it heard prosecution allegations he said probably stoked hatred towards Loughnane. Prosecutor Kristie Churchill alleged Hamka had been in a “relatively brief but violent and controlling relationship” with Loughnane before he murdered her at his Brighton home in April 2021. In the months before Hamka’s death, Loughnane physically assaulted her and also sent messages threatening to injure and kill her, Churchill alleged. The messages included, “I’m going to split your skull”, “I’ll go to (jail) just to see you suffer you dog”, “you’re dead” and “wait until I get my hands on you dog”, the prosecutor alleged. Loughnane also pursued Hamka in a car in 2021, followed her into her family home and threatened her friends, Churchill said. The last time her mother saw Hamka was on April 9, 2021, when Loughnane was screaming at her to get in a car before she left with him, the prosecutor said. Hamka was spotted the next day on CCTV at a Brunswick Woolworths before she was last seen alive in a “confronting” video allegedly filmed by Loughnane, wherein she was half-naked and he was mocking her, Churchill said. A friend of Loughnane’s later saw Hamka dead in the foetal position in the shower of his Brighton home, the prosecutor alleged. Churchill accused Loughnane of trying to cover up Hamka’s murder, alleging he sent her several messages after she died, sought a friend’s help to buy a steam cleaner off Gumtree and disposed of her body in dense bushland. Police found a significant number of cleaning products at Loughnane’s home days after Hamka’s death. Almost two years later – in May 2023 – they received information from Loughnane’s lawyers about the location of Hamka’s body, the prosecutor said. Officers later found Hamka’s bones in thick bushland at Cape Schanck on the Mornington Peninsula. skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Morning Mail Free daily newsletter Our Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The jury would hear evidence about the drug GHB, the barrister said. “This is the world in which these two people occupied in April 2021,” Sala said. “It can be quite disgusting. It brings out the absolute worst in people.” The world of drug use was critical to the case and Loughnane accepted responsibility for Hamka’s alleged fatal overdose, the barrister said. “What you have not heard (from the prosecution) is anyone say, ‘this is how she died’,” Sala said. The trial continues on Wednesday. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732.",

        "content": "Asialink Finance Corp. is expected to grow exponentially as it has more resources to address the substantial unmet demands for loans from the largely unbanked small and medium enterprises, according to its new investor Creador. Creador, a leading private equity firm in South East Asia, recently bought 18 percent of Asialink. In a statement, Creador Managing Director Omar Mahmoud cited the recent celebration of its P4-billion investment in Asialink. Mahmoud said that with the new investment, Asialink is just scratching the surface of providing financial assistance to the SMEs. Ninety-nine percent of the 1.2 million registered businesses in the Philippines are SMEs and Asialink has served around 200,000 of them so far, he said. Robert B. Jordan Jr., Asialink CEO, said that with Creador’s investment and proceeds from other funders like local banks, DFIs and major international lenders, Asianlink will expand all over the country to reach more of the unbanked businesses so that they can grow their operations, generate jobs, and improve their lives. In jest, Mahmoud said he could have invested in Asialink when it had a starting capital of only P3 million in 1997. Now, Asialink is valued at over P20 billion. “In 2022, we spoke to approximately 50 financial services companies in the country and it became clear that Asialink was the natural fit for Creador given its leading market share and long-term track record,” he said. Now Asialink, through Creador, has indirect investors from global development finance institutions, large pension funds, and university endowments. Jordan said Asialink will introduce new products and services as it bolsters its presence nationwide and improve its internal efficiencies. Mahmoud touted the visionary leadership of Jordan who, as a loan officer of a bank, saw the SME lending vacuum. Jordan said he pitched his proposal to many but eventually it was the family of Ruben Lugtu II, Asialink's chairman, who provided the funds to start Asialink.",

        "content": "Unruhen in Neukaledonien: „Sie haben ein Monster kreiert – jetzt will das Monster Chef werden“ Menschen demonstrieren, als die Autokolonne des französischen Präsidenten Macron in Noumea, Neukaledonien, vorbeifährt. Quelle: Ludovic Marin/AFP Pool via AP/dp Der Ausnahmezustand im französischen Überseegebiet Neukaledonien ist aufgehoben – doch die Bilanz der vergangenen zwei Wochen ist dramatisch: sieben Tote, Schäden in Millionenhöhe. Eine Lösung zu finden, ist für Frankreich und damit Europas künftigen Einfluss im Indopazifik von entscheidender Bedeutung. Ein Jahr nach seinem Amtsantritt als französischer Präsident ist Emmanuel Macron zum ersten Mal nach Neukaledonien geflogen. Damit zeigte er schon 2018, welch wichtige Rolle das französische Überseegebiet östlich von Australien für Frankreichs Außenpolitik spielt. Macron sieht es als europäischen Anker im Indopazifik gegen Chinas Hegemonie. Nicht umsonst vor kurzem: „China wartet darauf, dass Neukaledonien wie eine reife Frucht in seine Hände fällt.“ Die Inseln im Pazifik sind demnach von zentraler Bedeutung für Frankreichs Ambitionen im Indopazifik, die nicht zuletzt auch durch den AUKUS-Sicherheitspakt, den die USA, Australien und Großbritannien vor drei Jahren geschlossen haben, einen Dämpfer erhalten haben. Ein U-Boot-Auftrag Canberras wurde damals – zum Ärger von Paris – kurzerhand gestrichen. Fast zwei Wochen herrschte in Neukaledonien Ausnahmezustand. Ausgelöst hat die Unruhen eine Reform des Wahlrechts, die die politische Einflussnahme der indigenen Bevölkerung der Kanaken schwächen würde. Diese Entscheidung in Paris hat die Lage im 17.000 Kilometer fernen Nouméa, der Hauptstadt des Überseegebiets im Pazifik, entgleisen lassen. Vor allem junge indigene Menschen gingen wütend auf die Straße. Die Proteste endeten in Gewaltexzessen mit bisher sieben Toten und Schäden in Millionenhöhe. Der Flughafen musste gesperrt, Urlauber evakuiert werden. Macron hat auf die bürgerkriegsähnlichen Zustände mit Entschlossenheit reagiert: Innerhalb weniger Tage wurden 3000 französische Sicherheitskräfte nach Neukaledonien ausgeflogen, weitere 480 sollen folgen. Ende der vergangenen Woche reiste Macron zudem selbst für Gespräche an. Die Hoffnung ist, dass sämtliche Parteien nun zurück an den Verhandlungstisch kehren. Der Ausnahmezustand wurde am Dienstagmorgen aufgehoben, der Flughafen öffnet ab Sonntag wieder. Wie der indische Premier Modi nach der Wahl die Welt neu ordnen will Die Parlamentswahl in Indien geht nach sechs Wochen ihrem Ende zu. Favorit ist Premierminister Modi, den seine Anhänger fast bedingungslos verehren – und vor dem seine Kritiker warnen. Eines seiner Ziele: Deutschland von Platz drei der größten Volkswirtschaften zu verdrängen. Wie Frankreich den ersten Ausbruch schwerer Gewalt in Neukaledonien seit 40 Jahren bewältigt, werde sich nicht nur auf seine zukünftige Rolle, sondern auch „auf seine Akzeptanz als ansässige pazifische und indopazifische Macht auswirken“, schrieb Denise Fisher, Australiens ehemalige Generalkonsulin für die Inseln und Autorin des Buches „France in the South Pacific: Power and Politics“, bei der australischen Denkfabrik . Und Jacques Attali, ein Ökonom und einstiger Berater des früheren französischen Präsidenten François Mitterrand, schrieb auf seinem : Eine Schwächung Frankreichs in Neukaledonien bedeute nicht nur „eine Schwächung des Gewichts Frankreichs in Europa“, sondern auch eine Schwächung „des Gewichts Europas in der Welt“. Dazu muss man wissen: Frankreich ist als einziger EU-Staat territorial weltweit vertreten. Im Pazifik gehören neben Neukaledonien auch noch Französisch-Polynesien und Wallis und Futuna zu Frankreich. Mit Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon hat Frankreich ein Standbein vor der Ostküste Kanadas, mit Saint Barthélemy, Saint-Martin, Guadeloupe und Martinique eines in der Karibik und mit Französisch-Guyana ist es an der Ostküste Südamerikas stationiert. Hinzu kommen im Indischen Ozean vor Afrika Mayotte und Réunion. Auch in der Antarktis hat Frankreich Ansprüche sowie im Pazifik vor Mexiko, wobei die Clipperton-Insel ein unbewohntes Atoll ist. Damit ist Frankreich im Atlantik, im Indischen Ozean und im Pazifischen Ozean vertreten und verfügt über eine Meeresfläche von 10,2 Millionen Quadratkilometern. Paris besitzt damit – gleich nach den USA – das zweitgrößte maritime Territorium der Welt. Die Inseln mit ihren 270.000 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohnern verfügen zudem über einen Großteil der weltweiten Nickelreserven sowie über bedeutende Vorkommen an Chrom, Kobalt, Eisen, Gold, Kupfer und Mangan – Mineralien, die für die Entwicklung erneuerbarer Energien essenziell sind. Krisen-Radar RND-Auslandsreporter Can Merey und sein Team analysieren die Entwicklung globaler Krisen im wöchentlichen Newsletter zur Sicherheitslage – immer mittwochs. Mit meiner Anmeldung zum Newsletter stimme ich der zu. Welche Bedeutung die Inseln im internationalen Gefüge haben, wurde auch durch die aktuelle Einflussnahme von außen deutlich. Bereits wenige Tage nach Ausbruch der Unruhen warf der französische Innenminister Gérald Darmanin Aserbaidschan Einmischung in Neukaledonien vor, und damit einem Regime, das Russland nahesteht. So wurde in Dutzenden von X- und Facebook-Posts mit dem Hashtag #EndFrenchColonialism behauptet: „Französische Polizisten sind Mörder in Neukaledonien.“ Dass sich letzteres nicht bewahrheitet, dafür scheint sich Macron persönlich eingesetzt zu haben. Alcide Ponga, ein indigener Politiker und Präsident der pro-französischen Partei Rassemblement, berichtete im Telefoninterview, dass der Präsident der Polizei vor Ort die klare Anweisung gegeben habe, dass nicht auf die Menschen geschossen werden sollte. Ponga ist einer der Gegner eines unabhängigen Neukaledoniens. Er sieht die Vorteile, die Frankreich für Bereiche wie die Gesundheitsversorgung und das Thema Bildung mit sich bringt. Ponga weiß jedoch auch, dass der Status quo sich verändern muss. „Wir müssen eine Lösung finden“, meinte er. Sonst ende es tatsächlich noch im Bürgerkrieg. Ponga mahnt wie auch Jimmy Naouna, Sprecher der Partei Front de Libération Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS), die sich für die Unabhängigkeit Neukaledoniens einsetzt, die sozialen Ungleichheiten zwischen Französischstämmigen und Kanaken im Land an. Bei der Volkszählung von 2019 betrug die Armutsquote unter den indigenen Kanaken 32,5 Prozent, verglichen mit neun Prozent unter Nicht-Kanaken. „Deswegen wussten wir bereits, dass der Ärger kurz vor dem Überkochen war“, sagte Naouna. Mehr zum Thema Überkocht war der Ärger vor zwei Wochen, nachdem Paris eine Reform des lokalen Wahlrechts von der Nationalversammlung absegnen ließ. Diese erlaubt es Einwohnern, und damit vor allem Franzosen, die seit zehn Jahren in Neukaledonien leben, künftig an Provinzwahlen teilzunehmen. Bisher waren Stimmen von Bürgern, die nicht schon vor 1998 in Neukaledonien lebten oder ein Nachfahre solcher waren, „eingefroren“ gewesen. Diese Regel war ursprünglich eingeführt worden, damit die indigene Bevölkerung – die sogenannten Kanaken – nicht zur „Minderheit“ im eigenen Land werden. Mit dem Schritt würde Paris nun aber rund 25.000 neue französischstämmige Wählerinnen und Wähler kreieren und damit fürchten die Kanaken, die etwa 40 Prozent der Bevölkerung Neukaledoniens ausmachen, dass sich ihr Einfluss deutlich verringern wird. Vor allem aber sehen sie ihre Chance auf eine Unabhängigkeit von Frankreich dahinschwinden. Schon bisher waren drei Referenda, die 2018, 2020 und 2021 abgehalten wurden, zugunsten von Paris ausgegangen, wobei der Großteil der Indigenen das letzte Referendum während der Pandemie boykottierte. Ein neues Referendum ist dann auch der Hauptwunsch, den Naouna im Gespräch erwähnt. Außerdem müsse Frankreich die Wahlreform fallenlassen, forderte der Indigene.

        "content": "Menschen demonstrieren, als die Autokolonne des französischen Präsidenten Macron in Noumea, Neukaledonien, vorbeifährt. Quelle: Ludovic Marin/AFP Pool via AP/dp Der Ausnahmezustand im französischen Überseegebiet Neukaledonien ist aufgehoben – doch die Bilanz der vergangenen zwei Wochen ist dramatisch: sieben Tote, Schäden in Millionenhöhe. Eine Lösung zu finden, ist für Frankreich und damit Europas künftigen Einfluss im Indopazifik von entscheidender Bedeutung. Ein Jahr nach seinem Amtsantritt als französischer Präsident ist Emmanuel Macron zum ersten Mal nach Neukaledonien geflogen. Damit zeigte er schon 2018, welch wichtige Rolle das französische Überseegebiet östlich von Australien für Frankreichs Außenpolitik spielt. Macron sieht es als europäischen Anker im Indopazifik gegen Chinas Hegemonie. Nicht umsonst sagte der französische Senator Claude Malhuret vor kurzem: „China wartet darauf, dass Neukaledonien wie eine reife Frucht in seine Hände fällt.“ Die Inseln im Pazifik sind demnach von zentraler Bedeutung für Frankreichs Ambitionen im Indopazifik, die nicht zuletzt auch durch den AUKUS-Sicherheitspakt, den die USA, Australien und Großbritannien vor drei Jahren geschlossen haben, einen Dämpfer erhalten haben. Ein U-Boot-Auftrag Canberras wurde damals – zum Ärger von Paris – kurzerhand gestrichen. Fast zwei Wochen herrschte in Neukaledonien Ausnahmezustand. Ausgelöst hat die Unruhen eine Reform des Wahlrechts, die die politische Einflussnahme der indigenen Bevölkerung der Kanaken schwächen würde. Diese Entscheidung in Paris hat die Lage im 17.000 Kilometer fernen Nouméa, der Hauptstadt des Überseegebiets im Pazifik, entgleisen lassen. Vor allem junge indigene Menschen gingen wütend auf die Straße. Die Proteste endeten in Gewaltexzessen mit bisher sieben Toten und Schäden in Millionenhöhe. Der Flughafen musste gesperrt, Urlauber evakuiert werden. Macron hat auf die bürgerkriegsähnlichen Zustände mit Entschlossenheit reagiert: Innerhalb weniger Tage wurden 3000 französische Sicherheitskräfte nach Neukaledonien ausgeflogen, weitere 480 sollen folgen. Ende der vergangenen Woche reiste Macron zudem selbst für Gespräche an. Die Hoffnung ist, dass sämtliche Parteien nun zurück an den Verhandlungstisch kehren. Der Ausnahmezustand wurde am Dienstagmorgen aufgehoben, der Flughafen öffnet ab Sonntag wieder. Die Parlamentswahl in Indien geht nach sechs Wochen ihrem Ende zu. Favorit ist Premierminister Modi, den seine Anhänger fast bedingungslos verehren – und vor dem seine Kritiker warnen. Eines seiner Ziele: Deutschland von Platz drei der größten Volkswirtschaften zu verdrängen. Wie Frankreich den ersten Ausbruch schwerer Gewalt in Neukaledonien seit 40 Jahren bewältigt, werde sich nicht nur auf seine zukünftige Rolle, sondern auch „auf seine Akzeptanz als ansässige pazifische und indopazifische Macht auswirken“, schrieb Denise Fisher, Australiens ehemalige Generalkonsulin für die Inseln und Autorin des Buches „France in the South Pacific: Power and Politics“, bei der australischen Denkfabrik ASPI . Und Jacques Attali, ein Ökonom und einstiger Berater des früheren französischen Präsidenten François Mitterrand, schrieb auf seinem Blog : Eine Schwächung Frankreichs in Neukaledonien bedeute nicht nur „eine Schwächung des Gewichts Frankreichs in Europa“, sondern auch eine Schwächung „des Gewichts Europas in der Welt“. Dazu muss man wissen: Frankreich ist als einziger EU-Staat territorial weltweit vertreten. Im Pazifik gehören neben Neukaledonien auch noch Französisch-Polynesien und Wallis und Futuna zu Frankreich. Mit Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon hat Frankreich ein Standbein vor der Ostküste Kanadas, mit Saint Barthélemy, Saint-Martin, Guadeloupe und Martinique eines in der Karibik und mit Französisch-Guyana ist es an der Ostküste Südamerikas stationiert. Hinzu kommen im Indischen Ozean vor Afrika Mayotte und Réunion. Auch in der Antarktis hat Frankreich Ansprüche sowie im Pazifik vor Mexiko, wobei die Clipperton-Insel ein unbewohntes Atoll ist. Damit ist Frankreich im Atlantik, im Indischen Ozean und im Pazifischen Ozean vertreten und verfügt über eine Meeresfläche von 10,2 Millionen Quadratkilometern. Paris besitzt damit – gleich nach den USA – das zweitgrößte maritime Territorium der Welt. Die Inseln mit ihren 270.000 Einwohnerinnen und Einwohnern verfügen zudem über einen Großteil der weltweiten Nickelreserven sowie über bedeutende Vorkommen an Chrom, Kobalt, Eisen, Gold, Kupfer und Mangan – Mineralien, die für die Entwicklung erneuerbarer Energien essenziell sind. RND-Auslandsreporter Can Merey und sein Team analysieren die Entwicklung globaler Krisen im wöchentlichen Newsletter zur Sicherheitslage – immer mittwochs. Mit meiner Anmeldung zum Newsletter stimme ich der Werbevereinbarung zu. Welche Bedeutung die Inseln im internationalen Gefüge haben, wurde auch durch die aktuelle Einflussnahme von außen deutlich. Bereits wenige Tage nach Ausbruch der Unruhen warf der französische Innenminister Gérald Darmanin Aserbaidschan Einmischung in Neukaledonien vor, und damit einem Regime, das Russland nahesteht. So wurde in Dutzenden von X- und Facebook-Posts mit dem Hashtag #EndFrenchColonialism behauptet: „Französische Polizisten sind Mörder in Neukaledonien.“ Dass sich letzteres nicht bewahrheitet, dafür scheint sich Macron persönlich eingesetzt zu haben. Alcide Ponga, ein indigener Politiker und Präsident der pro-französischen Partei Rassemblement, berichtete im Telefoninterview, dass der Präsident der Polizei vor Ort die klare Anweisung gegeben habe, dass nicht auf die Menschen geschossen werden sollte. Ponga ist einer der Gegner eines unabhängigen Neukaledoniens. Er sieht die Vorteile, die Frankreich für Bereiche wie die Gesundheitsversorgung und das Thema Bildung mit sich bringt. Ponga weiß jedoch auch, dass der Status quo sich verändern muss. „Wir müssen eine Lösung finden“, meinte er. Sonst ende es tatsächlich noch im Bürgerkrieg. Ponga mahnt wie auch Jimmy Naouna, Sprecher der Partei Front de Libération Nationale Kanak et Socialiste (FLNKS), die sich für die Unabhängigkeit Neukaledoniens einsetzt, die sozialen Ungleichheiten zwischen Französischstämmigen und Kanaken im Land an. Bei der Volkszählung von 2019 betrug die Armutsquote unter den indigenen Kanaken 32,5 Prozent, verglichen mit neun Prozent unter Nicht-Kanaken. „Deswegen wussten wir bereits, dass der Ärger kurz vor dem Überkochen war“, sagte Naouna. Mehr zum Thema Überkocht war der Ärger vor zwei Wochen, nachdem Paris eine Reform des lokalen Wahlrechts von der Nationalversammlung absegnen ließ. Diese erlaubt es Einwohnern, und damit vor allem Franzosen, die seit zehn Jahren in Neukaledonien leben, künftig an Provinzwahlen teilzunehmen. Bisher waren Stimmen von Bürgern, die nicht schon vor 1998 in Neukaledonien lebten oder ein Nachfahre solcher waren, „eingefroren“ gewesen. Diese Regel war ursprünglich eingeführt worden, damit die indigene Bevölkerung – die sogenannten Kanaken – nicht zur „Minderheit“ im eigenen Land werden.

        "content": "DIREKTUR Jenderal Pendidikan Tinggi, Riset, dan Teknologi (Dirjen ), Abdul Haris, menindaklanjuti arahan Menteri Pendidikan, Kebudayaan, Riset, dan Teknologi ( ), , terkait dengan pembatalan kenaikan uang kuliah tunggal (UKT) tahun akademik 2024/2025 di Badan Hukum (PTNBH) dan Perguruan Tinggi Negeri ( ). Per 27 Mei 2024, Dirjen Diktiristek secara resmi mengirimkan surat Nomor 0511/E/PR.07.04/2024 kepada Rektor PTN dan PTNBH untuk membatalkan dan mencabut rekomendasi dan persetujuan tarif UKT dan IPI tahun 2024 di 75 (tujuh puluh lima) PTN dan PTNBH. \"Terima kasih atas respon positif yang kami terima sejak Mas Menteri mengumumkan pembatalan kenaikan UKT siang hari kemarin. Secara resmi saya telah bersurat kepada pemimpin PTN dan PTNBH mengenai enam poin penting untuk dilaksanakan,\" ungkap Haris, Selasa (28/5). Ia menguraikan, \"Pertama, Kemendikbud-Ristek membatalkan dan mencabut surat rekomendasi tarif UKT dan Iuran Pengembangan Institusi (IPI) PTNBH dan surat persetujuan tarif UKT dan IPI PTN tahun akademik 2024/2025.\" Masih terkait poin pertama, Haris mengatakan bahwa Surat Dirjen juga meminta Rektor PTN dan PTNBH mengajukan kembali tarif UKT dan IPI tahun akademik 2024/2025 kepada dirinya. \"Kedua, Rektor perlu mengajukan kembali tarif UKT dan IPI paling lambat tanggal 5 Juni 2024, tanpa kenaikan dibandingkan dengan tarif tahun akademik 2023/2024 dan sesuai dengan ketentuan batas maksimal dalam Peraturan Mendikbud Ristek (Permendikbudristek) Nomor 2 Tahun 2024 tentang Standar Satuan Biaya Operasional Pendidikan Tinggi (SSBOPT) pada Perguruan Tinggi Negeri di Lingkungan Kemendikbud Ristek,\" urainya. Kemudian sebagai poin ketiga, setelah memperoleh surat rekomendasi atau surat persetujuan dari Dirjen Dikti Ristek atas pengajuan kembali UKT dan IPI, Haris mengatakan bahwa PTN dan PTNBH harus merevisi Keputusan Rektor mengenai tarif UKT dan IPI tahun akademik 2024/2025. Soal arahan Mendikbud Ristek agar kampus merangkul calon mahasiswa baru yang terdampak, Haris menekankan arahan tersebut dalam Surat Dirjen. Sebagai poin keempat, dirinya menjelaskan bahwa Rektor PTN dan PTNBH harus memastikan tidak ada mahasiswa baru tahun akademik 2024/2025 yang membayar UKT lebih tinggi akibat dilakukannya revisi Keputusan Rektor. \"Kelima, Rektor PTN dan PTNBH harus menginformasikan tarif UKT dan IPI sesuai dengan revisi Keputusan Rektor kepada mahasiswa baru yang telah diterima, namun belum mendaftar ulang atau sudah mengundurkan diri dan memberikan kesempatan kepada mahasiswa untuk melakukan daftar ulang. Ini adalah prioritas Mendikbud Ristek,\" tuturnya. Kemudian, dalam Surat Dirjen, dirinya juga menegaskan solusi bagi calon mahasiswa baru yang telah melakukan pembayaran, sebagaimana dijelaskan dalam poin keenam atau terakhir, yaitu dalam hal terjadi kelebihan pembayaran UKT akibat revisi Keputusan Rektor, Rektor PTN dan PTNBH perlu segera melakukan pengembalian kelebihan pembayaran atau penyesuaian perhitungan pembayaran UKT untuk semester berikutnya. Direktorat Jenderal Dikti Ristek akan terus mengawal implementasi kebijakan ini agar PTN dan PTNBH dapat menjalankannya dengan lancar. “Keputusan ini menunjukkan bahwa kami senantiasa mendengarkan aspirasi masyarakat dan selalu menindaklanjutinya secara serius. Kami berkomitmen menyelenggarakan kebijakan pendidikan tinggi yang berkeadilan dan inklusif, serta memastikan agar tidak ada anak Indonesia yang mengubur mimpinya berkuliah di perguruan tinggi negeri karena kendala finansial,” tandas Haris.

        "content": "Zürich (awp) - Die Preise für Ferienwohnungen im Schweizer Alpenraum sind im ersten Quartal 2024 im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum erneut gestiegen. Der Zenit dürfte aber laut einer Studie der Grossbank UBS nun vorerst erreicht sein. Der Preisanstieg für Ferienwohnungen in den Berggebieten ist zunächst aber weiter gegangen: Im ersten Quartal 2024 kletterten die Immobilienpreise für Zweitwohnungen im gehobenen Bereich laut dem \"UBS Alpine Property Focus 2024\" um knapp 4 Prozent im Vergleich zum entsprechenden Vorjahresquartal. \"Im Schnitt kostet eine Ferienwohnung in Schweizer Berggebieten damit 13'000 Franken pro Quadratmeter\", sagte Maciej Skoczek, Immobilien-Ökonom bei der UBS, am Dienstag an einer Medienkonferenz anlässlich der Vorstellung der Studie. Damit seien die Preise mittlerweile im Vergleich zu vor der Pandemie um rund 30 Prozent gestiegen. Die Preisdynamik hat sich seit 2022 aber etwas abgeschwächt. Im Jahr 2023 legten die Immobilienwerte in den touristischen Regionen noch um 6,2 Prozent zu. 2022 waren es sogar 7,9 Prozent. Dabei vergleicht die UBS jeweils die Durchschnittspreise im ersten Quartal eines Jahres mit dem entsprechenden Vorjahresquartal. Der \"alpine Ferienboom\" seit der Pandemie treibt die Preise also immer noch an, wenn auch nicht mehr so stark, so das Fazit. Verbier an der Spitze An der Spitze der teuersten Destinationen hat derweil Verbier den bisherigen Spitzenreiter St. Moritz abgelöst. Eine Zweitwohnung im gehobenen Segment kostet in Verbier mittlerweile im Schnitt 21'500 Franken pro Quadratmeter. Gefolgt von St. Moritz mit einem Quadratmeterpreis von 21'200 Franken. Zermatt belegt mit 19'900 Franken pro Quadratmeter den dritten Rang. Den höchsten Preisanstieg registrierte die UBS in Arosa mit 18 Prozent. Aber auch insgesamt legten die Preise in Graubünden mit knapp 6 Prozent durchschnittlich am stärksten zu im Vergleich zum Startquartal 2023. Im Berner Oberland war die Entwicklung am schwächsten, dort stagnierte das Preisniveau im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum. Dieser Trend dürfte sich nun auch in weiteren Regionen abzeichnen, wie Skoczek erklärte. Denn derzeit spreche vieles gegen eine Fortsetzung des aktuellen Preisbooms: \"Die konjunkturelle Schwächephase wird die Nachfrage nach Zweitwohnungen dämpfen\", so der UBS-Ökonom. Zudem dürften Kaufinteressenten die geforderten Preise vermehrt kritisch hinterfragen. Die Experten rechnen in diesem Jahr mit stagnierenden Preisen auf dem Zweitwohnungsmarkt. sta/ys Zinsen: Ein Goldlöckchen-Szenario dauert nie ewig Währungen: Wie viel? Nur ein Pfund!
