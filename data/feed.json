        "description": "The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas.",
        "content": "VALLEY VIEW, Texas — Powerful storms killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas after obliterating homes and destroying a truck stop where dozens sought shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. The storms inflicted their worst damage in a region spanning from north of Dallas to the northwest corner of Arkansas. On Monday, forecasters said, the greatest risk would shift to the east, covering a broad swath of the country from Alabama to near New York City. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency early Monday in a post on social media platform X, citing “multiple reports of wind damage and tornadoes.” Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Sunday. The dead included two children, ages 2 and 5. Three family members were found dead in one home, according to the county sheriff. Eight people died statewide in Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed in a news conference Sunday evening. An emergency official said two of the deaths were attributed to the circumstances of the storm but not directly caused by weather, including a person who suffered a heart attack and another who was deprived of oxygen due to a loss of electricity. The deaths included a 26-year-old woman who was found dead outside a destroyed home in Olvey, a small community in Boone County, according to Daniel Bolen of the county’s emergency management office. One person died in Benton County, and two more bodies were found in Marion County, officials said. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, east of Tulsa, officials said. The injured included guests at an outdoor wedding. In Kentucky, a man was killed Sunday in Louisville when a tree fell on him, police said. Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed on social media that it was a storm-related death. Beshear said Monday that an additional two people had been killed in his state. In Texas, about 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures destroyed, Abbott said, sitting in front of a ravaged truck stop near the small agricultural community of Valley View. The area was among the hardest hit, with winds reaching an estimated 135 mph, officials said. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” said Abbott, whose state has seen successive bouts of severe weather, including storms that killed eight people in Houston earlier this month. Abbot signed an amended severe weather disaster declaration on Sunday to include Denton, Montague, Cooke and Collin on a list of counties already under a disaster declaration sparked by storms and flooding in late April. Hugo Parra, who lives in Farmers Branch, north of Dallas, said he rode out the storm with 40 to 50 people in the bathroom of the truck stop. The storm sheared the roof and walls off the building, mangling metal beams and leaving battered cars in the parking lot. “A firefighter came to check on us and he said, ‘You’re very lucky,’” Parra said. “The best way to describe this is the wind tried to rip us out of the bathrooms.\" Multiple people were transported to hospitals by ambulance and helicopter in Denton County, also north of Dallas. The destruction continued a grim month of deadly severe weather in the nation's midsection. Tornadoes in Iowa last week left at least five people dead and dozens injured. The deadly twisters have spawned during a historically bad season for tornadoes at a time when climate change contributes to the severity of storms around the world. April had the second-highest number of tornadoes on record in the country. Meteorologists and authorities issued urgent warnings to seek cover as the storms marched across the region late Saturday and into Sunday. “If you are in the path of this storm take cover now!” the National Weather Service office in Norman, Oklahoma, posted on X. Harold Brooks, a senior scientist at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, said a persistent pattern of warm, moist air is to blame for the string of tornadoes over the past two months. Residents awoke Sunday to overturned cars and collapsed garages. Some residents could be seen pacing and assessing the damage. Nearby, neighbors sat on the foundation of a wrecked home. In Valley View, near the truck stop, the storms ripped the roofs off homes and blew out windows. Clothing, insulation, bits of plastic and other pieces of debris were wrapped around miles of barbed wire fence line surrounding grazing land in the rural area. Kevin Dorantes, 20, was in nearby Carrollton when he learned the tornado was bearing down on the Valley View neighborhood where he lived with his father and brother. He called the two of them and told them to take cover in the windowless bathroom, where they rode out the storm and survived unharmed. As Dorantes wandered through the neighborhood of downed power lines and devastated houses, he came upon a family whose home was reduced to a pile of splintered rubble. A father and son were trapped under debris and friends and neighbors raced to get them out, Dorantes said. “They were conscious but severely injured,” Dorantes said. As tornado season approaches, more residents in vulnerable regions are turning to private shelters to ensure their safety. These shelters have become a critical lifeline, especially in areas prone to severe weather. Craig Ceecee, a meteorologist from Mississippi, emphasizes the importance of having a dedicated safe space during tornadoes. He notes that many people live in mobile homes or buildings without basements, which are particularly susceptible to damage. His website, findyourtornadoshelter.com , maps out public shelters, but awareness and accessibility remain issues. Advances in radar technology have improved tornado warning lead times, now averaging 13 minutes. Despite this, public shelters in rural may be miles away, making them impractical during an emergency. Private shelters, typically installed in garages or basements, offer immediate protection. While the costs of these shelters, including installation, can be significant, many see them as a necessary investment for their family's safety. The severe weather knocked out power for tens of thousands of homes and businesses in the path of the storms. On Monday, more than 187,000 customers were without power in Kentucky, according to the tracking website poweroutage.us . Some 84,000 customers were without power in Alabama; 74,000, West Virginia; 70,000, Missouri; and 63,000, Arkansas. Inaccessible roads and downed power lines in Oklahoma also led officials in the town of Claremore, near Tulsa, to announce on social media that the city was “shut down” due to the damage. The system causing the latest severe weather was expected to move east over the rest of the holiday weekend. The Indianapolis 500 started four hours late after a strong storm pushed into the area, forcing Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials to evacuate about 125,000 race fans. More severe storms were predicted in Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The risk of severe weather moves into North Carolina and Virginia on Monday, forecasters said.

Eyewitnesses reported that the attack was likely a response to a police raid on motorcycle riders, known locally as Okada riders, in the area. The confrontation led to an exchange of gunfire, causing panic and forcing passersby to flee for safety. The police, however, successfully repelled the attackers. Benjamin Hundeyin, the police spokesman in Lagos State, confirmed to Channels Television that the assailants were indeed Okada riders retaliating against the enforcement actions taken by the police. He praised the officers and men of the Ipaja division for their strong resistance against the attack. Hundeyin did not provide details on whether there were any casualties during the incident but assured that normalcy had been restored to the area. Additional police detachments have been deployed to maintain order and prevent further disturbances. ALSO READ THESE TOP STORIES FROM NIGERIAN TRIBUNE",

        "content": "Israel faces new condemnation over Rafah strikes, which local health officials say killed 45 TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faces new condemnation over strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials say killed at least 45 Palestinians. Some of those killed were displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Many were women and children. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas. Even some of its closest allies like the United States are expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel says it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts. One of those courts last week demanded that Israel halt its offensive in Rafah. EU, Israel in war of words as ties nosedive ahead of Spain, Ireland recognizing Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah while Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leader of Hamas. Latest deadly weather in US kills at least 20 as storms carve path of ruin across multiple states VALLEY VIEW, Texas (AP) — Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms obliterated homes and destroyed a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park. Eight people were killed in Arkansas. Three died in Kentucky, and two were killed in Oklahoma. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. Papua New Guinea says Friday's landslide buried more than 2,000 people and formally asks for help MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by a landslide Friday. The official formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple a U.N. estimate of 670 killed in the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. In a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. China has threatened trade with some countries after feuds. They're calling 'the firm' for help WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department has set up an eight-person team known as “the firm” to provide help to countries cut off from Chinese trade. The team emerged after Washington stepped in to help Lithuania when the northern European country found its cargo shipments to and from China stranded two years ago during a feud over Taiwan. State Department officials say Washington sees ”the firm” as an emergency response when a country fears facing economic pressure from China. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. says Beijing opposes economic coercion and calls the American allegation “completely unfounded.\" Russian POWs get to make phone calls home. Ukrainians don't. A growing movement wants that to change FAR WESTERN UKRAINE (AP) — For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It's a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They're appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site. It's a full day’s journey from the front lines. The visit took place on condition its location not be revealed. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. Military labs do the detective work to identify soldiers decades after they died in World War II OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency experts strive to offer about 200 families annually the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. Advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year.",

        "content": "The Houston Astros expect to have a familiar face back in the clubhouse when they open a four-game series Monday at Seattle. First baseman Jose Abreu is scheduled to rejoin the ballclub after he was optioned to the Astros' spring training complex in West Palm Beach, Fla. He had been working on his swing with, among others, Hall of Fame member Jeff Bagwell and former teammate Michael Brantley. Abreu, the 2020 American League MVP with the Chicago White Sox, was batting .099 with one extra-base hit and three RBIs in 22 games when he was sent to the minors for the first time in his career. \"What I can tell you is my head is in a good spot right now,\" Abreu told The Athletic. \"When I was going through it, when your head is not in a good spot, you feel like everything is going down. There was a point, and I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart, I couldn't even know how to hit, how to field. I was a little lost. But I'm humble enough to recognize that and I'm telling you I'm trying to be the best Jose Abreu I can be and the one you guys know.\" Abreu went 7-for-22 with a homer and three RBIs in the Florida Complex League before playing in two games for the Triple-A Sugar Land Space Cowboys, going 0-for-7 with three strikeouts. \"The plan is to bring him for the Seattle series and just come in with confidence,\" Astros manager Joe Espada said. \"He has made adjustments that we feel are going to help him and we just expect him to come back up here and just be himself and we're going to help him, get him rolling. We're all waiting for him, our players are excited, we are excited to have him back, so we're looking forward to it.\" Abreu, 37, batted .237 with 18 home runs and 90 RBIs last season, his first in Houston after signing a three-year, $58.5 million deal. \"I was wrong on my swing, and games speed up on you too much and it's tough to see where you're at,\" Abreu said through an interpreter. \"I saw videos and didn't see it, and now we found it and I hope that I can show it right away, right now, but it's baseball, it's a process.\" The Astros won 5-2 at Oakland on Sunday as Kyle Tucker belted a two-run homer and Ronel Blanco allowed the Athletics one run on four hits over seven innings. \"He didn't miss a beat,\" Espada said of Blanco, who returned from a 10-game suspension for having an illegal substance on his glove. Houston has won 10 of its past 14 games to pull within 3 1/2 games of the American League West-leading Mariners. On May 1, the Astros were in last place in the division, 6 1/2 games out. Seattle snapped a season-worst, four-game losing streak with a 9-5 victory at Washington on Sunday. Julio Rodriguez went 3-for-5 with a home run and four RBIs and Ty France went deep and drove in three. Rodriguez homered in each of the last two games in the series to double his season total to four. \"Huge game by Julio,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"Really happy for him. Everybody's happy to see it. That's the Julio Rodriguez we've grown to know over the last couple of years and hopefully he can keep that going. That's the best he's looked all year.\" Astros left-hander Framber Valdez (3-2, 4.32 ERA) is set to start the series opener Monday against Mariners right-hander Bryce Miller (3-5, 3.53). Valdez is 5-2 with a 3.41 ERA in 13 career appearances (11 starts) against Seattle; Miller is 2-1, 3.22 in four career starts versus Houston. Valdez lost 5-0 to the visiting Mariners on May 4 as he allowed five runs on nine hits in 5 1/3 innings. Miller didn't get a decision in Seattle's 5-4 victory at Houston on May 5, a game in which he gave up four runs on six hits over six innings. --Field Level Media",

        "content": "Israel faces new condemnation over Rafah strikes, which local health officials say killed 45 TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faces new condemnation over strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials say killed at least 45 Palestinians. Some of those killed were displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Many were women and children. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas. Even some of its closest allies like the United States are expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel says it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts. One of those courts last week demanded that Israel halt its offensive in Rafah. EU-Israel relations take a nosedive as Spain, Ireland set to formally recognize a Palestinian state BRUSSELS (AP) — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive on the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain. Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah while Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including the leader of Hamas. Latest deadly weather in US kills at least 20 as storms carve path of ruin across multiple states VALLEY VIEW, Texas (AP) — Powerful storms have killed at least 20 people, injured hundreds and left a wide trail of destruction across Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. The storms obliterated homes and destroyed a truck stop where drivers took shelter during the latest deadly weather to strike the central U.S. Seven deaths were reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border, where a tornado Saturday night plowed through a rural area near a mobile home park. Eight people were killed in Arkansas. Three died in Kentucky, and two were killed in Oklahoma. Tens of thousands of residents were without power across the region. Papua New Guinea says Friday's landslide buried more than 2,000 people and formally asks for help MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — A Papua New Guinea government official has told the United Nations more than 2,000 people are believed to have been buried alive by a landslide Friday. The official formally asked for international help. The government figure is roughly triple a U.N. estimate of 670 killed in the landslide in the South Pacific island nation’s mountainous interior. In a letter seen by The Associated Press to the United Nations resident coordinator dated Sunday, the acting director of the South Pacific island nation’s National Disaster Center Luseta Laso Mana said the landslide “buried more than 2000 people alive” and caused “major destruction” at Yambali village in the Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely. Closing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict? Major week looms in Trump hush money trial WASHINGTON (AP) — Testimony in Donald Trump’s New York hush money trial is wrapped up after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses, meaning the case heads into the pivotal final stretch of closing arguments, jury deliberations and possibly a verdict. It’s impossible to say how long that all takes. But in a landmark trial that’s already featured its fair share of memorable moments, this week could be the most important. Starting Tuesday, prosecutors and defense lawyers will have their final opportunity to address the jury in closing arguments. Perhaps Wednesday, before the jury begins deliberations, the judge is expected to spend about an hour instructing the jury on the law governing the case. China has threatened trade with some countries after feuds. They're calling 'the firm' for help WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. State Department has set up an eight-person team known as “the firm” to provide help to countries cut off from Chinese trade. The team emerged after Washington stepped in to help Lithuania when the northern European country found its cargo shipments to and from China stranded two years ago during a feud over Taiwan. State Department officials say Washington sees ”the firm” as an emergency response when a country fears facing economic pressure from China. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. says Beijing opposes economic coercion and calls the American allegation “completely unfounded.\" Russian POWs get to make phone calls home. Ukrainians don't. A growing movement wants that to change FAR WESTERN UKRAINE (AP) — For hundreds of Russian soldiers taken prisoner, phone calls home can offer a bit of comfort and hope. It's a lifeline unavailable to Ukrainian POWs, whose families have gone without hearing their voices. Now, Ukrainian families of POWs are demanding an end to the calls to Russia. They're appealing a decision to block a petition that got more than 25,000 signatures. The families’ anger and the petition rejection come amid widespread reports of systematic mistreatment of Ukrainians in Russian captivity. Ukraine has regularly opened its main POW camp to the Red Cross, the U.N. and journalists. The Associated Press recently visited the western Ukraine site. It's a full day’s journey from the front lines. The visit took place on condition its location not be revealed. Armenians, Hmong and other groups feel US race and ethnicity categories don't represent them The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes are still missing the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab and Brazilian communities in the U.S. feel that they are not accurately represented in the official numbers that their government produces. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them and how they identify themselves. Advocates are hoping revisions will be made before the next census in 2030. Major retailers are offering summer deals to entice inflation-weary shoppers NEW YORK (AP) — Americans who spend Memorial Day scouting sales online and in stores may find more reasons to celebrate the return of warmer weather. Major retailers are stepping up discounts heading into the summer months, hoping to entice inflation-weary shoppers into opening their wallets. Target, Walmart and other chains have rolled out price cuts — some permanent, others temporary — with the stated aim of giving their customers some relief. The reductions, which mostly involve groceries, are getting introduced as inflation showed its first sign of easing this year but not enough for consumers who are struggling to pay for basic necessities as well as rent and car insurance. Military labs do the detective work to identify soldiers decades after they died in World War II OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency experts strive to offer about 200 families annually the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. Advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year.",

        "content": "The Kogi State Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Abuja, on Monday, affirmed the election victory of Gov. Usman Ododo of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Nov. 11, 2023 Kogi governorship poll. The three-member panel of justices, headed by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, held that the petition was bereft of substance and accordingly dismissed. The tribunal held that the petitioners; the social Democratic Party (SDap) and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka, failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act, 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous, decision held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Kogi had, on Nov. 11, 2023, held its off-cycle election in which Ododo of the APC emerged winner beating his closest rival, Ajaka of the SDP with a wide margin. Ajaka, dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, had filed a petition before the tribunal, challenging Ododo’s victory. The case, which commenced in December 2023, came to its highest point on May 13 when SDP, Ajaka, APC, Ododo and INEC adopted their final written addresses, after which the tribunal reserved judgement in the petition. It would be recalled that INEC, Ododo and his party, APC, had prayed the tribunal to dismiss Ajaka and SDP’s petition in its entirety for being incompetent and lacking in merit. The trio had, through their lawyers; Chief Kanu Agabi, SAN; Joseph Daudu, SAN and Emmanuel Ukala, SAN, respectively, had told the tribunal so while adopting their final written addresses and presenting their arguments against the petition. However, Ajaka’s lawyer, Pius Akubo, SAN, had urged the tribunal to discountenance the respondents’ submissions and uphold their petition. You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "description": "The PVV, VVD, NSC, and BBB coalition’s plan to put the cultural sector under",
        "content": "The PVV, VVD, NSC, and BBB coalition’s plan to put the of 21 percent instead of the low VAT rate of 9 percent, also includes sports events. The plan will result in much more expensive tickets and season tickets and make things like football matches much less accessible, the sector told . The cheapest season ticket at an Eredivisie club like Feyenoord for next season costs 385 euros. After the VAT hike, which will take effect in 2026, that same season ticket will cost around 430 euros. And that is without the annual price increase of around 5 percent that football clubs implement. The KNVB called the measure “a slap in the face” of the country’s largest popular sport. According to the Dutch football association, the right-wing coalition is passing its bills on to football supporters, players, and clubs. “This affects people with a small wallet, and they are more likely to drop out due to the higher costs, especially in times of rising costs,” a KNVB spokesperson told AD. “When it was decided 20 years ago that the tickets would be sold at the low VAT rate, agreements were made about the proceeds,” the KNVB spokesperson said. “Approximately 3.5 million euros are invested annually in youth football and the development of over 2,800 football clubs. The loss of this is disastrous for amateur football.” Matthijs Keuneng of Supporters Collective Netherlands wonders whether the new coalition considered the effects of the measure. “The great thing about football stadiums is that many people with different backgrounds now come together there, a reflection of all levels of society. The danger is that a popular sport like football will soon become something for the elite.” The coalition’s “main lines agreement” did not specifically mention sports in this measure. The sports world hopes that the parties just didn’t consider that the measure also impacts sporting events and will give them the same exception they did to cinemas and amusement parks. The fact that sports are included in the measure only became clear in parliament last week when D66 leader Rob Jetten complained that his FC Twente season ticket would become more expensive.",

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel faced new condemnation on Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel asserts that it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt its offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths, saying it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,\" said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan. “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.” The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had been housing more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group on Sunday launched a barrage of rockets from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Israel has adamantly denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writers Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Colleen Barry in Rome contributed to this report.

Currently set up as a formal dining room its function is versatile and its use is all year, with a door to the delightful garden veranda for summer days and a log burner providing a cosy ambience when the winter appears. The kitchen diner is the next social space, easily welcoming a dining area so the cook can have company while they create a feast in the well-equipped kitchen that includes a Rangemaster range cooker with double gas oven, grill and a five zone electric hob, and extractor hood, integrated Miele dishwasher and integrated Liebherr fridge, freezer and washing machine. Tucked away at the front of the house there's a contemporary lounge dripping in floor-to-ceiling glass doors and accessed via a cute spiral staircase - it's a space that epitomises this memorable house - a surprise to discover and a truly delightful one, there's something to see and fall in love with around every corner. This hidden space is one of the many gems inside the house and is currently set up as a study and lounge, with a sizeable roof lantern ensuring the room enjoys cascading light from above as well as from the wall of glass. Taken from the estate agent video of the property this image shows the pretty and private, sun-drenched courtyard accessed from the ground floor lounge - it's a super special space for relaxing and entertaining with an intimate atmosphere as a direct contrast to the sweeping views from the rear of the house that stretch for miles to the horizon. The ground floor is home to two of the five bedrooms and this one in particular is a fabulous space to enjoy restful slumber - there's a whole wall of bespoke built-in storage to make sure everything has a home to keep this as a clutter free zone, plus mirror doors bounce light around the space as well as showing you how the outfit is looking before you step outside for the day. The ground floor bedroom has a sleek and contemporary ensuite within sleepy stumbling distance and this level can also boast a family bathroom boasting the same high level of facilities and décor. Up the incredible staircase to explore the next two storeys and there are some stunning spaces waiting to impress you with their sweeping views. There's a dining room directly off the landing that is a very relaxed space and versatile too - it could easily be home to a different function - and is well-placed as part of another social hub, partially open-plan to another lounge via a wide, open doorway. The first floor dining room flows into this very special space - a lounge with an incredible view accessed via a wall of bifold doors and a contemporary log burner that hangs from the ceiling and ensures this room is super cosy in the winter as you watch the wild Welsh weather rush across the expansive landscape outside. Step out onto the balcony with a morning coffee, to enjoy a lazy brunch, entertain guests or sip a night time drink with a view over the communal garden and Bristol Channel so mesmerising it's hard to stop staring. There are two more double bedrooms on the first floor, both with an ensuite, before the grand staircase transports you to the absolute gem that crowns this amazing property - the principal bedroom suite. The spectacular principal suite occupies the whole of the second floor. Imagine waking up to that view once the duo of electric black-out blinds have slowly revealed it. Making the windows into two sets of bifold doors with glass panels creating a Juliet balcony is a genius move, maximising the connection to the outside world and the view. The principal bedroom can boast a large bathroom as its ensuite with a double sink and more thoughtful design, creating a half wall between the bath and the toilet area is a simple idea but very effective, so a relaxing time in the bath is accompanied by a view of the rooftops of Penarth and not the room's other facilities.",

By MBN recently shared , which features EXO’s Suho, Hong Ye-Ji, and Kim Min-Kyu in lead roles. The historical romance K-drama currently focuses on a misunderstanding that affects the bond of two half-brothers. In the , Grand Prince Soo Seong (Suho) fell into Sang-Rok’s trap. The royal politics changed Soo Seong’s plans, which landed Queen Yoon in imprisonment. Do Sung’s trust in his brother shook after the incident. Things got complicated when Do Sung’s grandfather manipulated him and revealed that Soo Seong hid Myung-Yoon (Hong Ye-Ji) in the palace. The episode ended with Do Sung demanding to be the crown prince. The trailer for the upcoming episode features Myung-Yoon staying at the palace as a maid. She searches Queen Dowager Min Soo-Ryun’s chamber to find a way to save the king. Will she be caught? Viewers will find out next week. Watch the trailer here: Missing Crown Prince episode 15 trailer teases Hong Ye-Jin in danger The episode 15 trailer begins with Grand Prince Soo Seong mentioning that Soo-Ryun will be away from the palace. Myung-Yoon says that she will search Soo-Ryun’s chamber and steal the book. The video shows Soo-Ryun’s court maiden entering a chamber while a man suspects that someone is inside the room. Meanwhile, Do Sung and Soo Seong will confront the latter’s grandfather for sending men to attack Myung-Yoon. Do Sung says, “They are killers that your grandfather sent to kill Maiden Myung-Yoon, brother!” It seems there has been another attack, and Myung-Yoon has gone missing. Angry, Do Sung asks his brother, “Where is Maiden Myung-Yoon? You must find her even if you have to search the entire palace.” Meanwhile, Soo Seong and Myung-Yoon treat the King.

        "content": "The San Diego Padres have hovered around .500 all season, but maybe their newest weapon can help them string together some wins. In Sunday's 5-2 victory over the visiting New York Yankees, flamethrowing right-hander Jeremiah Estrada jumped to prominence, striking out all five batters he faced and setting a Padres franchise record by fanning his past 10. The Padres, who had lost five straight home games, have the surging Miami Marlins coming to town for a three-game set that starts Monday. San Diego manager Mike Shildt professed to knowing Estrada's potential since the right-hander was claimed off waivers from the Chicago Cubs in the offseason. \"This guy's got an elite fastball, and now he's got secondary pitches in the zone. It's just a lethal combination,\" Shildt said after Sunday's game. Estrada routinely hit 97-98 mph and mixed in splitters and sliders. \"He demonstrated a lot of positive things throughout the offseason with us, including spring training, and the message just continued to (be) get better at some of these things, (that) ‘If you do that, you can be a force at the back end of games.'\" Estrada came on in relief of starter Joe Musgrove with one out in the sixth inning after the Yankees took a 1-0 lead. The 25-year-old struck out the red-hot Aaron Judge on three pitches and Alex Verdugo on four. After San Diego rallied for four runs in the bottom of the inning, Estrada took down Giancarlo Stanton, Anthony Rizzo and Gleyber Torres. Since being called up from Triple-A El Paso on April 26, Estrada is 2-0 with a 0.59 ERA and one save in 11 appearances. Right-hander Michael King (4-4, 4.28 ERA) gets the start for the Padres on Monday. In May, King is 2-1 with a 3.24 ERA. He is coming off a 7-3 win over the Cincinnati Reds on Wednesday. He went 6 2/3 innings, giving up three runs on four hits and two walks with six strikeouts. King has faced the Marlins once in his career. While with the Yankees, he pitched two innings as an opener and allowed two runs on four hits with three strikeouts in a 3-1 loss in Miami on Aug. 12. While the Marlins have won nine of their past 13 games, including four consecutive series, their starter on Monday has been struggling. Left-hander Trevor Rogers (1-6, 6.11) has been limited to no more than 3 2/3 innings in three of his past four starts, after going at least five innings in his first six. In his past four starts, he is 1-2 with a 10.05 ERA. He has allowed 17 runs (16 earned) on 26 hits with 11 walks, one hit batter and 14 strikeouts. Opponents hit .377 against him in that span. Rogers has made one start against the Padres in his career, tossing five shutout innings in a no-decision in May 2022. Miami took two out of three against the host Arizona Diamondbacks over the weekend, with Marlins pitchers holding the reigning National League champions to four runs in three games. Jake Burger went 6-for-12 in the series after entering the weekend hitting .164 in his first 31 games. He scored three runs and drove in three versus the Diamondbacks. Burger credited the coaching staff for helping him get on track. \"I think maybe (hitting coach John) Mabry and I got some stuff figured out in the cage. ... Just, like, calming everything down in the box,\" Burger told Bally Sports Florida. \"Skip (Schumaker, manager) and I had a really good conversation a couple days ago. He's like, ‘Hey, when you're out there, you have swagger when you're right. Nothing's speeding you up, you're not rushing to get in the box, you're kinda bobbing your head to the music, whatever it may be.' ... You know what? Let's just get back to having fun.\" --Field Level Media",

Chart 2 shows the relative contributions of the major categories: energy; food; goods; and services. Services inflation now accounts for the vast bulk of the overall inflation rate. In turn, this reflects the non-uniform dynamics: while the other categories have seen major declines, with the April indicating energy inflation running -0.6 per cent, food inflation 2.8 per cent and goods inflation 0.9 per cent, services inflation was still elevated 3.7 per cent.

While Chart 3 reports broad measures of underlying inflation, Chart 4 examines the domestic inflation rate, which is aggregated across sectors with import content. The on this measure is motivated by the higher sensitivity of domestic inflation to local pressures. Although domestic inflation remains quite elevated, the exclusion-type indicators (weighted median and trimmed measures) suggest that the breadth of the domestic inflation dynamic is narrowing. Domestic inflation (annual percentage changes) Sources: and staff calculations. Notes: Domestic inflation is an aggregate of HICP items with a relatively import intensity, as explained in Fröhling, A., O’Brien, D. and Schaefer, S. ( ), “ ”, , Issue 4, . The latest observations for April . In a similar vein, Chart 5 shows services inflation. In April, services inflation declined slightly to 3.7 per cent. The decline in services inflation since last summer largely been in non-labour-intensive services sectors, reflecting the indirect impact of lower energy prices, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the fading out of pandemic reopening effects in these sectors. As shown in Chart 5, there is a relatively tight medium-term relation between wage inflation and the inflation rate for labour-intensive services sectors (which make up a large of the domestic inflation component). Over time, deceleration in wage growth is necessary in order for services inflation to converge to a rate that is consistent with meeting the two per cent target for overall inflation. Services inflation developments (annual percentage changes) Sources: and calculations. : Latest observations for the fourth quarter of for compensation per employee and April for the rest. In relation to wage dynamics, Chart 6 shows the evolution of compensation per employee and compensation per hour until Q4 and negotiated wages until Q1 , while Chart 7 shows a set of wage trackers. The wage tracker – an important tool used to assess wage developments across the area – is signalling that overall wage pressures have moderated since . Furthermore, the Indeed wage tracker – which reflects the wages offered in job postings and thereby should be a leading indicator for overall wage dynamics – materially decelerated in recent months. the same time, wage growth is expected to remain elevated in , and to show a bumpy profile. These developments reflect the staggered nature of the wage adjustment process as workers continue to recoup real wage losses from past price shocks, as as the important role of one-off payments in this process. Such one-off payments also behind the increase in area negotiated wage growth in the first quarter. Similarly, one-off payments likely played a significant role in the increase in the growth rate of the “wages and salaries” component in the experimental release for Eurostat’s labour (LCI) for Q1 , which jumped to 5.0 per cent from 3.2 per cent in Q4 . The impact of higher wages on price pressures depends on the rate of labour productivity growth. In , labour productivity fell, such that unit labour costs grew more quickly than wages. Preliminary for the first quarter of suggest that aggregate labour productivity was constant; given the strongly pro-cyclical behaviour of labour productivity, the March staff projections foresee labour productivity growing 0.1 per cent in , 1.2 per cent in and 1.2 per cent in due to the output recovery outpacing employment growth. Under this baseline, unit labour costs will grow more slowly than nominal wages. In addition to a slower rate of growth of labour costs, deceleration in domestic inflation also requires compression in profits. The annual growth in unit profits peaked 9.4 per cent in the last quarter of and stood 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of . The March projections exercise foresees unit profit growth turning negative in , implying that profits will buffer the relatively strong labour growth. Unit profit growth is then expected to recover somewhat from , helped by a robust economic recovery and strengthening productivity growth.

Due to the swings in energy prices during , there will be oscillations in base effects in the monthly inflation readings during , while the staggered reversal of various temporary fiscal supports will also have uneven effects on price levels.

Even if inflation does not smoothly decline during the rest of , further disinflation can be expected in the course of . This next phase of disinflation should be underpinned by the lowering of labour pressures, ongoing compression of unit profits, the dissipation of the adverse effects of past energy shocks, supply bottlenecks and the pandemic reopening, and the further unfolding of the disinflationary impact of the restrictive monetary policy stance. This disinflationary dynamic is consistent with both inflation stabilising our target later in and a substantial economic recovery. The latter will be supported by rising real incomes, improvements in the terms of trade and the prospect of disinflation unlocking future interest rate reductions and boosting domestic consumption and investment, while the normalisation of foreign demand will facilitate growth in exports. The sustainable attainment of the medium-term inflation target would be difficult in the absence of sufficient growth to foster the demand conditions that would be aligned with an overall inflation rate of two per cent. Finally, it is essential to track the evolution of inflation risk, in addition to indicators of the expected inflation path. The lowering of perceived inflation risk since last summer is plausibly connected to the faster-than-expected decline in inflation (even if this somewhat reversed in the initial months of ): the September staff projections pencilled in inflation 3.2 per cent, while the March projections revised inflation down to 2.3 per cent. Since last summer, a range of measures show that near-term inflation expectations have also come down and that the risk of inflation staying above target in the term diminished: the right tail in the distribution of -term inflation expectations in the Survey of Professional Forecasters markedly diminished compared to the peak inflation phase in late ; the inflation risk premium embedded in five-year-on-five-year inflation swaps declined by about 40 basis points since last summer; the option-implied probability of above 2.5 per cent inflation in the five-year-on-five-year interval dropped, while the option-implied probability of below 1.5 per cent inflation picked up; to the Consumer Expectations Survey, households have recognised the improvement in inflation outcomes and marked down their near-term inflation expectations; according to the results from the SAFE, firms have lowered their near-term inflation expectations, while the proportion of firms fearing high inflation in the medium term decreased. The role of monetary policy in the disinflation process been to ensure that the large inflation shocks did not translate into an increase in the medium-term inflation trend through medium-term inflation expectations shifting above our two per cent target. This required a substantial adjustment in monetary policy for two reasons: first, in the normalisation phase, to avoid that excessively- nominal interest rates would pro-cyclically add to the initial inflation shock; and, second, in the restrictiveness phase, to make sure that demand conditions dampened, so as to ensure that the multi-round adjustment process for prices and wages is consistent with a timely return of inflation to the two per cent target. Put differently, the aim of a restrictive monetary policy stance is to limit the persistence of backward-looking inflation dynamics and steer forward-looking inflation dynamics towards the medium-term anchor. While backward-looking inflation dynamics continue to play out (especially in relation to domestic/services inflation), these should continue to ease over the next year due to several factors: (a) with significant progress in and in reversing the real wage that was generated by the - inflation surge, wage growth should be lower in than in ; (b) with inflation lower than inflation, there will be less catch-up pressure from post-shock inflation on prices and wages in ; (c) the upward impact from the reversal of fiscal measures and energy base effects will be less relevant in than in ; and (d) the lagged impact of monetary policy tightening will still be contributing significantly to disinflation dynamics during . With forward-looking inflation expectations anchored, the dissipation of the backward-looking component will underpin the convergence in inflation towards the target. our June meeting, if our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission were to further increase our confidence that inflation is converging to our target in a sustained manner, it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction. Among other considerations, the subsequent pace of rate cuts will be slower if there upward surprises to underlying inflation (especially in relation to the underlying dynamics of domestic inflation and services inflation) and the level of demand (in view of the implications of demand conditions for the medium-term inflation outlook) and will be faster if there downward surprises to underlying inflation and the level of demand. The future rate path will also depend on the evolving strength of monetary transmission. First, given the lags in transmission, the tightening effects from our past interest rate hikes still unfolding. While the impact of the tightening cycle on economic activity might have reached its maximum level the turn of this year, model-based analysis suggests that the bulk of the impact on inflation is comparatively backloaded, with substantial pass-through still expected to transpire in the period ahead. Second, with expected inflation various horizons now lower than the date of our last rate hike, a given nominal interest rate now maps into a higher real interest rate. It is straightforward that the calibration of the appropriate degree of restrictiveness should adjust for the impact of lower expected inflation. Third, the overall restrictiveness of aggregate financial conditions also depends on the evolution of term premia and risk premia. Among other factors, these will be influenced by developments in global financial markets. The future rate path will also be guided by our management of the two-sided risks in proceeding through the next phase. In one direction, easing the stance too quickly would not be consistent with inflation sustainably returning to target if inflation turns out to be more persistent than anticipated. In the other direction, keeping rates overly restrictive for too could push inflation below target over the medium term. This would require corrective action through a subsequent acceleration in rate cuts that could even require having to descend to below-neutral levels to fix any persistent drift towards a below-target inflation trend. In deciding on the appropriate policy rate path, we will continue to follow a -dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction, and we not -committing to a particular rate path. This approach served us in the tightening cycle and many of the same considerations will apply during the unwinding phase. In relation to staff projections of various indicators, I rely on the March exercise. The projections from the June exercise will be published after our 6 June monetary policy meeting.

        "description": "The former Chief Justice of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir speaks about the recent unrest in the region, and more.",
        "content": "The life story of Justice (retd) Syed Manzoor Hussain Gillani, who was born and brought up in Karnah, in the border region of Jammu and Kashmir, reads like a perfect Bollywood masala film. His parents travelled to PoK in 1947, leaving him, then 2 years old, in the care of his grandparents. His parents could not return because war had broken out by then and stayed back in Muzaffarabad. He attended the Government Degree College in Baramulla and then went to Aligarh Muslim University to pursue a degree in law. When he visited his parents for the first time in the late 1970s, they convinced him to stay back in Muzaffarabad. The author of five books, he has held positions such as Advocate General, Vice Chancellor of a university, and Chief Justice. A leading legal luminary in the region, he spoke to from Muzaffarabad about the recent unrest in PoK. Excerpts from the interview: Why did the crisis escalate in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir? The crisis escalated because the government ignored demands for equal treatment in subsidies, especially in flour prices, which also apply to Gilgit-Baltistan. These tensions surfaced publicly when the Rawalakot-based Awami Action Committee of Poonch raised these concerns on May 8, 2023. The introduction of new taxes on electricity bills in August 2023, which were labelled as “protected” and “unprotected” taxes, further aggravated the situation. This led to widespread protests initiated by students of Muzaffarabad University and supported by local traders. These demonstrations also brought to light issues relating to the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project. In response, the government arrested numerous people in September last year. Tensions came to a head when a Deputy Commissioner in Dodyal was attacked on May 9 after he tried to disperse a crowd, and protesters marched towards Muzaffarabad the next day. Apart from these economic problems, what were the other factors that led to the unrest, and was anything done about it? Basically, there is a structural problem in the relationship between Pakistan-administered Kashmir [PAK] and the Pakistani government. Only when they are streamlined under a constitutional mechanism will the problems be solved. In my opinion, whatever the Pakistani government does here in practice should be governed by specific constitutional provisions so that there is some accountability to the Parliament and the Supreme Court of Pakistan. There is no doubt that it is being administered by Pakistan in a similar manner as the provinces of Pakistan, but there must be a regulatory mechanism under the Constitution of Pakistan. Your side of Kashmir has not been as politically active as the Indian side of Kashmir. Why? Lack of bold leadership like that of Sardar Ibrahim Khan, Sardar Qyoom Khan, and K.H. Khursheed is the main reason. There is no voice at the national level. The governments in Muzaffarabad bow to pressure from the Pakistani bureaucracy. Secondly, one-third of the 45 Assembly segments are reserved for non-resident nationals, commonly referred to as refugees from the Indian part of Kashmir. They do not live in Kashmir [Pakistan-administered Kashmir] and have no stake, but they influence the results and have a say in the formation of the government. They are dependent on the bureaucracy for various reasons such as issuance of residency certificates. Since you have seen both parts of Kashmir, how do you compare them in terms of political power, distribution of resources, and so on? The Indian part of Kashmir is governed by the Indian Constitution and is represented in Parliament and often in the Union government, and there is oversight by the Supreme Court of India. Apart from that, there has also been vocal leadership. If we minus what happened to Jammu and Kashmir on the Indian side after August 2019 and some other things, we realise that the institutions on that side are comparatively strong. What is the political structure of PoK? The region has a parliamentary form of government consisting of a Legislative Assembly, which is responsible for local affairs, headed by the Prime Minister and has a President as the symbolic head of state. And then there is another structure, the AJK [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] Council, which is headed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan. The catch is that all executive matters are the responsibility of the AJK Council, which is not an elected body and represents the Pakistani government. Whatever policy matters and decisions the Pakistani government takes for the other provinces applies to AJK as well. Unlike the Indian part, we have no representation in the Pakistani parliament. Almost all national political parties operating in Pakistan have their branches in AJK, and the party that forms the government in Islamabad usually governs in Muzaffarabad as well. After the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, is there a fear that this territory will be annexed to Pakistan? Apart from the constitutional arrangement, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan are integrated with Pakistan in every respect. Apart from the scanty voices in favour of an independent Kashmir, people do not feel alienated from the rest of Pakistan. There is only formal constitutional assimilation left, which has been publicly expressed after the abrogation of Article 370. Of late, many Indian leaders have been vowing to reclaim PoK, and it is even being suggested that the people there could start a movement and join the Indian Union. What is the legal and factual situation? In my view, all agreements between the princely states and the British government lapsed on August 15, 1947. Therefore, the State of Jammu and Kashmir became technically free from August 1947. Parts of the State were liberated by the people from the forces of the local Dogra ruler, and they proclaimed their government on October 24, 1947. When Maharaja Hari Singh acceded to India, he was left with the part that had remained under him, not the part that had been liberated from him. The AJK government later entered into an agreement in which it ceded its sovereignty to Pakistan (Karachi Agreement of April 1948). That is the legal and factual position, which has remained hidden from the Indian public. COMMents",

        "content": "Warren believes Joshua should be made to wait so Usyk and Fury can fight for all the belts again (Image: Seconds Out/YouTube) Frank Warren, the promoter of Tyson Fury, has stated that Fury deserves another shot at the undisputed heavyweight title in his rematch with Oleksandr Usyk. This will be a setback for Anthony Joshua and Daniel Dubois, who were eyeing the IBF belt. Usyk is anticipated to lose his IBF title before the rematch later this year, but Warren asserts that the title cannot be stripped from him until his suspension is over. Following his tough win over Fury in Saudi Arabia, Usyk has been prohibited from fighting until June 2 - Fury was also suspended, but his ban was lifted on May 25. Usyk has already asked for an exception to retain his IBF title, and Fury's promoter believes it's only fair that they fight for all four belts again, despite Joshua and Fury's stablemate, Dubois, wanting their chance at the title.

There were rumours that the IBF title could be up for grabs this weekend for Dubois and Hrgovic, but Warren thinks it should only be the interim title at stake. Warren revealed to Seconds Out: \"He has been suspended, Oleksandr, because of how tough the fight was. I think it's 45 or 40 days by the commission so he cannot be stripped at this stage of the same because he's not in a position to defend his title so we will see what happens. That fight we just spoke about Dubois vs Hrgovic is a fantastic fight and in the worst-case scenario it'll be an interim title fight. If it goes ahead as an interim title fight, I have no problem with that,\" reports the Mirror . \"A lot of people will be p***ed off at me saying this, especially Hrgovic's camp and maybe with Daniel who I'm involved with but I feel like it should be for the interim because I think the rematch should be for the four belts.\" Anthony Joshua was hoping to fight for the IBF belt at some point this year (Image: Richard Pelham/Getty Images) The future of Usyk's belt remains uncertain, with a request already submitted to the IBF. But with Warren insisting that the rematch against Fury should be for the undisputed crown again, Joshua and Dubois could be forced to wait until after the rematch for this chance. The promoter also praised Joshua, who is currently on a three-fight winning streak, suggesting his next bout should be against Dubois, provided the Brit prevails over Hrgovic. \"That's what everybody wants to see, that's what I'd love to see, AJ is coming off a really good line of form at the moment, he's looked very good in his last two fights and him and Ben Davison is obviously a partnership that's really working well,\" he added.

        "content": "RED Lobster will close 17 restaurants in Florida alone as financial troubles persist. The seafood chain filed for bankruptcy in Florida on May 26 and will face closures in an additional 27 states. On May 26, Red Lobster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the Sunshine State , per USA Today . The filing reveals how the chain restaurant has struggled in many ways, such as its 30% decrease in guests since 2019. In a 124-page document, CEO Jonathan Tibus shared why Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy and why he supported the decision. \"Recently, the debtors have faced a number of financial and operational challenges, including a difficult macroeconomic environment, a bloated and underperforming restaurant footprint, failed or ill-advised strategic initiatives, and increased competition within the restaurant industry,\" said Tibus. As of May 22, Red Lobster's website listed 99 locations closed across 28 states. Some of the locations are auctioning off their kitchen equipment via an online restaurant liquidator. The liquidator, TAGeX Brands, announced last week it was hosting auctions for supplies from 48 Red Lobster locations that have closed. Each winner would receive the \"entire contents of the Red Lobster location they bid on,\" according to the liquidator's website. The following Red Lobster locations are currently listed as temporarily closed on the restaurant's website. Alabama: Arizona: California: Colorado: Florida: Georgia: Idaho: Illinois: Indiana: Iowa: Kansas: Louisiana: Maryland: Michigan: Mississippi: Missouri: New Jersey: New York: North Carolina: North Dakota: Oklahoma: Pennsylvania: South Carolina: Tennessee: Texas: Virginia: Washington: Wisconsin: In related news, Cracker Barrel plans a $700 million transformation as the CEO claims the chain is \"just not as relevant as we once were.\" Plus, Applebee's fans \"Thought it was a hoax\" after a location \"randomly\" closed down leaving even workers stunned.

        "content": "The National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) has made its first investment in Powerstove, a Nigerian company pioneering cookstove production and carbon credit projects, aimed at combating global warming and promoting sustainability among Nigerian companies focused on decarbonisation. Segun Ayeoyenikan, Director of Information at NASENI, said in a statement on Thursday that, as part of the investment, NASENI will provide Powerstove with growth capital and technical assistance, enabling the company to ramp up production from 100,000 units to over 1 million units per year. “This scaling is expected to have a substantial impact on Nigeria’s carbon footprint and contribute to the country’s transition to a more sustainable energy landscape.” Khalil Halilu, the Executive Vice Chairman, NASENI, said this substantial increase in production capacity will not only meet the growing demand for clean and efficient cookstoves but also significantly contribute to reducing carbon emissions in Nigeria. “With this investment, NASENI is not only supporting an impact-driven enterprise but also positioning itself to benefit from carbon credit revenue, thereby reinforcing its commitment to sustainable development,” Halilu said. “This investment underscores the strong commitment of NASENI’s leadership to address climate change proactively and to build a resilient and sustainable ecosystem of innovative Nigerian companies with the potential to drive decarbonisation efforts.”",

        "content": "SHE’S the most-watched movie star you may never have heard of - but that won’t be for long. Brit actress Ella Purnell is about to go stratospheric as her Amazon Prime show Fallout became the most watched programme on any streaming service last month, with more than 7million views. Ella, 27 , plays naive vault-dweller Lucy in the post-apocalyptic show, venturing out into the wasteland to find her kidnapped father. Fallout went straight to number one on its release and is sure to catapult the stunning actress to super-stardom. Ella has already started to amass the trappings of an A-list life with 1.2million Instagram followers, a rocker boyfriend and an LA pad. Not that this is her first big role. She may have flown under the celeb radar until now but she already has plenty of impressive parts under her belt, with her talent spotted early by the likes of Tim Burton and Angelina Jolie . Born and raised in London, with her mum, step-dad and three brothers, while her dad and step-mum lived down the road, she landed a place at Sylvia Young’s theatre school at the age of nine and also starred as a child model. She won her first big role aged 11, beating hundreds of other kids to a part in the West End production of Oliver! The show gave her the acting bug and she quickly became the first-choice child star for directors looking for a girl to play younger versions of some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. In Disney’s Maleficent she played a young Angelina Jolie. In Never Let Me Go she played the child version of Kiera Knightley, and in The Legend of Tarzan she was the younger Margot Robbie . In an interview Ella said she once worried that playing the younger version of lead actors might hamper her career, but she figured: “If someone asks me to be the young Margot Robbie I am not gonna say no!” And she was right - she got to work with and learn from some of the biggest and best female stars in the world. “It really helped, watching how disciplined they were and how they were devoted and committed to their craft,\" she said to Crash. \"I actually just like to get to know them and see them as real-life human beings. Working with smart, driven women was a huge inspiration at a young age.\" But despite this early brush with fame, Ella still saw acting as a hobby until aged 18 she landed the role of Emma in legendary director Tim Burton’s 2016 \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.” After that major success her career suddenly slowed down and she started to question her acting ambitions. \"I thought, 'I'm 21, I haven't had a job in a while, I really don't know if this is a job I want to continue doing,\" she confessed to the Belfast Telegraph. She didn't want to take on roles like \"the girlfriend of the main, male character; a female that needs saving; or the goal, something that is wanted. Just there to be a sex object, portrayed as weak, pretty, nice.\" Ella even considered pausing her career and heading to uni until she landed her first “grown-up” role as Tess in Sweetbitter, which saw her make the move across the pond to live and work in New York. As a huge fan of tattoos she was thrilled when she was told her character was going to get a tattoo on the top of her back. So she actually got the tattoo in real life - and converted her mum to body art too. She said: “She’d been against me getting tattoos for all 21 years of my life. But suddenly she’s like ‘I’m going to get one too’. \"And now I can’t stop her. She has so many, she won’t stop. It is like she’s addicted to the ink.\" Ella then switched to live in LA and landed the role of Jackie In Yellowjackets, the slow-burning hit which went viral telling the story of a girls’ football team who face a fight for survival after their plane crashes in the Rocky Mountains. Brand and culture expert Nick Ede says: Ella is one of those stars who have slowly crept up on audiences and we know we recognise, but we cant figure our where from. That's all about to change as she has wowed audiences in the hit Amazon Prime show Fallout and in the dark thriller Yellowjackets. She is fast becoming the UK's Sydney Sweeney and her trajectory to superstardom is happening in 2024. With her stunning looks, brilliant acting ability and a knack of holding down any accent she puts her voice to, she's one to watch. She has proved that she can do costume drama as well as kick ass fight scenes, which makes her a casting dream. She's also not afraid to talk about her ups and downs with mental health battels that makes her all the more relatable. With Hollywood falling for her, it wont be long before big brands come calling and she is cast in major advertising campaigns for fashion and beauty brands. With her near-million social media following, she's going to fast become the toast of the town and I am here for it! I see Ella leading the new Hollywood Brit pack alongside Leo Woodall, Amy Jackson, Kit Connor, Ncuti Gatwa, Andrew Scott and Ambika Mod. The show’s success took everyone by surprise - not least Ella. “We had no idea people were going to respond this way,” she told The Face. “When you’re making it, you’re only really living 50 per cent of the show. But when you add the music and the adult counterparts’ storylines, it works brilliantly. Still, it really was a surprise to all of us. None of us saw this coming!” As a result of the success of Yellowjackets and now Fallout, Ella’s gained an army of fans and social media followers who are lapping up her new glam red carpet shots as well as weekends spent at Coachella with her friends. And the constant on her Instagram is her boyfriend of three years - musician Max Bennett Kelly. When asked by a fan on Insta who her celebrity crush is, Ella didn’t hesitate to name her Max as the only one for her. The couple live together in LA with their dog, and regularly gush about each other online. The pair released a short film they made together last year, called Junk Male, about which Max posted: “I can’t believe it’s actually happening. kinda feels surreal to spend almost a year on something and then boom it’s just out. \"Couldn’t have done it without Ella, she really brought this film to life. so professional so bold ugh i’m so proud. seriously such an amazing director and i’m very happy we got to do this together :),” While Ella describes Max as “her rock” and made a heartfelt Instagram tribute to him in 2022 when her car got stolen with all her belongings in when she was moving house. She wrote: “How overwhelming his love is. It’s emotional being loved like this—being in the light of someone so kind and generous and gentle. Max, I adore you. You are so wonderful, so vibrant, so funny, so talented, so smart. I love the way your brain works. I love the way you interact with the world. The way you treat people. The way you dance. I love everything about you. It’s a joy to know you, let alone do life with you. \"I am so lucky, it’s insane. Thank you for being you, for holding it down and making me laugh and knowing what I need before I even know I need anything. Thank you for slowing me down and reminding me to breathe. Thank you for supporting all of my crazy ideas and big dreams. You bring out the best in me, and then some.” So it looks like hard luck to Ella’s growing army of male fans - she appears to be most definitely taken.",

        "content": "11 Shares Facebook Facebook messenger Twitter WhatsApp LinkedIn Telegram Email By Dr. Adam Aw Hirsi Monday May 27, 2024 Summary: Somalia faces the challenge of balancing immediate humanitarian needs with long-term investments in human capital to achieve sustainable development. Managing the delicate balance between addressing immediate humanitarian needs and making long-term investments in human capital for sustainable development in Somalia is particularly complex due to its unique circumstances. Introduction: Somalia operates under a federal system with two layers of government, adding an additional layer of complexity to decision-making and resource allocation. Additionally, the country is still recovering from a brutal civil war and is in an active, guns-blazing war with Al Shabaab, a potent terrorist organization, further complicating efforts to prioritize development initiatives. Furthermore, Somalia currently lacks an agreed-upon constitution, leading to ongoing disputes over elections and power-sharing arrangements. The prevalence of corruption allegations only exacerbates the situation, hindering the effective distribution of resources and stalling progress towards sustainable development goals. In light of the above, Somalia continues to grapple with poverty and climate change-induced natural disasters, leading to pressing humanitarian needs in the country. At the same time, investing in human capital, such as education, healthcare, and skills development, is crucial for long-term sustainable development. Navigating these multifaceted challenges requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the intricate political landscape, security concerns, and governance issues in Somalia, while also ensuring that humanitarian needs are met and investments in human capital are made for long-term sustainability and development. This article, inspired by a set of questions I was asked during the third panel of the Biannual Human Capital Development Forum held in Mogadishu by the Office of the Prime Minister on May 20th 2024, seeks to briefly examine strategies for reconciling short-term relief efforts with long-term capacity-building initiatives to foster resilience and sustainable development in Somalia. To be blunt, the ten-minute timeframe provided by the panel moderator was insufficient for me, therefore I decided to respond in this illustrative essay. Short-term Humanitarian Needs and Long-term Investments in Human Capital: Short-term humanitarian needs in Somalia often encompass the critical provision of immediate food aid, crucial healthcare services, necessary shelter, and vital protection for vulnerable populations impacted by crises or emergencies. These interventions are crucial for preserving lives and tackling pressing challenges. Yet, to ensure enduring development results, it is crucial to supplement short-term relief initiatives with sustained investments in human capital. This may involve initiatives in education, healthcare advancements, and opportunities for sustainable livelihoods, thus paving the way for long-term resilience and progress in the country. Strategies for Balancing Short-term Needs and Long-term Investments: 1. Integrated Approach: In considering the impact of neglecting human capital development, it becomes evident that the reliance on humanitarian interventions may intensify. The absence of investment in human potential can result in a greater need for immediate assistance during crises. After all, it is the skilled workforce within a society who play a pivotal role in determining the success or failure of various endeavors. Cognizant of this fact, an integrated approach that merges short-term humanitarian aid with long-term development strategies is indispensable. This approach ensures a seamless continuum of care and support for both individuals and communities, addressing immediate needs while laying down the foundation for sustainable growth and resilience. Through the integration of immediate relief initiatives with sustained investments in human potential, Somali communities can enable their members to effectively address challenges and lessen their reliance on ongoing humanitarian assistance. 2. Targeted Interventions: Considering the exacerbating impact of climate change-induced crises on security, population displacement, and community degradation, it is paramount to prioritize interventions that holistically address the multifaceted challenges faced by communities. In the face of such complexities, it is essential to concurrently tackle immediate needs, including emergency healthcare and nutrition programs, while simultaneously focusing on sustainable, long-term development measures. This dual approach ensures that communities receive vital support during crises, while also equipping individuals with the knowledge and skills through education and training programs to build resilience and foster self-reliance for a brighter future. Through a combination of quick relief efforts and purposeful investments in human resources, communities can effectively confront the challenges brought about by climate change-induced crises and strive towards sustainable development and security for all. 3. Community Engagement: Engaging local communities in decision-making processes, project planning, and execution is essential to ensure the sustainability and impact of interventions. Through the inclusion of community members in these critical areas, projects can be tailored to address the specific needs and priorities of the local population, increasing their relevance and efficacy. This participatory approach also fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among community members, leading to greater buy-in and long-term success of the interventions. 4. Disaster Risk Reduction: To address the challenges posed by the climate crisis on small-scale farmers, townspeople, and entrepreneurs in Somalia, implementing disaster risk reduction strategies is crucial. These measures, such as early warning systems and community preparedness initiatives, can build resilience and mitigate the impact of future shocks on human capital development. Despite financial constraints, investing in disaster risk reduction is a proven cost-effective approach to safeguard livelihoods, protect communities, and promote sustainable development. Prioritizing these strategies can strengthen the Governments' ability assist the governed to cope with climate-related disasters, reduce vulnerability, and create a more secure environment for its them, ultimately enhancing long-term progress and prosperity. Achieving Sustainable Development through Balanced Investments: Strategically balancing short-term humanitarian needs with long-term investments in human capital is crucial for the Somalia Governments to pave the way for sustainable development outcomes nationwide. Strengthening the education system - curriculum and overall education reform - expanding healthcare access, promoting the necessary vocational training, and creating economic and employment opportunities are fundamental pillars for cultivating a resilient and empowered population. Collaborative efforts, innovative approaches, and a commitment to investing in human capital as a driver of progress are essential for achieving sustainable development goals in Somalia. Conclusion: Tackling the immediate humanitarian needs while investing in crucial areas like education, healthcare, and economic opportunities can put a positive trajectory in Somalia's overall development agenda. This will specifically lay a strong foundation for human capital development, leading to sustained progress and growth in the country. Granted, balancing short-term humanitarian needs with long-term investments in human capital is a complex, but it is an equally vital endeavor for Somalia's sustainable development journey. In addition to that leveraging a combination of immediate relief efforts and enduring investments in human capital development a foundation for resilient communities, educated workforce, and sustainable economic growth can be simultaneously realized. Through realistic and practical strategic planning, commensurate resource allocation, and effective community participation, Somalia can navigate the dual challenges of addressing the pressing humanitarian needs while laying the groundwork for a prosperous and sustainable future.

        "content": "RUTH Langsford and Eamonn Holmes revealed they 'needed space' from each other during a forgotten TV interview from the pandemic. Chatting on TalkTV during lockdown, the unearthed clip saw the former This Morning hosts - who recently announced they are divorcing - reveal they spend very little time together. In a joint interview with host Kevin O'Sullivan, Eamonn admitted that the only time the pair really interacted was when they were working together. He said at the time: \"Although we live together, we're not really together, we don't watch the same TV, Ruth likes her own space, when we do This Morning it's a rare time we actually interrelate.\" Ruth then chimed in: 'That's why we've been together 24 years, because we aren't actually together a lot.' And in another resurfaced clip from 2018 when the pair were still presenting This Morning, Eamonn and Ruth has rather different opinions on staying friends with an ex. The hosts discussed whether they could remain pals with a former partner in a discussion topic on the flagship ITV show. Eamonn said on the subject: 'It is easier to stay friends.' But Ruth had a very different stance, admitting: \"Why would you need to stay friends, you aren't with them anymore, you don't need to be friends. \"My thing is you weren't just friends, you were married or had a relationship.\" It comes as pals claimed the pair had secretly separated a year ago. And The Sun exclusively revealed Ruth and Eamonn have actually been living separate lives for two years. Eamonn, 64, has suffered greatly over the last couple of year, losing his mum , job on This Morning, health, a home and now his wife. Pals say he has been through ordeals which would “break most people”, but has “kept on going and kept on working the best he can”. Eamonn also wanted to return to his native Belfast , spending long periods of time away from their £3.6million Surrey home. Ruth, who has son Jack , 21, with Eamonn, reportedly didn't want to up sticks to Northern Ireland. And insiders claim the pair's departure from This Morning in 2021 was the beginning of the end. A source said: “Eamonn and Ruth’s relationship changed when they left This Morning . They started moving in different directions in their careers and their priorities started to change. “Eamonn was desperate to return to Belfast , which he thinks of as home, but Ruth would never move. It became a bone of contention. “As her ITV career continued, Eamonn went down another path and they became ships in the night. “For the past two years they had led separate lives, professionally and personally.” The former couple's last public appearance together was at the 2022 Tric Awards. While they put on beaming smiles for photographers on the red carpet, Ruth and Eamonn did not leave the event together. In images taken at the time, Loose Women host Ruth was seen looking stressed as she left the bash while on the phone.

        "content": "Aidan O'Brien's City Of Troy is one of 20 left in Saturday's Betfred Derby after Tabletalk was supplemented for the Classic at Monday's confirmation stage. The open nature of this year's race seems likely to lead to a big field at Epsom, with last season's champion juvenile City Of Troy set to start as the favourite despite disappointing in the 2000 Guineas. He is one of six left in by Aidan O'Brien, including the unbeaten Los Angeles, a Group One winner at two and successful in Leopardstown's key Derby trial. Diego Velazquez, Euphoric, Illinois and Portland could also represent the Ballydoyle handler, although the first-named colt is the ante-post favourite for Sunday's Prix du Jockey Club at Chantilly. Adrian Murray's Dallas Star is another trained in Ireland in the mix after winning the Ballysax Stakes. Tabletalk, a Chelmsford winner last time out for Tom Clover, was supplemented at a cost of £75,000. Ambiente Friendly, the subject of plenty of talk in the last week due to connections switching jockeys from Callum Shepherd to Robert Havlin, holds strong claims based on his win at Lingfield, while Roger Teal's Dancing Gemini, second in the French Guineas, is another with top-class form. Mqse De Sevigne strikes late in Prix d'Ispahan nail-biter 'They work well together' | Joorabchian sheds light on Freire and Ffrench-Davis linkup Charlie Appleby and Godolphin rely on Ancient Wisdom, having once looked like having three strong contenders, and Ralph Beckett is due to run Macduff. Watch every race from Royal Ascot, all live on Sky Sports Racing from Tuesday 18th June to Saturday 22nd June Deira Mile, God's Window, Kamboo, Mr Hampstead, Padesha, Sayedaty Sadaty and Voyage have also been left in. Connections of Blue Riband Trial winner Bellum Justum believe this is the year to take a chance. With the Guineas winner Notable Speech sticking to a mile, the placed horses from Newmarket running in the Irish equivalent and the impressive Dante winner Economics skipping Epsom, the Andrew Balding-trained colt is a live outsider. \"All is good, we're happy with him and it looks a very open year. It's quite hard to assess the form lines this year,\" said Alistair Donald of owners King Power Racing. \"At least we know he can go around the track and I think we'll stay the trip. I've said before I don't know if he's quite good enough to win it, but I do think he'll run a good race. \"This is the year to take a chance with a horse like him, as there are question marks over so many of the runners, it's a very interesting Derby.\" The only two horses not confirmed were Roger Varian's Defiance and O'Brien's The Euphrates.

        "content": "The Lagos State government on Monday commenced the removal of shanties and illegal business structures under Ijora Bridge. This came after the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LSESC) served a 24-hour notice to the illegal occupants and business operators squatting under the bridge. Tokunbo Wahab, the state commissioner for environment and water resources, posted videos on the demolition of the shanties on X. The spokesperson of the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA), Folashade Kadiri, recently said the government plans to clear illegal squatters from the Ijora Under Bridge over environmental concerns. Kadiri said the demolition of the shanties was a decisive move to halt further environmental violations in the area. “The action, which was carried out by the enforcement team of the Lagos Waste Management Authority, LAWMA, followed a one-week ultimatum earlier issued by the Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources, Tokunbo Wahab,” Kadiri said. “We are committed to ensuring a clean and healthy environment for all residents of Lagos. The enforcement action under the Ijora Bridge is a crucial step in achieving this goal. “We will continue to identify and address environmental challenges across the state, working tirelessly to make Lagos a cleaner, more sustainable city.” You must be logged in to post a comment.

        "description": "Hundreds of shareable electric scooters have vanished across the Bay Area in recent years — a pivot from industry promises to revolutionize micromobility in an eco-friendly, affordable way.",
        "content": "BERKELEY — E-scooters aren’t hard to find, whether they’re zipping down city streets, cluttering public sidewalks or sitting, half-submerged, in a neighborhood pond. But hundreds of the shareable electric scooters have vanished across the Bay Area in recent years — a pivot from industry promises to revolutionize micromobility in an eco-friendly, affordable way. While some brands such as Lime and Bird are still powering forward, a growing number of e-scooter companies have quietly shuttered, declared bankruptcy and even abandoned communities outright, often without any explanation. Rent-a-scooter companies frequently blame this downward trend on financial woes — stemming from both over-investment of private equity and lackluster revenue streams. As e-scooter enterprises continue to take their business and equipment offline, some commuters, tourists and residents have been left to their own devices trying to cope with gaps in service that buses, trains and other traditional modes of public transportation struggle to fill. But it’s unclear whether local governments are politically motivated — or physically equipped — to help address the complicated safety and access concerns that are exacerbating the micromobility industry’s economic struggles. In May 2022, the e-scooter company Superpedestrian of 200 stand-up scooters and 50 seated scooters in Berkeley. Nineteen months later, they were gone. Superpedestrian announced that its scooters by the last day of 2023, despite just 18 months earlier. Joining a host of shared e-scooter brands that folded in major metropolitan areas worldwide, their neon chartreuse “LINK” e-scooters are no longer visible on the company’s app-based maps of Berkeley and Oakland — two of the cities where machines were yanked before being put . Meanwhile, VeoRide is the only remaining option to — at least through the end of June. Spokesperson Matthai Chakko said the city is currently working through the “permittee selection process” for the next fiscal year, which will determine the number of operators and e-scooters that will be available for use. He said that out of the 224,048 total e-scooter trips across Berkeley last year, roughly 22% were taken on Superpedestrian e-scooters. Looking ahead, Chakko said that “the city is open to expanding the available fleet, however, expansion is dependent on operator performance and user demand, among other things.” The current outlook for e-scooters — which generally cost under a dollar per minute to ride, along with an unlock fee — is a lot less rosy than when the industry first got rolling in California just seven years ago. Bird e-scooters were the first ones to appear by September 2017, when the company scattered hundreds of them on the streets of Santa Monica within just a few days. Bird was valued at $1 billion within its first year in business and $2.5 billion by 2019. However, Bird was temporarily grounded after it last winter — only three months after , Spin, for $19 million. By April 5, the company it had successfully sold its assets and emerged as part of Third Lane Mobility Inc. — now the largest micromobility operator in North America, encompassing both the Bird and Spin brands, which recently won multiple new competitive bids and started service in several new cities, according to the April news release. The list of shuttered or acquired companies has grown since their 2017 introduction. For example, while Spin, Scoot, Lime and Jump were awarded to operate in San Francisco in 2019, only Spin and Lime were still in business in the city by . Despite headlines about bankruptcy, acquisitions and an overall lack of cash for some rent-a-scooter operators, the fate of the industry hasn’t dimmed entirely. According to an from the National Association of City Transportation Officials on the state of shared micromobility in 2022, there were 56.5 million trips nationwide on “dockless” e-scooters, which can be parked anywhere. Compared to 65 million trips in 2021, the report attributes the recent dip to the industry’s recent financial struggles and business shifts. However, the total number of trips has hit 730 million since 2010. While the South Bay has a slightly smaller list of options, e-scooters operated by Lime, Spin and Bird can be found in cities like San Jose, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Redwood City and Millbrae. Wheels powered by Veo, however, are concentrated in the East Bay and Southern California. Looking ahead, national association said communities must tackle redesigning streets, such as adding wider bike lanes that can better accommodate more people traveling at different speeds in order to help support e-scooters and other micromobility systems. “One billion trips on shared bikes and scooters is just around the corner,” the report said, “and cities that form strong partnerships with both their operators and the communities they serve will be the ones that lead the way.” Sandwiched between Berkeley and Oakland, Emeryville has not only maintained a range of options for , but the city’s elected officials have made a concerted push for finding safer places for riders. Former Emeryville Mayor John Bauters said the success of any form of micromobility transportation relies on a local government’s ability — and desire — to invest in infrastructure specifically designed to accommodate those options, such as protected bike lanes and the car-free Emeryville Greenway. He said one of the biggest problems started when American roadways were redesigned to primarily accommodate automobiles. Despite the benefits of reducing emissions and the costs associated with car ownership, Bauters said people may shy away from accessing e-scooters and other alternative forms of transportation because they lack safe places to ride — on roadways and sidewalks, alike. “Scooter companies — predictably, in my opinion — are not succeeding because cities aren’t responding to the public desire to have choices by giving people safe infrastructure that matches those choices,” Bauters said. “The people who are choosing to use them — whether it’s because they’re more cost-effective, faster or more fun — they’re being pushed out of using it because the sidewalk isn’t for them, and neither is the street. We haven’t given them a space. Companies fail because there’s only so long in which a person who’s trying to use something that is innovative and more accessible decides it’s not worth it.”",

        "description": "Nacada CEO Anthony Omerikwa says establishments less than 300 from schools targeted.",
        "content": "The National Authority for the Campaign against Alcohol and Drug and Drug Abuse has announced a nationwide crackdown to close down bars and other liquor dispensing outlets located near learning institutions. In a statement on Monday, chief executive officer Anthony Omerikwa said the crackdown will affect bars and liquor dispensing establishments located less than 300 meters from educational institutions or areas catering to individuals below 18 years. “The crackdown will be executed in collaboration with relevant national and county government agencies and seeks to ensure strict compliance with legal requirements about the positioning of such outlets,” he said. Omerikwa said the initiative is anchored in the Alcoholic Drinks Control Act of 2010. “Moreover, it serves as a reminder to all players in the community in their role in enhancing the safe development and wellbeing of our children,” the Nacada CEO said. The Alcoholic Drinks Control Act provides a legal liability to any person who sells alcoholic drinks in prohibited locations. This is like a fine not exceeding Sh500,000 or imprisonment to a jail term not exceeding three years, or both. The crackdown is the latest in a series of other government initiatives aimed at arresting alcohol and drug abuse, especially among the youth. On May 20, Nacada ordered the removal of billboards promoting alcoholic drinks near learning institutions. The Authority said the advertisements were likely to create an erroneous impression about the characteristics, health effects, health hazards, or social effects of the alcoholic drink. It said the exposure of youth to outdoor alcohol advertising near schools was likely to mislead youth to use alcohol. The move adds to another initiative spearheaded by Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua to contain illicit brew use and drug abuse among the youth. The initiative has so far achieved commendable milestones with the Interior Ministry reporting that 18,650 unlicensed liquor joints had been closed as of March 25, 2024. While issuing the update, the CS said 12,150 premises which were operating across 47 counties without licenses and 6,500 others which were licensed contrary to National Law on proximity to learning institutions had also been shut. The CS said 14 distilleries that were manufacturing toxic killer brew had also been closed and their production infrastructure destroyed. Gachagua has on countless occasions reaffirmed the government’s commitment to rid the country of illicit brew saying it will not relent on the nationwide fight against manufacturers of the killer brew. \"President, CS Kindiki and I have resolved that we can't allow the lives of our youths to be destroyed by illicit brew. We have deployed stringent measures to save the generation. Those selling legit alcoholic drinks will not be affected,\" Gachagua said in Meru on March 23.",

Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez. With Marcell Ozuna at the plate, Acuña started toward third on a stolen base attempt and his left knee gave way.

That is according to studio estimates on Sunday. Warner Bros. is waiting until Monday to release its four-day estimates. That left room for the weekend's other new opener, “The Garfield Movie,” to claim No. 1 for the four-day holiday weekend with $31.9 million. Aside from Memorial Day in 2020 when theaters were closed due to COVID-19, these are the lowest-earning No. 1 movies on this weekend in 29 years. Paris' traffic-clogged Champs-Elysees turned into a mass picnic blanket for an unusual meal PARIS (AP) — The French capital’s most famous street has been transformed into a massive picnic blanket. Around 4,000 people sat in the sun on Sunday enjoying an al fresco meal on the Champs-Elysees Avenue. The lucky picnickers were selected in a draw and provided with free baskets with delicacies from some of the top chefs in Paris. A tablecloth ran around 216 yards from the Arc de Triomphe along the avenue and served as the sitting area for the event. The event comes exactly two months before Paris hosts the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics. Nicki Minaj's England concert postponed after rapper was detained by Dutch authorities over pot MANCHESTER, England (AP) — Nicki Minaj’s concert in Manchester, England, scheduled for Saturday night was postponed after police in the Netherlands discovered marijuana in her bags as she was preparing to leave the country. Promoter Live Nation said the show would be rescheduled soon and tickets were honored. It said Minaj made “best efforts” to make the show in time. Minaj tweeted earlier Saturday that police at the Amsterdam airport stopped her Saturday as she was about to board a plane for a concert in Manchester, England. She tweeted that police told her they found marijuana in her bags, and it would have to be weighed. Cannabis is illegal in the Netherlands, but it is tolerated for recreational use.

        "content": "Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months. Chasing cheese wheels or lugging sacks of wool, UK competitors embrace quirky extreme races LONDON (AP) — Dairy-loving daredevils threw caution to the wind Monday for one of Britain’s most extreme annual events: Cheese rolling. Dozens of reckless racers chased 7-pound (3 kilogram) wheels of Double Gloucester cheese down the near-vertical Cooper’s Hill, near Gloucester in southwest England. The first racer to finish behind the fast-rolling cheese in each race gets to keep it. The races have been held at Cooper’s Hill since at least 1826. In the nearby town of Tetbury, competitors carried sacks of wool weighing up to 60 pounds (27 kilograms) up and down Gumstool Hill. The Tetbury Woolsack Races have been held since 1972. They draw on a local tradition dating back to the 17th century in the historic wool-trading town. Former 'General Hospital' actor Johnny Wactor killed in downtown Los Angeles shooting LOS ANGELES (AP) — Former “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was shot and killed when he interrupted thieves stealing the catalytic converter from his car in Los Angeles. Police say the shooting occurred around 3 a.m. Saturday when the victim approached three men in downtown LA. His mother, Scarlett Wactor, tells ABC 7 that her 37-year-old son had left work at a rooftop bar with a coworker when he saw someone at his car and thought it was being towed. Scarlett Wactor says a mask-wearing suspect looked up and opened fire. Police say three suspects drove away from the scene. Wactor was rushed to a hospital, where he died. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. 12 people injured after Qatar Airways plane hits turbulence on flight to Dublin LONDON (AP) — Twelve people have been injured when a Qatar Airways plane flying from Doha to Dublin hit turbulence. Dublin Airport said in a statement that the plane landed safely as scheduled before 1 p.m. Sunday. It said six passengers and six crew members reported injuries after the aircraft experienced turbulence while airborne over Turkey. The airport said all passengers were assessed for injuries aboard the plane, and eight were then taken to hospital. The incident comes five days after a British man died of a suspected heart attack and dozens of people were injured when a Singapore Airlines flight from London hit severe turbulence. Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. to miss the rest of the season after tearing his left ACL PITTSBURGH (AP) — Atlanta Braves star Ronald Acuña Jr. will miss the rest of the season after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during an 8-1 victory at Pittsburgh. The reigning NL MVP led off the game with a double to right-center field off Martín Pérez.

Thousands of apply to be on the show, but only a lucky handful make it to Majorca — and Mimii is one of the chosen few. Applying was a spontaneous thing, I didn’t expect to get here! When asked why she chose to apply for Love Island now, Mimii — real name Michelle — said: \"The pool in Portsmouth is not giving. \"I’ve tried dating, speaking to people on social media and it just hasn’t been successful. \"Applying was a spontaneous thing, I didn’t expect to get here!\" And when asked what she thinks she'll bring to the villa, Mimii explained: \"I’m a girls’ girl. My girls are my rocks and I’m theirs so I’ll be a good friend as well as going in there to find a man. \"I like dressing up so I’ll bring style, and I’d like to think I’m quite funny so I’ll make people laugh. \"Bringing honesty as well — I’m good at picking up on people's personality traits and side-eyeing those who might be a liar.\" Miimii is studying to be a mental health nurse, which could come in handy in the pressure cooker environment of the villa. She is also an actor who enjoys performing in theatre shows. In a production of Grease in Portsmouth , Mimii played the part of Marty. Mimii is heading into the Love Island villa for season 11, which kicks off on June 3, 2024. She will be joined by ten other singletons all looking for a steamy summer of love. As the weeks go on, the original cast will be joined by more bombshells. The Sun revealed how the famous villa has gone through a glam makeover in time for the new series. The launch show will start at 9pm on ITV2 on June 3, 2024. Episodes will then continue at the same time from Sunday to Friday. On Saturdays a highlights show is aired instead of the main programme. The Sun previously revealed how Love Island bosses are planning a huge shake-up for the launch night. ITV is going to air the dating show simultaneously across ITV1, ITV2 and ITVX for the first time. A source said: “ITV want to throw their weight behind Love Island and make sure it has a big, glitzy moment when the 11th series kicks off next month. “Showing it across every channel means creating what they hope will be a big TV moment. It shows there is still a real commitment to the format even nine years on.\" Every year Love Island opens its doors to more sexy Islanders who are hoping for a holiday romance that could turn into more. Here we take you though all of the Love Island winners so far and what their relationship statuses are now: 2024 - The first ever All stars spin off show was won by Molly Smith and Tom Clare . STATUS: Still together. 2023 - Jess Harding and Sammy Root took home the 50K, and won the summer 2023 Love Island . STATUS: Broken up. 2023 - The first series of 2023 saw Sanam Harrinanan and Kai Fagan crowned Love Island winners in South Africa .

        "content": "interrupted his May bank holiday with his family to share a very important message. The 75-year-old penned a heartwarming message to the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands following the landslide in Enga on Friday 24 May 2024. \"My wife and I were deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the devastating landslide in Enga, and the tragic loss of so many lives, homes and food gardens. \"I have witnessed at first-hand and have great admiration for, the extraordinary resilience of the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands. I have faith that your communities will come together to support the survivors and the recovery in these heartbreaking circumstances. \"My wife joins me in sending our most heartfelt condolences to the families and communities who have suffered so much as a result of this appallingly traumatic event. Papua New Guinea is very much in our special thoughts and prayers.\" As many as 2,000 people are feared buried under Papua New Guinea landslide as survivors dig with hands and spades. Locals have been left reeling after tonnes of rock and mud smashed into their homes as they slept, and rescuers have struggled to reach such a remote part of what is already one of Asia’s poorest nations leaving locals with little choice but to dig through the collapsed mountainside with whatever tools they have. Papua New Guinea is home to around 10 million people. Its vast mountainous terrain and lack of roads have made it difficult to access the affected area. Papua is one of five countries in Asia and the Pacific where the His Majesty is head of state. They also include Australia, New Zealand, the Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. At a ceremony also honouring the late Queen, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape said: “In reflection of the life she lived, the exemplary performance of duties as the head of the state of Papua New Guinea, it is in this connection that we all gather here this morning to acknowledge her passing and to acknowledge and witness the ascension of the throne of King Charles III,” the Associated Press reported.

Deputy Governor Adnan Zaylani Mohamad Zahid said the foreign exchange policy flexibilities, as a package, are expected to reduce the concern of foreign exchange mismatch for both the lender and the borrower. \"Another shared priority is our respective focus on green finance and sustainability agenda. \"We would also like to welcome greater engagement from multilateral development banks such as the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) to participate in providing financing and critical expertise in the area of sustainable development in Malaysia, particularly in green finance and sustainability,\" he said during a keynote address at the roundtable discussion between the IsDB and Malaysia’s Islamic Financial Markets Subcommittee (IFMC) today. According to Adnan, identifying common priorities for the IsDB and Malaysia will enable the banks to channel resources and focus efforts more effectively. \"It is instrumental in facilitating a deeper understanding of each other's investment preferences and risk appetites, paving the way for mutually beneficial investment linkages,\" he added. - Bernama",

        "description": "Here is the roundup of all the motorsport action that took place around the world during the weekend (May 23-26).",
        "content": "From May 24-26, the motorsport world was revving with events across the continents. While Monaco hosted the three Formula races in which F1’s Charles Leclerc claimed his first-ever home race victory, the Shanghai E-Prix double-header saw two different pole-setters and race winners. In a street circuit like Monte Carlo, securing pole position in qualifying almost guarantees a race win because of the nature of the track. Although Ferrari’s Leclerc topped the timesheet on Saturday, he knew he had his work cut out, keeping in mind his Monaco curse. Since his F1 career began in 2018, the Monegasque driver had failed to make it to the podium of his home race. Back in 2021 and 2022, Leclerc claimed pole position but couldn’t convert them into wins – he didn’t start the race in 2021 and a poor team strategy cost him the next year. The final moments of the Monaco Grand Prix 🥺 Goosebumps from After starting at the front on Sunday, he was dealt with a race restart with the charging McLaren of Oscar Piastri hot on his heels. But nothing could come in the way of the 26-year-old, who dominated from start to finish to win an emotional first-ever home race. The Indianapolis 500, commonly known as the Indy 500, saw 33 drivers take part in the 500-mile rain-affected race on Sunday. Often termed ‘the greatest spectacle in racing’, the 108th edition of the Indy 500 around the 2.5-mile circuit proved exactly why. It was Josef Newgarden who came out on top in the most riveting fashion as he passed Pato O’Ward in the final lap to win back-to-back races. The two raced it out to the flag, trading positions a few times before Newgarden and his Penske sealed the deal. He became the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. Zak O’Sullivan will have the Virtual Safety Car to thank as it helped him win the Feature race and get a first-career win in F2. Going on a long stint after starting from P15, the ART Grand Prix driver had a cheap pit stop to come ahead of leader Isack Hadjar. Richard Verschoor, who started from the front, faced issues with the car and saw his lead diminish with every lap. Falling to the back of the grid, he was handed a five-second penalty and eventually retired his Trident. Hadjar, who won the Imola Feature race last weekend, battled his way from P3 but was denied by O’Sullivan in a dramatic final lap. Hadjar was also in the middle of a heart-in-mouth moment on Friday when he used his skills and reflexes to swerve away from a slow-moving Ritomo Miyata in the tunnel section of the track. Lightning-quick reactions from Isack Hadjar ⚡️ An unbelievable show of reflex and skill in the Monaco tunnel. PREMA Racing’s Gabriele Mini claimed victory at the Monte Carlo Feature race, making him the eighth different winner in eight races this season. Mini has now won two Monaco feature street races in a row. Leading from pole position, the Italian had to defend from ART Grand Prix’s Christian Mansell who was a car-length behind him for most of the race. He managed to lead the pack throughout despite three Safety Car restarts in the 27-lap race. He now leads the Driver’s Championship with a four-point gap to second placed Luke Browning of Hitech Pulse-Eight. Aleix Espargaro broke the news of his retirement to the MotoGP world before the Catalunya GP, bringing to end a nearly 15-year long career. However, 48 hours after announcing his departure, he was gifted his first sprint win of the season, in his home race. The Aprilia Racing driver started from pole but fell down the order in the 12-lap sprint. Francesco Bagnaia, who found his way to the front of the pack, crashed on the last lap to give the win away to the Spaniard. The brightest star in Barcelona ⭐ That's what it feels like to win the on home turf for ! 🥇 🏁 Bagnaia had a better show on Sunday as he drove his Ducati to victory at the Circuit de Catalunya while Espargaro had to settle for fourth. The Shanghai E-Prix weekend had two exciting races which saw Mitch Evans take victory despite being overtaken in the penultimate lap, and Antonio Felix Da Costa claim a second win in three races. Evans, who started Saturday’s race from third, was passed by Pascal Wehrlein in the closing stages by cutting across the circuit. But the Kiwi driver made a move in the final corners to claim the win. In the second race, Mclaren’s Jake Hughes stole pole position by one thousandth of a second but had to settle for second as Da Costa managed to pull ahead of the pack with better energy management. After leading the pack for 90 of 249 laps, which was 151 laps less than the usual 400, Christopher Bell was declared winner after the race was called off. Due to a heavy storm that resulted in a shorter format of the calendar’s longest race, the officials were forced to call the race off keeping in mind the safety conditions. For Kyle Larson, who was supposed to do ‘The Double’ by racing at the Indy500 as well, weather played spoilsport and ruined his plans. A delayed start and fuel issues in Indianapolis made him take the call to fly back to Charlotte. But three stages of the Cup Series race had already gone by and Larson was yet to land.

        "content": "The importance of self-defence for everyone as a lifelong skill In today’s unpredictable world, the importance of self-defence cannot be overstated. Whether young or old, male or female, everyone can benefit from learning how to protect themselves. Self-defence encompasses a range of techniques and strategies designed to help individuals defend against physical threats. However, its benefits extend beyond physical protection, enhancing mental well-being and fostering a sense of empowerment. BUILDING CONFIDENCE AND EMPOWERMENT One of the most significant benefits of learning self-defence is the boost in confidence it provides. Knowing you have the skills to protect yourself in a potentially dangerous situation instils a sense of security and empowerment. This confidence transcends physical scenarios and seeps into everyday life, making individuals more assertive and less likely to be intimidated or bullied. For women and girls, in particular, self-defence training can be transformative. Societal norms and gender-based violence often leave women feeling vulnerable. By equipping themselves with self-defence skills, women can challenge these norms and take control of their safety. This empowerment is crucial in fostering gender equality and enabling women to navigate the world with confidence and assurance. ENHANCING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND HEALTH Self-defence training is not just about learning to fight; it’s also an excellent way to improve physical fitness. Many self-defence classes incorporate elements of cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and flexibility. These physical activities contribute to overall health, helping to maintain a healthy weight, improve cardiovascular health, and build muscle strength. Regular physical activity is known to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Moreover, the physical conditioning involved in self-defence training improves coordination, agility, and reflexes, making individuals more adept at handling various physical tasks and challenges. MENTAL RESILIENCE AND STRESS RELIEF The mental benefits of self-defence are equally compelling. Engaging in self-defence training can significantly reduce stress levels. The physical exertion involved helps to release endorphins, the body’s natural mood elevators, which can alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Furthermore, self-defence training requires mental focus and discipline. Learning to assess situations, make quick decisions, and remain calm under pressure enhances mental resilience. This mental fortitude is invaluable in everyday life, aiding in problem-solving and improving emotional regulation. PROMOTING AWARENESS AND PREVENTION An essential aspect of self-defence is situational awareness. Self-defence training teaches individuals to be mindful of their surroundings and recognise potential threats before they escalate. This heightened awareness is a crucial preventive measure, enabling individuals to avoid dangerous situations altogether. In addition to physical techniques, self-defence training often includes verbal strategies to de-escalate conflicts. Learning how to communicate effectively and assert boundaries can prevent physical confrontations, making self-defence a holistic approach to personal safety. INCLUSIVITY AND LIFELONG LEARNING Self-defence is a valuable skill for people of all ages and abilities. For children, learning self-defence can teach discipline, respect, and the importance of personal boundaries. It can also provide a safe outlet for physical energy and help prevent bullying. For older adults, self-defence training can enhance mobility, balance, and independence. As individuals age, the risk of falls and physical vulnerabilities increase. Self-defence techniques can improve stability and provide seniors with the confidence to live independently. Inclusivity in self-defence training is paramount. Classes tailored to different age groups, fitness levels, and physical capabilities ensure that everyone can benefit from these skills. Adaptive self-defence techniques can accommodate individuals with disabilities, ensuring that personal safety is accessible to all. In a world where safety concerns are ever-present, the importance of self-defence surpasses gender and age. It equips individuals with the tools to protect themselves physically, enhances mental and physical health, and fosters a sense of empowerment and confidence. By promoting awareness, prevention, and inclusivity, self-defence training serves as a vital life skill that benefits everyone, regardless of their stage in life. Investing in self-defence is an investment in personal security and overall well-being, making it a practice that everyone should consider embracing. – IZAH AZAHARI",

        "content": "Nigeria’s U-17 team, the Golden Eaglets , face an uncertain future regarding the 2025 U-17 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) . While their 1-0 semi-final defeat to Ivory Coast in the WAFU B qualifiers ended their hopes of automatic qualification, a potential expansion of the tournament offers a lifeline. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has yet to determine the number of teams qualifying from each zone. Traditionally, only two teams progressed from each region, but speculation suggests this could increase due to FIFA’s expansion of the U-17 World Cup to 32 teams. Golden Eaglets media officer, Francis Achi, remains optimistic. He hints at the possibility of three teams qualifying from WAFU Zone B, with CAF expected to confirm the details soon.

        "content": "National Vice-Chairman, South-West of Accord, Chief Paul Igbinsola, on Monday, ex-rayed the performance of Gov. Seyi Makinde’s administration in the last one year, saying that it falls below the expectations of the people of Oyo State. Igbinsola told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan that his party and the people of the state had not seen any meaningful development since the commencement of Makinde’s second term on May 29, 2023. According to him, the state has been struggling with security challenges within the period under review, adding that the impacts of the money claimed to have been expended on security agencies had yet to be felt. “The economic situation across the state is also at its worst stage due to the failure of the Makinde-led administration to lift the hope of the people despite the increase in revenue allocation from the Federal Government. “Majority of small-scale business owners and farmers are not allowed to benefit from the low interest credit facilities and inputs from the state government because they are not members of the ruling party,” he said. Igbinsola also criticised the state government for engaging in sales of lands in some Government Reservation Areas (GRAs) and those already occupied by professional groups to estate developers indiscriminately. “In the last one year, we have witnessed series of handing over of public and private lands to the so-called investors, all in the name of public-private partnership (PPP) initiative. “Through this initiative, lots of the farmlands hitherto reserved for agricultural purposes have been converted to residential estates, with prices going beyond the reach of the masses,” he stated. The party chieftain called for reversal of some of the Makinde-led administration’s policies and programmes, which he described as anti-people. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Media, Mr Sulaimon Olanrewaju, however, countered Igbinsola, insisting that his principal had recorded tremendous achievements in terms of development in all sectors. According to Olanrewaju, the governor had has been working day and night since the beginning of his second term in office by either flagging-off road construction or inaugurating the completed ones. He said that about 170 kilometers of roads had been completed and inaugurated across the state within the last one year, adding that the 76.67-kilometer Ogbomoso- Iseyin road had been completed and would be inaugurated soon. The governor’s spokesman listed the roads whose contracts had been awarded in the last one year to include: Ido-Eruwa road (48 kilometers), Ibadan circular road (32.2 kilometers) and inner roads within Ibadan metropolis (84.75 kilometers). He also mentioned the bush clearing of the 34-kilometre North-East wing of Ibadan circular road as part of the ongoing projects in the state. In the area of education, Olanrewaju said that rehabilitation and renovation of many school structures and provision of learning equipment had been done while the process of recruiting 7,000 primary school teachers had commenced. He said that agricultural sector was not left out, as the state government had supported farmers with seedlings and other inputs, while access to credit facilities had been provided to farmers and small business owners at single digit interest rate. This, he said, was aside the provision of tractors at subsidised rate to farmers in the state. On workers’ welfare, the special adviser said the state was the first to announce payment of wage award to its workers and pensioners to cushion the effect of fuel subsidy removal. He added that and that the governor had even extended the wage award payment beyond March, even when the Federal Government that introduced it had stopped paying its workers. “We shouldn’t forget that backlogs of gratuities of retired civil servants have been cleared and that monthly pensions of retirees are now being paid promptly. “Omituntun commuters buses are also everywhere across the state providing services to residents at cheaper fares. “We have many other laudable achievements across all sectors that have been recorded under this administration in the last one year, while our people should be expecting more dividends of democracy,” he said.

        "content": "GETTING tattoos - however large or small - could up your risk of developing cancer by 21 per cent, a study suggests. A Swedish study found a link between tattoos and cancer of the lymphatic system, also known as lymphoma . Researchers from Lund University stressed they're not trying to dissuade people from getting inked and said further research is needed to confirm their results. But they said that not much is currently known about the long-term health effects of tattoos , with little research in the area despite the popularity of permanent body art surging in recent decades. Lead author Christel Nielsen said: “We already know that when the tattoo ink is injected into the skin, the body interprets this as something foreign that should not be there and the immune system is activated. \"A large part of the ink is transported away from the skin, to the lymph nodes where it is deposited.\" Lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that affects the immune system - specifically white blood cells called lymphocytes, according to Blood Cancer UK . There are two main types of lymphatic cancer – Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Over 14,000 people are diagnosed with lymphoma each year in the UK, making it the most common blood cancer. Lund University researchers looked at the link between tattoos and lymphoma, finding that people sporting ink have a 21 per cent increased chance of developing it. They relied on Swedish National Authority registries, which identify every individual who's been diagnosed with lymphoma, Dr Nielsen said. Out of the 11,905 people studied, 2,938 were diagnosed with lymphoma between the ages of 20 and 60 years old, between 2007 and 2011. Of these participants, 54 per cent (1,398) answered a questionnaire about tattoos. Researchers also examined a control group of 4,193 people who hadn't been diagnosed with cancer. “We have identified people diagnosed with lymphoma via population registers,\" Dr Nielsen said. \"These individuals were then matched with a control group of the same sex and age, but without lymphoma. \"The study participants answered a questionnaire about lifestyle factors to determine whether they were tattooed or not.\" In the group with lymphoma, 21 percent were tattooed (289 individuals), study results published in eClinicalMedicine showed. As for the control group, 18 percent were tattooed (735). “After taking into account other relevant factors, such as smoking and age, we found that the risk of developing lymphoma was 21 per cent higher among those who were tattooed,\" Dr Nielsen explained. The study team initially thought the size of a tattoo would affect someone's likelihood of developing lymphoma - for example, that a full body tattoo might be associated with a greater risk compared to a small butterfly. To their surprise, the size of of the tattoo turned out not to matter. “We do not yet know why this was the case,\" Dr Nielsen said. \"One can only speculate that a tattoo, regardless of size, triggers a low-grade inflammation in the body, which in turn can trigger cancer. \"The picture is thus more complex than we initially thought.” Study authors noted that most people get their first tattoo at a young age, meaning they're are exposed to tattoo ink for a large part of their life. But they said research into the subject has only scratched the surface of the long-term health effects of tattoos. Dr Nielsen said: \"It is important to remember that lymphoma is a rare disease and that our results apply at the group level. \"The results now need to be verified and investigated further in other studies and such research is ongoing.\" The research group intends to conduct studies on whether there is any association between tattoos and other types of cancer. They also want to do further research on other inflammatory diseases to see if there is a link to tattoos. Dr Nielsen said the point of the research was to ensure the practice of tattooing is safe rather than to dissuade people from doing it. “People will likely want to continue to express their identity through tattoos, and therefore it is very important that we as a society can make sure that it is safe,\" she explained. \"For the individual, it is good to know that tattoos can affect your health, and that you should turn to your health care provider if you experience symptoms that you believe could be related to your tattoo.” LYMPHOMA - also referred to as lymphatic cancer - is a type of blood cancer that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes. The most common symptom of the disease are lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes. You may get painless swellings in your neck, collarbone, armpit, groin or other parts of your body. Some swollen lymph nodes can press on organs and cause pain in your chest, coughing, breathlessness, or pain in your stomach area. Other symptoms include: There are different types of lymphoma depending on how the cells are affected and how the lymphoma behaves. They include: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas that are fast-growing: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas that are slow-growing: Source: Blood Cancer UK",

But they said research into the subject has only scratched the surface of the long-term health effects of tattoos. Dr Nielsen said: \"It is important to remember that lymphoma is a rare disease and that our results apply at the group level. \"The results now need to be verified and investigated further in other studies and such research is ongoing.\" The research group intends to conduct studies on whether there is any association between tattoos and other types of cancer. They also want to do further research on other inflammatory diseases to see if there is a link to tattoos. Dr Nielsen said the point of the research was to ensure the practice of tattooing is safe rather than to dissuade people from doing it. “People will likely want to continue to express their identity through tattoos, and therefore it is very important that we as a society can make sure that it is safe,\" she explained. \"For the individual, it is good to know that tattoos can affect your health, and that you should turn to your health care provider if you experience symptoms that you believe could be related to your tattoo.” LYMPHOMA - also referred to as lymphatic cancer - is a type of blood cancer that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes. The most common symptom of the disease are lumps caused by swollen lymph nodes. You may get painless swellings in your neck, collarbone, armpit, groin or other parts of your body. Some swollen lymph nodes can press on organs and cause pain in your chest, coughing, breathlessness, or pain in your stomach area. Other symptoms include: There are different types of lymphoma depending on how the cells are affected and how the lymphoma behaves. They include: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas that are fast-growing: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas that are slow-growing: Source: Blood Cancer UK",
