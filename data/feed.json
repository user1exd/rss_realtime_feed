        "description": "O'Hoppe, 24, has still caught just 98 games in the majors. Refusing to use his inexperience as an excuse, O'Hoppe said he hasn't lived up to his own expectations in terms of helping the pitching staff.",
        "content": "ANAHEIM — A month ago the Angels were swept by the Minnesota Twins , allowing 11 runs in the series finale. It was one of the lowest points of a mostly disappointing two months. For more than a half hour after that Sunday afternoon game, catcher Logan O’Hoppe sat in the Angels dugout conferring with bench coach Ray Montgomery. O’Hoppe then spoke to reporters and took responsibility for the flood of runs and hits they allowed. “When there’s a crooked number under hits on the scoreboard, it’s not fun and you do feel guilty about it,” O’Hoppe said that day. “You do a lot of work to make sure that doesn’t happen. It’s part of my job. That’s why I’m here, to win games and get these guys through it, and I’m not happy with how I’ve been doing it.” Since that day, the Angels pitching has shown a few more encouraging signs, although the results still aren’t what the Angels need them to be. The same can be said for O’Hoppe’s role in the process. “I’m not gonna sit there and tell you that I feel like I’m doing more good than bad right now,” the 24-year-old catcher said this weekend. “I feel like I’m definitely feeling the inexperience and opportunities to grow more than I am confirming the things that work. It’s just something I’m trying to be patient with. I’m not gonna lie. It’s taken a toll on me mentally.” Any discussion of O’Hoppe’s role the performance of the Angels pitchers requires some nuance. First, no one would suggest that the primary responsibility for pitching strategy falls on anyone but the pitcher who has the ball in his hand. Also, no one who has spent any time around O’Hoppe has any doubt in the work he puts in toward learning his pitchers and devising a game plan. In fact, one of the reasons the pitchers like O’Hoppe so much is because they feel how invested he is in their performance. That said, O’Hoppe acknowledges that he hasn’t lived up to his own expectations in terms of handling the pitching staff. “I think it’s all a learning process,” O’Hoppe said. “I know this position carries a lot of weight and a lot of responsibility, and that’s the part I really do love. It’s heavier than I expected. I’m sure some of that is self-inflicted. It’s just it’s not fun looking up and seeing crooked numbers on the board. Then you have a start like (José) Soriano’s in Cleveland and it all balances out. I know I’m inexperienced. I know I have a lot to learn, but at the same time, I’m trying to stick to what I know works personally and work with them.” O’Hoppe was behind the plate when Soriano threw six scoreless innings on May 3 at Cleveland, just a few days after that nightmare against the Twins. He was the catcher for all three of the Angels shutouts, including the Soriano start in Cleveland, a Reid Detmers start on April 12 in Boston and a Patrick Sandoval start on May 7 in Pittsburgh. Left-hander Tyler Anderson, who has been the Angels most consistent starter all season, said last week in an interview on MLB Network Radio that O’Hoppe has improved. “From where he was last year to this year, he’s made massive strides on the catching side,” Anderson said. Still, the Angels have a 4.64 ERA, which ranks 27th in the majors. According to some in and around the clubhouse, there have been times when pitch selection has been an issue, as well as execution. Since the establishment of the pitch timer last year, it’s more difficult than ever for pitchers to shake off a sign until they get what they want. Mound visits are now limited to four per game, further impacting the ability of a pitcher and catcher to get on the same page when there are disagreements. Back in 2022, the Angels ranked ninth in the majors in ERA. Most of the pitch calling that season was handled by veteran catchers Max Stassi and Kurt Suzuki. Stassi’s unplanned absence last year left O’Hoppe as the No. 1 catcher, and then he missed four months of the season rehabbing from shoulder surgery. O’Hoppe said he felt like he was trying to take in so much information in such a short time that it was like “drinking out of a fire hose.” Over the winter the Angels’ front office decided not to provide O’Hoppe with a veteran mentor. Catchers Austin Hedges and Martin Maldonado, for example, were both available as free agents. Instead, the Angels are trying to speed up the learning curve by giving O’Hoppe every inning he can handle. He’s started 41 of the Angels’ 53 games. His 369-1/3 innings behind the plate are tied for the fourth most in the majors. Even with a heavy workload this season, O’Hoppe has caught just 98 games in the majors, which is not even one full season for a No. 1 catcher. O’Hoppe acknowledges that he’s still learning, although grudgingly. “I pride of myself for not making excuses,” he said. “Because I’m here; I need to win games and be the best I can be. I do tell myself that (I’m inexperienced) but I don’t think that’s any reason to justify any poor performance or excuse.” Instead of shrugging off the disappointment and chalking it up to growing pains, O’Hoppe said he brings the games home with him. He analyzes the games long after they’re over to see what he could have done differently. “It’s tough to wind down some nights,” O’Hoppe said, “but I know it’s part of it.” O’Hoppe is also going through all of this with a new staff around him. Pitching coach Barry Enright and bullpen coach Steve Karsay, as well as run prevention coordinator Alex Cultice, are all new to the mix of voices in O’Hoppe’s head as he decides which pitches to call more than 120 times a night. Without a veteran catcher to help, O’Hoppe said he’s frequently communicated with Suzuki — now a member of the Angels’ front office — as well as catching coach Jerry Narron and backup catcher Matt Thaiss. Manager Ron Washington neither blamed nor absolved O’Hoppe for the performance of the pitching staff. It is a simple fact that the catcher and pitcher work together, and in this case there’s plenty of inexperience on both sides.

        "content": "DALLAS — Karl-Anthony Towns had seemingly bested his postseason demons through the first two rounds of this year’s playoffs. Sure, there were a few offensive clunkers mixed in, but in general, the all-star big man was great on defense — where he took on marquee matchups — and on the glass and delivered offensively when needed. He helped slam the door on Phoenix in Game 4 of the first-round series sweep. He shot 51 percent from the floor and 39 percent from deep against Denver in the Western Conference semifinals. ADVERTISEMENT After his fair share of past playoff struggles, Towns had apparently found a comfort level on the sport’s biggest, brightest stages. But the Western Conference Finals have told a different story. Through three games — all Wolves losses — Towns is shooting 28 percent from the field and 14 percent from 3-point range. His offensive struggles bottomed out in Sunday’s Game 3 when the big man went 0 for 8 shooting from 3-point range. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch admitted it was “hard to watch” Towns struggle at times Sunday. “He had enough buckets here and there. Defensively, in the second half, I was really pleased with the way he played, rebounding pretty well,” Finch said. “But yeah, he’s struggling. There’s no doubt in that right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Finch felt Towns was rushing his shots earlier in the series. He didn’t think that was the case Sunday, which makes the results all the more inexplicable. One of the NBA’s premiere 3-point shooters missed the rim on multiple good looks from beyond the arc. “He had a couple of good looks and needed those to go down, particularly earlier in the game,” Finch said. And Towns assumed they would. “I feel every shot’s good. I’ve shot a lot of basketballs in my life. I’m the first one in the gym. I definitely am working. I’m shooting. Every time I’m shooting, it feels good,” Towns said. “I’m just having these very unfortunate bounces all the time. It’s annoying. The last game, first shot of the game goes in-out, in-out, in-out. This game, my first shot is a free throw and it goes in-out. I don’t mean to smile, but I’ve just got to laugh at it right now. It’s very disappointing.” ADVERTISEMENT Towns said his confidence level remains “extremely high.” He noted he’s putting up “1,500 shots a day,” a fact the Inside the NBA television crew vehemently disputed after Game 3. Regardless, Towns has a large body of work upon which he can rely to know future shots will fall. Wolves forward Kyle Anderson agreed 3-point shots will go down for Towns. But there are certainly other ways he can get himself going in the meantime. That was evident in the third quarter Sunday, when — after Dallas big man Dereck Lively left the game due to injury — Towns started to go downhill aggressively in an effort to attack the rack. “Put me in spots where I was getting the ball in the mid-post, Dallas action,” Towns said, “and I was utilizing that one-two step to the basket for my advantage.” Perhaps more of that will be required until Towns regains his shooting touch. Because this much is apparent – if Towns can’t find ways to be an offensive contributor, it will be difficult for the Wolves to extend their season. There simply aren’t enough shooters or offensive creators for Minnesota to survive these major lulls from its all-star big man. ADVERTISEMENT Take the second half Sunday, for example. When Towns was 3 for 4 from the field with nine points in the third period, the Wolves dropped 35 points in the quarter — their most impressive offensive segment of the series. When Towns is rolling, it opens up the floor for everyone else — starting with Anthony Edwards. But, in the fourth quarter, Towns regressed again, going 0 for 4 shooting from the field, and Minnesota scored just 20 points in the period en route to another crushing defeat. If Dallas doesn’t have to account for Towns on offense, the floor shrinks for Minnesota in short order. Towns has shot below 35 percent from the floor in nine of his 30 career playoff games, and the Wolves are 0-9 in those games. ADVERTISEMENT “I think KAT gotta just do a better job of maybe getting back to his old self, of finding himself around the basket more. Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "DALLAS — Karl-Anthony Towns had seemingly bested his postseason demons through the first two rounds of this year’s playoffs. Sure, there were a few offensive clunkers mixed in, but in general, the all-star big man was great on defense — where he took on marquee matchups — and on the glass and delivered offensively when needed. He helped slam the door on Phoenix in Game 4 of the first-round series sweep. He shot 51 percent from the floor and 39 percent from deep against Denver in the Western Conference semifinals. ADVERTISEMENT After his fair share of past playoff struggles, Towns had apparently found a comfort level on the sport’s biggest, brightest stages. But the Western Conference Finals have told a different story. Through three games — all Wolves losses — Towns is shooting 28 percent from the field and 14 percent from 3-point range. His offensive struggles bottomed out in Sunday’s Game 3 when the big man went 0 for 8 shooting from 3-point range. Timberwolves coach Chris Finch admitted it was “hard to watch” Towns struggle at times Sunday. “He had enough buckets here and there. Defensively, in the second half, I was really pleased with the way he played, rebounding pretty well,” Finch said. “But yeah, he’s struggling. There’s no doubt in that right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Finch felt Towns was rushing his shots earlier in the series. He didn’t think that was the case Sunday, which makes the results all the more inexplicable. One of the NBA’s premiere 3-point shooters missed the rim on multiple good looks from beyond the arc. “He had a couple of good looks and needed those to go down, particularly earlier in the game,” Finch said. And Towns assumed they would. “I feel every shot’s good. I’ve shot a lot of basketballs in my life. I’m the first one in the gym. I definitely am working. I’m shooting. Every time I’m shooting, it feels good,” Towns said. “I’m just having these very unfortunate bounces all the time. It’s annoying. The last game, first shot of the game goes in-out, in-out, in-out. This game, my first shot is a free throw and it goes in-out. I don’t mean to smile, but I’ve just got to laugh at it right now. It’s very disappointing.” ADVERTISEMENT Towns said his confidence level remains “extremely high.” He noted he’s putting up “1,500 shots a day,” a fact the Inside the NBA television crew vehemently disputed after Game 3. Regardless, Towns has a large body of work upon which he can rely to know future shots will fall. Wolves forward Kyle Anderson agreed 3-point shots will go down for Towns. But there are certainly other ways he can get himself going in the meantime. That was evident in the third quarter Sunday, when — after Dallas big man Dereck Lively left the game due to injury — Towns started to go downhill aggressively in an effort to attack the rack. “Put me in spots where I was getting the ball in the mid-post, Dallas action,” Towns said, “and I was utilizing that one-two step to the basket for my advantage.” Perhaps more of that will be required until Towns regains his shooting touch. Because this much is apparent – if Towns can’t find ways to be an offensive contributor, it will be difficult for the Wolves to extend their season. There simply aren’t enough shooters or offensive creators for Minnesota to survive these major lulls from its all-star big man. ADVERTISEMENT Take the second half Sunday, for example. When Towns was 3 for 4 from the field with nine points in the third period, the Wolves dropped 35 points in the quarter — their most impressive offensive segment of the series. When Towns is rolling, it opens up the floor for everyone else — starting with Anthony Edwards. But, in the fourth quarter, Towns regressed again, going 0 for 4 shooting from the field, and Minnesota scored just 20 points in the period en route to another crushing defeat. If Dallas doesn’t have to account for Towns on offense, the floor shrinks for Minnesota in short order. Towns has shot below 35 percent from the floor in nine of his 30 career playoff games, and the Wolves are 0-9 in those games. ADVERTISEMENT “I think KAT gotta just do a better job of maybe getting back to his old self, of finding himself around the basket more. Rim running, taking advantage of mismatches,” Anderson said. “He’s obviously a really good player, and he’s big time for us, so we need him to get going. So it’s our job to put him in the right position. ... But I think if he gets back to rim running and catching the ball on the block and taking his time and going to finish, they got nothing for him. So we just gotta find him, put him in the right situations.” ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

In March, Helen revealed she suffered a psychotic breakdown at the beginning of the year after splitting from her ex of 13 years, Scott Sinclair. And the former Coronation Street star, 33, took to Instagram on Sunday to share that she feels like a 'horrible mummy' being away from her kids - Charlie, six, and Matilda, eight - when they spend time with their father Scott. Helen shared an adorable video with her son, as she admitted 'not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls' due to splitting from Scott when her youngest was just one. 'Not seen my babies for 11 days as they were in Dubai with their daddy x,' Helen wrote. 'I feel such a horrible mummy for not seeing them and guilty but I think it's important for them to have a nice time with their daddy. Helen Flanagan shared a candid post on Instagram on Sunday about the 'mum guilt' she feels over her youngest child Charlie as she opened up about life as a single mother The former Coronation Street star, 33, took to Instagram on Sunday to share that she feels like a 'horrible mummy' being away from her kids - Charlie, six, and Matilda, eight - when they spend time with their father Scott 'I suppose mum guilt never goes no matter what you do x They went on holiday with their lovely nanna too which helps me as I get lots of pictures of them looking really happy x.' In the video shared by Helen, she looked angelic in a floaty white summer halterneck summer dress, as she curled her blonde locks and tied them up with a ribbon. Her and Charlie shared a sweet moment as they cuddled on a picnic blanket and made funny faces together. Of her own health following her breakdown earlier this year, Helen said in her post: ' Feeling in such a better place then I did this time last year and I think it's just time, it's a massive healer and I look back at myself this time last year and I can give myself kindness and compassion for maybe looking for love in the wrong places and numbing how I felt x. ' As mummys we just do our best at that time x. Maybe I've not always got it right but always had the right intentions x. I feel like I've changed so many times since Matilda was born and that we have grown together and our bond is really special x.' Helen opened up about going through her separation from Scott while Charlie was a baby, saying: ' Charlie was one when me and his dad split and I remember in the build up to us separating I was still breast feeding and I couldn't get my baby boy off the boob and it made me feel quite trapped and stuck as I couldn't do anything on my own independently as my baby needed to be stuck with me all the time and he would just cry for me and maybe because everything felt a lot emotionally when I finally got Charlie off the boob at 14months with help from a nanny. In March, Helen revealed she suffered a psychotic breakdown at the beginning of the year after splitting from her ex of 13 years, Scott Sinclair (Pictured in 2019) Helen shared an adorable video with her son, as she admitted 'not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls' due to splitting from Scott when her youngest was just one 'Not seen my babies for 11 days as they were in Dubai with their daddy x,' Helen wrote In the video shared by Helen, she looked angelic in a floaty white summer halterneck summer dress, as she curled her blonde locks and tied them up with a ribbon Of her own health following her breakdown earlier this year, Helen said in her post: ' Feeling in such a better place then I did this time last year and I think it's just time' 'I needed my space to get my head together and to feel like my own person and not just a mother but a woman too x. 'I do feel guilty for maybe not being as present with Charlie as I was with the girls. I struggled to sit and just play with him.' She added: 'To be honest I struggled to be in the house too much as it all felt a bit sad. Their daddy moved away for football and originally he surprised me with our family home that me and the kids live in and I suppose at the beginning I just didn't want to take on the reality that it really was just me now and the three little ones. 'That was just a bit much for me. The beginning of the year was tricky and I felt so guilty for not being my best. 'I know I'll have such a beautiful relationship with Charlie and the girls. Feel in such a happier place this summer and I'm so grateful ✨.' The heartfelt post comes after she revealed the heartbreaking details of a psychotic breakdown she suffered earlier this year. Taking to Instagram in March, Helen revealed that across January and February she was fighting a secret battle with her mental health after her split from Scott Sinclair. Helen has admitted just how scary the breakdown was as she revealed she was seeing things and felt like she was in danger all the time after having a reaction to her ADHD medication (pictured her children Matilda, eight, Delilah, five, and Charlie, two) The couple called it quits on their relationship back in 2022 after spending 13 years together but are in a better place to co-parent now After suffering a bad reaction to her medication as she explained: 'It was really sad and very scary. I was seeing things and I felt like I was in danger all the time' And now she has admitted just how scary the breakdown was as she revealed she was seeing things and felt like she was in danger all the time after having a reaction to her ADHD medication. Opening up the The Mirror , she confessed she struggled to deal with the split: 'I don't see it as a break-up, I see it as a divorce. We were together 13 years. But instead of processing it all, I threw myself into work and shut off my emotions. 'I just went into survival mode. Then it all came to the surface earlier this year and I was mentally and physically breaking down.' She then started medicating for her ADHD and suffered a bad reaction to her medication as she explained: 'It was really sad and very scary. I was seeing things and I felt like I was in danger all the time.' Whilst in the grasps of her episode, Helen jetted to Bali with her kids Matilda, eight, Delilah, five, and Charlie, two, who she shares with ex Scott. Helen didn't have her children over Christmas as they were with their father so she decided to take them to the sunny destination for a special New Years. During the trip, she shared a slew of sweet snaps - with smiles hiding her hidden pain following the painful break-up from her ex and her new life as a single mum. While she did not comment on her battle at the time, she was the grasp of a psychotic breakdown due to unresolved trauma surrounding her split. Putting herself and her mental health first, Helen pulled out of playing Miss Scarlett in the theatre tour of Cluedo 2 as she wasn't well enough to leave her family and commit to the show. She was replaced by Ellie Leach (pictured) The couple called it quits on their relationship back in 2022 after spending 13 years together.

Her mugshot for the May 20 DUI Shocking new video shows a police officer emptying bottle after bottle of Fireball whiskey out of Kathryn Dennis's Louis Vuitton dog bag after officers seized it following her arrest for causing a three-vehicle-collision last week. In a cache of new footage, obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com, the former Southern Charm belle can also be seen flunking her field sobriety test earlier that evening – wobbling shoeless in the headlights of the patrol car called to the scene. Dennis, 32, was arrested and charged with being drunk at the wheel and transporting alcohol in open containers when she smashed into the back of a car as it slowed to a stop at a red traffic signal about 9.15pm last Monday. That car in turn hit the car in front of it. Last week bodycam footage emerged of Dennis sobbing in the back of a police car as she was transported by officers of Goose Creek Police Department to Berkley County Detention Center in Monck's Corner, South Carolina. Now, DailyMail.com can reveal new details of that journey, of Dennis's erratic behavior and of the chaotic events that preceded it. The former Southern Charm belle can be seen flunking her field sobriety test - wobbling, shoeless, in the headlights of the patrol car called to the scene New video shows a police officer emptying bottles of Fireball whiskey out of Dennis's Louis Vuitton dog bag after her DUI arrest In the video, the officer takes the Fireball bottles out of the bag one by one, before coming across a single can of Coke. He eventually throws them all in the trash. According to the incident report obtained by DailyMail.com, the first officer to speak to Dennis observed her 'glossy eyes' and 'the odor of alcohol emanating from [her] person.' The officer also noted 'an unopened bottle of Fireball on the driver's side floorboard' and a 'pink tumbler cup in the center console which was empty'. The officer noted that Dennis refused a breathalyzer test but agreed to undergo a field sobriety test. Captured by the dashcam video of his patrol car the extent to which Dennis flunked the test is painfully evident. According to his report the first test the officer carried out was the 'Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test,' in which a person is asked to track an officer's finger while the cop looks for the tell-tale involuntary eye jerking which happens when someone under the influence of drugs or alcohol looks to the side. As well as smelling the alcohol on Dennis, the officer noted four out of six clues suggesting intoxication while conducting the test including a 'lack of smooth pursuit' on Dennis's part. The next test was a walk and turn for which she chose to remove her sandals. Here the officer noted she could not even keep her balance while standing in the starting position, used her arms and hands for balance as she walked and missed the heel to toe requirement of the walk on numerous occasions. She was also unable to balance on one leg without wind-milling her arms to keep her balance. Later, oblivious to her performance, Dennis can be heard telling herself: 'I passed that f***ing field sobriety test. This is some b******t. Like, I literally am not drunk.' Dennis was traveling with her golden doodle puppy 'Lil Gucci' whom she had placed in the back of the police patrol vehicle during these tests Videos show the reality star handcuffed after failing sobriety tests. She tells the cops: Y'all are ruining my life' Dennis was traveling with her golden doodle puppy 'Lil Gucci' whom she had placed in the back of the police patrol vehicle during these tests. When officers searched the pup's dog carrier they found, 'several mini bottles of Fireball, some of which were opened and empty.' Indeed, footage of the search of that bag as she was booked into Berkley County Detention Center some hours later shows an officer removing at least ten miniature bottles from the bag – some are empty, some are open and appear half empty, others are full and still bound together by the plastic wrap of the multipack in which they were bought. Read More EXCLUSIVE Southern Charm's Kathryn Dennis's car is seen speeding through a school zone before hitting officer and knocking stop sign out of her hand in hit-and-run incident - months before DUI arrest Patrol car footage of the drive from the scene to the detention center reviewed by DailyMail.com shows Dennis running the emotional gamut in attempts to derail the due process of her arrest. At times she pleads, at others she wails in fury at being separated from her 'child' by which she means her dog. At some points she threatens the officers with legal action, saying she will 'ruin' them, at others she attempts to chat more calmly and elicit sympathy. When she sobs her tears appear to be out of frustration and anger that none of her tactics have any impact on the cops. She accuses the officer of touching her inappropriately as he reaches across her to fasten her safety-belt across her lap while her hands are cuffed behind her back. She then accuses the officer of trying to 'gaslight' her 'like my ex.' Dennis's tumultuous relationship with disgraced former congressman Thomas Ravenel which resulted in two children and ended in 2018 when he was hit with sexual assault charges by three women , was the predominant plotline or her eight seasons with Bravo reality show, Southern Charm. The reality star was also booked for driving with an open container Dennis's tumultuous relationship with disgraced former congress man Thomas Ravenel ended in 2018. They share son St. Julien Rembert, eight, and daughter Kensington Calhoun, 10 At one point during her transportation to the detention center Dennis pleads for leniency from the officer arresting her saying, 'I'm going to lose custody of my children, please!' But Dennis lost custody of Kensington 'Kensie' Calhoun, 9, and St. Julien 'Saint' Rembert, 7, to their father following a protracted and bitter custody battle as she repeatedly failed the court-mandated drug testing on which her rights to her children depended. She now has supervised visitation with them every other Saturday and Sunday. At another point she says, 'I'm never going to get my kids back. Thanks guys. There's literally no reason for me to be here. So congratulations it's f***ing b******t.' Vacillating wildly, Dennis seems lucid at times, before lurching into a rage and threatening the officers, 'I will f***ing ruin you,' when they explain her dog will be taken into a pound until someone can come and collect him. Later, in a moment of apparent resignation and exhaustion she says, 'There's no way to go back now is there?' Dennis was booked into Berkely Detention Center Monday night where she was held before being released on bond. Her bond was set at $1,199.50 for the DUI and $257.70 for transporting an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle.

        "content": "The ruling Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) has declared a resounding victory in the Capital, Provincial, City and District Council elections for the fourth mandate. Chhim Phalvorun, a spokesman for the CPP, said yesterday that the party won the majority of votes in the elections. “Our party agents are collecting the data, and we are waiting for the official results issued by the NEC, and then we can analyse it,” Phalvorun said. The official results of the Council Election will be announced on June 8. Five political parties— the CPP, the Khmer Will Party, the Nation Power Party, Funcinpec and the Khmer National United Party, contested the non-universal suffrage elections. Kong Monika, Secretary-General of the Khmer Will Party, said that the party lost some votes for two reasons: firstly, it was slow to garner support from some commune councillors of the Candlelight Party and secondly, local authorities arrested commune councillors who were voters. The KWP replaced Candlelight Party which was disqualified to run the elections. Monika added that the results of the Capital, Provincial, City, and District Council elections on Sunday were not different from the Senate Election earlier this year. “Based on the votes in each constituency, the Khmer Will Party can get between 40 and 50 seats for the Capital and Provincial Councils, and more than 300 seats for the City, and District councils,” he said. The CPP obtained 9,376 council seats (1,648 commune chiefs, 1,618 first deputy and 261 second deputy positions) during the June 5, 2022 commune elections. Candlelight Party has 2,198 councillors (four commune chiefs, 25 first deputy and 1,360 second deputy posts), Funcinpec has 19 commune councillors and Khmer National United Party has 13. NECs Chairman Prach Chan said that 11,598 sitting commune chiefs and councilors, or 99.79% of the 11,622 eligible voters, cast their ballots for 4,200 capital, provincial, city and district councillors on Sunday. “The elections were conducted smoothly with good security and order, and without any violence or intimidation,” Chan said. He said that the council elections were held in a free and fair manner based on the principle of liberal multi-party democracy. CPP won all the votes in Pursat, Kep, Pailin and Mondulkiri provinces. In general, nationwide most of the votes went to the CPP, followed by KWP, and KPP. Based on the preliminary results in Phnom Penh, the CPP received 813 votes, the KWP received 80 and the National Power Party got one. In Battambang province, the CPP received 711 votes, the KWP garnered 100 votes and the KPP got 11. In Siem Reap, the CPP received 541 votes, KPP (90), the KWP (35) and the Khmer United National Party obtained one vote. In Prey Veng province, the CPP received 737 votes, the KWP got 140, the KPP had six, while Funcinpec and the Khmer United National Party obtained one vote each. The Capital, provincial, city and district council elections are held once every five years. Only commune councillors are eligible to vote. The third Council Election was held on May 26, 2019. Seven political parties had contested the elections.",

        "content": "Listen to Story Young star Varvara Gracheva pulled out of the early upsets of the French Open 2024 as she eliminated Maria Sakkari in the first round of the competition on May 27, Monday to move to the second round. Buoyed by the support from the home crowd, Gracheva secured a comeback win over the Greek star with the scoreline reading 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 as the match ended in just over 2 hours and 10 minutes. Sakkari, who was looking to make amends for her poor showing in the Australian Open, had a shaky start as Gracheva was able to break her in the very first game. However, Sakkari was able to return the favour in the next one as she was slowy able to gain control over things and took a 4-2 lead by breaking the 23-year-old French star. The duo would then go on lose while serving, before Sakkari finally pulled away and secured the first set 6-3. Gracheva would find her groove in the second set and was finally able to break Sakkari to take the lead and extend it to 4-1. Sakkari, however, would mount a comeback of her own and levelled the score at 4-4 as the odds were in favour of the 6th seed at that point. However, the French star was able to get a grip of proceedings and won the next two games to make the game 1-1 and pushing it into the decider. The third set saw both women push each other in the early goings with the score level at 2-2. Gracheva was able to take the lead from the serve and then both women had an incredible back and forth in the next game. It seemed like the Greek star would be able to level things up before Gracheva used the encouragement from the crowd to gain the advantage and secure the break point. The next serve saw Gracheva on the verge of securing the win with the score at 5-2, before Sakkari dug deep to save a couple of match points and get the game. However, it wasn't able to start a revival for the 6th seed as Gracheva secured a memorable win to progress to the next round.",

        "content": "The Nigerian Army, on Monday, confirmed the immediate reopening of the popular Abuja Banex Plaza following an understanding between the authorities, plaza management and traders’ association. The plaza had been shut for over a week following a mob attack on some personnel of the Nigerian army by unidentified hoodlums on May 18. This is contained in a statement by the Director, Army Public Relations, Maj.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, on Monday in Abuja. Nwachucku said a high-level meeting was convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser including the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, Commissioner of Police FCT and the FCT Director of the Department of State Services. Others on the panel, according to him are the Leadership and Management of Banex Plaza, a Representative from the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the National Chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders Association. He said the primary objective of the meeting was to identify and apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the continued security of the Federal Capital Territory. “The following resolutions were agreed upon: Immediate reopening of Banex Plaza to the public and the leadership of Banex Plaza is instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect. “The owners of the shop who orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers are to be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. “Market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. “Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action. “The Nigerian army will also thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack,” he said. Nwachukwu reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel were not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order. He urged members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. According to him, there are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities. “It is imperative that these channels are utilized to maintain order and respect for those who serve and protect our nation. “The Nigerian army remains committed to ensuring safety and security of all citizens and will continue to work diligently to prevent such incidents in the future,” he added.

        "content": "A digital endoscope used in colonoscopy. (iStock / Getty Images) DEAR MAYO CLINIC : I just turned 45 and am dreading my first colonoscopy. Why do I need to be screened if I’m not having issues? Can you walk me through the process? ANSWER : Feeling anxious or afraid surrounding a procedure, particularly when you’ve never done it before, is completely normal. The purpose of screening is to act before someone develops symptoms. If we’re able to identify polyps , which are precancerous lesions in the lining of the colon, we would then have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer in the first place. So through screening, we can prevent cancer. At the time of diagnosing cancer, we’ve missed that opportunity. There are a number of ways we can screen for colorectal cancer . In the U.S., we most often use a colonoscopy . A colonoscopy is an invasive test, but it allows us an opportunity to not only see polyps, but also remove them at the same time. For people with no additional risk factors besides age, it is recommended to start screening at the age of 45. If other risk factors are present, though, it may be recommended to have a colonoscopy sooner than 45. The colon preparation prior to the colonoscopy is key. The goal of colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon by using a laxative liquid solution. Then, at the time of the colonoscopy, we’re able to see and detect even small precancerous lesions so they can be removed. It is very common to hear complaints from patients about the preparation, such as the consistency or taste of the solution, cramping, abdominal bloating or discomfort. That’s to be anticipated. Unfortunately, some patients also experience nausea. Try slowing down how fast you are drinking the solution. For those who tend to struggle with the taste or consistency, try drinking it through a straw. You can also bite into a small wedge of lime or lemon, or you can chew gum or ice between drinks. After you finish the last of the prep solution and check in for your appointment, you’ll often be greeted by the front desk team and then escorted back by a healthcare team member. They will review things like your medical history and medications and see how the colon prep treated you. There is a risk that you may have to come back and repeat the test at a later time if the colon prep was not adequate. Another critical thing they will do is establish your intravenous therapy or IV. The IV is the route in which they will give you the medication to help make the procedure a little bit more comfortable. Some people don’t do any sedation at all, but it is totally appropriate to opt for it. There are several different ways that sedation could be done for the procedure. A lot of that depends upon how the procedure is scheduled with your health care team. Then, you will end up going back to the procedure room where they will review the nature of the procedure before starting the colonoscopy. Afterward, there’s a bit of a recovery period, and then you’re able to head back home. Because of the sedation, we don’t want people driving, consuming alcohol or making any critical decisions for 24 hours. We still don’t have a perfect recipe for preventing polyps, but maintaining a healthy diet and exercise can protect you. It is important to be aware of any symptoms and then follow through with screening. Best of luck as you take this important first step. — Derek Ebner, M.D ., Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

Tonight Britain's Got Talent returned for the first live shows of the series as the first group of acts competed for a place in the final. 3 Amanda left fans seriously distracted with her daring look Credit: ITV 3 She looked incredible in the red leather dress which had a thigh-high split Credit: Shutterstock 3 She was joined by fellow judges Simon, Alesha and Bruno Credit: Shutterstock Judges Amanda Holden, Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli were back, along with hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. As always the judges put on a glamourous display and Amanda, 53, looked incredible in an off the shoulder red leather dress with a daring thigh-high split. The presenter went braless for the look, and viewers were distracted when Amanda spoke to new dad Ant and co-host Dec, both 48, at the start of the show. Taking to social media, one wrote: \"Bit nippy, Amanda?\" Another said: \"Amanda could cut glass tonight.\" And a third joked: \"Does Amanda own a bra?\" It comes after Amanda admitted she thought she'd be fired when daughter Hollie, 12, stormed the panel with 64-year-old Simon's son Eric, 10, to send Japanese double dutch dancers Haribow through with the Golden Buzzer. Sharing the clip on Instagram, Amanda later wrote: \"I mean ... I thought I was going to get fired as it was so unexpected my #HRH & Eric x even @simoncowell was wobbled but they have the first ever audience GOLDEN BUZZER\" Most read in TV BALOGUN'S BACK Rangers star Leon Balogun signs new one-year contract GER HUNGARY Rangers 'in advanced talks' to sign winger who helped shock Real Madrid TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate The moment came after Haribow received a standing ovation from the audience and roaring pleas for them to get a golden buzzer, despite all the judges already using theirs. Until this game-changing moment, Ant and Dec, plus each of the judges were allowed only one per series. BGT fans hit out at major Simon Cowell change they say has 'ruined the show' Britain's Got Talent's biggest 'fix' rows Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight.",

        "content": "Thank goodness NSW coach Michael Maguire picked Roosters centre Joseph Suaalii for the opening match of this year’s State of Origin series. If he’d heeded calls to overlook the 20-year-old for signing a $5 million deal with Rugby Australia from next season, it would have been another part of Origin that Queensland apparently do better than NSW. In 2010, Brisbane Broncos star Israel Folau signed with incoming AFL franchise GWS Giants. The AFL announced the deal on May 31, with a media conference involving Folau and the Giants’ inaugural coach, Kevin Sheedy, held the next day – six days after Folau had played in the first Origin played for Queensland. The argument for banning Suaalii from playing Origin goes that to let him play gives Rugby Australia free publicity. Folau’s decision to take the $6 million on offer to become the face of an ambitious new club in rugby league heartland in Sydney’s west, and then announce it in the middle of the game’s showpiece event, the jewel in the crown as it were, was a dagger through rugby league’s artery-clogged heart.

Credit: Kate Geraghty The QRL vetoed Folau’s selection for the rest of the series before hastily backflipping after intense lobbying from coach Mal Meninga and senior players. Brent Tate’s broken jaw may have also helped their argument. So Folau played the entire series, which the Maroons won 3-0. The sporting landscape has changed significantly since then, mostly for rugby union, which is no longer the same cashed-up powerhouse that pinched NRL stars Mat Rogers, Wendell Sailor and Lote Tuqiri in the early 2000s. (Incidentally, when Sailor signed with Rugby Australia in February 2001, he was still picked for Queensland that year.) Israel Folau was selected by Queensland in 2010 despite announcing a $6 million switch to AFL in the middle of the series. Credit: Getty Images Will the sight of Suaalii playing for NSW really give rugby a leg-up? Hardly. He’s already told the Roosters he intends to return to the NRL once his three-year contract ends. Even ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys, who relishes any opportunity to kick AFL and rugby union whenever he can, is at ease about Suaalii playing. “The coach’s job is to pick the best team to win,” he said. “That’s all he should worry about.” Perhaps the more relevant question about Suaalii isn’t about whether he should play but which side of the field will he occupy. He’s been named in the centres alongside the Bulldogs’ Stephen Crichton, the best in the business. Both players are equally comfortable playing on the right or left. Crichton was exceptional in Penrith’s grand final win last year playing on the left. His clever little kicks into the in-goal were invaluable late in the game. But he’s been mostly playing on the right for the Bulldogs this season, and unlike some players who struggle when they leave the three-time defending premiers, his form hasn’t waned. Maguire would not be drawn on which side Crichton or Suaalii will play, but there’s a school of thought among his coaching staff that Suaalii is better suited to the right – even though he’s played most of this season for the Roosters on the left because Joey Manu has the right centre position stitched up. Israel Folau during his AFL days. Credit: Getty Because he’s right-handed and has a right-foot step, he is more comfortable on that side of the field. He’s also less likely to be targeted by inside defenders trying to drive a shoulder into the ball, forcing an error. That is the real fear I have with this NSW team, which features six debutants and a new captain heading into the opening match at Accor Stadium on June 5 – errors! Suaalii, who is only in his fourth season in the NRL, has produced some incredible touches in attack this year. But he can make the odd mistake, whether it’s a dropped ball or conceding a penalty. His defence, though, has improved significantly. If Maguire does play him on the right edge, he’ll be playing inside fellow rookie and right-winger Zac Lomax, who looms as Maguire’s greatest leap of faith with this side. Lomax has been in career-best form for the Dragons this season. He has made 2014 metres (fifth in the NRL) from 237 runs (third). But no player in the league has made more errors. Lomax has made 25 so far. When he threw an errant flick pass coming off his own line in the Anzac Day match against the Roosters, which led to their second try in their 60-18 drubbing, some people within Lomax’s own club reckoned it was enough to end his Origin aspirations. Now, he could end up on a precarious-looking right edge with fellow rookie Suaalii. Maguire had options: he could have played Suaalii on the right wing and picked either the Bulldogs’ Matt Burton, the Sharks’ Jesse Ramien or the forgotten man in the NSW conversation, Penrith’s Izack Tago.

        "description": "Offenders older than their victim by 10 years and convicted of unlawful acts would be registered.",
        "content": "A bill that aims to make unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor a crime that requires sex offender registration is one step closer to becoming law after passing the Senate May 22 on a vote of 34-3. Legal distinctions between consensual and non-consensual sex with a minor in existing state law are the root of the issue the bill seeks to address. Senate Bill 1128, authored by Sen. Anthony Portantino, would require individuals older than their victim by 10 years and convicted of unlawful sex with a minor to be classified as what’s known as a tier one offender and have their name placed on the sex offender registry for 10 years. The author said the goal of his proposal will additionally fix a loophole in existing law where consensual sex with a minor, if convicted of such, requires sex offender registration, while non-consensual sex does not. “It is inexplicable that consensual sex with a minor can cause someone to be placed on the registry while unlawful sex does not... [and] this bill will change that,” Mr. Portantino told The Epoch Times. “If you are 10 years older and have illegal sex, you should be put on the registry.” The aim is to help protect children across the state from becoming a victim to sex trafficking and hold offenders accountable, he said. Human trafficking victims are predominantly young girls and women, about 99.4 percent of such cases, according to California Department of Justice data. Supporters of the bill pointed to statistics showing that sex trafficking accounts for 89 percent of all human trafficking cases in California, according to the Public Policy Institute of California—as a sign that more needs to be done to address the issue. “As a society, we must protect vulnerable youth and hold those who harm them accountable,” the California District Attorneys Association said in legislative analyses. “SB 1128 would ... strengthen our laws and hold accountable sex offenders who target minors.” Opponents said the measure is too broad and would cause some to be unfairly placed on the sex offender registry. “While current law recognizes that cases of unlawful sex with a minor vary widely in their circumstances and potential harm, and thus provides flexibility in charging, SB 1128 ignores those varying circumstances and applies the measure of sex offender registration to anyone convicted of this crime, regardless of circumstance, and regardless of whether the individual is convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor,” the California Attorneys for Criminal Justice said in legislative analyses. The criminal justice group alleges that those between the ages of 18 and 26 would be most harmed by the bill. California’s penal code defines all offenders 26 and under as “youth” because, officials say, their brains are still developing. “The majority of people affected by SB 1128 would be youth, as they are the people most likely to enter into sexual relationships with minors,” the group said. “Those most likely to be prosecuted ... are young adults, under 26, who are youthful offenders, which California law recognizes are subject to many of the same developmental issues as those under 18.” The group also contends the sex offender registration list—with about 88,000 individuals currently registered statewide and expected to increase if the bill is approved—is ineffective because it marginalizes and isolates them from jobs and housing opportunities. “Sex offender registration, even for serious sexual offenders, has a problematic history and has not been shown to benefit either the offender or the community,” the group said. “Adding sex offender registration would add no benefit, cause great harm to youth, and be enormously expensive.” Critics also point to comments made by the California Sex Offender Management Board as evidence that youth are vulnerable to exercising poor judgment and making decisions related to sexual activity that could cause them to face harsh punishment and consequences if the bill became law. They also highlighted recidivism rates of only about 3 percent for young sexual offenders. “Common methods of supervision and treatment used with adult sexual offenders are, for the most part, inappropriate and potentially harmful with youth,” the state’s sex offender board said on its website. “The Board strongly recommends that youth who have offended sexually should have services specialized for their needs.” California was the first state in the nation to require sex offender registration—beginning in 1947—to deter registrants from reoffending, provide law enforcement with relevant information and investigative tools, and protect the public. Offenders on the registry are required to register annually within five days of their birthday, with photos, location, and offense data available to public view. Having cleared the Senate with bipartisan support—with three Democrats voting against the measure, including Senators Nancy Skinner, Scott Wiener, and Susan Talamante Eggman—the bill will next be heard by respective committees in the Assembly in the coming weeks.",

        "description": "Walton was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams.",
        "content": "By TIM REYNOLDS AP Basketball Writer Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars in basketball broadcasting, died Monday, the league announced. Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ‘Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach.",

        "content": "VIENNA (AP) — Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country's controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — are under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week's helicopter crash that killed Iran's president and foreign minister. The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency also comes against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Israel and Iran have carried out direct strikes on each other’s territory for the first time last month. The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February . Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA's previous report. IAEA’s definition says that around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Iran has maintained its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, but the IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi , has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment . Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday's report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran's decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA's talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran \"on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA's years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations\" under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.”",

        "content": "Acadia Coombs, 11, holds one of her 30 chickens in their new home in North Harpswell. Acadia sells their output under the name Chipper Chickens Farm Fresh Eggs. Robin Casey photo Imagine you had 30 pet chickens. Could you tell them apart and call each by name? Acadia Coombs can. The pint-sized 11-year-old powerhouse sells organic eggs from her family’s backyard farm along Harpswell Neck Road. She’s been an excited egg entrepreneur since she was 6 years old, even though she doesn’t like to eat eggs. This spring, her father, Bob Coombs, owner of builder R.L. Coombs Inc., was constructing what passing motorists speculated was either a garage or a small house. Turns out it’s the Taj Mahal of chicken coops. Acadia’s pets now have a spacious 14-by-48-foot area enclosed by chicken wire with an attached modern “barn” that’s not like an old-fashioned red barn. This one, with its mono-slope roof, is adjacent to the entrance to Barnes Point Road, and Acadia can ride her bike from her home on nearby Walini Way to feed her fowl. Joining the chicken menagerie is Henry, a portly New Zealand rabbit who was raised with the chickens and snuggles with them at night. Three Rouen ducks are happy paddling in a pond with a fountain on the 1-acre roadside property. On Mother’s Day, the family added twin Nigerian dwarf goats, Ruby and Emerald. Acadia is named after Maine’s national park, of course, and like any diligent poultry farmer, she has compiled spreadsheets with information about her chickens, including breed, date of birth, name, and the color of its eggs (white, medium brown, dark brown or greenish-blue). On a recent spring day after the school bus had dropped her off by the chicken coop, Acadia easily rattled off the monikers of her 18 hens, one rooster and 11 chicks. The hens are Midnight, Chickadee, Chirper, Honey, Big Crown, Birdbrain, Buttercup, Hard Pecker, Pumpkin Pie-Peanut, Lilly, Lilac, Miracle, Spotted, Speckle, Wood Chip, Sweet-pea, Pom Pom and Flapper. The baby chicks are Ugg, Cocoa, Oatmeal, Raisin, Sheli, Turken, Willow, Rusty, Amanda, Emma and Poppy. Petey is the rooster, a “gentleman who’s a good guardian” of the hens, said Acadia’s mother, Lisa. Acadia, an only child who is entering the sixth grade at Harpswell Community School, crosses her arms, puts a finger studiously to her face, and recites the breeds of her chickens. There’s a buttercup, buff Orpingtons, naked neck or turkens, Jersey giants, Araucanas, Wyandottes, white leghorns and an ayam cemani. She can tell if they’re male or female by looking at the shape of their feathers as she gently spreads their wings. “Turkens are my favorite,” she said, cradling a tiny black turken she had fetched from its heated brooder box, its skinny bald neck looking like that of an ostrich. Another favorite pet is Wood Chip, an all-white rescue chicken that can’t walk, likely because of frostbite. Acadia babied the hen back to health. She plucks it from the coop and gently sets it down in the dirt. With its legs unable to bend, it sits on its hocks, flaps its wings to move, and glides to safety under Acadia’s legs. “She’s more of a human chicken,” Acadia said. Why chickens? “It’s kind of a funny story,” Acadia related, her eyes blue as the ocean and her long blonde pigtails swinging from side to side. She told her dad she wanted another animal. “He was like, ‘You can have another animal as long as you can get money out of it.’ I said, ‘A cow?’ Too big. ‘A horse?’ Nope. My dad suggested chickens so I could sell their eggs.” And so began Chipper Chickens Farm Fresh Eggs, selling for $6 a dozen. At first she sold them to friends and neighbors. Now, with the new barn, she can sell them to passersby. Her dad scrambled to finish building the chicken coop in May after the family returned from Costa Rica, where Acadia went to school for three months. Her mom, Lisa, grew up in a city but is no stranger to pitching in to help Acadia. “I’m definitely the backup. (Acadia) gives me jobs and I do them,” Lisa said. Lisa and Bob met when Lisa was his brother’s boxing coach in Portland. Tall and slim, Lisa is a five-time national boxing champion in the welterweight category and was captain of the U.S. women’s boxing team. Because of her efforts, women’s boxing became an Olympic sport in 2012. Acadia said she prefers basketball to boxing. As far as what she wants to do when she grows up, Acadia said, “It’s complicated. When I’m an adult, I want to live in a small house with one or two kids and a 60-acre farm.” That’s after she becomes a veterinarian. In the meantime, Acadia, a preteen who one minute seems like a little girl and the next like a seasoned and wise egg farmer, said she has started writing a book for first-time egg farmers. This summer she’ll also find time to play volleyball and swim. And her mini zoo will keep expanding. Her next pet? A barn cat. Connie Sage Conner is a former editor of The Virginian-Pilot.

        "content": "RICCI RIVERO – University of the Philippines (UP) Fighting Maroons star player Ricci Rivero uploaded photos from 26th birthday party. Ricci Paolo Uy Rivero is a Filipino professional basketball player and actor, known for his dynamic playing style and significant contributions to Philippine basketball. Born on May 25, 1998, in Ilagan, Isabela, Philippines, Ricci grew up in a family with a strong basketball background. He is the younger brother of Prince Rivero, also a notable basketball player. Ricci Rivero attended La Salle Green Hills for his high school education, where he honed his basketball skills and emerged as one of the top high school players in the country. His performances in various high school tournaments earned him a spot in the De La Salle University (DLSU) Green Archers’ roster. Rivero began his collegiate basketball career with the DLSU Green Archers in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP). During his time with La Salle, he quickly became one of the league’s most exciting and promising players. He was known for his agility, scoring ability, and defensive prowess. In Season 80 of the UAAP, Rivero was named to the Mythical Five, underscoring his impact on the court. However, after two seasons with La Salle, Ricci Rivero made a high-profile move to the University of the Philippines (UP) Fighting Maroons. His transfer was met with much anticipation and excitement. Rivero continued to display his basketball talents at UP, further establishing his reputation as one of the top players in collegiate basketball. Ricci is not only celebrated for his on-court performances but also for his off-court persona. He has a significant following on social media, where he shares insights into his life, training, and various personal endeavors. He is now dating Los Baños, Laguna Councilor Leren Mae Bautista. In a previous article, the politician shared a glimpse from Ricci’s birthday party . In a post on her Instagram account last May 27, Ricci Rivero turned to social media to share glimpses of his special day with his followers. On his IG, the basketball player posted a series of photos from his lively birthday celebration. Among the attendees was his girlfriend, Leren Mae Bautista. In the caption of the post, he wrote: “LATE!!! Bday dump!”",

        "description": "Qld Labor has dished out a pre-election sugar hit by way of cheap fares, but a political expert and a former premier say it's still the end of the line.",
        "content": "A surprise move by the Labor state government of Queensland to offer 50-cent tickets for public transport will only win over urban commuters already committed to the Greens. That’s according to a political expert, who says the incumbent government is only delaying a likely election loss in October. Griffith University Associate Professor Paul Williams provided his insight to The Epoch Times after it was announced that from Aug. 5, all Translink public transport tickets would cost just 50 cents as part of a six-month trial. Translink is government-run and is the largest provider of train, bus, and ferry services in Brisbane. But Assoc. Prof. Williams said the problem with policy “sugar hits” was that they seldom worked in an election, and voters often had short memories. “The problem is also that only a minimal number of people use public transport,” he said. The people who were most likely to use it and swing their votes to Labor, he said, were Greens-partial city-slickers who—might—angle their vote the way of Premier Steven Miles. Mr. Miles started above water, and the electorate “gave him a chance,” he said. But Labor’s primary vote is almost certainly likely to sit around the 20 percent mark in Queensland, largely due to voter dissatisfaction in four key areas: cost of living, law and order (especially youth crime), housing, and health. “Nothing will stop [Opposition Leader David] Crisafulli becoming premier in October,” Mr. Williams said. Labor is likely to lose 20 to 25 seats to the LNP (Liberal National Party) and some to the Greens, and there’s nothing they can do about it, according to the academic. “It won’t be a wipe-out, but it'll be a comfortable victory,” he said. “Labor’s careering to certain defeat. “This [50 cent fares] was announced quite quickly and these sorts of sugar hits don’t last.” Voters would most likely like to have seen changes to interest rates, mortgage payments, and grocery bills, he says. “It’s a blatant vote-buying exercise,” he told The Epoch Times. “I think it’s an act of desperation by the premier.” Mr. Newman said it would also lead to a difficult decision for an incoming LNP government who would need to decide whether it could afford to maintain the initiative or not, likely to cost millions. But Mr. Newman, who served as premier from 2012-15, said the move could also be a good way to determine whether public transport ridership increases. “It’s going to be a very interesting experiment to see what happens to public transport patronage in Queensland,” he said, noting it could ease pressure on the roads. “For all intents and purposes, it’s making public transport almost free. I don’t believe it’s sustainable, suddenly, it’s a massive increased cost.” “I expect this will save Queenslanders thousands of dollars over six months, and encourage more people to catch our fast, frequent and 50 cent public transport,” he said in a statement. “Encouraging more Queenslanders to jump on a bus or train to get to work or school will help bust congestion. “Queenslanders are doing it tough, but they can trust that my government is here to help, and we’re doing what matters to Queensland.” The LNP opposition provided a statement to The Epoch Times, saying the party believed Labor had driven costs up and was desperately trying to hold on to voters. “The LNP supports more cost-of-living relief, Queenslanders are doing it tough under a Labor government that’s driven-up living costs,” a spokesperson said. “The LNP is committed to long-term underlying cost of living relief, but after nine years of Labor driving-up costs, Queenslanders see Labor will now do and say anything to cling to power, including announcing measures which expire just weeks after the election.” But Minister for Transport and Main Roads Bart Mellish assured the public the move was one that would help provide hip pocket relief. “The Miles Government is providing critical cost of living relief to Queenslanders,” he said in a statement. “This initiative will importantly mean money in the pockets of families across Queensland.” Queenslanders will head to the polls on October 24.",

(NASDAQ: NASDAQ: ADSK ) between June 1, 2023 and April 16, 2024, both dates inclusive (the Class Period), of the important June 24, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm. SO WHAT: If you purchased Autodesk securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Autodesk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24019 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 24, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Autodesk, Inc. lacked adequate internal controls as a result of issues with its free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices; and (2) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Autodesk class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24019 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

So, that's immutable.\" But the judge said sexual assault complainants, with the presumption of innocence afforded to an accused person, hear the court's message as: \"We are entitled to think you might be lying until you prove that you're not.\" \"That's not quite how the system works but that's the messaging,\" she said. \"Part of what we can do without throwing fair trials out the window, I think we can do better in terms of reducing delay.\" The list Chief Justice McCallum is working on a practice direction to announce the list dedicated to progressing sexual assault cases to trial faster. In theory, a sexual violence case committed to the Supreme Court would almost immediately land in the new list and be managed by a judge rather than a registrar. Chief Justice Lucy McCallum. Picture by Karleen Minney The list is intended to help deal earlier with pre-trial issues and things like recording complainant evidence, or work out if legal problems can be dealt with later by a trial judge to help speed up a months-long process. The Chief Justice also said she wanted prosecutors to present an indictment with charges, and for an accused person to be arraigned, at the beginning of proceedings. \"This is going to be across the board for all matters. At the moment the accused aren't arraigned until just before their trial,\" she said. \"I want them to be arraigned earlier, so that they have that focus with their lawyers to think about do they want to plead guilty or not guilty. \"They always can choose not to but I think it's important to maintain the focus on the fact that you're facing these charges, and you need to work out what you're going to do with them.\" The Chief Justice is set to formally announce the list soon. Picture by Karleen Minney Cross-examination \"I fully accept that an accused person is entitled to have a barrister cross-examine the complainant and test their evidence,\" Chief Justice McCallum said. \"That's what a trial is. It's a trial of the evidence.\" But the judge said courts had a statutory duty to disallow cross-examination questions that were \"misleading, confusing, offensive, annoying, harassing, humiliating, or repetitive\". \"So why aren't we doing that? Because we're all scared of not giving an accused a fair trial,\" she said.

I think judges need to own that responsibility a bit more.\" Accused given 'significant leeway' Erin Priestly, head of practice at the Sexual Violence Legal Service, agreed there was an imbalance and legal protections in place for cross-examinations were not invoked as they should be. \"We have observed judges to give significant leeway to the accused party to undertake cross-examination rather than to step in to ensure these protections are enforced,\" she said. The ACT Supreme Court. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong Ms Priestly said she continually observed rape myths invoked during proceedings. \"Perhaps most common is the myth that people will act in a particular way in the days, weeks, months and even years after being subjected to sexual violence,\" she said. \"This is particularly the case when the violence has occurred in the context of intimate partner relationships. A very common immediate response to being subjected to sexual violence is to do nothing.\" The lawyer said rape myths reflect social ideas about what is and isn't sexual violence in the broader community. \"This means it's also critical juries have access to appropriate expert evidence about trauma responses and sexual violence, where appropriate, to combat these pervasive myths,\" she said. The ACT Women's Legal Centre pilot program established last year aims to support complainants through the criminal justice system and \"rebalance the scales\". Ms Priestly said the service supported the introduction of a specialised sexual assault court list, and its goals of reducing delays and achieving earlier resolutions. \"A specialised list is just one step in building faith in the criminal justice system. It alone will not achieve this, however, and it is just one change amongst many that are needed,\" the lawyer said. \"Such a list will only be successful where everyone involved - the judicial officers, the prosecutors, and defence solicitors - have adequate training on trauma responses to sexual violence and consider the design of processes to ameliorate these.\" Support is available for those who may be distressed.

Neurodivergence includes autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or dyslexia. Dr Alison Lally, a pediatric specialist at Canberra Hospital, said turning any room into a less chaotic environment for young patients could make all the difference in their care. She has introduced a range of sensory tools like virtual reality goggles equipped with games, magic shows and puzzles along with noise-cancelling muffs, a tablet and a light projector. This could make drawing blood or checking vitals less of a challenge. Dr Alison Lally, right, introduces Annabell Fenton and her neurodivergent son Max, 12, to a virtual reality headset at Canberra Hospital. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong Mum Annabell Fenton said her son Max was \"a frequent flyer\" in the emergency department. She explained the 12-year-old, like most kids with autism, had an ever-changing sensory profile. \"You might be able to cope with pressure on Tuesday, but the next day, because you've had a bad night's sleep or your clothes are too tight, you might not be able to cope with noise,\" she said. 'Life-changing' tools can help avoid trauma Ms Fenton said sensory tools available in hospitals was life-changing for neurodivergent children. She said the extra support could save the children \"a lot of trauma\" in the long run. \"[The system] is not built for an autistic person, it's built for a neurotypical person,\" she said. \"It means our kids will start their journey with the health sector knowing that it's okay to need and expect these things, to say, 'I need sensory support', or 'I'm going to struggle in this setting'.\" Dr Lally, who also has a son with autism, said neurodivergent needs can be hard to grasp for those who don't live with them everyday. Emergency physician James Falconer is part of Canberra Hospital's ED staff. Picture: Karleen Minney \"Having ADHD or being autistic doesn't mean they're bad child or you've been a bad parent. It means we are just making them live in a world that suits us and doesn't suit them. It's similar to going to a foreign country, you don't speak any language,\" Dr Lally said. She said she was advocating for health professionals to \"break the bias\" and educate themselves about how to care for these patients which includes communication style or something as simple as dimming the lights. Parents can request these tools at Canberra Hospital by telling staff what neurodivergence their child has in a form titled CHS Neurodiversity Care Plan. Dr Lally looked forward to the opening of the new critical services building at Canberra Hospital, which has a dedicated sensory room for those who need it.

Subscribe now for unlimited access . $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading Continue with Email Continue with Google Continue with Apple See subscription options In its 2024-25 pre-budget submission, Professionals Australia found that the public sector risked being caught in the \"slow lane of a two-speed industry\". Reported pay rises were 2 per cent in the Australian Public Service compared with 5 to 7 percent in other tech roles, the union reported. Medium base rates of pay of between $71,000 to $152,000 were being offered in the APS compared with between $110,000 to $187,000, plus stock options worth about $100k, \"which is now typical in new tech companies\". One of the sticking points to tech recruitment in the APS was identified as the 11.2 per cent salary cap increase over three years, as set by the Australian Public Service Commission. The union also urged swift action and investment to address science, technology, engineering and mathematics skill shortages in public sector agencies by removing average staffing level caps in public service agencies. \"Unfortunately STEM skill shortages threaten to derail the delivery of major infrastructure projects, the transition to green energy and digital transformation,\" the report said. Professionals Australia's government director Kathleen Studdert said that for the APS to build its STEM capability it needed to become competitive in a market for technical and engineering talent. Professionals Australia's Kathleen Studdert says the APS needs to build its tech capability. Picture by Keegan Carroll \"There is a benefit to doing meaningful, impactful work in the public sector that can and will attract talented and ambitious people,\" she said. \"Setting up a technical and engineering remuneration framework is a crucial first step to this. \"In some cases the total remuneration gap is six figures between public and private sector employers. It doesn't necessarily need to be dollar for dollar, but it needs to be in the same ballpark.\" PA members work in both the private and public sectors and its ranks include engineers, scientists, pharmacists, IT professionals, translators and interpreters. In spruiking the May budget, Public Service Minister Katy Gallagher said the public sector had grown by 10,000 people in the past year. And that public sector growth will continue in the next financial year . Social Services will grow by 3472 roles in the next financial year - largely spread across Services Australia and the National Disability Insurance Agency - while Treasury's growth is predominantly linked to a 1771 increase to staffing in the Tax Office. The PA submission identified two key safety agencies, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Australian Transport Safety Bureau, as experiencing significant technical staff shortages and budgetary constraints, \"undermining their capacity to maintain the integrity of Australia's transport safety regulatory regime\". For instance, more than eight months on from the horrific Gundaroo plane crash in which a pilot and three children were killed , the ATSB is yet to issue its final report and potentially explain why an emergency parachute in the Cirrus aircraft failed to deploy. \"Unfortunately, the ATSB's workforce has seen significant turnover over the last seven years, and rising demand in each of the sectors the bureau manages (rail, aviation and marine) coupled with budget shortfalls has meant the capacity of the bureau to undertake investigations has been reduced,\" it said. The PA submission also found women were still seriously underrepresented in tech fields, especially engineering and IT. \"In addition, workplace outcomes for women in STEM remained unequal. The STEM Equity Monitor revealed that in 2022 the gender pay gap in all STEM industries was 17 per cent,\" it reported.

Rachel Stephen-Smith encouraged First Nations Canberrans to consider standing for election to the body. \"I think the referendum on recognising Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through a Voice to Parliament has raised the profile of our own elected body,\" Ms Stephen-Smith said. \"And I hope that will encourage more people to have their say to ensure that we're electing a strong Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body, and also to participate in the review so that we can continue to strengthen that voice to the ACT government and Assembly.\" Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith. Picture by Karleen Minney Ms Stephen-Smith said the failed referendum for a national Voice to Parliament had raised the profile of the Elected Body. \"I think one of the many reasons that Canberra's were the only jurisdiction to vote yes in the referendum last year was because we had the experience of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice to government, and we know that it's made a positive impact,\" she said. Nominations to run for the 2024 Elected Body election opened last week and will close at noon on Monday, June 3. Voting opens on July 6 and closes at 6pm on Saturday, July 13. Elections for the seven-member body are held every three years. Eighteen people nominated for the 2021 election, and 267 eligible people cast formal ballots in the election. Census data collected in 2021 by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed there were more than 6000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Canberra who would have been eligible to vote. A report into the conduct of the election, released by Elections ACT in 2021, said: \"At the time of polling at the [Alexander Maconochie Centre] on Wednesday 7 July 2021, approximately 101 detainees identified as being an Aboriginal person or Torres Strait Islander. Of the 101 potential electors, a total of 19 people cast a vote.\" The Auditor-General last year found the part-time Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body in the ACT, which attracts low voter turnout, risked being an ineffective support for Indigenous self-determination in the ACT. An independent review is considering the future of the Elected Body, with the government earlier this year committing to working with the ACT's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community on improvements. The ACT committed $1.19 million over three years to increase members' paid time and set up an independent secretariat. \"The more people who are going to come out and vote, the more people are going to have conversations about the elected body - and then that will encourage more people to get involved,\" Ms Stephen-Smith said.

        "description": "Yes, her dad’s Ethan Hawke and her mum’s Uma Thurman. But Maya Hawke is creating thoughtful work on her own terms – including her new album, Chaos Angel.",
        "content": "On a highway somewhere between Atlanta and South Carolina, Maya Hawke is enjoying a brief respite from armageddon. She’s been given a few days off from shooting the final season of Stranger Things , the Netflix hit where she plays the loveable, neurotic video shop clerk Robin Buckley, and the 25-year-old has decided to break up the grind of the lengthy shoot – “We started in January, and we’ll probably be done in January. It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” she deadpans – with an impromptu road trip. By the time she phones through for our scheduled interview, she’s already singing the classics. “We’ve been listening to a podcast on the history of the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte,” she says with a dry laugh, when I ask her for the road trip’s playlist. It’s not Sabrina Carpenter and it’s not the Beatles’ Black Album , the famous mixtape her dad Ethan Hawke once curated for her and later repurposed for his role in Richard Linklater’s Boyhood , but it feels delightfully on brand for the most cerebral of Gen-Z’s rising screen stars. “I remember it all pretty well from grade school,” Hawke adds. “I can sing along if I try really hard, shouting out Bastille Day, really vibing with it.” Beyond the screen, Hawke – the daughter of Ethan and Uma Thurman, who, besides Stranger Things , earned acclaim for her recent performances in Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City and Bradley Cooper’s Maestro – is gearing up for the release of Chaos Angel , her third album of thoughtful indie-pop following Blush (2020) and Moss (2022), albums which, while sonically sparse, showcased her sensitive, expressive songwriting. If Moss was her musical unveiling, particularly via its breakout single Therese , inspired by modern artist Balthus’ Therese Dreaming , Chaos Angel , elevates her work further, both with its sonic ambition and an increasing boldness in her songwriting. Take the lead single Missing Out , for example, where Hawke sings about naive kids envying her “television salary” and her own conflicted feelings about “being born with my foot in the door”, as though she’s grappling with the privilege of how she grew up while also wondering if she lost something along the way. “I don’t see Missing Out as any more revealing than any of my other songs, but it’s possible it’s revealing aspects of my thinking that are more salacious to people in, like, a kind of headliney way,” Hawke concedes, perhaps a weary glare to the nepo narrative that’s become every Hollywood scion’s burden. The song was inspired by Hawke’s misgivings about having skipped college at 18 in order to live on her own and pursue acting opportunities instead. The decision left her feeling so alienated among her own generation that years later, she tagged onto her brother Levon’s experience at Brown University, where she dropped in on random lectures on the history of Hinduism, Eastern religion, and the history of China for three months. “Yes, there was a poetic irony to it,” Hawke says, when I suggest most uni kids are trying to get out of class, not get into ones they aren’t even enrolled in. “But it was so fun and so enlightening. I got to sneak into classes and listen to professors talk, and I’m grateful to my brother for allowing me to do that and to talk about it publicly, because both things are slightly embarrassing for him.” By the time summer break came around, Hawke had found perspective. “I was like, you know what? I like my life. I don’t have any regrets. But I wrote a song about it, so not a total waste of time.” It’s a strange thing to admit to an interview subject that you might have inadvertently stalked them years ago, when they were merely a child clutching their famous father’s hand during a leisurely stroll around their home neighbourhood, but here we are. It was over a decade ago, I tell Hawke, and my girlfriend and I were tourists in New York, on our way to explore Chelsea’s recently opened High Line, when we stumbled across Ethan Hawke in the streets with kids in tow. Obviously, we did what any Before Sunrise enthusiast would do and surreptitiously walked in the same direction for a string of blocks to see what exciting movie star business he was getting up to. About 10 minutes later, we gave up out of both shame and boredom. What was surprising, however, was the space and respect his fellow New Yorkers afforded Hawke. He might have attracted the odd head turn, but no one bothered him – just a dude taking a walk with his family. You sense that even with two Hollywood superstars for parents, Maya’s childhood was decidedly sheltered from typical movie star eccentricities. “One thing that’s wonderful about my parents is that they never had an overblown sense of their own importance,” says Hawke. “They felt like artists, in that their relationship to their work was not as celebrities or famous people, but as people whose job it was to make art. And so they acted like anyone would with that; they just saw it as their job. That’s what I was brought up around, an understanding that a life in the arts is a job and it’s a craft. It’s a beautiful privilege to have that job, but it’s also a job like everyone else’s and it’s not more or less important than anyone else’s.” Growing up in such an environment, a life in the arts was always likely. “My whole life was drowned in the arts,” says Hawke. “I did every school play, I was always writing songs, I was always doing watercolours, I was always writing poems. Being in New York City, we’d go to the Met, the theatre, see plays on Broadway, things off-Broadway. It just felt like a necessary part of life – you eat, you sleep, you try to move your body, you try to go to school, and you try to consume a little art and make a little art, too.” In an interview with Variety , Ethan once mentioned he knew the exact moment Maya would follow in her parents’ footsteps, after he brought her along to a technical read through of a Shakespeare play he was in, and was shocked to find she wasn’t bored at all. But when does Maya pinpoint her professional awakening? “It was doing Euripides’ Bacchae in my junior year, directed by Laura Barnett, at my high school Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn,” she says. “I dove into it completely. I didn’t study for my SAT, I didn’t focus on anything else, I just let myself be an actor and it was the best feeling I’d ever had. It felt like I was home, I loved the community, I loved the friendships I made. That experience, and how positive it was, became kind of like the golden compass, alethiometer, of my life. I was like, OK, I’m gonna chase that feeling.” Music was a similarly organic pursuit, fuelled by childhood guitar, piano and singing lessons, and the realisation that songwriting was a prime form of communication that persuaded the people around her to listen more. “I’m still this kind of person who practises for my conversations. Like, if we were roommates and we were gonna have a big talk about the fact that you don’t do the dishes enough, I would practise that conversation in my head a lot, and I would find that putting melodies to my rehearsed conversations and making them rhyme was a better way to remember them.” Negative preconceptions about actors who make music are prevalent, and Hawke hasn’t been immune. She credits her producer and co-writer Christian Lee Hutson (to whom she’s also been romantically linked ) for being “a huge influence in shirking some of the imposter syndrome, though I still have a lot”. “I still have imposter syndrome but it’s gotten a lot better,” says Hawke. “On my first record I really felt like I had to keep the songs completely bare, like only use acoustic instruments and not double my vocal or have any harmonies because I didn’t want anyone to think that I had, you know, ‘bought a record’ – like, hired a producer to make me sound good. If they didn’t like me, I wanted to make sure they knew that they didn’t like me and not that they didn’t like the choices somebody else had made. “But I think each record has gotten less constrained by my fear and more playful and more present, and I think it’s just from education. The more you learn, the less afraid you are. Knowledge is power.” Her confidence is present on Chaos Angel, a warm album that’s more sonically layered than Hawke’s others, with its use of samples, horns, electronics and distortion, inspired by artists she was listening to at the time including Liz Phair, Mazzy Star, Buffy Sainte-Marie, James Blake, and our own Julia Jacklin. “About my first few records, people kept writing that they were sparse,” she says. “And I definitely had a goal to have no one say that this was sparse.” The song Dark , which she’s said “emerged from a major anxiety episode following a soul-shattering break-up”, highlights Hawke’s way with a good line (“I’m your guitar, mute me gently with the palm of your hand”). You can imagine the Notes app on her phone is loaded. “It’s very chaotic,” Hawke admits. “I like to play this game called ‘Notes Roulette’, where you and another person pick a date and you scroll through your phone to find the note you made on that day and you have to read it out loud. Fun game, I highly recommend it,” she adds. “Nothing’s more revealing than a grocery list.” In a recent interview, Hawke said that Chaos Angel , the album’s titular track, came out of the mindset she was in while making Wildcat , a film she did with her father Ethan where she played author Flannery O’Connor. It seems like being in such a space of imagination and creative empathy offers a fertile overlap for songwriting. “I think they work very well together, and I highly recommend that all actors write music,” she says, noting that acting’s a form of “reaching out” to better understand the world, while songwriting is an act of “digging deep” to figure out what you feel and think. Each practice lies in a desire to “express, pursue truth and tell stories”, says Hawke, but she admits, as her music career flourishes, that it’s becoming difficult to juggle both. Is there some sort of plan to how she navigates her career or is she just feeling her way through? “I still audition a bunch and I’ve taken most every good job that’s come my way. I think that a lot of people see the roles that actors choose as, like, intensely reflective on them, and that’s partially true. But also, most actors I know, even really successful ones, are kind of going with the flow and, like, whatever good writing comes their way they want to do, basically,” says Hawke. “I mean, you’d be hard-pressed to find a kind of person that’s more gung ho, ‘put me in, coach!’ than an actor – they’re a pretty excitable group of volunteers.” Having veterans in her corner (yes, Mum and Dad), only helps to a degree. “I think people really overestimate the amount of strategy that goes into an actor’s career, you know?” Hawke jokes. “I mean, it’s a lot of auditioning, taking the jobs that come your way, and hoping that more do. “The advice I get from my parents is always more minutiae-based – ‘I don’t want to do this job but it’s a good job, would I be stupid not to do it?’ or ‘What should I do if I’m having an uncomfortable experience with my scene partner?’ In terms of what projects to do and how to spend your career, that’s mostly 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent instinct.” Her next role will see her playing Anxiety in Pixar’s Inside Out 2 , a casting stroke that feels inspired considering her public persona – that rare star who appears introverted, slightly uncomfortable with the spotlight. “Wow, is that my persona?” Hawke says. “I don’t feel like that’s who I am as a person. I mean, of course I have anxiety, but I don’t think I have any more anxiety than the average person. In fact, I might be lucky enough to have a little bit less.” OK, but has she ever seen herself on a talk show? There’s a kind of charming, nervous energy there that is a large part of what makes her feel relatable to audiences, despite her atypical upbringing. Is it painful for her to get up on stage, or to see herself on screen? “I mean, I’m not gonna be like, ‘No, I’m totally comfortable on stage!’ I’m totally nervous and excited, and I feel like I want to express myself and I want to be understood, and I’m afraid that I won’t be or that I won’t be good enough. But it doesn’t feel painful, it’s joyful,” says Hawke. “There’s a great David Bowie quote about that: ‘You want to be just deep enough in the water so that your toes don’t touch the bottom’. That’s how I feel. I’m happiest when I’m just deep enough out there into the realm of what scares me that my toes don’t touch the bottom, and I can explore that and just, you know, kick my feet a little.” Maya Hawke’s Chaos Angel is out on May 31.

The theme for 2024 is \"Now More Than Ever\", to facilitate conversation about shared histories and cultures like Uncle Billy T from Yukembruk Dreaming Dance Academy. \"Our dance group is not just about local dance, it's about the community,\" he said. \"Also recognising who we are as First Nations people, learning the songs and the dances. A lot of people just watch, they don't know what the song is about or the dance is about.\" The Yukembruk dance group followed Uncle Billy's smoking ceremony to welcome the community onto Country. \"It's good to see the whole community here as well,\" he said. Stevie Greenaway is a member of the Yukembruk dance group, alongside her children. Leilani Greenaway, 14, Uncle Billy T, Stevie Greenaway and Janara Duffin, 13, from the Yukembruk (black crow) dreaming dance academy on Monday. Picture by Keegan Carroll She said that people who come to these events get a better understanding of what Indigenous communities are about. \"It means the Aboriginal people and our culture being accepted by the wider community, which obviously, it already should be.\" \"The Yukembruk dance group allows my children to practice their cultural skills when we're not living on country, which to me as an Aboriginal woman is just amazing.\" \"Unless we do that, we're never going to be acknowledged, our culture won't reach where it should reach.\" In the children's marquee, activities that displayed Indigenous culture included Aboriginal symbol tracing, Yulunga language development games and the Wiradjuri dance dice. Ms Greenaway said her kids might have friends who don't understand Indigenous culture, so raising them to tell their friends who they are, and where they come from, in the story behind our First Nations people was important. \"I hope to raise strong, black, proud children who will always stand up for their rights, their country and their culture. That's what I want as a mum.\" Families gathered around the main stage where entertainment like Wallabindi and Djaarmby Band shared stories and song. AJ and Debbie Wiltshire were among those in attendance reflecting on what Reconciliation Day means to them. \"I think it's important to spread the message of reconciliation and everyone needs to be a part of it,\" they said. \"The more we can be around and talk about Aboriginal issues and bring them to the public, I think, the more the better.\" Local Canberra residents, like Martin Lumb, who, despite not often going to events like these, showed up to be part of the conversation. \"It's important that despite the referendum, we need to keep having some presence,\" he said.

        "description": "From student to director, Lisa Pavane’s storied 46-year journey with the Australian Ballet School is drawing to a close.",
        "content": "Lisa Pavane arrived at the Australian Ballet School as a starry-eyed teenager. Forty-six years later, she’s leaving after nine years as its director. The school celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2024, but has only been overseen by four directors across that period. Each person who led the school clearly left their mark; during Pavane’s tenure, the old stereotype of the draconian ballet taskmaster who demands everything of their students has been replaced by an approach she describes as “holistic”. Lisa Pavane is retiring after nine years helming the Australian Ballet School. Credit: Hilary Walker “We’re so fortunate in the way that we’re looking at our young people and their health and wellbeing. That’s a real lens now,” she says. “It’s a very vigorous vocation, so having that education around how you look after your body and how you learn about it and how you fuel it, prepare it, condition it, is leaps and bounds from when I went to the school.” When Pavane was a student, there was an implicit understanding that dancers were to be seen and not heard. Now the atmosphere is one of collaboration. “We’re trying to break down that hierarchy, that power between teacher and student and really levelling it out. Inviting young people to step into the space, to be their own learners and understand their learning. We’re inviting a lot more conversation.” Greg Horsman and Lisa Pavane perform in Giselle, 1990. Credit: The Australian Ballet Dancer and choreographer Kevin Jackson says that Pavane’s interest in giving students more chances to explore their own artistic voice and contribute to classes has lifted the local ballet scene on the whole. “Lisa’s been a visionary in her response to investing in homegrown talent. She’s given the students of today the opportunity to experience the creative part of the profession, and allowed a space for choreographers to explore their art.” Pavane says that a nurturing learning environment leads to far better outcomes than a whip-cracking, disciplinarian approach. Lisa Pavane is proud of the way the school has become more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. Credit: Lynette Wills “We know through positive education and psychology that when they’re happy, they’re thriving, they’re flourishing, they’re feeling comfortable in the space, then their brain is open and they’re much more open to learning. That’s our philosophy, embedded in what we do every day now.” Pavane is also proud of the way the school has become less of a closed shop and more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. “I’ve worked to try and open up the school so that we have more accessibility and more connection with the community. “We have an incredible love and passion for teaching and dancing and nurturing the future generation of dancers. We can all learn from each other. We’re really trying to inspire that and not feel that we’re better than anyone else.” In the nine years she has been the school’s director, Pavane hasn’t been the sort who leads from afar. “Lisa is very involved,” says Jackson. “She’s always there for assessments and will come into rehearsals for the productions we do, as a mentor not only to the choreographer but also to the students.” Pavane has been an influential mentor in Jackson’s own career, from his time training as a teacher at the school to his development as a choreographer. But along with the success stories come those who don’t find a career in dance is on the cards. “We talk about the holistic person and the skills that they learn, whether it be from one year, three years, five years of this amazing discipline, that they can take into all walks of life. When we hear back from young people that have left the school for whatever reason they speak so highly of the skills you learn from being in this artistic field,” says Pavane. After graduating from the school, Pavane rose to become a principal artist at the Australian Ballet before enjoying a long international career. En Pointe , the final Australian Ballet School performance under her stewardship, will be performed at Hamer Hall on May 28 and at The Round, Nunawading on August 21. She’s looking forward to a little break, but she’s not putting her feet up for good. “This school gave me my life, it gave me my career, and I’ve loved every minute that I’ve spent in it ... I’m certainly not going to be putting on my slippers and sitting on the couch with my knitting needles just yet.” En Pointe is on at Hamer Hall on May 28 and The Round on August 21.

        "content": "The NBA conference finals are lacking drama, as both series appear headed for a sweep and a finals clash between the Celtics and Mavericks. Indiana goes into Game 4 on Monday night attempting to save their season as a 7.5-point home underdog. Oddsmakers at DraftKings , among others, are clearly expecting a sweep. Ahead of Game 1 , we noted that the Celtics do not turn the ball over nor do they get their shots blocked. Wise bettors have smashed that trend into oblivion. Those prop projections have all plummeted thanks to a 100 percent win rate on Myles Turner’s blocks, steals, and blocks + steals prop in each of the first three games. Bettors who have followed the trend are more than 10 units of profit on three games, but oddsmakers, as always, are adjusting. Turner’s prop projection is down to 1.5 steals + blocks ahead of Game 4, and there likely will be no Tyrese Haliburton going forward . (8 p.m. ET, ESPN) Many have joked about Andrew Nembhard’s sudden emergence as he’s thrown up shots and connected on many, especially during a 32-point outburst in Game 3 . He kept the Pacers on top for most of that game before the Celtics furiously rallied to win. If Nembhard can’t keep up that hot shooting, the Pacers are live to get smoked Monday at home. And that’s where we could see some mop-up duty from guys like Peyton Pritchard, Sam Hauser and Xavier Tillman Sr. Based on the oddsmaker’s opinion of this game, it should seem likely that the Celtics are able to sit their starters for large portions of Monday’s contest. Hauser played 22 minutes in the Game 2 blowout (1-for-5 from 3-point range). Target Hauser in Game 4; he’s taking a ton of shots and his poor shooting has been nothing short of shocking, considering the Pacers own the worst defense in the NBA playoffs. Hauser is 1-for-11 in this series, taking multiple 3-pointers in each game he has played. His projection is 3.5 points, according to FanDuel and BetMGM, but given the expected game script and freedom he’s being given to fire away whenever he has the ball, he’s a good bet. Hauser’s overs are all worth targeting. Here’s my plan of attack for Game 4. PICKS: Hauser over 3.5 points scored (-113, BetMGM ) | 2+ 3-pointers made (+175, FanDuel ) | 10+ points scored (+500, Bet365 )",

        "content": "Anti-Semitic attacks are continuing in the territory, as a Jewish community leader dismissed the Albanese government's consultation on new laws to ban hate speech as \"too little, too late\". Subscribe now for unlimited access . $ 0 / (min cost $ 0 ) Login or signup to continue reading Continue with Email Continue with Google Continue with Apple See subscription options The Canberra Times has been sent a photo of graffiti in Civic calling on Jews to leave, as evidence anti-Semitic hate speech continues in the ACT. The graffiti, scrawled onto a wall in East Row earlier this month, comes after nearby Anita Gelato was targeted with anti-Israel stickers in November . Australian Jewish Association president Robert Gregory, who took the photo while visiting Canberra on May 12, said it was no consolation the federal Attorney-General was progressing hate speech laws, when anti-Semitism had been allowed to spread for the past seven months. \"The Albanese government should have taken action immediately following the protest outside the Opera House on 9 October when it was clear anti-Semitism was spreading,\" Mr Gregory said. \"They have allowed the situation to deteriorate.\" Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus is consulting on a standalone hate speech bill while still seeking to include religious vilification prohibitions in the government's controversial Religious Discrimination Bill . Mr Dreyfus said the Albanese government \"is committed to promoting and supporting respect, acceptance and understanding across the Australian community\". \"We are committed to protecting the community from those who promote extremism, hatred or seek to incite violence,\" he said in a statement. Federal Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus is consulting on hate speech laws. Picture by Karleen Minney Mr Gregory said it was \"not necessarily clear that there needs to be new laws\" and that there needed to be \"enforcement of the existing laws\". He acknowledged disagreement over the precise words chanted at the pro-Palestine Opera House protest, but said \"either way, the conduct was unacceptable.\" The ACT already has a ban on religious vilification as part of its Discrimination Act. It is unclear how frequently it is being enforced. Federal Opposition frontbencher Dan Tehan said the Coalition would \"work with the government in a bipartisan way\" on laws to address religious vilification amid the \"growing anti-Semitism, which is occurring at the moment\". \"The government has been too late to this issue, far too late to this issue, and we need to take strong action,\" he said. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles on Monday condemned \"confronting\" levels of anti-Semitism in Australia after a Jewish school in Melbourne was vandalised with threatening graffiti. \"We need to be, as a country, mature enough to be able to have a debate about what's going on overseas, to allow people to have their completely legitimate right to express their views about what's happening overseas - but to do that in a way which does not challenge our own social cohesion,\" Mr Marles said. Mr Marles visited Mount Scopus College after the school's fence was found sprayed with the words \"Jew die\", words he said \"have no place in our society\". Speaking alongside Labor MP Josh Burns, a former student of the school, he said the number of incidents of extreme hate speech he had observed in recent months were higher \"than any that I've seen during my lifetime\". Mr Burns said it was \"just devastating to see the graffiti outside a place that was such a big part of my life\". \"We need ... to stand strong and to stand firm against anti-Semitism in all of its forms,\" he said. A spokesperson for ACT Policing said it had \"received a report of a Civic business having propaganda stickers relating to protests placed on them\" in November. \"ACT Policing continues to monitor this type of behaviour and will prosecute as required those who are responsible for acts of public nuisance, vandalism or criminal damage,\" the statement said. \"We support a tolerant and inclusive society and encourage anyone who is the victim of racial vilification to report this crime to police.\" Share Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Email Copy Dana Daniel Senior Political Reporter Dana Daniel is Senior Political Reporter for The Canberra Times.

        "description": "From student to director, Lisa Pavane’s storied 46-year journey with the Australian Ballet School is drawing to a close.",
        "content": "Lisa Pavane arrived at the Australian Ballet School as a starry-eyed teenager. Forty-six years later, she’s leaving after nine years as its director. The school celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2024, but has only been overseen by four directors across that period. Each person who led the school clearly left their mark; during Pavane’s tenure, the old stereotype of the draconian ballet taskmaster who demands everything of their students has been replaced by an approach she describes as “holistic”. Lisa Pavane is retiring after nine years helming the Australian Ballet School. Credit: Hilary Walker “We’re so fortunate in the way that we’re looking at our young people and their health and wellbeing. That’s a real lens now,” she says. “It’s a very vigorous vocation, so having that education around how you look after your body and how you learn about it and how you fuel it, prepare it, condition it, is leaps and bounds from when I went to the school.” When Pavane was a student, there was an implicit understanding that dancers were to be seen and not heard. Now the atmosphere is one of collaboration. “We’re trying to break down that hierarchy, that power between teacher and student and really levelling it out. Inviting young people to step into the space, to be their own learners and understand their learning. We’re inviting a lot more conversation.” Greg Horsman and Lisa Pavane perform in Giselle, 1990. Credit: The Australian Ballet Dancer and choreographer Kevin Jackson says that Pavane’s interest in giving students more chances to explore their own artistic voice and contribute to classes has lifted the local ballet scene on the whole. “Lisa’s been a visionary in her response to investing in homegrown talent. She’s given the students of today the opportunity to experience the creative part of the profession, and allowed a space for choreographers to explore their art.” Pavane says that a nurturing learning environment leads to far better outcomes than a whip-cracking, disciplinarian approach. Lisa Pavane is proud of the way the school has become more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. Credit: Lynette Wills “We know through positive education and psychology that when they’re happy, they’re thriving, they’re flourishing, they’re feeling comfortable in the space, then their brain is open and they’re much more open to learning. That’s our philosophy, embedded in what we do every day now.” Pavane is also proud of the way the school has become less of a closed shop and more receptive to outside influences during her time at the helm. “I’ve worked to try and open up the school so that we have more accessibility and more connection with the community. “We have an incredible love and passion for teaching and dancing and nurturing the future generation of dancers. We can all learn from each other. We’re really trying to inspire that and not feel that we’re better than anyone else.” In the nine years she has been the school’s director, Pavane hasn’t been the sort who leads from afar. “Lisa is very involved,” says Jackson. “She’s always there for assessments and will come into rehearsals for the productions we do, as a mentor not only to the choreographer but also to the students.” Loading Pavane has been an influential mentor in Jackson’s own career, from his time training as a teacher at the school to his development as a choreographer. But along with the success stories come those who don’t find a career in dance is on the cards. “We talk about the holistic person and the skills that they learn, whether it be from one year, three years, five years of this amazing discipline, that they can take into all walks of life. When we hear back from young people that have left the school for whatever reason they speak so highly of the skills you learn from being in this artistic field,” says Pavane. After graduating from the school, Pavane rose to become a principal artist at the Australian Ballet before enjoying a long international career. En Pointe , the final Australian Ballet School performance under her stewardship, will be performed at Hamer Hall on May 28 and at The Round, Nunawading on August 21. Loading She’s looking forward to a little break, but she’s not putting her feet up for good. “This school gave me my life, it gave me my career, and I’ve loved every minute that I’ve spent in it ... I’m certainly not going to be putting on my slippers and sitting on the couch with my knitting needles just yet.” En Pointe is on at Hamer Hall on May 28 and The Round on August 21.

        "description": "Leeds United’s latest play-off final heartache will hurt more than ever before. That’s six play-off encounters they have been involved in spanning close to three...The post Neil Warnock states what he noticed about Daniel Farke when Dan James hit the crossbar for Leeds appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "That’s six play-off encounters they have been involved in spanning close to three decades and they have all ended in defeat. Some would say that’s typical because they have a serious mental blockage when it comes to these games, as they proved during their on Sunday. When hit the crossbar, it sent a shudder down the spine of both sets of supporters because the game was coming to an end and it was a moment that could have changed everything. The Yorkshire outfit, after falling behind to an early Adam Armstrong goal, just couldn’t play their natural game and Russell Martin was tactically outdoing , again! Southampton were the only team during the regular season to do the double over Leeds – and that showed at the home of football. Neil Warnock made it clear that ‘the best team won tactically’ even if he thinks highly about the man in the Elland Road dugout. , Warnock shared that he instantly looked down at the Leeds manager and noticed that ‘he knew’ that was it and the game was gone, as he told (26/05/24 at 5:55 pm). Very little time was left and if the Whites had any luck, then that effort would have hit the back of the net, but in the end, it’s another season in the Championship for Leeds. Leeds United lose play-off final to Southampton “When James hit the crossbar, I looked down at Daniel (Farke) and I think he knew,” said Warnock. “When that hit the crossbar, I think he knew that it wasn’t going to be. He shouldn’t batter himself because he has done a brilliant job. He is a lovely man and I think he is a good manager. “But I thought the best team won tactically. Look at that here, that’s a volley, no chance for the goalkeeper and any other way, it goes in. That’s in, it’s then a different game and they are on top. That’s football and you need a bit of luck, a referee decision or the smallest of things.” Big pressure on Daniel Farke You can’t see the manager leaving, whether that’s moving on himself or getting booted out. But this defeat does put huge pressure on him heading into the forthcoming campaign because nothing but promotion is expected. Two of the relegated sides – Leicester City and Southampton – did their jobs, so Leeds can’t have any excuses, in that regard. The issue for the club is that if you offered them a play-off finish next season, then fans wouldn’t probably accept it because they know what’s coming. But now it’s about dealing with the present, , they better hope that he is the only one.",

        "description": "Stress is normal. But how do we manage it?",
        "content": "Do you ever feel like the world is against you? or signup to continue reading Like everything that could go wrong has gone wrong? Like Murphy (and his law) has moved in and is squatting in your basement? Sometimes, it can feel like the world is against you when one thing after another comes at you like rolling punches on a speed bag ... and you're the speed bag. That's certainly how I've been feeling lately. Battered, bruised, barely able to catch my breath, and still having to show up for everything, plastering a smile on my face and making the best of it. Honestly, it's exhausting. Why do we do this? Why do force ourselves to pretend everything is OK, that we're coping just fine, that we don't need help? Is it shame? Embarrassment? The belief that acknowledging the challenges we are facing makes them real? Maybe it's a little of all of those things. Well, - once again sharing my own rawness and failures for the world to see - because I think it's really important that we remind ourselves that everyone needs help sometimes. And that's OK. Last week, my husband was rushed to hospital and spent the week in intensive care. We nearly lost him and it was stressful beyond measure. In between trying to get to and from the hospital, managing my and our son's respiratory infections, working, a uni assignment that was due, we had a house inspection we weren't able to reschedule. Then, this morning, I receive a phone call from my husband to tell me that we've received a \"no cause\" termination notice, so on top of everything else, we now have to try and find another place to live in a rental market that thinks it's OK to of all places. I mean seriously. Get a grip. At this point, what started out as a snowball rolling down the hill, has gathered so much stress and anxiety, panic and fear along the way as it rolls, it's become something of an avalanche. I'm finding myself desperately running in front of it as it careens down the hillside, trying not to be smothered by the immeasurable amount of stress-snow nipping at my heels as I find myself running more and more out of control, picking up pace I can't handle. Like I said, it's exhausting. I know I'm not the only person in this situation. in December 2022 and discovered that 64 per cent of people rated their stress level as 5/10 or higher, with 40 per cent of all Australians worryingly rating their stress level as 7/10 or higher. I really don't think we can lay claim to being the laid-back she'll-be-right-mate nation of the world anymore, and we need to seriously look at how this is impacting people across Australia. Stress is a natural part of our lives as it's a normal human reaction that everyone experiences from time to time. According to Dr Timothy Legg, It is a biological response to a perceived threat manifested through the physical and mental experience of the hormone release that produces the \"fight-or-flight\" response. However, stress becomes a problem when you start to feel overwhelmed by it or it lasts for a long time. So how can we manage it? How can I prevent the snowball turning into an avalanche and squishing me flat on the downhill spiral that appears to be becoming my life? Well, that's a very good question. Looking at the cause of our stress is an important factor in being able to manage our stress levels as this holds the key to finding ways to prevent stress occurring in the first place. However, stress prevention isn't always possible. The American Institute of Stress said (in not so many words) that essentially it comes down to the Serenity Prayer: it's about recognising there's no point stressing about things you can't do anything about, working out what you can do about the things you can change, and taking the time to work out what goes on what list. Now, I just need to find the magic solution to fear and panic and I'll be golden. I'm thinking something with four bedrooms and two bathrooms might have something to do with it.

        "description": "Out-of-date thinking on heavy industries needs to change.",
        "content": "The regions are key to Australia's enormous emissions reduction potential. They also stand to gain from its equally enormous clean energy and industry opportunities. or signup to continue reading Australia and its regions have incredible advantages: abundant renewable resources, a strong industrial history, a skilled workforce and established trading partners, ready and waiting for our green products. Despite these advantages, the country's heavy industries have been defined by many as \"hard to abate\" - in other words, it is considered difficult to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. But that thinking is out of date: it is rather that they are \"late to abate\". Climateworks co-convened the four-year Australian Industry Energy Transitions Initiative which found it is possible to eliminate over 90 per cent of emissions in Australia's major heavy industry supply chains of iron and steel, aluminium, liquified natural gas, chemicals and mining of other metals such as copper and lithium. The other good news is Australia's heavy industries and associated emissions are clustered in a handful of places across the country. Five industrial regions - Illawarra, Hunter, Kwinana, Gladstone and the Pilbara - account for one-eighth of Australia's total emissions. That's equivalent to the emissions of every car and light commercial vehicle across the country. That is why taking a place-based \"Net Zero Industrial Precinct\" approach makes so much sense for Australia, alongside other national and state policies. The idea is relatively simple - focus on where the emissions and industries are and supercharge them with plenty of renewable energy, green hydrogen and shared infrastructure and take advantage of their existing skilled workforce. A place-based approach also allows for the costs, risks and benefits to be shared, and actions to be coordinated. Net Zero Industrial Precincts are a major revitalisation opportunity for our industrial heartlands to ensure they - and the communities they support - remain competitive in a decarbonised world. It wasn't that long ago that solar panels were considered a novel, emerging technology. I can remember in 2010 when Climateworks Centre showcased different low carbon solutions for Australia and solar ranked behind energy efficiency, transport and carbon farming. Today, close to 3 million Australian homes have rooftop solar, supplying over 10 per cent of the country's power. We have the highest amount of solar PV per person in the world and a renewable energy target of 82 per cent by 2030 for the national electricity grid. Earlier this month the federal budget showcased Future Made in Australia, a framework focused on developing wind and solar in addition to clean industries like green hydrogen and critical minerals. Australia is starting to focus on decarbonising not just the grid we have today but the economy we want tomorrow - one with prosperous clean industries that generations of Australians can work in and benefit from. Australia's national net zero legislation is now two years old, and older for all the state and territory governments and many companies and financial institutions. New national laws will require large companies' financial reports to include their emissions; those of their suppliers and customers; their forward targets to reduce emissions and their transition plan to get them there. Having agreed to net zero targets, now every country, sector and company needs a plan to achieve it. That's where the Australian government's sector decarbonisation plans come into play. The government is developing national net zero sector plans for the major parts of our economy that matter for emissions reduction: Electricity and energy, Industry, Resources, Transport, Built environment and Agriculture and land. There are a few key things that need to be taken into account when developing and implementing these plans. To solve for what the science demands, they should align ambition with the 1.5 degree Celsius global warming limit in the Paris Agreement. There are also many interdependencies between sectors. Most obvious is the energy and electricity sector, which must move quickly to build the renewable energy needed to power the decarbonisation of other sectors, including the built environment, industry and transport. Management textbooks say when you set your strategy you make a plan and provide targets and resources to those responsible for implementing it. We are now in the era where net zero strategy, targets and plans are being tackled by nations, sectors and companies. It won't be long until we can reflect on a time when industrial decarbonisation felt out of reach, and point to Australia's world-leading Net Zero Industrial Precincts and sectors with green supply chains producing and exporting green energy, green metals and critical minerals around the world.

It’s not and it’s not the Beatles’ , the famous mixtape her dad Ethan Hawke once curated for her and later repurposed for his role in Richard Linklater’s , but it feels delightfully on brand for the most cerebral of Gen-Z’s rising screen stars. “I remember it all pretty well from grade school,” Hawke adds. “I can sing along if I try really hard, shouting out Bastille Day, really vibing with it.” Beyond the screen, Hawke – the daughter of Ethan and Uma Thurman, who, besides , earned acclaim for her recent performances in Wes Anderson’s and Bradley Cooper’s – is gearing up for the release of , her third album of thoughtful indie-pop following (2020) and (2022), albums which, while sonically sparse, showcased her sensitive, expressive songwriting. If was her musical unveiling, particularly via its breakout single , inspired by modern artist Balthus’ , , elevates her work further, both with its sonic ambition and an increasing boldness in her songwriting. Take the lead single , for example, where Hawke sings about naive kids envying her “television salary” and her own conflicted feelings about “being born with my foot in the door”, as though she’s grappling with the privilege of how she grew up while also wondering if she lost something along the way. “I don’t see as any more revealing than any of my other songs, but it’s possible it’s revealing aspects of my thinking that are more salacious to people in, like, a kind of headliney way,” Hawke concedes, perhaps a weary glare to the nepo narrative that’s become every Hollywood scion’s burden. The song was inspired by Hawke’s misgivings about having skipped college at 18 in order to live on her own and pursue acting opportunities instead. The decision left her feeling so alienated among her own generation that years later, she tagged onto her brother Levon’s experience at Brown University, where she dropped in on random lectures on the history of Hinduism, Eastern religion, and the history of China for three months. “Yes, there was a poetic irony to it,” Hawke says, when I suggest most uni kids are trying to get out of class, not get into ones they aren’t even enrolled in. “But it was so fun and so enlightening. I got to sneak into classes and listen to professors talk, and I’m grateful to my brother for allowing me to do that and to talk about it publicly, because both things are slightly embarrassing for him.” By the time summer break came around, Hawke had found perspective. “I was like, you know what? I like my life. I don’t have any regrets. But I wrote a song about it, so not a total waste of time.” It’s a strange thing to admit to an interview subject that you might have inadvertently stalked them years ago, when they were merely a child clutching their famous father’s hand during a leisurely stroll around their home neighbourhood, but here we are. It was over a decade ago, I tell Hawke, and my girlfriend and I were tourists in New York, on our way to explore Chelsea’s recently opened High Line, when we stumbled across Ethan Hawke in the streets with kids in tow. Obviously, we did what any enthusiast would do and surreptitiously walked in the same direction for a string of blocks to see what exciting movie star business he was getting up to. About 10 minutes later, we gave up out of both shame and boredom. What was surprising, however, was the space and respect his fellow New Yorkers afforded Hawke. He might have attracted the odd head turn, but no one bothered him – just a dude taking a walk with his family. You sense that even with two Hollywood superstars for parents, Maya’s childhood was decidedly sheltered from typical movie star eccentricities. “One thing that’s wonderful about my parents is that they never had an overblown sense of their own importance,” says Hawke. “They felt like artists, in that their relationship to their work was not as celebrities or famous people, but as people whose job it was to make art. And so they acted like anyone would with that; they just saw it as their job. That’s what I was brought up around, an understanding that a life in the arts is a job and it’s a craft. It’s a beautiful privilege to have that job, but it’s also a job like everyone else’s and it’s not more or less important than anyone else’s.” Growing up in such an environment, a life in the arts was always likely. “My whole life was drowned in the arts,” says Hawke. “I did every school play, I was always writing songs, I was always doing watercolours, I was always writing poems. Being in New York City, we’d go to the Met, the theatre, see plays on Broadway, things off-Broadway. It just felt like a necessary part of life – you eat, you sleep, you try to move your body, you try to go to school, and you try to consume a little art and make a little art, too.” In an interview with , Ethan once mentioned he knew the exact moment Maya would follow in her parents’ footsteps, after he brought her along to a technical read through of a Shakespeare play he was in, and was shocked to find she wasn’t bored at all. But when does Maya pinpoint her professional awakening? “It was doing Euripides’ in my junior year, directed by Laura Barnett, at my high school Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn,” she says. “I dove into it completely. I didn’t study for my SAT, I didn’t focus on anything else, I just let myself be an actor and it was the best feeling I’d ever had. It felt like I was home, I loved the community, I loved the friendships I made. That experience, and how positive it was, became kind of like the golden compass, alethiometer, of my life. I was like, OK, I’m gonna chase that feeling.” Music was a similarly organic pursuit, fuelled by childhood guitar, piano and singing lessons, and the realisation that songwriting was a prime form of communication that persuaded the people around her to listen more. “I’m still this kind of person who practises for my conversations. Like, if we were roommates and we were gonna have a big talk about the fact that you don’t do the dishes enough, I would practise that conversation in my head a lot, and I would find that putting melodies to my rehearsed conversations and making them rhyme was a better way to remember them.” Negative preconceptions about actors who make music are prevalent, and Hawke hasn’t been immune. She credits her producer and co-writer Christian Lee Hutson (to whom she’s also ) for being “a huge influence in shirking some of the imposter syndrome, though I still have a lot”. “I still have imposter syndrome but it’s gotten a lot better,” says Hawke. “On my first record I really felt like I had to keep the songs completely bare, like only use acoustic instruments and not double my vocal or have any harmonies because I didn’t want anyone to think that I had, you know, ‘bought a record’ – like, hired a producer to make me sound good. If they didn’t like me, I wanted to make sure they knew that they didn’t like and not that they didn’t like the choices somebody else had made. “But I think each record has gotten less constrained by my fear and more playful and more present, and I think it’s just from education. The more you learn, the less afraid you are. Knowledge is power.” Her confidence is present on a warm album that’s more sonically layered than Hawke’s others, with its use of samples, horns, electronics and distortion, inspired by artists she was listening to at the time including Liz Phair, Mazzy Star, Buffy Sainte-Marie, James Blake, and our own Julia Jacklin. “About my first few records, people kept writing that they were sparse,” she says. “And I definitely had a goal to have no one say that this was sparse.” The song , which she’s said “emerged from a major anxiety episode following a soul-shattering break-up”, highlights Hawke’s way with a good line (“I’m your guitar, mute me gently with the palm of your hand”). You can imagine the Notes app on her phone is loaded. “It’s very chaotic,” Hawke admits. “I like to play this game called ‘Notes Roulette’, where you and another person pick a date and you scroll through your phone to find the note you made on that day and you have to read it out loud. Fun game, I highly recommend it,” she adds. “Nothing’s more revealing than a grocery list.” In a recent interview, Hawke said that , the album’s titular track, came out of the mindset she was in while making , a film she did with her father Ethan where she played author Flannery O’Connor. It seems like being in such a space of imagination and creative empathy offers a fertile overlap for songwriting. “I think they work very well together, and I highly recommend that all actors write music,” she says, noting that acting’s a form of “reaching out” to better understand the world, while songwriting is an act of “digging deep” to figure out what you feel and think. Each practice lies in a desire to “express, pursue truth and tell stories”, says Hawke, but she admits, as her music career flourishes, that it’s becoming difficult to juggle both. Is there some sort of plan to how she navigates her career or is she just feeling her way through? “I still audition a bunch and I’ve taken most every good job that’s come my way. I think that a lot of people see the roles that actors choose as, like, intensely reflective on them, and that’s partially true. But also, most actors I know, even really successful ones, are kind of going with the flow and, like, whatever good writing comes their way they want to do, basically,” says Hawke. “I mean, you’d be hard-pressed to find a kind of person that’s more gung ho, ‘put me in, coach!’ than an actor – they’re a pretty excitable group of volunteers.” Having veterans in her corner (yes, Mum and Dad), only helps to a degree. “I think people really overestimate the amount of strategy that goes into an actor’s career, you know?” Hawke jokes. “I mean, it’s a lot of auditioning, taking the jobs that come your way, and hoping that more do. “The advice I get from my parents is always more minutiae-based – ‘I don’t want to do this job but it’s a good job, would I be stupid not to do it?’ or ‘What should I do if I’m having an uncomfortable experience with my scene partner?’ In terms of what projects to do and how to spend your career, that’s mostly 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent instinct.” Her next role will see her playing Anxiety in Pixar’s , a casting stroke that feels inspired considering her public persona – that rare star who appears introverted, slightly uncomfortable with the spotlight. “Wow, is that my persona?” Hawke says. “I don’t feel like that’s who I am as a person. I mean, of course I have anxiety, but I don’t think I have any more anxiety than the average person. In fact, I might be lucky enough to have a little bit less.” OK, but has she ever seen herself on a talk show? There’s a kind of charming, nervous energy there that is a large part of what makes her feel relatable to audiences, despite her atypical upbringing. Is it painful for her to get up on stage, or to see herself on screen? “I mean, I’m not gonna be like, ‘No, I’m totally comfortable on stage!’ I’m totally nervous and excited, and I feel like I want to express myself and I want to be understood, and I’m afraid that I won’t be or that I won’t be good enough. But it doesn’t feel painful, it’s joyful,” says Hawke. “There’s a great David Bowie quote about that: ‘You want to be just deep enough in the water so that your toes don’t touch the bottom’. That’s how I feel. I’m happiest when I’m just deep enough out there into the realm of what scares me that my toes don’t touch the bottom, and I can explore that and just, you know, kick my feet a little.”",

        "description": "A historic marker by an Allentown church was removed while the new owner was closing on it. He wants it back.",
        "content": "The new owners of a former Allentown church were at the closing while a historic marker on the property was removed, and they want it back. The marker was erected in 1932 on the grounds of the ivy-covered Church of the Ascension, located at 16 Linwood Ave., at North Street, by the Buffalo chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, also known as DAR. On May 10, Peter Johnson, DAR's handyman, removed the patinaed marker and the wooden post it was attached to. That happened as the 1872 Gothic Revival-style church's new owner, John Daly, was in a downtown office closing on the Medina sandstone property purchased with his sister Melissa Littlefield for $450,000. A June 21, 2016 photo shows a historic marker on Church of the Ascension property in Allentown that was there for 92 years until its removal May 10 by the Buffalo branch of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The new owner, who closed on the property the next day, wants it returned. Daly learned this because Johnson posted photographs of the removal on the Buffalo Rehab and Reuse Facebook page, writing, \"I've been tasked to remove it by 3 p.m. today,\" a half-hour after the scheduled start of the closing. The posts drew Daly's ire, leading him to file a police report charging DAR with whisking away something that wasn't theirs to take. \"I'm very disturbed that someone on social media bragged about how they stole it, and that they had a certain window of time to steal it,\" said Daly, a managing partner at the engineering and architectural firm Trautman Associates. \"It is bothersome that that person has not been apprehended and the property recovered. It was a downright, sneaky theft.\" Betsy Boundy, who initiated the marker's removal as a board member of the Katherine Pratt Horton Buffalo chapter of DAR, said it belongs to the organization and that the Episcopalian Diocese, which was selling the church, gave permission to take it. The nonprofit, which owns the historic Henry Birge House, also known as the DAR House, a Georgian Revival row house at 477 Delaware Ave., wants to relocate the marker to tiny Tony Sisti Park across from the church. \"Our Daughters of the American Revolution commissioned the marker. That's our marker and we are taking repossession of it,\" Boundy said of the group that claims descendants from supporters of the American Revolution in the late 18th century. But Jennifer Hurley, an attorney representing Daly's lender, said a search of the property's title report found no deed restriction or sale exclusion on file with the property showing DAR owned the marker, giving the group no legal right to it. \"There was nothing in the contract excluding the monument from the sale, and nothing in the title report indicating that there was an exception wherein the Daughters of the American Revolution could retrieve the marker if the church sold to another buyer,\" Hurley said. The sign in the middle of the controversy reads \"GUIDE BOARD ROAD\" on the first line, followed by, \"Directing Pioneers Coming from The East to Black Rock Ferry. Erected by Buffalo Chapter National Society Daughters of the American Revolution, 1932.\" \"If you look at the marker, it says 'erected by DAR' and not 'property of DAR,'\" Daly said. \"It never belonged to them. There is not a shred of evidence that it is DAR property.\" Gwen Howard, chair of the Buffalo Preservation Board, said neither DAR nor anyone else can remove a historic marker without going through proper channels. \"The marker is part of a historic site, and the site cannot be modified without the approval of the Preservation Board,\" Howard said. Daly expects to seek state and federal historic tax credits when the church is redeveloped, and the marker helps make the case for the property's historic value. While a mixed-use development in the former church is a possibility, \"we are in the planning stages, with nothing ruled in or out. We are intending on doing a historic preservation, and the history of the corner is very important to us.\" The former Church of the Ascension, at 16 Linwood Ave., was recently purchased by John Daly and Melissa Littlefield. A historic marker on the property was removed, and they want it returned. If Daly values the historic importance of the sign and wants to keep it on his property, why did DAR feel a need to remove it? Boundy said the DAR learned about the building's sale by accident, when they called the diocese about cleaning the marker. Boundy sought the marker's removal out of concern that the church, which closed in 2015, would be converted into residential housing and the grass where the marker was would become a parking lot. \"There is no parking on North,\" she said. \"If you are building housing units on that complex, then where are people going to park?\" Boundy never spoke with Daly about his intentions before removing the marker. \"The diocese would not tell us who the buyer was,\" she said. Louise Kreiner, DAR's house chair who asked Johnson to remove the marker at Boundy's behest, heard the marker wasn't wanted. \"I think it was going to be tossed by the new owners,\" she said. Johnson said on the Facebook thread that \"the lawn that that marker was on is going to become a parking lot and the church is going to turn into apartments.\" A responder thanked Johnson for \"preserving the marker that the new owner doesn't care about.\" Johnson didn't return phone messages left by The News. In a separate matter, he has been accused by Hurley of fraudulent billing practices in a lawsuit in State Supreme Court. Johnson's counterclaim on defamation was dismissed, with a second claim regarding a bonus still pending, according to court documents. Boundy contacted Fillmore Council Member Mitch Nowakowski, whose district includes Allentown, to see if she could get his help to move the marker to the nearby park. Nowakowski told The News that Boundy told him \"the new developers basically told them to get rid of it.\" All of this has Daly furious. \"They never reached out to me, and I'm very reachable,\" he said. \"It's also very disturbing when you hear accusations about what we plan to do. There won't be parking where that sign is. There is no way you can even put parking there.\" Although Daly never gave the diocese permission for DAR to remove the marker, it turns out his attorney did – but under false pretenses, she said. \"I have not heard anything about the sign,\" Kristina Ramos, Daly's attorney, emailed Donna Hartnett, the diocese's attorney, on May 9, after a second inquiry, on the day before the closing. \"You can have owner remove it.\" Ramos said Hartnett told her the sign was owned by DAR and she had no reason to question it. That was before, she said, she learned the sign was part of the property purchased by Daly. \"The church's attorney misrepresented who owned the sign, most likely as a result of assertions of third parties,\" Ramos said. \"But in the end, the sign belongs to Mr. Daly.\" Ramos said she plans to reach out to Hartnett. \"In the end, we would like the sign placed back because it's going to be maintained as part of the historic value of the building,\" she said. John Ramos, Kristina's husband and partner in the firm Ramos & Ramos, thinks the situation can be resolved in a way that puts DAR's fears to rest. \"Hopefully, this turns out to be a comedy of misunderstandings, and gets worked out amicably in the end,\" he said. Diocese spokeswoman Rebecca Wilson said the diocese went by what DAR presented to the attorney. \"I think everyone with the diocese was acting with the best of intentions,\" Wilson said. Nowakowski said he's ready and willing to help facilitate a resolution, but the whole episode has left a sour taste with Daly, who is inclined to let law enforcement handle it. \"I have heard so many lies from such a simple story, and I believe (my attorney) was deceived,\" Daly said. \"This could have been handled in a very cordial, friendly manner. It's very sad.\" Mark Sommer covers culture, preservation, the waterfront, transportation, nonprofits and more. He's a former arts editor at The News. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

National Gallery of Australia operations and maintenance technician Neve Foxcroft, and chief information officer Jade Carson with Jordan Wolfson's Body Sculpture. Picture by Sitthixay Ditthavong And a growing number of them are women, especially when it comes to robotics and animatronics. For Body Sculpture , an entirely separate team was required to bring it to life once it arrived. The team was led by Sally Brand, senior project manager for complex artistic commissions - a realm of art that's developing at a rapid pace as the parameters around artistic definitions shift and morph. Body Sculpture features two robots - a factory-style mechanical arm, and a metal box with humanoid arms and hands, held captive by a chain. It's a disconcerting work that comes with a content warning and appears to lose control - a kind of statement on the darkness within the human condition. Paradoxically, putting it together involved plenty of planning, control and human intervention - of the tech-savvy variety. American artist Jordan Wolfson with his robotic work Body Sculpture, unveiled at the National Gallery of Australia in December 2023. Picture by Karleen Minney Brand, who has a background in both science and art history, says the art world is appealing to more than just artists and curators. \"Artists and scientists are particularly curious people in the world,\" she said. \"You have to be curious to work in the arts, and you have to be curious to work in STEM. \"But I do love that idea of STEAM, which is the STEM with art ... because you just have to be creative. It's all complex problem-solving.\" She had previously worked with Patricia Piccinini after the gallery acquired her renowned Skywhale hot air balloon, and commissioned a companion piece, Skywhalepapa . Like Wolfson, Piccinini requires large, multi-skilled teams to realise her vision. \"We took a lot of the learnings of when it's an artwork as well a lot of other things into this work on the robot, because it is a work of art,\" Brand said. \"People are running to meet with the technology and regulation that sits around robotics, but also wanting to encourage a lot of creativity in that place as well. It's really fascinating.\" The gallery's chief information officer Jade Carson, who works with the gallery's behind-the-scenes technology infrastructure, said the field for women who want to work in tech was ever-widening. \"People often underestimate the diversity of roles available in technology,\" she said. \"Wolfson's work and the women at the NGA who have helped bring it to life, shows how technology roles have evolved. \"We want people to see that you can align your passion and creativity with your work and that digital works of art are increasing.\" She's leading a Women in ICT panel discussion at the gallery on May 30 celebrating the intersection of art and technology, centring around Wolfson's Body Sculpture , and the various skills that are required to bring a work like this to life. \"If you're a woman in tech, or a girl coming through school, and you want to get into tech, or you want to do art, you can do both,\" she says.

        "description": "Annette King, Yukon's child and youth advocate, is calling for better legal representation for young people involved in court matters. She's also wants her office to be able to review any child deaths that happen in the territory.",
        "content": "Annette King admits that even after nine years as Yukon's child and youth advocate, she still finds many people don't quite understand what she does. \"I think everywhere we go and every time we meet with a different group, or even an individual client or family that comes to our office, we have to explain our role,\" she said. \"And I do think over the last several years, people are getting a broader understanding of what we do, as there's more experiences with our office, more reports that we've released publicly.\" The advocate office was created by territorial legislation passed in 2009. Written into the Child and Youth Advocate Act was a requirement for the all-party Members' Services Board to establish a process to review the act, within five years. Fifteen years later, that review is underway. King spoke to CBC's Yukon Morning host Elyn Jones about the review, and some of the recommendations she's making to update the legislation. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Who have you heard from so far, in this review? We've been talking about this review in my whole term, which is now nine years. So we provide a little bit of input on what we've heard to date, each year in our annual report. And so at the beginning, what we've really focused on was our experiences to date, so what we were hearing from the people accessing our services and the service providers that we'd be working with. And we'd be like, \"OK, so if the act was amended, we'd want to really look at this or look at this.\" And then we worked really closely with youth advisors. So we contracted youth advisory groups. We've had a few different iterations of youth leading the way to review our legislation. They created a youth-friendly version of the legislation so that it made a little bit more sense. We connected really closely with the territorial youth collective as the territorial youth strategy was being developed. Then also we've stayed connected to service providers and First Nation governments throughout the years. Over the last year, I've been really targeting those conversations because I want to make sure that the First Nations governance, as it is intended to be, you know, in parallel to the Yukon government, that that is definitely represented in our legislation. And those conversations have been really deep and meaningful. One of the things that you're asking for is a mechanism to review deaths of children. Why is that so important? When this act came into place in 2009, it was a small little act. And I think that's partly why the review in five years was built into it, it was like, \"let's just start here, let's really get things so that young people have a voice in government services, and then we'll look at building it from there.\" Every other child advocate in the country — and there are 12 — have a child death review mandate. And so it's one of those questions that we've been asking over all of the years to anybody that we talked to about the legislation: how do you see that working? And we've had some great conversations with the coroner and with the death review investigators across the country. We've really looked at what could be a model for the Yukon. And so that's kind of what we're trying to develop. You're also calling for legal representation for children and youth, and better information-sharing. Tell us more about that. So when a child needs legal representation, it's usually three different ways. A youth over 12 that's been charged with a crime would need a lawyer for the criminal investigation. That is already in place really well, through legal aid — every young person who's been accused of a crime has access to legal representation there. In family law, there's two areas that we want to make sure young people of all ages have legal representation to make sure their views and rights are upheld in court. And that is, if there's a court matter regarding the Child and Family Services Act — so their placement, or if their custody is being changed as a result of being in that system — we want to make sure young people are represented in that system. Our office can represent young people in the decision-making and in the case planning. But when it goes to court, we don't have a role. And we want to make sure that that happens. And the other one is, we get so many calls regarding child custody matters and high-conflict custody matters where a parent will say, \"my child needs a view in this process. How do I make sure that happens?\" Our office isn't... we don't have child lawyers that go to court. We actually have a clause in our legislation now that says we can't interfere and impede with the court process. So we're trying to create that access for young people to have legal representation in those big matters where the adults have the, you know, the applicant, the respondent, the court decisions — but the child's voice matters in these things that impact their lives. When will you be presenting your recommendations? That's really up to the Legislative Assembly. I report to an all-party committee, so all three parties are represented on that. They've asked me to provide a submission to them of what we're recommending. I provide recommendations to them every year, but this one will be more fulsome. And we're hoping that we do some more targeted interviews over the summer and get that to them as soon as possible. Yukon ombudsman says territory's Safer Schools Action Plan doesn't go far enough 'Time for some action': Review to look at systemic racism in Yukon education I think we're at a point now where we've had so many conversations — and since I'm talking publicly, I want to thank everybody who's contributed. We've had even a sort of outline of what we're looking at on our website for the last several months. We just want to make sure we're getting it right, or that we're not missing other things. So we're continuing these conversations. Over the last year, I've been doing most of them myself. Like, I just wanna hear it myself 'cause I've been so in this act — like I'm in it, right? And I know what's going on. I've heard all the different stories and I'm putting them all together. And it's been a fascinating process. And I really hope that we'll be able to just advocate even more effectively for children in the Yukon. Can people still have their say? Absolutely. Yeah, this is not even close to done. On our website, we've got it right on the home page . And also on our website there's an e-mail address that people can just click. We have Facebook, Instagram. Or they can just call our office and set up a time to chat. I'm not huge into the surveys because like you said, what is this act? And unless you're in it, you don't really understand what the questions are. So what we've done is we've identified six areas of conversation, so six themes, and we've put like, one-pages on what our experiences are in that, and there's some key questions. So if somebody's really into writing a survey-type of answer to that, we are thrilled to have that. We've already had a few. I find those are good guides to creating the conversation. So, look at the themes and then call me and let's sit down and talk about it, if you have lots to say about it.",

        "content": "Hackers are taking advantage of the Windows launch of Arc browser to trick victims into downloading malware . Arc is a relatively new internet browser , first launched for macOS in the summer of 2023 - and initial feedback from both media and the users was positive enough to prompt the release of a Windows version too. However, at the same time, unidentified hackers were creating websites with typosquatted domains, seemingly identical to the browser’s actual website. They were also creating ads on Google which, due to certain problems the network has, displayed the legitimate website, but redirected people to the typosquatted one. This meant customers who wanted to install Arc on their Windows device, and had used Google to search for it, would find an ad in the very top of Google’s search results page. The ad seemingly pointed to the site’s actual website, but led the victims to a malicious site which offered an infected version of the browser’s installer, hosted on MEGA, for download. Anyone who downloaded this installer would get the browser, but also malware which, according to initial reports, seems to be an infostealer, although confirmation on the malware’s nature is still pending. Hackers are always taking advantage of major events and product launches to try and trick people into giving away sensitive data, or downloading malware. Events such as the FIFA World Cup, Olympic Games, Chat-GPT launch, Windows 11 launch, and others, have all been abused in the past to deliver bad code to people. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The best way to protect against these attacks is to always type the website address into the browser, instead of “just googling” it. If you don’t know the site, be mindful of the search engine results, and always double-check the characters in the address bar before downloading anything. Via BleepingComputer",

        "description": "Pinole resident Jeanne Gibson, 98, helped make history during World War II as a \"Rosie the Riveter.\" On the 80th anniversary of D-Day, she'll be one of about 70 heroes of that conflict honored in France.",
        "content": "PINOLE — Feeling she wasn’t giving enough to the war effort after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Jeanne Gibson — at the time only 18 years old — traded her nursing school life in Minnesota for a welding job in the shipyards of Seattle. Now 98, Pinole resident Gibson will be one of about 70 American World War II heroes honored in France on the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy, eventually leading to the liberation of France and the end of the war. “During World War II, everyone was on the same page. We were working to get it over with so we could get our boys back home,” Gibson said in an interview. “Everybody was just doing what they could. It was great and we were all working together. It was a good time as well as being a bad time because of the war.” The millions of women like Gibson who worked in American shipyards and factories during World War II — many of them stepping into the industrial workforce for the first time while the men who had formerly worked such jobs were deployed overseas — became known as “Rosie the Riveters,” after the song of the same name. The 1942 hit, popularized by several artists, could have been about Gibson herself: “All the day long, whether rain or shine / She’s a part of the assembly line / She’s making history, working for victory / Rosie, the riveter.” Whether or not there was a “real” Rosie on which the song was based is much-debated, but the most iconic image of Rosie the Riveter became the wartime poster by Pittsburgh artist J. Howard Miller of a woman with the sleeve of her industrial blue uniform rolled up, flexing her bicep as she proclaims, “We can do it!” Beginning May 31, Gibson and other honorees will be flown out to the headquarters of American Airlines in Fort Worth, Texas, where they’ll receive a send-off parade before boarding a charter flight to Paris. The trip will culminate in a ceremony on June 6 at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, where more than 9,000 American WWII soldiers are buried. The trip is made possible through a partnership between American Airlines and the nonprofit Old Glory Honor Flight. Gibson, one of only two Rosie the Riveters participating in the event, and a recent recipient of a Congressional Medal of Honor, said she’s excited for the adventure. It’s far from the first in her lifetime though; besides her World War II welding work, she’s also earned a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, as well as a pilot license, and traveled abroad over the decades since. Before moving to Seattle, Washington, to weld warships, Gibson was studying to become a nurse in Minneapolis, having heard the position was in demand during the war. She remembers listening to the radio when news broke about the attack on Pearl Harbor and wanting to be of service. But after two quarters studying nursing, she said she realized the role wasn’t for her. She and a school friend, Esther Harri, landed roles as welders at the Todd Pacific Shipyards in Seattle, working the cold evening shift in their safety helmets, leather overalls, jeans and long underwear purchased with their first checks. Gibson later took on another role making manifests and hatch lists for the Army Transportation Corps’ Embarkation Center in Juneau. Whether welding or filling out ledgers, Gibson said she loved and took great pride in the work. “Without World War II and what happened, I would be an entirely different person,” Gibson said. “It gave me courage to go ahead and I can do it. And it gave me some backbone.” After the war, Gibson moved to San Francisco and then Berkeley. She went on to earn a bachelor’s in psychology, and a master’s and Ph.D. in educational psychology from UC Berkeley, where she also taught multiple sections of educational psychology 101. While writing her dissertation, she also taught science to local schoolchildren and would end up dedicating 30 years of her life to teaching kindergarten through sixth grade. She and Harri earned their pilot licenses and joined a local chapter of the Ninety-Nines, a group for women pilots started by famed flyer Amelia Earhart and 98 others. They traveled the world, socialized with an assortment of friends, and picked up hobbies like weaving and baking. After attending a trip to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii in December of 2023, Gibson was inspired to begin telling her story to hundreds of visitors nearly every Friday at the Rosie the Riveter National Historical Park in Richmond, which honors the contributions of women during World War II. The work is what’s keeping her going, Gibson said, noting she especially enjoys encouraging young girls to fight for what they deserve, including fair pay. “I say don’t limit yourself to what you think you can do,” Gibson said. “You can do it and don’t let them pay you less.”",

        "content": "A Calgary man facing a murder charge after human remains were discovered by firefighters west of the city was in court Monday as lawyers dealt with a conflict issue. Christopher Stack, 39, faces a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Kyle Schuiling, 33. Court records suggest police aren't sure when Schuiling was killed. The offence dates listed on court documents show Stack is accused of murdering Schuiling between April 1 and April 3, 2024. Lawyer in conflict Schuiling's body was found by members of the Tsuut'ina Nation Fire Department as they were extinguishing a grass fire in Rocky View County near Range Road 40 and Township Road 241 early in the morning of April 3. Police charged Stack a month after Schuiling's remains were discovered. Stack was also in court Monday on other, unrelated charges, including possession of stolen property, driving offences and breaching court-ordered conditions. Justice Jim Ogle heard that Andrea Urquhart, Stack's lawyer on his previous charges, cannot act for him on the murder charge because she knew the victim and is in a conflict. Instead, defence lawyer Tonii Roulston will take the case. Stack will be back in court in two weeks.",

        "description": "Unlicensed miners are being arrested for allegedly stealing the country’s lithium, a critical mineral used in batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones and power systems.",
        "content": "Miners work at an illegal tin mining site in Jos, Nigeria on April 3, 2024. Nigeria is seeking to regulate mining of critical minerals, curb illegal activity and better benefit from its mineral resources. Sunday Alamba/Associated Press ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigeria’s government is cracking down on illegal mining, making dozens of arrests of unlicensed miners since April for allegedly stealing the country’s lithium, a critical mineral used in batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones and power systems. The recent arrests come as Nigeria seeks to regulate its mining operations of critical minerals, curb illegal activity and better benefit from its mineral resources. The clean energy transition, a shift away from coal, oil and gas and toward renewable energy and batteries has spiked global demand for lithium, tin and other minerals. Illegal mines are rife in the country’s fledging industry as corruption among regulatory officials is common and the mineral deposits are located in remote areas with minimal government presence. Officials say profits from illicit mining practices has helped arm militia groups in the north of the county. In the most recent arrests in mid-May, a joint team of soldiers and police conducted a raid on a remote market in Kishi, in the country’s southwestern Oyo State. Locals said the market, once known for selling farm produce, has become a center for illicit trade in lithium mined in hard-to-reach areas. The three-day operation resulted in the arrest of 32 individuals, including two Chinese nationals, local workers and mineral traders, according to the state government and locals. Loads of lithium were also seized. Jimoh Bioku, a Kishi community leader, said there had been “clandestine searches” for the mineral at remote sites tucked away in the bush in the past years by Chinese nationals before “they engaged people to dig for them and turned the market into a transit point.” The community was “particularly worried about the insecurity that usually follows illegal mining and that was why we reported to the state government,” he said. China is the dominant player in the global EV supply chain, including in Nigeria where China-owned companies employ mostly vulnerable people leaving Nigeria’s far north – ravaged by conflicts and rapid desertification – to work in mining operations throughout the country. China’s nationals and companies are frequently in the spotlight for environmentally damaging practices, exploitative labor and illicit mining. There have been at least three cases of illegal mining arrests involving Chinese nationals in two months. President Bola Tinubu has repeatedly blamed illegal mining for the worsening conflicts in the country’s north and asked the international community for help to stop the problem, which provides armed groups with the proceeds needed to sustain and arm themselves. The Chinese embassy in Abuja did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on the arrests and claims of illegal operations. But in a statement last year following a report by The Times of London alleging Chinese miners were bribing militants for access, the embassy said it “always encouraged and urged the Chinese companies and nationals in Nigeria to abide by the laws and regulations of Nigeria.” Nigeria is emerging as a new source of lithium in Africa as the world’s largest producers, like Australia and Chile, are unable to fulfill the growing demand worldwide. But illegal activities thrive in Nigeria’s extractive sector, denying the government due revenues, said Emeka Okoro, whose Lagos-based SBM Intelligence firm has researched illicit mining and terrorism financing in northern Nigeria. And the combination of conflict and climate change effects, such as once fertile land rapidly turning into useless arid sand in northern Nigeria, has produced a cheap workforce for mining sites. The arrests of “both Chinese nationals and young Hausa boys from conflict-affected regions underscore a troubling pattern,” Okoro told the AP. “The socioeconomic strain stemming from conflict and the repercussions of climate change has given rise to a vulnerable demographic desperate for survival.” To fight resource theft that causes losses of $9 billion to the government annually, according to the country’s extractive industry transparency watchdog, the West African nation has set up a 2,200-strong “corps of mining marshals” earlier in the year. While existing law enforcement agencies are still combating the problem, the new corps is geared at curbing “the nefarious activities of illegal miners,” said Segun Tomori, spokesperson for the solid minerals ministry. Before the Kishi raid, the mining corps arrested two trucks laden with lithium on the outskirts of the capital Abuja in April. Later that month, the corps raided a location in Karu, Nasarawa State, near Abuja, leading to the arrest of four Chinese nationals and the seizure of tons of lithium. Tomori said the cases are now in court. On April 22, a federal court in Ilorin, in the north-central region, convicted two Chinese nationals for illegal mining and sentenced them to a one-year jail term, although with an option of a fine. Nigeria has long neglected the solid minerals sector, which allows some communities like the northern-central town of Jos — which is tin-abundant — to depend on subsistence mining for their livelihood. For those communities where livelihood is tied to mining, Tomori said the government is encouraging artisanal miners there to form cooperatives and operate legally. Success.

        "description": "Enhance your hi-fi experience with a solid phono preamp. Whether you're an aspiring hobbyist or vetted vinyl collector, our list has options for everyone.",
        "content": "Whether you’re a hi-fi hobbyist or a , one of the best investments you can make for your is a phono preamp. Also known as a phono stage, these mostly compact external preamplifiers take the low signal output created by turntable cartridges and boost it so it's loud enough for the , , or powered speakers to amplify. Some models can even let you fine-tune the sound and output to match a specific cartridge you might be using. While many modern turntables and devices include their own built-in phono preamps, getting your own can give you more control over your sound and even improve it byadding balance, stability, smoothness, clarity and even better sound staging. Certain preamps also include additional features, like the ability to switch between more common moving magnet (MM) phono cartridges and higher-end moving coil (MC) cartridges, should you be getting into more audiophile-level territory. There are hundreds of phono preamps to choose from, so we’ve put together this list of the best models on the market. Our roundup includes options for LP first-timers, audiophiles, and those looking to score a phono preamp for a great price. Rega is well-known for its best-in-class turntables and amplifiers. The Rega Fono MM Mk5 is designed as a phono preamp for the more common MM (moving magnet) cartridges only — you typically only see MC (moving coil) cartridges in higher-end turntables. There is an MC-only version though, the , should you venture into MC territory. The Rega Fono MM Mk5 is affordable, simple to set up and use, and provides detailed and noise-free playback, with just enough punch and energy to reproduce any type of music just as the artist intended. Without getting too bogged down in the minutia of the tech, a phono stage has the job of amplifying the weak signal from the cartridge, yes, but it also must process the equalization standards applied to all vinyl records by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) to produce a tonally even audio signal. What makes the Fono MM Mk5 unique is that it splits the RIAA equalization into two stages — the regular signal path and the RIAA equalization circuits. This separation allows the Mk5 to provide cleaner and distortion-free playback. With a signal gain of around 41 decibels, the Mk5 is comparable to most other phono stages in this price range. Physically, the Fono Mk5 is pretty no-frills and is about the size of a paperback novel. The aluminum case fits in with the look of Rega’s other products. Also, the preamp’s aesthetics will look great amid modern hi-fi setups. While it’s pricier than some of the other products on our list, the Rega Fono MM Mk5 is an excellent choice for beginner LP owners and audiophiles alike. Phono preamps don’t get much more basic than the Rolls VP29, but sometimes simple is all you need. Measuring 3.25 inches wide, 2 inches tall, and 1.5 inches from front to back, the Rolls VP29 is just large enough to house RCA ins and outs, a 3.5mm output, a grounding post, and a power connection. The internal circuitry is designed to deliver fine-tuned playback that matches the RIAA equalization curve, and the VP29 delivers 42 decibels of gain. Keep in mind that this preamp is meant for signal conversion only. If you’re looking for a phono stage with adjustable gain and EQ settings, you’ll want to look elsewhere. In fact, not even the volume of the headphone output can be adjusted. Still, for under $70, the Rolls VP29 Phono Preamp is a plug-and-play winner that gets the job done. The Cambridge Audio Alva Duo is a diverse phono preamp that's good for both older vinyl and new (more on this below). Under the hood, a cutting-edge switch mode power supply reduces hum, and a surface-mounted circuit board further reduces noise for clean and ultra-quiet playback. They’re also connected in a way that prioritizes short signal paths, resulting in fast and precise timing. And consistent with the quality of sound that Cambridge is known for with its , the Duo offers rich, smooth sound with a wide soundstage. The Alva Duo’s subsonic filter and balance control mean that the preamp all but eliminates the low-frequency rumbles that come from scratches and scuffs on a record, as well as those that can come from an unbalanced cartridge. We’re also glad to see a 1/4-inch (6.35mm) headphone jack for private listening. While some users claim the headphone amp isn’t powerful enough, it’s still a thoughtful addition. The Alva Duo only consumes half a watt of power in standby and automatically powers down after 20 minutes of not being used, which saves energy. Pro-Ject Audio makes some of the best turntables around, so it stands to reason that it knows its way around a phono stage, too. The main idea behind the Pro-Ject Phono Box DC (or any phono stage, really) is to deliver a balanced, low-noise signal that is packed with as much precision and depth as possible. Pro-Ject achieves this by implementing high-quality circuitry that cuts down on distortion and other audible issues. It's compatible with both MM and MC cartridge types, and switching between either setup is handled with the simple push of a button. The Phono Box pushes up to 40 decibels for MM cartridges and 60 decibels for MC systems. For less than $150, you’re getting a phono preamp with gold-plated inputs and outputs and dual-mono circuitry for optimized performance. It’s a minimalist piece of equipment that will have no problem fitting in with your other AV gear. While it doesn’t have as many settings as other preamps, the Pro-Ject Phono Box DC is an ideal middle-ground between entry-level phono stages and preamps that cost thousands of dollars. The Musical Fidelity MX-VYNL is a premium phono preamp that sounds refined and detailed, excels at vocals, is deliciously full-sounding, and is even a bit forward (and smooth) in the low end. For its $850 price tag, it should do all that and more for those with premium turntables to pair it with -- and it does. Engineered for well-balanced and detail-focused performance, the MX-VYNL is compatible with MM and MC cartridges. It’s also one of the only phono stages to include both a standard RCA input and a balanced single XLR 5-pin input. Not only does this allow for connecting two turntables simultaneously, but the balanced input allows for much less noise. The MX-VYNL also features RCA outputs, as well as balanced XLR outputs, which are much quieter, but can deliver more precise and fuller sound than the RCA, should you have a compatible amplifier to connect to. The MX-VYNL goes ever further with fine-tuning features, with its dial for switching between MC and MM, and the ability to adjust cartridge impedance to perfectly match any given cartridge. Unlike other phono stages with these controls, you’ll actually be able to adjust settings during playback too. The MX-VYNL is also one of the best preamps for RIAA correction, letting you choose between it and the newer IEC equalization curve. It's definitely more advanced than most of the other phono stages on our list, but if you're heading in the direction of audiophile sound, then a phono preamp like this might be a good place to start. The Fosi Audio Box X2 leans on vintage engineering and delivers big results with its two vacuum tubes that are front and center. Thanks to low-noise integrated circuitry and top-shelf components, the X2 is designed to remove as much low-frequency noise as possible during LP playback, so you’ll always have crystal clear sound. You’ll be able to choose from 39-, 42-, and 45-decibel gain settings, so you’ll never have to worry about having enough power to match your MM cartridge -- but in case you have one that needs a little boost, it's there. We’re also glad to see an onboard tube preamp with a 3.5mm AUX input. Conveniently, the X2’s vacuum tubes can be swapped for other tube models. An excellent feature for hi-fi fans, this means you’ll be able to experiment with different makes and models to get the sound you like for your amplifier and speakers. Developed by legendary master circuit designer John Curl, the man behind the equally legendary Vendetta Research phono preamp, the Parasound JC3+ Phono Preamp is a sturdy, feature-rich component that audiophiles praise for its wide soundstage, realistic imaging, refined detail retrieval, and excellent neutrality. Featuring Vampire 24K gold-plated RCA inputs and unbalanced outputs, as well as balanced Neutrik XLR outputs, all of the JC3+ connections are designed for minimal noise and hum. This same principle carries over to the 24K gold-plated copper traces on the phono module boards. Even the power supplies and AC wires use low-carbon mild steel partitions to deliver the clearest signal possible. The JC3+ also includes an integrated Mono switch for enhancing the quality of older mono LPs, on top of an AC polarity reverse switch for dialing down the hum that many systems generate. Impedance adjustment dials and variable MC, fixed MC, and MM selection options allow for precise pairing with a wide range of moving coil and moving magnet cartridges. The Parasound JC3+ is more of a boutique component than many others, and its price reflects that.

        "content": "TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUND In this November 2016 photo, a Filipino fisherman catches fish as the China Coast Guard patrols Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, a traditional fishing ground for Zambales and Pangasinan fishers. —Richard A. Reyes/Inquirer MANILA, Philippines — Filipino fisherfolk continue to sail in the West Philippine Sea despite China’s intrusive fishing ban there, a unilateral annual policy which the government and analysts deem to be illegal and baseless while also being generally ignored by local trawlers even in previous years. Leonardo Cuaresma, president of the Zambales-based New Masinloc Fishermen Association, on Monday said they were unaware that the ban had already begun. READ: DFA protests China’s fishing ban encroaching West Philippine Sea Beijing’s fishing moratorium in the South China Sea encroaches most of the West Philippine Sea in outright disregard of Manila’s sovereign rights inside its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where it is allowed to explore and manage all the resources as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It already started on May 1, 2024 and is expected to last until September 16, 2024. READ: Chinese ships block convoy’s mother boat from reaching Scarborough “Our pangulongs go sailing [in the West Philippine Sea] everyday [despite the ban],” Cuaresma, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview in Filipino, referring to an indigenous mother boat. Cuaresma, who has sailed in the West Philippine Sea for over four decades, also noted that he, along with hundreds of fishermen, already joined the civilian convoy led by five “pangulongs”—which attempted to reach Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal—also this month when Beijing’s moratorium is already in place. The fishing activities of small bancas and pangulongs during the mission went unimpeded, as witnessed by INQUIRER.net. However, the convoy was blocked to come near the vicinity of Panatag Shoal by 10 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) branded as an “overkill” response. The actions of CCG are in line with Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, even if such a claim has been effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013. Despite CCG’s latest demonstration of authority, a geopolitical analyst noted that Filipino fishermen were able to fish in the West Philippine Sea even in previous years. “Nevertheless, there are still risks of escalation,” Don McLain Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University’s Department of International Studies, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. Gill also said “we have to wait and see” as to how the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. intends to address the lengthy ban. “This uncertainty and concern for miscalculation will likely raise pressures for the Marcos Jr. administration,” Gill noted. “It is likely for Manila to remain cautious and utilize its open channels with Beijing, while simultaneously emphasizing how the illicit and unilateral actions of China continue to derail bilateral ties,” he further said. In an expected move, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), through a diplomatic note, on Monday protested the fishing ban, calling it “illegal” under the “final and binding” 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA would always lodge a protest whenever China announces this yearly moratorium. For Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, the DFA should have completely disregarded China’s unilateral policy. “My personal opinion, we should just ignore it,” Ong said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “By protesting, we acknowledge its existence and inadvertently recognize it even in protest.” But for security expert Chester Cabalza, all other channels, like filing of a diplomatic protest, should be explored to defy Beijing’s policy and assert Manila’s rights in the West Philippine Sea. “This [fishing ban] should be defied,” Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “We should encourage more of our Filipino fishers to continue their fishing rights in our maritime entitlements.” Cabalza further said: “If we submit ourselves to their domestic law, it means that we surrender to their will.” Which, Cuaresma said, the fisherfolk have no plans of doing, as PCG continues to allow the fishermen to sail in the West Philippine Sea. “As long as our government allows us, we will continue to fish and we will not allow our neighboring countries to bully us and interfere with our livelihood,” Cuaresma said.

ALSO READ: Hajj 2024: Gov Yusuf inaugurates first flight of Kano pilgrims According to a statement signed by the spokesman of the party, Hassan Sahabi Sanyinawal, and made available to newsmen on Monday, the party said not fewer than five states have made provisions to support their pilgrims. The statement said, “the party wishes the intending pligrims for the 2024 exercise a safe trip and successful Hajj. “As the first batch of the Sokoto state intending pilgrims will start departing to Saudi Arabia tomorrow, the PDP hereby urges our pilgrims to be good ambassadors of our great state in the holy land and use the opportunity to pray for peace and tranquility and progress in Sokoto State and Nigeria as a whole. “We also wish to remind the governmeng of Sokoto State that it is not too late to emulate other states in Nigeria and provide reliefs on the Hajj for our 2024 pilgrims. “The party notes with concern and sincere amazement, that while governments of states like Rivers have since provided subsidies for their intending Muslim faithfuls to enable them pay the Hajj fare, that of Sokoto State, which the center of the Islamic faith in the country, has remain unconcerned and mute on the issue. “It has come to our notice that so far, the Federal Government and six states in the country have given aide to pilgrims to offset the high fare for this year’s pilgrimage. These are Kebbi, Rivers, Jigawa, Bauchi, Yobe and Kano.” The statement further said, “Sokoto State PDP, wishes to remind the APC regime in our state that all previous administrations, in spite of the lean resources available to them, had provided subsidies to pilgrims towards a successful Hajj, which is one of the pillars of Islam. “We therefore see no reason that the current administration that is enjoying an unprecedented availability of funds, should fail to sustain the noble gesture.”",

        "content": "A resident of a shelter for medically vulnerable people experiencing homelessness is accused of killing a roommate Sunday, less than six months after the facility opened . The 62-year-old woman killed, named in a probable cause affidavit as Stephanie Lynne Hackett Carrasco, was staying at the Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility in Sandy. One of Carrasco’s two roommates woke up from a nap to find her draped in bed sheets, laying under her bed face down in a pool of blood with blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Sandy police arrested another roommate — a 60-year-old woman — on suspicion of murder and tampering with evidence. The Salt Lake Tribune generally does not name defendants unless they have been formally charged with a crime. According to the probable cause affidavit explaining the woman’s arrest, Carrasco was seen on security footage entering the room for the last time, and cameras captured the roommate accused of killing her leaving the room 40 minutes later. The affidavit says the roommate had “her arms full of what appears to be clothing and other personal items.” When the other roommate awoke and saw Carrasco unconscious, she reportedly called emergency medical services. Paramedics declared Carrasco dead when they arrived at the scene. Police noticed spots of blood on a red fanny pack the accused roommate was carrying when she returned to the room. The probable cause affidavit states police had not yet searched the room, but that detectives hoped to look for an object that could have been used to cause the injuries to Carrasco’s head. The roommate who allegedly struck and killed Carrasco declined to make a statement to police without a lawyer. It is unclear if she has retained an attorney. She is currently being held at Salt Lake County jail and has been denied bail. (Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) A room at the Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility in Sandy on Friday, Dec. 8, 2023. A resident there is accused of killing her roommate Sunday. The Medically Vulnerable People Program Facility is located on 9000 South near Interstate 15 in Sandy, in a former EconoLodge motel. The facility is funded by both taxpayers and philanthropy. Michelle Flynn, the director of The Road Home — and organization that helps operate the facility — said in a statement Monday afternoon, “The events ... are tragic, our hearts are with those involved.” “The MVP program provides a safe and supportive environment where residents can rehabilitate from illness by accessing the necessary health care and care management services to find stability to move toward permanent housing and other long-term care solutions,” Flynn continued. “We are unwavering in our commitment to safety, ensuring a welcoming and secure environment for all those who seek refuge with us. We are working closely with law enforcement and other crisis services to support residents and staff. We will continue to work with our community partners to support ongoing needs as they arise.” The Salt Lake Tribune reported in December that the facility was designed to serve 165 people in need of specialized care, and that residents would either have their own rooms or share a room with one other person, depending on their condition. At the time of Sunday’s killing, three women were sharing a room.",

        "content": "VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis used a highly derogatory term towards the LGBT community as he reiterated in a closed-door meeting with Italian bishops that gay people should not be allowed to become priests, Italian media reported on Monday. La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, Italy's largest circulation dailies, both quoted the pope as saying seminaries, or priesthood colleges, are already too full of \"frociaggine\", a vulgar Italian term roughly translating as \"faggottness\". The Vatican did not respond to a request for comment. La Repubblica attributed its story to several unspecified sources, while Corriere said it was backed up by a few, unnamed bishops, who suggested the pope, as an Argentine, might have not realised that the Italian term he used was offensive. Political gossip website Dagospia was the first to report on the alleged incident, said to have happened on May 20, when the Italian Bishops Conference opened a four-day assembly with a non-public meeting with the pontiff. Francis, who is 87, has so far been credited with leading the Roman Catholic Church into taking a more welcoming approach towards the LGBT community. In 2013, at the start of his papacy, he famously said, \"If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?\", while last year he allowed priests to bless members of same-sex couples, triggering substantial conservative backlash. Nevertheless, he delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject any suspected homosexuals. In a 2005 document, released under Francis's late predecessor Benedict XVI, the Vatican said the Church could admit into the priesthood those who had clearly overcome homosexual tendencies for at least three years. The document said practicing homosexuals and those with \"deep-seated\" gay tendencies and those who \"support the so-called gay culture\" should be barred. REUTERS",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Favour Ugwuka’s death: Ebonyi varsity management breaks silence Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport Metro Favour Ugwuka’s death: Ebonyi varsity management breaks silence Published on May 27, 2024 By Casmir Nwankwo The management of Ebonyi State University, Abakiliki, has broken its silence over the death of Miss Favour Ugwuka, a student of the institution. Ugwuka, a final year student of EBSU in the Department of English Language and Literature, allegedly committed suicide in her hostel apartment on Wednesday, May 23, 2024. Addressing journalists on Monday at the institution’s conference room, the Vice Chancellor, Professor Chigozie Ogbu, dismissed claims by the deceased that the accused lecturer was behind her failure. Ogbu’s briefing read in part: “When a student is confident that a lecturer has deliberately marked them down, and they are sure that they passed the exam, what the student does is to complain to the HOD or Dean and request re-marking, which will be sent to the Vice Chancellor’s office. “It is usually sent to another university to re-mark and let us know. Some of them, on very rare occasions, have returned positive, and whatever the student gets here is usually what they get from the other university after re-marking, and that is the process. “If at the last exam, the late student felt that she was marked down by the lecturer, she would have complained to the Dean and asked for re-marking, and the paper would have been sent to another place for re-marking. ‘But from what is seen, it’s not that the student deserves to pass, and she didn’t pass. And from the record, you will find out that this is not the only course that she didn’t pass.” Professor Ogbu further stated that, according to the certified true copy of Ugwuka Favour Chinonye’s results, with the registration number EBSU/2018/89726 for the Department of English Language and Literature, who registered in the year 2018/2019, and that is her 1st year. In her 1st year, she offered 9 courses out of which she failed 3 courses and had a CGP of 1.78. In the 2nd semester of her 1st year, she took 8 courses, out of which she failed 2 and had a CGP of 1.75, thereby having a sessional CGP of 1.76. Professor Ogbu continued, “In 2019/2020, which is her 2nd year, she registered a total of 10 courses. Out of the courses, she was absent in 2 courses: Intermediate English Composition (ENG 215) and Philosophy and Logic (GST 102). She was absent in the 2 courses out of the 8 she wrote, she failed 2. She had a GP of 1.41 in that 1st semester. In her 2nd semester, she registered 10 courses. Out of the 10 courses, she failed 4 and had a CGP of 1.82. Total CGP in her 2nd year is 1.62.” The Vice Chancellor went on to detail Ugwuka’s academic performance in subsequent years, concluding that she had outstanding courses, including ENG 416, which she failed twice.

        "description": "Prominent proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis aired concerns about the \"excessive size\" of Musk's pay deal.",
        "content": "Tesla shareholders should reject CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package, according to proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which singled out the \"excessive size\" of the deal and its potentially negative impact on smaller shareholders. The recommendation from the influential proxy advisory company comes as Tesla is asking its shareholders to vote again on his 2018 pay package after a Delaware judge earlier this year nullified the payout , which was the biggest compensation plan in corporate America. Tesla shareholders are set to vote on the pay package on June 13. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Glass Lewis' recommendation to vote against the pay deal. Proxy advisory firms are relied on by institutional investors to provide research and advice on how to vote during annual and special meetings on public companies' proxy proposals, which can range from executive compensation to corporate governance issues. In Tesla's case, Glass Lewis wrote in a 71-page report, shared with CBS MoneyWatch, that Tesla shareholders risk stock dilution if Musk is granted the massive stock grant, meaning that their shares could be worth less as a result. The proxy advisory firm also noted that Musk is well compensated through his current 12.9% ownership of Tesla, a stake that is valued at about $74 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk doesn't receive a salary from Tesla, but Glass Lewis noted that his shares in the company mean that his interests are already aligned with that of the business. Deadly Tesla crash and burn in Weston 00:27 The value of Musk's current Tesla stake \"challenges the very basis that the 2018 grant as structured and sized was even necessary,\" Glass Lewis wrote. Dilution occurs when a company issues additional stock, which in turn shrinks the proportional ownership stake of pre-existing shares. Under the 2018 pay deal for Musk, Tesla would issue about 304 million new shares, creating a dilution effect of about 9%, the firm said. \"[T]hese concerns are exacerbated by the concentration of ownership in Mr. Musk,\" the report said, noting that Musk would increase his ownership stake to 22.4% if the 2018 pay package were to be approved next month. \"Mr. Musk would be the Company's largest shareholder by a healthy margin.\" It added, \"Given the impact on the holdings of other shareholders, the continued concentration of ownership around Mr. Musk warrants particular attention.\" More from CBS News Fired up about barbecue costs this Memorial Day?

        "description": "Change means that any body of water that meets the state definition of 'public water' will be granted legal protection, even if it isn't on the decades-old state inventory",
        "content": "A new state law expands legal protections for hundreds of miles of Minnesota waterways whose status had been uncertain. In the final days of the session, lawmakers passed language clarifying that a waterway that meets the legal definition is a public water, even if it’s not on a decades-old state inventory. The change was included in an omnibus environment and natural resources budget bill, which Gov. Tim Walz signed into law last week. “This is a backstop to say water courses that meet the definition in state law are water courses that belong to all of us as Minnesotans, and are due these protections that we’ve outlined for public waters,” said Carly Griffith, water program director for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. The bill’s passage followed a lengthy legal dispute over Limbo Creek, the last free-flowing stream in heavily-farmed Renville County. The county board did not require an environmental review of proposed improvements to the upper reaches of the creek, because it wasn’t listed on the public waters inventory. Environmental groups and the Department of Natural Resources argued the stream met the legal definition of a public water, warranting greater protection. A lower court agreed, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld that decision in 2022. In Minnesota, “where water is really central to our identity,” the state has taken an expansive view of what counts as a public water, Griffith said. That definition includes natural and altered waterways with a total drainage area greater than 2 square miles. “So that means it can include streams and creeks that aren’t the Mighty Mississippi River, but that are important to the local communities that rely on them,” Griffith said. She estimates the new law will affect at least 640 miles of waterways across the state. Griffith said there are errors in the state’s public waters inventory, which was created in the 1980s when the technology used to identify drainage areas was less advanced. The new law includes $8 million over the next eight years for the DNR to update the inventory. Some farm groups are concerned the new law could expand legal protections to more waterways and create uncertainty for farmers. Public waters have more regulations, including restrictions on draining and filling, and requirements to maintain vegetative buffers. Pierce Bennett, public policy director for the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, called it “a pretty dramatic expansion” of what could be labeled public waters, leaving farmers “in a little bit of limbo.” “Our view is that this would allow for a lot of waters that aren’t currently under that inventory to just simply be put in,” Bennett said. “And that is concerning.” He said farmers shared their concerns about the bill with legislators throughout the session, and plan to work with state regulators to understand its impacts. “We need to have a greater understanding of what this might mean for the future,” Bennett said.",

        "content": "A new state law expands legal protections for hundreds of miles of Minnesota waterways whose status had been uncertain. In the final days of the session, lawmakers passed language clarifying that a waterway that meets the legal definition is a public water, even if it’s not on a decades-old state inventory. The change was included in an omnibus environment and natural resources budget bill, which Gov. Tim Walz signed into law last week. “This is a backstop to say water courses that meet the definition in state law are water courses that belong to all of us as Minnesotans, and are due these protections that we’ve outlined for public waters,” said Carly Griffith, water program director for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy. The bill’s passage followed a lengthy legal dispute over Limbo Creek, the last free-flowing stream in heavily-farmed Renville County. ADVERTISEMENT The county board did not require an environmental review of proposed improvements to the upper reaches of the creek, because it wasn’t listed on the public waters inventory. Environmental groups and the Department of Natural Resources argued the stream met the legal definition of a public water, warranting greater protection. A lower court agreed, and the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld that decision in 2022. In Minnesota, “where water is really central to our identity,” the state has taken an expansive view of what counts as a public water, Griffith said. That definition includes natural and altered waterways with a total drainage area greater than 2 square miles. “So that means it can include streams and creeks that aren’t the Mighty Mississippi River, but that are important to the local communities that rely on them,” Griffith said. She estimates the new law will affect at least 640 miles of waterways across the state. Griffith said there are errors in the state’s public waters inventory, which was created in the 1980s when the technology used to identify drainage areas was less advanced. The new law includes $8 million over the next eight years for the DNR to update the inventory. Some farm groups are concerned the new law could expand legal protections to more waterways and create uncertainty for farmers. Public waters have more regulations, including restrictions on draining and filling, and requirements to maintain vegetative buffers. Pierce Bennett, public policy director for the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, called it “a pretty dramatic expansion” of what could be labeled public waters, leaving farmers “in a little bit of limbo.” “Our view is that this would allow for a lot of waters that aren’t currently under that inventory to just simply be put in,” Bennett said. “And that is concerning.” ADVERTISEMENT He said farmers shared their concerns about the bill with legislators throughout the session, and plan to work with state regulators to understand its impacts. “We need to have a greater understanding of what this might mean for the future,” Bennett said. ______________________________________________________ This story was written by one of our partner news agencies.

        "content": "Cambodia and China, through the Cambodian Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) and the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), are enhancing cooperation in investigating and extraditing suspects between the two countries. The collaboration was discussed during a meeting between ACU Chairman Om Yentieng and Song Fulong, Secretary of the Commission for Discipline Inspection of the CPC and Chairman of the State Inspection Committee of Guangdong Province, at the ACU yesterday. Song stated that the CPC is committed to integrity, which creates a transparent society, and has a strict anti-corruption system under the supervision of 600 officials in Guangdong. “We have no tolerance for corruption. We continue to promote the fight against bureaucracy, corruption, wastefulness, and inactivity. Our entire political system needs to constantly refine its policies, mechanisms, and regulations to ensure accountability without hesitancy or corruption,” he said. He noted that China and Cambodia share similar anti-corruption procedures, which will further enhance future cooperation in these areas. Yentieng highlighted that the ACU’s strategy against corruption focuses on education, prevention, and enforcement, culminating in legal proceedings. He added that education and prevention constitute 80% of the unit’s efforts, aiming to instill a mindset where individuals “do not want to be corrupt, cannot be corrupt, and do not dare to be corrupt”. The meeting underscored the ongoing commitment of the two nations to strengthen solidarity, friendship, and bilateral cooperation. The Chinese delegation pledged to deepen and improve cooperation within the framework of Guangdong province and the ACU. The Cambodian and Chinese delegations discussed enhancing exchanges and cooperation in investigations, with a joint commitment to strengthen anti-corruption efforts. They also focused on improving cooperation in tracking, arresting, and detaining fugitives. The Chinese side extended an invitation to Yentieng to visit China at his convenience, to foster more robust collaboration in both the short and long term. The Cambodian delegation showcased their operational facilities to the Chinese visitors, including the Complaints Analysis, Polygraph, Operations, Interrogation, and Holding Rooms for suspects or detainees, as well as the Assets and Debt Collection Warehouse of the ACU. Pech Pisey, Executive Director of Transparency International Cambodia (TIC), said previously that the cooperation between Cambodia and China in the fight against abuse of power is beneficial. He noted that China is using anti-corruption strategies to reform the CPC, and these offer valuable insights for Cambodia, especially for the ACU. However, he added that it is important to discern which aspects are applicable given the differences between Cambodia’s democratic system and China’s communist regime. During a meeting between Senate President Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Wang Wentian yesterday, the latter characterised Sino-Cambodian relations as a model of international relations. He expressed gratitude towards Cambodia for its equitable stance on contentious issues such as the South China Sea, Taiwan, and the Xinjiang region, highlighting the importance of these positions in safeguarding the interests of both Sino-Cambodian and ASEAN-China relations. Wang added that although the global situation has changed, relations between China and Cambodia have not.",

        "content": "Naga Chaitanya and Samantha Ruth Prabhu ’s separation in 2021 came as a shock to the entire film fraternity and their devoted fans. Even today, the former couple have fans who wish their reunion, despite knowing that it's a wild goose chase. An old video snippet of the couple is now going viral on social media. The video snippet is from an interview that the actors attended together when they were in the relationship . In the video, Chaitanya and Samantha are seen playing a game. Samantha wore headphones with blasting music, and she had to guess what Naga Chaitanya was saying. As the game starts, Samantha excitedly says, “We are going to play a game where I have to guess what he is saying.” When Samantha wore the headphones, Naga asked what song she was hearing, and Samantha responded, “Some English song, huh?” To which Naga Chaitanya responds, “Cheating. You can hear me.” Later when the volume is increased, Naga tests it once again and says, “You’re not looking good... Okay, you can’t hear me good.” Samantha asks Naga, “Say?” Next when Naga Chaitanya says, “Na Family Joliki Ravodhu”, Samantha guesses it, as “I’m in love with you.” Naga Chaitanya is undoubtedly delighted to hear it and he blushes. The fans of the former couple have shared it on social media. Check out the video here Meanwhile, Naga Chaitanya and Samantha Ruth Prabhu parted ways in 2021. In a statement released on social media, they said, “To all our well-wishers. After much deliberation and thought, Sam and I have decided to part ways as husband and wife to pursue our own paths. We are fortunate to have a friendship of over a decade that was the very core of our relationship which we believe will always hold a special bond between us. We request our fans, well-wishers and the media to support us during this difficult time and give is the privacy we need to move on. Thanking you for your support.”",

        "description": "From tickets to food to hotel to parking, families need hundreds of dollars to afford the Disney \"magic.\"",
        "content": "ORLANDO, Fla. — It's the \"most magical place on Earth\" but what's the actual cost of all that Disney magic ? For many families, a trip to one (or several) of Walt Disney World's four Florida theme parks — the Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom — is a dream vacation. But in order to make those dreams a reality, knowing the price tag before being transported to a \"whole new world\" is key. We found an average family of four could spend at least $800 for just one day at one of the Orlando-area parks. Here's a deep dive into the current average cost of a Disney World vacation for a family of four. Tickets Currently, the price for a standard, single-day ticket to any of Walt Disney World's four theme parks starts at $109. That doesn't account for extra fees, taxes, holidays or park hopper options. It's also important to note each park can be priced differently, depending on the day. Typically, the highest prices are for the Magic Kindom and Hollywood Studios while EPCOT and Animal Kingdom tend to be lower. Single-day prices can range from $109 to $189, according to Disney's booking website. Disney does have a couple of offers for multi-day ticket packages that drop the price of a single-day ticket slightly, depending on which option you choose. Florida residents can save a little more on these multi-day ticket packages. Single-day ticket: $109+ Annual pass: $1,449 Florida resident Discover Disney 3-day ticket deal: $219 Total average single-day ticket cost for a family of four at a Walt Disney World theme park: $464.36 - $805.16 after taxes. Again, this does not account for a multi-day ticket bundle, or additional features or perks. Reservations: Depending on what type of ticket you have, you may need to reserve your spot before heading to the theme park. To see if your ticket requires a reservation, click or tap here. Discounts: Discounted tickets can be purchased for members of different businesses and organizations, including GOVX , AAA , AARP , Costco , and Sam's Club . Food & drink Whether you're staying for a single day or strapping in for an extra-long vacation at Disney, staying fed and hydrated is essential, especially in the hot Florida sun. According to Disney's website , food items can range from $15 to more than $60 per person. According to travel blog Mickey Visit , it's not unusual to spend anywhere from $50-$80 per person during a typical day at a Disney World park. For a family of four, that equates to between $200-$320 per day for food. For drinks, Mickey Visit says non-alcoholic drinks average about $5 and $12 for alcoholic ones. Guests who book a Disney resort hotel package can also buy a dining plan. Those plans, depending on which option you choose and the duration of your stay, appear to range from between $60-$100 per person each day. You can get more information by clicking or tapping here . Hotel Even if you are a Florida resident, many Disney World parkgoers don't live super close to Orlando, meaning a hotel stay even overnight needs to be factored into the cost of a Disney trip. Of course, Disney offers several resorts and hotels — more than 30— for guests. For a standard room at a Disney hotel or resort, the average per-night stay for a family of 4 ranges from under $200 to over $900. Depending on the time of year, those prices can fluctuate even more. For those looking outside Disney property, hotel prices near the theme park start as low as around $100 per night. Parking If you and your family are staying at a Disney World resort, parking is typically complimentary, except at certain locations. But if you're coming from off Disney property, the standard parking at Disney's four theme parks is $30 per day and preferred parking is $45, $50, or $55 per day. Disney Genie+ If you and your family are banking on riding your favorite rides, getting Disney Genie+ may be your best option. This replaced the old FastPass system back in 2021. While prices vary depending on the attraction and dates, the service per ticket starts at $15. How much will a Disney vacation cost a family of four? Adding all the lowest-option costs, here's how much an average 1-day stay at Walt Disney World would be for a family of four. This total does not include airfare. Tickets: $464.36 Food & drink: $200 Hotel: $100 Parking: $30 4 Disney Genie+ passes: $15 Average 1-day grand total: $854.36",

        "content": "Residents in Fort Nelson are returning home after being evacuated from the community for more than two weeks due to wildfires. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded their evacuation orders at 8 a.m. on May 27, lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. “(The) alert will remain in effect until such time as the risk has been eliminated,” the statement says. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelsonon May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at FortNelson General Hospital are resuming. “The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,” the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality’s mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what’s expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online on May 26, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a “tremendous amount of fire” in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Mr. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. “The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It’s had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,” he said. “And it’s not just lightning that’s going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that’s giving us a lot of challenges.”",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” ___ This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling.

Airport operations director Phillip Elchitz says that in order for YLW to meet its increase in passengers, additional flights have been added. \"We are looking at a really robust schedule for 2024.\" \"We have an increase in traffic and flights to Winnipeg... we are going direct to Winnipeg this year, we are going direct to Regina, Saskatoon, and we have seen a number of increases to all of our other routes, particularly Toronto. We are going to have three flights this summer going to Toronto on Flair, Air Canada, and WestJet.\" YLW is projecting that 2.17 million passengers will arrive and depart this year. \"We are going to have a record year over 2023, which was bigger than 2019, so we have fully recovered. We actually have more seats now in our market than we had pre-COVID, and that just shows that there is a lot of demand,\" Elchitz said. Throughout the busy summer season, YLW is encouraging travellers to do what they can at home before heading to the airport. \"Check in online. Get your ID checked in online, pay any fees that you might have, do your seat selection, and then get to the airport two hours early,\" Elchitz added.",

Airport operations director Phillip Elchitz says that in order for YLW to meet its increase in passengers, additional flights have been added. \"We are looking at a really robust schedule for 2024.\" \"We have an increase in traffic and flights to Winnipeg... we are going direct to Winnipeg this year, we are going direct to Regina, Saskatoon, and we have seen a number of increases to all of our other routes, particularly Toronto. We are going to have three flights this summer going to Toronto on Flair, Air Canada, and WestJet.\" YLW is projecting that 2.17 million passengers will arrive and depart this year. \"We are going to have a record year over 2023, which was bigger than 2019, so we have fully recovered. We actually have more seats now in our market than we had pre-COVID, and that just shows that there is a lot of demand,\" Elchitz said. Throughout the busy summer season, YLW is encouraging travellers to do what they can at home before heading to the airport. \"Check in online. Get your ID checked in online, pay any fees that you might have, do your seat selection, and then get to the airport two hours early,\" Elchitz added.",

        "description": "The Nets will need some patience or some luck — or both — in order to reemerge as a legitimate contender in the East.",
        "content": "The Nets were a top-six seed in the Eastern Conference in 2022-23, but that was largely due to the work of a pre-trade-deadline roster led by Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving . After trading away Irving on Feb. 6 (an injured Durant was moved three days later), the team went 13-17 down the stretch and was swept out of the playoffs in the first round by Philadelphia. Those second-half and postseason results accurately reflected the level of the new-look roster, which underwent only marginal changes during the 2023 offseason. So it came as no real surprise that after hovering around .500 for much of the first half of this past season, Brooklyn eventually fell out of play-in contention, even in a weak Eastern Conference where the No. 10 seed finished with 36 wins. The team’s 32-50 record in 2023-24 wasn’t far off from its pace to finish the previous season. While the Nets have some talented young players on their roster, none appear to be on a fast track to superstardom, so roster changes will be necessary to increase the team’s ceiling. But there’s no simple path to legitimate upgrades — Brooklyn is capped out this summer and doesn’t own a 2024 draft pick. Going in the other direction and bottoming out in the hopes of landing a future star in the 2025 or 2026 draft isn’t really a viable path either, since the Nets don’t control their own first-round draft pick until 2028. As a result of the 2021 trade for James Harden , Brooklyn owes the Rockets its unprotected first-rounder in both 2024 (No. 3 overall) and 2026, along with swap rights in 2025 and 2027. The situation isn’t quite as dire as it was for a few years in Brooklyn after the team’s misguided decision to mortgage several years of draft assets in a deal for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce, which lined up the Celtics to draft Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in consecutive years. But the Nets will need some patience or some luck — or both — in order to reemerge as a legitimate contender in the East. The Nets’ Offseason Plan Mikal Bridges is the best player – and asset – on the Nets’ roster, but he was miscast as a No. 1 option in 2023-24. His play declined in the second half, and while he’d never ask for a night off (he hasn’t missed a single game since entering the league in 2018), the veteran forward probably wouldn’t mind facing a little less defensive attention going forward. Bridges averaged just 15.7 points per game on 39.9% shooting in his final 31 games of the season. Bridges makes perfect sense as the second or third option on a contending team, slotting into a role like the one OG Anunoby played for the Knicks — he can make three-pointers and handle challenging defensive assignments, but he’s better off as a secondary scorer, not as someone who constantly has the ball in his hands. Whether Bridges ends up in a more appropriate role in Brooklyn or elsewhere is the question. As noted above, the Nets don’t have cap room or draft picks this summer, so the only way to turn Bridges into their No. 2 option in 2024-25 would be to trade for a star. That scenario isn’t out of the question. Despite not controlling their own draft picks in the coming years, the Nets have an excess of future assets from other teams — namely Dallas and Phoenix — as a result of last year’s Irving and Durant trades. They also have a huge salary-matching piece in Ben Simmons , who will make $40.3M on an expiring contract in 2024-25. Brooklyn has frequently been linked to Donovan Mitchell and could certainly be a player in the bidding for the Cavaliers guard or another star who hits the trade market this summer. I’d question whether that’s the right approach though. Mitchell – or an equivalent star – would certainly make the Nets a better team, but he wouldn’t make them a legitimate title contender, and the cost (not only in trade assets but in the form of a long-term maximum-salary contract for the incoming star) would limit the club’s ability to pursue further upgrades. Team owner Joe Tsai recently talked about taking a “longer-term approach” to team-building, and the hiring of a player development specialist like Jordi Fernandez as Brooklyn’s new head coach suggests the organization isn’t looking to take big swings after a 32-50 season unless a can’t-miss opportunity falls into its lap. I’d be surprised if the Nets make a blockbuster win-now deal this offseason — it makes more sense to build up the roster patiently and incrementally like they did the last time they went through a retooling process without their own draft picks. Of course, there is another potential route available to the Nets: Bridges would have significant value on the trade market. Head of basketball operations Sean Marks and his front office have been adamantly opposed to trading Bridges despite reportedly receiving strong offers ever since they acquired him last February, and I understand that stance. His skill set is a coveted one and he’s proven he can play big minutes on a championship contender, having been a full-time starter for the Suns team that got within two wins of a title in 2021. You don’t want to trade that sort of player. Plus, as we noted earlier, making next year’s roster even worse wouldn’t benefit the Nets from a draft perspective as long as they don’t control their picks. But what if they did control their picks? The Rockets, who have prioritized two-way players since Ime Udoka‘s arrival last spring, reportedly covet Bridges and were said to be prepared to put a strong offer on the table for him at February’s trade deadline. Could it be in the Nets’ best interest, long-term, to consider a Bridges deal with Houston that would return their own 2026 pick and eliminate those 2025 and 2027 swap rights? Even if this year’s No. 3 pick isn’t included in the package (it could be), regaining control of those future picks would put Brooklyn in position to properly rebuild with valuable lottery picks in the next year or two. They could take the rebuild a step further by also entertaining trade offers for wings Dorian Finney-Smith and Cameron Johnson , both of whom would hold real appeal for playoff teams. There’s no simple answer here for the Nets. While negotiating with the Rockets makes some sense on the surface, Houston would presumably recognize that Brooklyn’s own first-round picks are more valuable to the Nets than another team’s first-rounders would be, which would give the Rockets added leverage in any trade talks. And is Marks’ job security strong enough — after he was given the chance to hire his fourth head coach this spring — that he’d be willing to take another step backward by hitting the reset button again? I’m skeptical, which is why I consider Bridges more likely than not to open the 2024-25 season as a Net. The decisions the Nets make on the trade market could have a huge impact on the franchise, but the front office has the option of simply taking a wait-and-see approach on that front. That’s not the case in free agency, where starting center Nic Claxton will become an unrestricted free agent this summer, giving him the ability to leave Brooklyn without the team getting any compensation. The Nets will do all they can to avoid that happening, which might mean going up to $25M per year — or even a little higher — to retain the young big man, who has emerged as a reliable rim protector and rebounder up front and still might have his best years ahead of him. Fernandez and Marks didn’t do themselves any favors in their upcoming negotiations with the 25-year-old by declaring last month that they believe he’s a future Defensive Player of the Year, but he would’ve been in line for a major payday anyway. For what it’s worth, Jarrett Allen signed a five-year, $100M free agent contract back in 2021 when his résumé wasn’t all that dissimilar to Claxton’s and a $20M salary represented about 17.8% of the cap. Three years later, 17.8% of the projected 2024-25 cap would be almost exactly $25M. The Nets will also have contract decisions to make on Cam Thomas and Day’Ron Sharpe , though there’s less urgency in those cases — both Thomas and Sharpe are extension-eligible beginning this July, but would be on track for restricted free agency in 2025 if no deal is reached before the 2024-25 regular season begins. As long as Brooklyn is able to re-sign Claxton, I wouldn’t count on a new deal for Sharpe this offseason. Big man Noah Clowney flashed real promise toward the end of his rookie season, and if he continues to improve, he could push Sharpe for the role of Claxton’s primary backup next season. The Nets may want to see more from both players before deciding in 2025 whether to invest long-term in Sharpe. Thomas is a trickier case. He’s a genuinely gifted scorer, having racked up 22.5 points per game in his third NBA season, but he doesn’t do much else on offense and has been a subpar defender. His ability to put the ball in the basket is valuable, but Brooklyn will likely be reluctant to break the bank on a player whose game outside of that one skill is so limited. It wouldn’t surprise me if the two sides have a hard time bridging the gap between the contract the Nets are comfortable offering and the one Thomas will seek. It’s also worth noting that if the Nets simply keep Simmons’ expiring contract on their books for the 2024-25 season and don’t add any long-term money to their cap besides Claxton, they’ll be well-positioned to create real financial flexibility a year from now, when Simmons’ $40M+ and Dennis Schröder ‘s $13M contract end. Locking up Thomas early would cut into that room, assuming his next deal starts above his projected 2025 cap hold of $12.1M. That’s another argument in favor of holding off on a new deal for the 22-year-old until next year. Salary Cap Situation Guaranteed Salary Ben Simmons ($40,338,144) Cameron Johnson ($23,625,000) Johnson’s cap hit includes a $22,500,000 base salary and $1,125,000 in likely incentives.

        "content": "The first “Golden Dragon 2024” exercise between the Cambodian and Chinese navies ended yesterday, while the sixth army exercises will end on Thursday. Major General Thong Solimo, Deputy Director of Information and Communication at the General Command and spokesman for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), said yesterday that “The exercise for the navies was completed yesterday, while the exercise for the two armies is scheduled to end on Thursday.” “On the final day of the Golden Dragon 2024 exercise both troops will hold a a grand finale at the Military Police Training Centre in Samakki Meanchey district in Kampong Chhnang province,” he said. “The exercise is aimed at exchanging experiences, maintaining cooperation, increasing trust, and further developing the relations between the two armies and navies,” he said. The remarks were made during the closing ceremony of the naval exercise which was presided over by Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the RCAF and Chairman of the Exercise Committees with China General Ith Sarath and Major General Gao Xiucheng, Assistant Chief of Staff of Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theatre Command, at Ream Naval Base in Preah Sihanouk province yesterday. Maj Gen Solimo, said that Gen Sarath emphasised that the current naval exercises were not a threat to any country, and that it aimed to exchange experiences between the two navies in order to increase the capacity of both and combat terrorism on the sea. According to Maj Gen Solimo, Gen Sarath also gave instructions to the Cambodian and Chinese navies to continue to pay attention to cooperation in all fields and exchange experiences with each other to increase professional skills and gain knowledge on military technology. Gen Sarath said the two sides must continue to promote solidarity, friendship, and strategic cooperation between the leaders of both countries, adding that the two armies set out to build common cooperation and a common destiny. A statement from the Chinese National Defence Ministry said on Saturday that the Chinese troops participating in the China-Cambodia “Golden Dragon 2024” joint exercise dispatched a medical unit to carry out free health treatment at a local health centre in Kampong Chhnang province on Wednesday last week. The Chinese medical unit consisted of 20 medical staff members, including nine specialists in orthopedics and endocrinology. On Wednesday morning, the team treated more than 300 locals with on-site diagnosis and treatment, and distributed more than 500 boxes of medicines, it said. The Chinese troops visited a local school and donated educational material to the teachers and students on May 20, it said. “These two charitable activities were an important part of the joint exercise, aiming to further enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries,” the statement added. Thong Mengdavid, Geopolitical Analyst and Lecturer at the Institute for International Studies and Public Policy (IISPP) at the Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), said yesterday that the joint Cambodian-Chinese naval exercise is aimed at expanding military cooperation between the two navies, as well as increasing preparedness to maintain order, stability, and security of maritime space in the region. The exercise will promote the exchange of information and experience, the development of skills and training for both troops, as well as the testing and sharing of new technologies with each other, he said. “During the context of international security and the rise of transnational crime in the region, Cambodia has always focused on maintaining security and regional order,” he said. “Cambodia is always involved in international security cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations and under the framework of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well,” Mengdavid added. The army drills are taking place over a 15-day period, and for the navies, over 12 days. They involve over 2,000 Cambodian and 760 Chinese soldiers, and feature a variety of military hardware, including 14 warships, helicopters, robotic dogs, and armoured vehicles.",

        "description": "Quebec provincial police confirmed they're investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling.",
        "content": "Jonathan Fortin woke up Friday morning to check on his herd of Black Angus cattle, only to find his field was empty. Fortin, who co-owns Ferme For Thé in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, said he initially thought his calves and cows might have got loose, but the presence of tire tracks and a fence that appeared to have been dismantled led him to conclude that something more sinister had occurred. “All my herd — close to 75 animals — were stolen,” he said in an interview Monday. Quebec provincial police confirmed they’re investigating what appears to be a case of modern cattle rustling. Police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel confirmed police opened a criminal investigation after arriving at the farm in Cookshire-Eaton, Que., on Friday and finding the cattle had “disappeared.” Ruel didn’t say how police were planning to retrace the herd, but he noted the thieves would need to have access to equipment and a place to put the animals. Story continues below advertisement “You can’t move that many livestock in a Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla,” he said in a phone interview. 2:29 Health Matters: CFIA steps us avian influenza surveillance Fortin figures the cattle were taken between 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, while he was out working his second job. He said neighbours later reported seeing trailer lights and hearing a commotion in his field, but at the time they assumed it was buyers coming to pick up cattle. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. He said the loss of about $200,000 worth of livestock represents a good portion of his savings and four hard years of work building up his farm. “There’s a lot of emotion, because even if it’s a new business, it’s still all the work and the life savings,” he said. “To have a herd of that size, there were a lot of sacrifices that were made, it means sometimes working two jobs, things like that.” Story continues below advertisement Fortin says it isn’t easy to load dozens of cattle into trailers, but it’s not impossible for someone with experience. He said the animals are marked by tags, but he believes thieves would be able to remove them. While he’s heard stories about stolen cattle, he never thought his entire herd could be taken all at once. He said thefts usually involve individual calves that are taken by people who want to raise them for meat. Fortin is still hopeful police will be able to find his lost animals, which weren’t insured against theft. If not, he says he’ll have to rebuild his herd two or three animals at a time, while pushing back his plans to give up his second job to farm full-time. “For sure it’s very difficult physically, and even more so morally, because we’re restarting at zero,” he said.

        "description": "She has learned about different cultures and is grateful the diversity has taught her.",
        "content": "Leavitt Area High School senior Tamara Rusakovich has attended several different schools and said she has been exposed to diverse cultures along the way. Russ Dillingham/Sun Journal TURNER — Leavitt Area High School senior Tamara Rusakovich, 18, has the kind of perseverance and determination that inspires others around her, Principal Eben Shaw said. An engaged member of the high school and community, she helped raise money for local youth athletics by selling clothes donated to her and donating the leftovers to local clothes closets, he said. It is one example of the ways she has affected her community. “She’s been a great student here at Leavitt and I have no doubt she will be equally impactful at Colby next year,” he said. Attending several different schools, Rusakovich said she has learned there is a much larger world or different cultures and ways of life beyond where one attends schools or the town they are raised in. “I will always be grateful for these schools teaching me different ways of life, being exposed to different cultures and diversity, but for also teaching me how to advocate for myself in an unfamiliar place — finding my independence,” she said. Best part of each day? The best part of each day is being able to talk to my biggest support system here at Leavitt. The teachers, whether it be lunch talks or just saying hi in the hallways, and the relationships I have built with teachers here have brightened my worst days at school. Worst part of each day? I think the worst part of each day is being in those particular classes with students who don’t care about their education. It’s hard to see the contrasting classes of honors to regular and the disrespect many teachers have to endure. When kids start to disrespect the learning of other students because they don’t want to learn, it’s hard to find motivation to perform in those classes. Favorite class or subject? Why? My favorite classes/subjects throughout school have been literature and government. In these classes, you have the freedom to think individually, critique, analyze, and form your own conclusions. In typical math and science classes, there is one answer and one answer only, whereas in government and literature, you have moments in class to talk and debate with your classmates, to form your conclusion on an idea or theme. I just love that freedom of thought and not having to be perfect all the time. I never knew I would find such a passion for government since so many aspects within government have made me upset but I have found a huge passion for learning about government so that I can properly defend myself and hopefully one day advocate for others, through better knowledge of government ideals. Favorite teacher or school staff member? Why? The teachers who have made the biggest impact on my adjustment here at Leavitt are Mrs. Marcotte, Mr. Cifelli, Mrs. Talbot and Mr. Strong. These teachers have given me a sense of community, understanding and support. With everything I have been through in the past few years, I can always count on Marcotte or Cifelli to talk to and support me. Strong and Talbot offer a safe space for me to talk but also to make mistakes without feeling guilty. Their classrooms have become places where I may have struggled but I could see myself grow in my time there and my time getting to know them. These teachers will be the teachers I remember for a lifetime with how much they have helped me to open up. What was the hardest part of high school and how did you find your way through it? The hardest part about high school was the feeling of loneliness. Moving to three new schools, one of which being in a new state with 2,000 kids, it is easy to just be swallowed up by the crowd. Or moving to a small school where everyone has grown up together, meaning you’ll never really be accepted. One year leaves no time for you to truly find your place and leave a mark at a school. The hardest conclusion I had to come to was that I couldn’t rely on anybody anymore and at times I only had myself and I had to advocate to have my voice heard. Though, it has been a really good experience to learn more about myself as well as find my voice and be a little louder. And although it’s hard to find your people when moving, once you do find that select group, it’s worth it. How do you think you’ll be remembered by the members of your class? I’m not sure how I will be remembered at Leavitt or in my class but I have been told many times that I have made a huge impact at Leavitt for the better and that is my only goal in life, to make a difference and make someone’s life better. I think I have accomplished this by starting an outing club, raising awareness about sustainability and just trying to spread positivity. However, I don’t want people to remember me for these things that I did, I’d rather have them remember what they learned from those things and hopefully carry on the difference I may have made. Something you wish teachers and administrators understood about students today? Something I wish teachers and administrators knew about students today is that life is hard for everyone out there right now. Although this older generation believes that our generation is weak, we have to endure so many more things that affect our mental health differently, social media being a huge factor. I also believe that students nowadays are held to such high expectations and it is engraved into our minds that we are failures if we make one mistake. Everyone is going through something and we all handle it differently. So just be aware, be understanding, and help kids succeed rather than trying to fail kids. If I didn’t have those teachers to see my full character through a lot of tough times at home, I wouldn’t be where I am now. Some kids just need to feel understood in this craziness of the world nowadays. Advice to all those eighth graders entering high school next year? One piece of advice I have for freshman next year, and honestly anybody at Leavitt. Don’t conform to the crowd. Find yourself, find what you stand for and don’t settle for anything that makes you less than happy. Something I notice with incoming freshmen is that it is almost forced upon everyone to join a sport or a club. You don’t need to conform to the very few sports or clubs here at Leavitt. If you have other hobbies or interests, pursue those instead of devoting time to something you don’t love. Start a club of your interest! I wish I attended Leavitt longer to get more people involved in our outing club. Just do what makes you happy, not what makes other people happy. If I never took my own initiative and only listened to others I wouldn’t be where I am today. I still have regrets about passions I never pursued and opportunities I lost, so never let expectations or people hold you back. What is next for you after graduation? My plan after high school is to attend Colby College and pursue Environmental Policy and Government. I want to make a difference in the world and help advocate for basic human rights and the environment.

        "description": "Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel faced new condemnation Monday for strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah that local health officials said killed at least 45 Palestinians, including displaced people living in tents that were engulfed by fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there had been a “tragic mistake” and that Israel was investigating. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas , with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Israel said it was looking into the civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. In a speech before Israel’s parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that “despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake. We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers “pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. France, a close European ally of Israel, said it was “outraged” by the violence. “These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told Italy's SKY TG24 news channel. Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighboring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a “new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.” Jordan’s Foreign Ministry called it a “war crime.” The Israeli military’s top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur “in a war of such scope and intensity.” Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . ___ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "The boohoo share price has seen a rocky few years, but with signs that the economy is improving, could this be a buying opportunity?The post Potentially 34% undervalued, should I be watching the boohoo share price? appeared first on The Motley Fool UK.",
        "content": "( ), the online fashion giant known for its trendy styles and targeted marketing, has experienced a roller-coaster ride in recent years. Once a darling of the stock market, the boohoo share price has plummeted over 20% in the last year alone. But is this a sign of a sinking ship, or a buying opportunity for savvy investors? What’s going on? Analysts are divided. While the company has undoubtedly faced challenges, some see reasons to make this a stock well worth watching. boohoo’s recent woes can be attributed to a confluence of factors. In November 2023, the company issued a profit warning, citing a slowdown in consumer spending and rising costs. The primary demographic, young adults aged 16 to 45, were reportedly feeling the pinch of inflation and were cutting back on discretionary spending like clothing. Furthermore, the fast-fashion industry itself has seen some other major headwinds in recent years. Consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious and are shifting towards sustainable clothing options, away from fast fashion. Boohoo’s business model, built on mass production of trendy garments at low costs, might not resonate as strongly with this new wave of eco-conscious shoppers. As a result, the share price has plummeted over 85% in the last five years. Signs of hope Despite the current gloom, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic. Firstly, analysts predict annual earnings growth of a whopping 80% over the coming years. Admittedly, there still aren’t any signs of profit for the foreseeable, but a long-term investor may be rewarded if this trend can continue. Secondly, the company is adept at using social media and influencer marketing to reach its target audience. In the ever-evolving retail landscape, this could be a massive growth area. The third, and most interesting factor to me is the potential valuation. A calculation suggests the firm is about 34% undervalued. Although this isn’t a guarantee, with this much potential, I’d consider some more digging into the well worth doing. At present, debt levels seem to be under control. Also, there is a solid reserve of cash available, but as the sector has seen in the past, such resources can disappear very quickly in the wrong environment. Risks remain Before jumping on the bandwagon, it’s important to acknowledge there are still plenty of concerns that have dogged the company in recent years. There have been accusations of poor working conditions in its supply chain. These controversies can damage the firm’s reputation and seriously alienate consumers who value ethical practices. Moreover, boohoo faces stiff competition from established players like and emerging rivals like PrettyLittleThing. The online fashion market is crowded, and boohoo will need to innovate and adapt to stay ahead of the curve. Am I buying? The potential upside in the boohoo share price is certainly enticing. But it’s important to remember that this is just a calculation, and the stock price could easily go down further. For long-term investors who believe in the firm’s ability to overcome its challenges and adapt to the changing retail landscape, then the current share price might be an attractive entry point. However, I still don’t have much confidence that these can be resolved any time soon. I’ll be staying well clear for now.",

        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris played Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev and lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09.",

        "description": "Turkish capital hosts ‘Hamas festival,’ with clerics and political leaders praising the October 7 massacre and openly expressing anti-Jewish bigotry.",
        "content": "Sami Al-Arian, an academic deported from the US a couple of decades ago after pleading guilty to providing services to the (PIJ), shared a stage in a panel discussion with a high-ranking member of the terror organization Hamas, Jamal Issa, during a conference held in Istanbul last week. The conference was titled “The Flood of the Free” as a homage to Hamas’s October 7 massacre, named by the radical terror group “Flood of Al-Aqsa,” with the conference logo featuring two paragliders referring to the terrorists who on their bloodthirsty quest to murder, rape and kidnap over 1200 Israelis and foreigners on October 7. Other also took part in other sessions during the two-day event, including Osama Hamdan, Sami Abu Zuhri, as well as Khaled Meshaal, who sent a pre-recorded blessing to the conference. The main host of the event was the Global Campaign to Support Al-Quds and Palestine (GCQP), an Istanbul-based organization pertaining to the Muslim Brotherhood axis, with close organizational and ideological ties to the Al-Quds Foundation, designated as a Hamas proxy by both the US and Israel. Other hosts included Turkish NGO “Human and Civilization Movement,” as well as the Al-Baraka Society, a charity organization led by Algerian Muslim Brotherhood cleric Ahmed Brahimi. According to the organizers, the conference saw participation of hundreds of people from dozens of countries, from Pakistan to Yemen to Morocco. Several speakers in the conference expressed openly antisemitic views, including Mohammad Ibrahim, preacher at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron, who denounced “the Jews among the Arabs” and pointed at the Talmud as a motivation for the “burning of Gaza;” as well as Iraqi Sheikh Waleed Al-Husseini who praised Iraq’s struggle “against the Jews” ever since the time of Nebuchadnezzar, also praising the missiles shot by Saddam Hussein at Israel during the first Gulf War. Likewise, former justice minister of Mauritius, Rama Valayden, claimed that Israel “only understands the language of money,” calling to boycott international firms such as McDonald's, KFC, Coca-Cola, and even Head & Shoulders, alleging that they “support the Israeli army and Netanyahu.” A similar event was held one day later, as another Istanbul-based Islamist organization named the Palestine Scholars Association (PSA) held a conference titled “The Nation's Religious Scholars and the Flood of the Free,” which saw the participation of Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk. Notedly, PSA itself is led by Nawaf Takrouri, named a member of Hamas’s founding generation, who was deported by Israel in 1993 on the backdrop of his ties to the radical terror organization. The event saw participation of Muslim Brotherhood-oriented Islamist clerics from different countries. During the event, Abu Marzouk praised “mosques, the Quran, and Jihad” as the three reasons behind “Gaza’s triumph,” adding that “Jihad is not limited to weapons, but rather jihad is an obligation in our day, each in his specialty, work, and place.” According to Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated channels, the conference concluded with ten suggestions for action among scholars as part of the efforts to “support the flood [of Al-Aqsa],” including strengthening jihadi education, applying pressure on governments, enhancing Da’wah (‘call to Islam’ or religious preaching) through online platforms for the youth, and spreading “Qur’anic messages related to victory and love for Al-Aqsa.” Other suggestions included learning from Hamas, whose model was initiated by an Islamist religious scholar, supporting Palestinians in arenas involved in combating Israel, reviving jurisprudence of jihad and jihadi education while “drawing inspiration from the positions of our people’s jihad in Gaza and Palestine,” and promoting economic boycott of “the enemy.” Türkiye has long been a staunch supporter of Hamas, hosting the terror group’s leaders on many occasions and providing material and moral support to the radical Islamist group. Both Erdogan’s AKP party and the Palestinian terror organization have their ideological roots in what is named “political Islam” or Islamism, led worldwide by the Muslim Brotherhood axis. This ideology, amplified and promoted by religious institutions, political parties, and NGOs across the globe and usually backed by Qatar and Türkiye, aspires to establish its own version of Islam as the main focal point of personal and political identities. The Muslim Brotherhood is also the ideological predecessor of Salafi Jihadist movements such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS, and many scholars attribute the movement with the trickling of classical European antisemitic tropes into the Arab and Islamic sphere. through translations and adaptations of antisemitic texts.",

        "description": "Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal...",
        "content": "PARIS (AP) — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “ Ra-fa! Ra-fa! ” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev. Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal's last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,\" said the Spaniard, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. While Nadal said it's doubtful he'll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympics' tennis competition will be at the French Open site. Monday's match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I (felt like I had) a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he'd never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. Djokovic, owner of 24 major championships and the man Nadal played against more than any other, sat in the stands Monday, as did younger stars Iga Swiatek and Carlos Alcaraz. Also there: Nadal's uncle, Toni, who used to be his coach. Not surprisingly, it was difficult to spot so much as a single empty chair anywhere in the arena on what many realized could be a historic occasion. Here and there, when Nadal was able to come up with the goods and get the better of his opponent, he would yell “Vamos!” and throw that celebratory uppercut that became so familiar, from the days of muscle shirts and Capri pants to Monday's look of sky-blue sleeves and standard-length white shorts. His numerous and vocal supporters would respond in kind, thrusting their fists in the air right along with him or shaking their red-and-yellow Spanish flags or clapping to the beat of a drum. If Nadal put a ball into the net, or sailed one wide or long, the groans of disappointment filled the chilly air. Between points, especially when he was trying to navigate a difficult spot, it was so quiet that a pigeon’s coos were audible from a corner of the stadium. Nadal began shakily, with a misplayed drop shot and a double-fault contributing to getting broken at love. He got broken again to end the first set. The 6-foot-6 (1.98-meter) Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday's start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. On Monday, there were two stretches, albeit brief, where Nadal looked as though he might be able to find enough muscle memory to make this a close contest. In the second set, right after he flubbed a backhand and hung his head, Nadal faced a pair of break points that would have put Zverev up 3-1. Nadal escaped, using a 116 mph (187 kph) ace and a 117 mph (188 kph) service winner to hold, before breaking for a 3-2 lead. Roars. Not so fast. Nadal served for that set at 5-4, but Zverev broke at love, then was superior in the ensuing tiebreaker. At the start of the third set, Nadal again erased a pair of break points, then broke for a 2-0 lead with an on-the-run forehand. He pumped his fists, gritted his teeth and screamed, “Vamos!” More roars. Once more, though, Nadal failed to sustain it and soon was back at 2-all. Zverev broke to lead 5-3, and that essentially was that. Nadal said his body felt as well as it has in a while during practice, and he finally could move without limitations, but he hasn't been competing enough lately. “To hold your level (with) this amount of energy, this amount of concentration,” he explained, “you need to be playing often.” Addressing the fans directly, Nadal said: “The feelings that you made me feel here are unbelievable. I really hope to see you again, but I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” And with that, he gathered his bags and headed to the locker room, but not before stopping to look around. He applauded right back at those applauding him and saluting him with one final chant. “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” This story has been corrected to fix the year of Nadal's loss to Soderling. It was 2009, not 2010. AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "(iStock / Getty Images) Q : More than a decade ago, I used to work on the same team as “Brad,” who pursued me romantically. I was initially not interested, but after two years we started dating. Then, after a few weeks, he ghosted me. It was messy and painful, because I was young and very much in love. I sent him two texts calling him a lying jerk, but in harsher terms. Our manager said I was hurting the team dynamic and transferred me to a different office in the same city. I was happy to go. I cringe just thinking about how immature and unprofessional my actions were after the breakup. Also on our team was Abby, a toxic person who seeks out drama and creates conflict everywhere she goes. In the three months we worked together, Abby created workplace issues with two other people. She was also throwing herself at Brad. It was so obvious that her boyfriend broke up with her over it. I am now happily married and work for a different company thousands of miles away. My company recently hired Abby. She has been asking people if I’ve been “harassing any men,” and then retelling everything that happened. I was always friendly and professional with Abby, so it’s not like she has a grudge against me. How should I handle this? Do I ignore it and hope it dies down? Do I go to HR? Do I tell people she didn’t come out of it smelling like roses either? Do I look for a new job? I’m just so tired. A: I’ll take you at your word that this was a one-time, sorely regretted incident when your youth and emotions overrode your professionalism, and you learned the hard way about love bombing. (I might even argue that the person truly responsible for hurting the team dynamic was the one who spent two years badgering a teammate into a relationship, but that’s not helpful now.) Ordinarily, I’d tell you that people will catch on quickly that Abby is a drama-feeding muckraker, and you can safely ride out the gossip cycle by sticking to the high road. But her language takes things well beyond dishing about a messy breakup. If she’s falsely insinuating that you have a history of harassing men in general, that’s potentially harmful to your reputation, depending on how credulous and cutthroat your colleagues are. You need to get ahead of that narrative as soon as possible. Cornering her in the bathroom is tempting, but inadvisable. Asking if she’s heard from her ex recently, as a coded way of letting her know you also keep receipts, would probably be too subtle a hint to burst her soap-opera bubble. Also, bear in mind George Bernard Shaw’s adage about wrestling with swine in their own element: You’ll both get dirty, and she’ll like it. Instead, you would be best served by bringing the problem to a third-party authority who can intervene, whether that’s your manager or your HR department. Give your drama-free synopsis: “Ten years ago, in another job, I was briefly romantically involved with a co-worker. It ended badly, and I regret the experience and have never repeated that mistake.” If pressed for more details, keep it brief but honest: “When he abruptly ended things, I was hurt and sent him a couple of rude texts.” Subtext: You were unprofessional, but not violent or dangerous. You accepted the consequences and moved on. Then outline the problem and your request: “Unfortunately, someone who worked with me back then is now spreading embarrassing and embellished stories about that time. I’m concerned her narrative is undermining me and hurting my reputation, and I would like it to stop.” If your company has a general policy against bullying - including, for example, spreading rumors or gossip intended to humiliate - this would be the time to spell out how you believe Abby is violating it. You might be counseled to go back and discuss the matter with Abby yourself. But getting it on the record with HR first may be useful if Abby ups her game to more blatant harassment or starts creating trouble for other colleagues. Otherwise, should any co-workers care enough to inquire about your past, you can simultaneously own and defuse the intrigue with an eye-roll: “Yeah, that’s when I learned firsthand why dating a co-worker is a bad idea.” Assuming your colleagues know you as a mature, levelheaded professional, they will soon see Abby’s hot gossip for the cold tea it is. They will realize, as you should, that this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with her.",

The exact recovery period for the 33-year-old has not yet been disclosed, but the player himself has confirmed that the Euros will come too soon. “I can’t imagine I’ve had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn’t play the final, win the Europa League. In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff but it turns out I can’t play the Euros,” De Roon wrote in an post on “I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it’s a very tough day.

        "content": "CARDIFF: England’s white-ball captain Jos Buttler is likely to miss the third T20I of the four-match series against Pakistan, an international media outlet reported. According to the report, Buttler left for London after spearheading England to a comfortable 23-run victory over Pakistan in the second T20I in Birmingham. The England captain and his wife Louise are expecting the birth of their third child soon. Notably, Jos Buttler was absent from England’s training session in Cardiff on Monday afternoon and is unlikely to feature in the third T20I against Pakistan, scheduled on Tuesday evening. Moreover, it is uncertain whether Buttler will return in time for the final T20I against Pakistan but as things stand he is most likely to accompany the England squad on their departure for the West Indies for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024 on Friday. Earlier, England’s vice-captain Moeen Ali, who has led the side in 12 ODIs and T20Is, stated that nothing will change if he assumes the England captaincy role in Jos Buttler’s absence. “I feel I’ve captained enough for England,” Moeen said. “I’ll be fine. Nothing will change too much, it’s just taking over from what he’s doing and then when he comes back, he takes over. “Hopefully, the baby comes at the right time where he doesn’t miss too many games. “For me, it’s just whatever will happen, will happen. It’s not really difficult, to be honest with you, because we speak often, me and Jos. We talk about other things, the team and all that. We’re on the same page anyway.” Pakistan squad: Babar Azam (c), Abrar Ahmed, Azam Khan, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Rizwan, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Usman Khan. England squad: Jos Buttler (c), Phil Salt, Will Jacks, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Duckett, Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Sam Curran, Chris Jordan, Tom Hartley, Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Reece Topley. Pak vs Eng T20I remaining series schedule: 3rd T20I: Tue, May 28th 4th T20I: Thu, May 30th",

The veteran centre will be in the lineup tonight when his Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason Franson EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. \"It's more nerve-racking watching than playing,\" the 34-year-old centre said Thursday morning. \"But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. \"You're just itching to be a part of that.\" Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. Hintz, the Stars' No. 1 centre, hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Thursday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. \"He's just an awesome player,\" Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. \"He's one of the best players in the in the world. You can't really replace a guy like that. \"Being able to get him back, it would be huge.\" McLeod comes out of Edmonton's lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers' penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod taking a seat to the \"reset\" the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. \"There's a lot to like about his game,\" said the coach. \"A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He's been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn't been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. \"We've got a lot of players that are playing well. It's been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Joshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "By Nivedita Balu and Fergal Smith TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada, Mexico and Argentina on Monday started to settle securities trades faster, halving settlement time to one day, in a move designed to reduce counterparty risk and improve market liquidity. Settlement is the final stage of a trade, when buyers get their securities delivered and sellers are paid. Market participants and regulators in the United States are paying close attention to the implementation of the so-called T+1 in Canada, Mexico and Argentina because Wall Street will shift to one-day settlement on Tuesday for equities, corporate and municipal bonds and other securities. As global markets are highly integrated, any hiccups there could signalize potential issues for the United States too. \"Everything is bright green at this point in time. There are no issues and everybody is extremely optimistic,\" said Keith Evans, executive director of the Canadian Capital Markets Association, a federally incorporated industry organization. Volumes will likely be up to 25% lighter than normal due to the U.S. holiday on Monday, making it \"somewhat of an advantage\" for Canada, Evans added. In Argentina, Gonzalo Pascual Merlo, chief executive of local exchange operator BYMA, told Reuters that the change would further strengthen the country's capital markets. \"Implementing this measure brings clear benefits for the whole ecosystem, from liquidity providers to investors and other participants,\" he said. A BYMA spokesman added that implementing the quicker settlement would \"strengthen the friction-less arbitrage with other global markets and reduce counterparty risk in normal settlement, increasing security for capital markets participants.\" Although regulators have been discussing the implementation of one-day settlement for a long time, it gained more traction after the 2021 trading frenzy around the \"meme stock\" GameStop (NYSE: GME ) highlighted the need to reduce counterparty risk and improve capital efficiency and liquidity in securities transactions. In China and India, the new standard is already in place, while Britain and the European Union plan to shift in the coming years. The more countries or markets adopt T+1, the more efficient the faster settlement it will be for global investors. Currency trades funding securities transactions currently settle in two days. Because of issues like this, regulators and market participants expect a temporary increase in trade fails. Research firm ValueExchange found in a survey that market participants expect the trade fail rate to increase to 4.1% after T+1 implementation from 2.9%. \"The next few days promise to be challenging,\" said Nawan Butt, head of capital markets at Purpose Investments in Toronto. \"We have to spend the time to handhold all trades and make sure trade fail rates remain low as funding costs are quite high with the current interest rate backdrop.\"",

        "content": "TALAMBAH: A shocking incident was reported from Tulamba area of Punjab where two orphan sisters were violently assaulted and had their fingers burned for allegedly stealing books from the madrasa, ARY News reported on Monday. The mother of the victim girls claimed accused that the individuals, named Mudassir and Maqsood along with others tortured her daughters, adding that the girls were taken to a tent, tied with ropes, and hung. She claims that the assailants later handed both her and the girls over to the police. “The police released me and my daughters on the guarantee of non-medical examination,” the mother claimed. The mother has accused the authorities of neglect and insists that a medical examination and justice for her daughters are necessary. She also stated that the girls have been barred from receiving any medical or psychological support following the trauma. DSP Saleem Rath confirmed that the girls were accused of stealing books from a madarssa and passing them to someone else. He mentioned that the incident occurred a few days ago and assured that he is currently investigating the case. DSP Rath promised a transparent inquiry, emphasizing that no one will be allowed to take the law into their own hands.",

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDiscover how the three bargain stocks operating in oil and gas transportation and financial sectors can turbocharge the portfolio's growth.The post 3 Bargain Stocks Ready to Supercharge Your Wealth appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "One should look for hidden jewels in the stock market, which provide stability and development possibilities. Three businesses have stood out in this endeavor; each represents a different industry — banking, insurance and energy. They are all united by opportunity and perseverance. The first one excels in the energy field, namely in gas and oil transportation. Growing Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) rates indicate that geopolitical concerns and an aging tanker fleet have driven the company’s market performance. Meanwhile, the second one deftly negotiates the complex world of insurance. The company has maintained policyholders in the face of substantial premium hikes and enhanced the performance of its Property & Casualty (P&C) sector by implementing a methodical plan for profitability restoration. Finally, with strong financial indicators, the third one commands respect in regional banking. Strategic balance sheet expansion is the foundation for its strong performance, as seen by its earnings per share ( EPS ), return on equity and net interest income. Overall, these businesses offer more than just financial prospects. They are examples of resilience against volatile markets. Frontline (FRO) Frontline (NYSE: FRO ) has already secured 72% of Suezmax days at $52,800 per day, 69% of Aframax (LR2) days at an exceptional $67,800 per day, and 81% of Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) days at an average TCE cost of $55,100 per day for the first quarter of 2024 (in Q4 2023). These rising rates are load-to-discharge-based and the number of ballast days may impact them. Moreover, the tanker business is significantly affected ton-mile by the heightened tensions in the Middle East and the interruptions in the Red Sea/Aden area . Additionally, the United States is putting more pressure on Russia’s price cap evasions and the so-called Dark Fleet. Due to economies of scale, bigger boats such as VLCCs are preferred in the expanding trading lanes as non-OPEC oil output rises, especially from the U.S. and Brazil. Finally, with 133 VLCCs scheduled to reach 20 years old in 2024 alone, a sizable portion of the fleet’s current age is nearing or beyond 20. The Suezmax fleet has a comparable pattern. Thus, the aging fleet and rising ordering activity indicate a probable decrease in available tonnage, which might compress supply and justify higher prices. Horace Mann (HMN) Horace Mann ‘s (NYSE: HMN ) notable advancements in the P&C sector are one of its main advantages. Compared to Q1 2023, the P&C combined ratio increased by 13 points to 99.9% in Q1 2024. The combined ratio is the percentage of the premiums an insurer collects that it pays out in claims and expenses, before counting its profits from investing those premiums. This improvement shows that the segment’s cost control and efficiency have improved. The segment’s $11 million profit represented a substantial improvement over the previous year’s deficit and showed the value of the company’s multi-year profitability restoration plan. Additionally, Horace Mann projects overall premium increases in cars and property of around 40% and 50% , respectively, from 2022 to 2024. This calculated action aims to increase profitability. Further, the policyholder retention has stayed the same despite these significant premium hikes, indicating consumer loyalty and contentment with the value offered by the business. Thus, the steady retention rates in the face of increasing premiums demonstrate the efficacy of Horace Mann’s client retention techniques. Further, Q1 catastrophe losses were higher than the 10-year and five-year norms . However, they were less than 2023 on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Overall, the resilience and effectiveness of the company’s claims management practices are demonstrated by its fundamental ability to manage higher catastrophic losses while increasing the consolidated bottom line. Columbia Banking System (COLB) Columbia Banking System (NASDAQ: COLB ) delivered operational EPS of $0.65 and $0.59 for Q1 2024. The company uses equity capital effectively, reflected in the operational return of 16% for tangible equity on average, reflecting its high returns to shareholders. Further, Q1’s net interest income of $423 million represented a $30 million decline from the prior quarter. This is mostly due to increased deposit expenses and decreased revenue from investment securities. Despite this drop, the net interest margin (NIM) was 3.52% , falling between the predicted range of 3.45% and 3.60%. Notably, price reductions on wholesale and promotional funding caused the NIM to rise to 3.55% in March. Thus, this demonstrates successful margin management in a challenging environment for interest rates. Lastly, for Q1, Columbia Banking System saw growth in deposits of $100 million and loans of $200 million. After declining in January, non-sparing demand deposits stabilized in February and March , indicating a stabilizing deposit base. Thus, it is evident that the company’s main strength that supports its expansion plan is its capacity to increase its balance sheet. As of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in HMN and COLB. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines .",

Police say they've laid a total of 322 charges so far and have issued arrest warrants for 10 more people. They say the seven-month investigation, called Project Odyssey, recovered 255 vehicles in Peel Region and 114 vehicles at the Port of Montreal, where the cars were intended for export. Police say a Peel-based company was helping to transport stolen vehicles out of a trucking yard in Brampton, Ont.

        "content": "American Ben Shelton won his first match at the French Open on Monday as he overcame Frenchman Hugo Gaston 3-6 6-3 6-4 6-4, not only surviving two interruptions from the Paris rain but also the wrath of the local fans. Loud chants of \"Hugo, Hugo\" echoed across Court 14 as the home favourite took the opening set, but Shelton's fierce left-handed play quickly silenced the French crowd as he took the second, third and fourth sets, converting six of 14 break points to complete the two-hour, 29-minute encounter. \"This was a pretty amazing atmosphere, honestly. This is the first time that I've come out to a tennis match and had a band playing in the stands on my court, so I think that was pretty special,\" Shelton told a press conference. \"I love these moments. I enjoy these atmospheres. I got a lot of heckling when I was in college tennis, but today the crowd was just loud, chanting, supporting their countryman. It's something that you love to see. There was a lot of positives out there,\" he added. The 21-year-old Shelton, who burst onto the scene last year when he reached the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park and the semis at the US Open, likened the atmosphere to an American football match and said he used to get booed at his college games. \"It's a big motivator when you hear the chants and cheers whenever you make an unforced error, but also, there was so much energy for me, which made it awesome,\" he said. \"Sometimes it's tough when it's completely silent when you hit a good shot, and they're going nuts every time that you miss, but here it was a little bit more even. Obviously, he had the home field advantage, but I felt some love out there,\" he added. Shelton will play Kei Nishikori, who beat Gabriel Diallo 7-5 7-6(3) 3-6 1-6 7-5, in the second round.

        "description": "A roundup of crime news from around the Lower Mainland and B.C. on Monday, May 27",
        "content": "Article content A North Vancouver man is facing charges after a knife-wielding man damaged several cars in Deep Cove over the weekend, then went after a motorcyclist with the weapon. North Vancouver RCMP were called about a man reportedly slashing cars near Deep Cove Road and Mount Seymour Parkway, not far from The Raven pub in the District of North Vancouver, at about 3 p.m. Saturday. “It is alleged the man was carrying a knife and using it to damage cars,” said Const. Mansoor Sahak in a news release on Monday. “The man then allegedly attacked a motorcyclist, striking his helmet with the knife, but fortunately, causing no injury. “The motorcyclist did sustain minor injuries as a result of falling, and was led to safety by a motorist at the scene.” Officers flooded the scene within minutes and arrested a suspect. Police allege the suspect assaulted an officer while in custody. North Van District Mayor Mike Little went to the scene on Saturday. “Deep Cove is a very safe area so this violent act comes as a complete shock,” said Little in a text exchange on Monday. “This could have been much more serious if it wasn’t for the quick thinking of a bystander who protected the victim in their car, and also thanks to the RCMP for their quick action.” On Sunday, prosecutors charged Alexander Currie with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assault of a police officer and weapon possession. “The quick actions of our officers led to the safe arrest of the suspect,” said Sahak. “We would like to thank the quick-thinking actions of a passerby motorist who assisted the motorcyclist by guiding them to safety.” Sahak said the RCMP victim services unit is available 24/7 for anyone struggling emotionally by calling 604-969-7540. Witnesses who haven’t spoken to police are asked to call 604-985-1311. Richmond RCMP are hoping witnesses have dashcam footage after a traffic cop was forced to leap out of the way to avoid being hit by a speeding car last week. A road safety unit was cracking down on speeders on Highway 91 near the Knight Street Bridge on May 19 when an officer allegedly clocked a vehicle going 145 km/h in an 80 km zone. The officer on foot tried to stop the vehicle, but it didn’t stop and the Mountie had to dive to the side of the road to avoid getting hit. “Fortunately, our officer was not seriously injured, but this type of driving behaviour puts all road users at risk,” said Sgt. Eric Baskette of the road safety unit. Investigators are asking anyone who was in the area between 8:40 and 9:10 a.m. to check dashcam footage. The suspect was in a black sedan with a broken passenger-side mirror that was last seen headed east on Highway 91. Anyone with information or video is asked to call Richmond RCMP at 604-278-1212 or Crime Stoppers, 1-800-222-8477, or make a report at . A man wanted for assault and drug charges in Surrey and Langley who missed a court date in February is in custody. Surrey RCMP say Arandeep Gill, 34, failed to show up in court on Feb. 9 to face eight charges including assault and assault with a weapon. He was also wanted on three charges in Langley for possession of drugs for trafficking purposes and dangerous operation of a vehicle. Gill was arrested at a home in the 10400-block of University Drive late Sunday afternoon by Surrey RCMP, an integrated emergency response team, crisis negotiators, police dogs and a gang enforcement team. He is in custody until a remand hearing.",

        "description": "A sessions court in Mumbai convicted two colleagues, Siddhesh Tamhankar and Kavita Sidhwani, for the murder of Kirti Vyas, a 28-year-old BBlunt salon executive who went missing over six years ago.",
        "content": "MUMBAI: Over six years after 28-year-old BBlunt salon executive Kirti Vyas went missing, a sessions court on Monday held two of her colleagues - Siddhesh Tamhankar and Kavita Sidhwani (name changed), in whose company she was last seen - guilty of her murder, making it a rare conviction in the absence of the victim's body . Special judge MG Deshpande said, \"The offence against both of you has been proved.\" The judge will pronounce the quantum of sentence on Tuesday. While the maximum punishment is death, the minimum is life imprisonment. The trial was conducted in-camera at the behest of Sidhwani's lawyer to protect her identity. Vyas went missing on March 16, 2018, after leaving home for work. Tamhankar and Sidhwani were arrested on May 5 that year. A police inquiry found that the two strangled her in a car and dumped her body at Mahul. A prolonged search for the body did not yield results. The prosecution had said in court that Tamhankar had been afraid of losing his job after being put on notice by Vyas over his poor performance at work, and of his relationship with a married Sidhwani being exposed. Sidhwani (48), who had been granted bail by Supreme Court in 2021, broke down after the verdict and was taken into custody. Tamhankar (42), who has been in jail since his arrest in 2018, made repeated attempts to calm her down. IPS officer Sanjay Saxena, who was the then JCP (crime), credited the verdict despite the absence of the body to good teamwork. \"Strong circumstantial evidence coupled with scientific evidence through forensic analysis, was the key,\" he said. Calling the crime premeditated, special public prosecutor Avdhoot Chimalkar had cited the evidence of 39 witnesses to seek a conviction, and said, while submitting the final arguments in the case, that the crime was committed on the day the deadline mentioned on the show-cause notice ended, \"on which day, in all probability, his services were to be terminated\". He said Tamhankar and Sidhwani's residences, and their workplace, were far from Vyas's home and there was no other need for them to have waited for her outside her house on March 16, 2018. The prosecution said Tamhankar had accompanied Vyas's family when filing a missing person complaint and even joined a search for her. It said during none of these instances did Tamhankar reveal he and Sidhwani had picked Vyas up from outside her house - the most incriminating evidence against him. He revealed this out of fear only after CCTV footage was being scanned. It was also said DNA from the bloodstains and hair strands recovered from the car matched with Vyas' blood samples.",

        "description": "Jeep challenges Tesla with Wagoneer S EV ad. Wagoneer S EV offers 600 hp and over 300 miles range. Performance comparisons are now crucial in EV marketing.",
        "content": "The rivalry between manufacturers continues to intensify as Jeep targets the Model Y Performance in its newest advertisement. Demonstrating its latest Wagoneer S , Jeep aims to spotlight its capabilities in a head-to-head race against Tesla’s popular electric SUV. This strategic move underscores Jeep’s commitment to entering the high-performance electric vehicle market and showcases its determination to compete with established leaders like Tesla. Enthusiasts and industry watchers are keenly observing this competition, as it reflects broader trends in the rapidly evolving EV sector. The Jeep Wagoneer S EV, an all-electric luxury SUV, was launched in 2024. It boasts a powerful 600 hp motor and 617 lb-ft of torque, enabling it to achieve a 0-60 mph time of just 3.4 seconds. With over 300 miles of estimated driving range per charge and multiple driving modes, the Wagoneer S EV aims to combine performance and practicality. Designed to contend in the high-end electric SUV market, it encapsulates Jeep’s ambitious foray into the EV landscape. Earlier discussions around the Wagoneer S EV primarily focused on its anticipated market placement and performance metrics. Compared to past reports, the latest advertisement provides concrete performance comparisons with the Tesla Model Y Performance, highlighting real-world capabilities rather than just theoretical specs. This development is significant as it moves the conversation from speculative performance to demonstrable achievements. Additionally, the price disparity between the Wagoneer S EV and the Model Y Performance, which was previously less emphasized, is now being scrutinized by market analysts. Past news on the Tesla Model Y Performance emphasized its quick acceleration and market dominance as a leading electric SUV. The current advertisement by Jeep not only acknowledges Tesla’s market leadership but also positions the Wagoneer S EV as a direct competitor. By showing the Wagoneer S EV nearly matching the Model Y Performance in acceleration, Jeep aims to challenge Tesla’s stronghold. This shift in narrative from individual performance reviews to direct competitive benchmarks marks a new phase in the electric SUV market competition. As Jeep introduces its Wagoneer S EV, the electric vehicle market witnesses a growing emphasis on performance comparisons and competitive marketing. Jeep’s decision to directly compare its new model with the Tesla Model Y Performance is a clear indicator of its ambitions. While the Wagoneer S EV shows promise with its impressive acceleration and range capabilities, the substantial price difference with the Model Y could be a deciding factor for potential buyers. This competitive dynamic highlights the importance of balancing performance, pricing, and brand positioning in the rapidly evolving EV sector. For enthusiasts and consumers, these developments promise an exciting future with more options and innovations.",

        "content": "He emphasized the need for assistance from both the Federal Government and Edo State Government to address the banditry disrupting their operations. Hefer underscored the significance of rubber production for the company’s operations, citing it as a major source of foreign exchange earnings. However, he lamented the production losses incurred due to insecurity, highlighting that attacks compelled them to cease rubber farming, consequently impacting their commitments. In addition to security challenges, Hefer identified currency devaluation, forex scarcity, and inadequate infrastructure as further obstacles affecting the company. He also flagged government policies such as multiple taxation as significant hurdles. Expressing hope for governmental intervention to mitigate these challenges and enhance business performance, Hefer mentioned that the company currently has no immediate expansion plans unless directed otherwise by the board. In a related development, recent attacks on Okomu Oil Palm’s facility resulted in casualties among the company’s staff. A militant group claiming responsibility demanded a 25% stake in the company and a directorship position on its board. The broader issue of insecurity in Nigeria, extending beyond the North-East region, has impacted various sectors, including agriculture. Reports suggest that farmers across Northern Nigeria pay bandits for access to their farms to avoid harvest losses, contributing to elevated food inflation nationwide.

Yolanda Mays and her uncle, Tommy Holmes, claim on the evening of March 21, 2023, Minneapolis Police Officers Andrew Schroeder and Mark Suchta as well as Brooklyn Center Police Officer Alan Salvosa without permission . The reason for their presence on the scene in the first place was to investigate the fatal shooting of a woman. A search warrant affidavit listed as a residence on the same block but not that belonging to Ms. Mays and Mr. Holmes, the suit says. Alas, . Holmes was home at the time but in the basement. The suit alleges the police trio began shuffling through the mailbox while awaiting a response from someone inside the home. Eventually, the suit claims they began peering through the window where they discovered a baby doll lying on the couch. The group then drew up the conclusion that the doll - with apparent “stitched on joints and plastic sheen” - was not indeed a doll but instead a real infant in distress that needed saving, the suit claims. Once their minds were made, they kicked in the front door. Read more from : The suit alleges Officer Salvosa caused damage to the home and garage during the midst of his search.

The suit cited up to 20 disciplinary matters Officer Schroeder has faced alone since 2015 for conducting none other than unlawful searches. In 2020, he was accused of fabricating where he received a tip from in a drug investigation, the report says. The suit also came for Officer Salvosa’s record, explaining he was sued following a 2015 incident where he deployed a Taser at someone who died later. The suit seeks an unspecified amount of monetary damages, arguing that the officers acted with “evil intent” and “reckless indifference” of the civil rights of both Mr. Holmes and Ms. Mays.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Catch up on the French Open with a guide that tells you everything you need to know about what happened at the clay-court Grand Slam tennis tournament, how to watch it, what the betting odds are, what the schedule is and more: Who is Playing on Monday? The match getting by far the most attention — Rafael Nadal vs. Alexander Zverev — will be third in Court Philippe Chatrier. That means it should start at around 3:30 p.m. (1330 GMT; 9:30 a.m. EDT). That will be preceded by No. 8 Ons Jabeur against Sachia Vickery, which starts play in the main stadium at noon (1000 GMT; 6 a.m. EDT), and the second match there, with Iga Swiatek against Leolia Jeanjean. Another match that could generate interest will be Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, who is coming off a hip injury, against Chris Eubanks, a big-serving American who reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year. That starts the day in Court Suzanne Lenglen at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT; 5 a.m. EDT). What Happened on Sunday? Two-time major champion Carlos Alcaraz pronounced his recently injured forearm “fully recovered,” even if it still is “feeling weird,” after overwhelming J.J. Wolf 6-1, 6-2, 6-1 in the first round. “It's still in my mind, but I didn’t feel anything after the match ... which is really, really good for me.” Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka won a match at a major for the first time in more than two years by defeating Lucia Bronzetti 1-6, 6-4, 7-5, to advance to what could be a second-round showdown against Swiatek. Other players moving into the second round included Caroline Garcia of France, 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin, No. 30 Dayana Yastremska and Donna Vekic in the women's draw, and No. 6 Andrey Rublev, No. 8 Hubert Hurkacz and No. 10 Grigor Dimitrov in the men's. No. 17 seed Ugo Humbert was eliminated by Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. There was a brief rain shower in the afternoon, which delayed action on several courts but allowed for the first use of the new retractable roof at Court Suzanne Lenglen. How to Watch the French Open on TV — In the U.S.: Tennis Channel, NBC, Peacock. — Other countries are listed here . Betting Guide Nadal is usually favored to win the championship at the French Open — he has 14, after all — but BetMGM Sportsbook has him as the underdog in the first round against No. 4 seed Zverev on Monday. Zverev is a -350 money-line favorite against Nadal, who is listed at +260 for that match. Nadal is just 7-4 this year and missed nearly all of last year while dealing with injuries; that is why he is unseeded and so could have been drawn to face anyone to begin the tournament. Zverev was a semifinalist in Paris each of the past three years and is coming off a clay-court title at the Italian Open this month. Swiatek is a big favorite to win the title (-155), so it makes sense that she is listed at -10000 against Jeanjean, who has +1600 money-line odds for their match. The Schedule — Monday-Tuesday: First Round (Women and Men) — Wednesday-Thursday: Second Round (Women and Men) — May 31-June 1: Third Round (Women and Men) — June 2-3: Fourth Round (Women and Men) — June 4-5: Quarterfinals (Women and Men) — June 6: Women’s Semifinals — June 7: Men’s Semifinals — June 8: Women’s Final — June 9: Men’s Final A Quiz About Nadal Try your hand at the AP’s quiz about Rafael Nadal .

        "description": "That same economic story is being replicated in a number of other critical battleground states, including Arizona and Georgia.",
        "content": "Construction continues on the Wolfspeed factory in Siler City, N.C., on March 26. The new factory will soon produce advanced wafers for computer chips. Automaker Vinfast is scheduled to open a factory next year. Both projects stem in large part from incentives that Biden signed into law. Josh Boak/Associated Press SILER CITY, N.C. — At the epicenter of President Biden’s promised economic boom, a slow tractor can still halt traffic. Just 81,000 people live in rural Chatham County, North Carolina. There are 1,076 farms. The old mill now houses a dance studio, a grocer and a steakhouse. For work, many people have no choice but to commute to Chapel Hill, Durham and Raleigh. But after years of careful planning, Chatham County has started to change. The new Wolfspeed factory – six football fields long – overlooks U.S. Highway 64 and will soon produce advanced wafers for computer chips. Automaker Vinfast is scheduled to open a factory as well. Both projects stem in large part from incentives that Biden signed into law. Developers, including the Walt Disney Corp. , plan to build several thousand new homes. “When the right opportunity came along, we were there and we were ready,” said Greg Lewis, who owns the steakhouse. “It is growth, growth, growth.” That same economic story is being replicated in a number of other critical battleground states, including Arizona and Georgia. But while the kind of enthusiasm voiced by Lewis would usually mean a strong tailwind for an incumbent president, so far this election year there is little evidence from polling that Americans are giving Biden credit for the gains as voters still focus instead on inflation still climbing at 3.4% annually. TRUMP, BIDEN HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON A GROWING ECONOMY Places like Chatham County show how this year’s presidential campaign offers two conflicting visions for America’s economic future. Voters face a decades-defining choice about what can do more for growth: former President Donald Trump’s preference for tax cuts skewed toward business and the wealthy or the targeted government investments backed by Biden as well as possible tax increases to fund programs for the middle class. The county backed Biden over Trump in 2020 but sits in the solidly Republican congressional district of Rep. Richard Hudson. He voted against the Democratic president’s policies and his office declined to answer questions about whether the investments in his district are a positive. Just how much the influx of federal and private sector money affects the political dynamics in North Carolina and beyond will have a lot to say about who will win November’s presidential election. Biden is campaigning on how his policies have helped pump hundreds of billions of dollars in private and federal investment into companies, helping to revive the faded computer chip sector and pioneer newer technologies such as electric vehicles, solar panels and artificial intelligence. But so far, the investments have not significantly swayed the public. Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, maintains that Biden’s ideas would wreck the economy and that EVs will flop against a proven fuel such as gasoline. He says corporate tax cuts would do more to bolster growth by letting companies choose their own path, and a threat of higher tariffs would cause them to keep their factory jobs inside the United States. “Would everybody like to buy an electric car?” Trump asked at a recent rally, where he was met with a chorus of “No!” When Biden spoke at Wolfspeed’s headquarters in Durham last year, he described its chips as not just powering the economy but protecting it from supply chain disruptions and competition from China. “It’s a game changer,” he said. “We’re turning things around in a big way.” MANUFACTURING INVESTMENTS INCREASING The new Wolfspeed factory has begun installing its industrial furnaces that heat to half of the sun’s temperatures. The factory is prepared to start production by the end of the year, while many of the other announced government incentives around the country are still blueprints or in the construction phase. Pending administration approval, the company may receive support through tax credits from Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act. It also has applied for funding through the Commerce Department as part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. Wolfspeed CEO Gregg Lowe said the potential for government support has been “very important” as the company has sought to produce more silicon carbide, a material that increases the efficiency of computer chips. He said the material will “lead to one of the most important transitions in the history of semiconductors,” allowing EVs, solar panels, data centers and other technologies such as energy storage to work better. Even if the company is more focused on its business than electoral politics, the changes in Chatham County go beyond the factory in ways that could matter in November. People can see the new hotel, the new gasoline stations and the acres of lots set aside for new housing. County Commissioner Karen Howard, a Democrat, said the debate is being forced as Democrats point to what they say is clear evidence they are delivering on their promises. Howard stressed that the gains came as a result of years of county officials’ groundwork for sustainable growth that was then complemented by federal policies. “It feels like Republicans have turned a blind eye to what voters want,” she said. “Tax cuts for the biggest boys in the world never got down to the person who is barely scraping by.” Howard said the expected total of 1,800 jobs at the Wolfspeed facility will transform households. “When we say it’s making generational change for these families, you now have individuals who will make more than their entire family did in a year,” Howard said. But Republicans in North Carolina’s legislature say investments in the state had more to do with their own policies than the incentives from Biden. GOP lawmakers are making the argument that the impact of inflation during Biden’s presidency matters more to voters. “We’ve lowered taxes, grown the state economy and built the nation’s best workforce,” said Phil Berger, president pro tempore of the North Carolina Senate. “Bidenomics here means higher costs for families and businesses, which is what voters will remember when heading to the polls.” Both Trump and Biden have committed to increasing factory production in the U.S. and making it less reliant on countries such as China. So far, the numbers suggest that Biden’s policies have done more for manufacturing than Trump’s 2017 tax cuts. Census Bureau figures show that the annualized rate of factory construction spending peaked at $82 billion annually under Trump. As of last March, adjusting for inflation, it has more than doubled under Biden to a record $223 billion. The president has also added more manufacturing jobs than Trump did before the disruptions caused by the 2020 pandemic. EVEN WITH NEW FACTORY INVESTMENTS, THERE ARE RISKS But that does not mean Biden’s industrial strategy is a sure thing. Chatham County records indicate that Vinfast has scaled down the footprint of its EV plant, with the company saying in a statement that it’s “currently reviewing the construction of the factory.” Administration officials say success will require breakthroughs to lower the production costs of advanced computer chips relative to Asia. More drivers will also need to switch to EVs and reverse the recent slowdown in sales. Some Republicans see room both for some of Biden’s policies as well as tax cuts, saying that a mix was the optimal course for success. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., voted for the CHIPS and Science Act, which funds semiconductor plants. Tillis said after touring Wolfspeed’s new factory that the combination of tax breaks and government financial support has been key for attracting new factories. “At the end of the day, it’s the balance that makes the difference,” he said in an interview outside the factory. As Wolfspeed’s Lowe explained it, the chips produced by the company’s factory will help the U.S. to compete against China in the EV, solar panel and artificial intelligence sectors. He happens to drive an EV made by Lucid that contains his own company’s chips, which help give it an impressive range of 516 miles, enough for him to drive to his Ohio hometown with a single charging stop. The CEO did not speculate about the outcome of the election, but he said technologies such as silicon carbide represent “a monumental change in the history of semiconductors” that is helping to remake the economy. In short, he sees no going back. “I tell our people this all the time, you know, in 30 years you’re going to look back to this moment and it’s going to be your mission control, Apollo 13 moment, where you say, ‘I was there when this technology switched.’” Success.

        "description": "While dismissing a foreign media report that parts of Malaysia Airlines MH370 could possibly be in a deep jungle of the Kingdom, Cambodia is ready to cooperate with the Malaysian authorities if there is a request to open an investigation into this case.The post Cambodia dismisses report of MH370 plane wreckage in jungle appeared first on Khmer Times.",
        "content": "While dismissing a foreign media report that parts of Malaysia Airlines MH370 could possibly be in a deep jungle of the Kingdom, Cambodia is ready to cooperate with the Malaysian authorities if there is a request to open an investigation into this case. Sin Chanserivutha, spokesman and Undersecretary of State for the State Secretariat of Civil Aviation (SSCA), said yesterday that, “The media coverage of MH370 in Cambodia is fake”. “We do not know the purpose of this false news, but we just know that they have bad intentions against Cambodia,” he said. “This false media coverage and an image were published once about eight years ago, and it has just been revised again and republished recently, which has created confusion,” he said. The remarks come after a British-based newspaper, The Mirror reported that: “MH370 mystery ‘solved’ by Google Maps as plane remains ‘found’ in darkest part of Cambodian jungle”. Chanserivutha said that if international researchers or whoever have found or have enough evidence to prove that the missing Malaysia Airlines plane was found in Cambodia’s jungle then Cambodian authorities are ready to cooperate with the Malaysian authorities. If there is a request to open an investigation into this case, the Cambodian authorities are ready to cooperate, he added. Ian Wilson, a self-professed expert from the UK, was quoted by The Mirror on Saturday that the remains of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane – which vanished carrying 239 people en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing – are scattered deep in a jungle in Cambodia. He said, “Measuring the Google sighting, you’re looking at around 69 metres, but there looks to be a gap between the tail and the back of the plane. It’s just slightly bigger, but there’s a gap that would probably account for that.” The plane’s disappearance sparked the largest-ever search operation for an aircraft, and remains one of the greatest aviation mysteries of our time. However, the search could be restarted after new investigations in the US. The flight took off from Kuala Lumpur on March 8, 2014 with 227 passengers and 12 crew on board, but it disappeared during a handover between Malaysian and Vietnamese air traffic controllers. Wilson said, “I was on there (Google Earth) a few hours here, a few hours there. If you added it up I spent hours searching for places a plane could have gone down. And in the end, as you can see the place where the plane is. It is literally the greenest, darkest part you can see.” At the time of the incident, Cambodia sent two ships and four helicopters to aid in the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight 370. The Cambodia search entailed 80 naval and army personnel and included flights over Cambodian land and sea. However, no trace of the plane was found in the search. In March, the BBC reported that in the aftermath of MH370’s disappearance, a massive search ensued that continued for four years and cost millions of dollars. Even after official recovery efforts ended, amateur sleuths continued trying to locate the ill-fated plane, which disappeared from radar less than 40 minutes into the flight. The report questioned if the mystery of the lost flight was any closer to being solved, ten years on – or, at least – if the wreckage of the plane might be located? It said some of the searchers who have been trying to solve the mysterious case for the past decade are saying, “yes”. It went on to say that Richard Godfrey, a retired British aerospace engineer and creator of the website ‘The Search for MH370’, and who has dedicated much of the past 10 years to solving the mystery, is convinced it would only take one more search in the correct location to find the aircraft. Separately, Vincent Lyne, a former researcher from the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) at the University of Tasmania, who has published numerous papers on the topic, has also been conducting his own independent investigation and is certain that the location of the plane is not a mystery. “The precise location of MH370 is in a very deep 6,000-metre hole about 1,500 kilometres west of Perth and along the longitude of Penang,” said Lyne. “That location reconciles all evidence,” he claimed. The BBC report questioned how did Godfrey and Lyne each grow so sure about the plane’s exact location when years of official searches turned up nothing? Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 left Kuala Lumpur International Airport at 12.41am on March 8, 2014, and was scheduled to arrive in Beijing Capital International Airport at 6.30am local time. But what happened next has baffled analysts. Air traffic controllers in Kuala Lumpur last heard from plane when pilots on the flight communicated to indicate that the plane was moving into another country’s airspace en route to Beijing. “After 40 minutes, it disappeared from civilian radar,” said Alessandra Bonomolo, director of a new documentary BBC podcast on the plane’s disappearance, “Why Planes Vanish: The Hunt for MH370”. “There were communications a few minutes prior between the pilots and air traffic controllers in Kuala Lumpur who exchanged a brief conversation, which is entirely customary when they say that they are going to move on to a different airspace – (which) in that case would have been Vietnamese airspace,” Bonomolo explained in the podcast. “And after that ‘goodnight,’ the air traffic controllers in Malaysia know that they are no longer responsible for that plane because it entered another nation’s airspace.” “It was at the border of Malaysian and Vietnamese airspace that the plane disappeared and stopped communicating with air traffic controllers entirely,” says Bonomolo. And that’s where the mystery begins. Meanwhile, Associated Press had reported that Malaysian officials said they may renew the hunt for MH370, after a US company that tried to find the plane in 2018 proposed a fresh search in the southern Indian Ocean where the Malaysia Airlines plane is believed to have crashed. Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said he would invite Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity to brief him on its latest “no find, no fee” proposal. The government has long said it would not support another search without new leads on the aircraft’s location. If the evidence is credible, he said, he will seek Cabinet approval to sign a new contract to resume the search. “The government is steadfast in our resolve to locate MH370,” Loke told a memorial event marking the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of the jet in March, adding, “We really hope the search can find the plane and provide truth to the next-of-kin.”",

        "content": "Timipre Sylva, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State and former Minister of State, Petroleum, Timipre Sylva, has rejected the Bayelsa State Governorship Election Tribunal judgement which upheld the election of Douye Diri as the state governor. Dissatisfied with the tribunal’s judgement, Sylva held a closed-door meeting with elders and stakeholders of the party to discuss the next course of action. After the meeting, he directed his legal team to seek justice at the Court of Appeal. “We are not satisfied with the decision of the tribunal. But this is just a court of first instance and after meeting with the elders and critical stakeholders of our great party, the APC, we directed our legal team to seek justice for Bayelsa at the Supreme Court.” Sylva also assured the people of Bayelsa that the court of appeal would surely correct the travesty perpetrated by the tribunal. According to him, the liberation of Bayelsa was close, adding that justice was inevitable for the traumatized people of the state. Read also: Breaking: Kano court orders police to evict Bayero from palace He appealed to them to remain positive, law-abiding, and steadfast. Sylva had in the course of the sitting of the tribunal accused the tribunal of bias following several infractions observed by his lawyers during the hearing of the case. Though he subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal demanding the dissolution of the panel and reconstitution of a new one, his petition was thrown out by the President of the Court of Appeal. It will be recalled that the tribunal had earlier upheld the election that produced Diri as the state governor. A three-man panel led by Justice Adekunle Adeleye dismissed the petition filed by Sylva, and the APC for lacking merit.

That’s because Birmingham-Southern is closing its doors as an institution May 31 — the day the D-III CWS begins at Classic Park. Birmingham-Southern — founded in 1856 — is a liberal arts college with an enrollment of 1,300. For two years, the school reportedly tried to restore its endowment with no luck. When legislation for a $30 million loan reportedly did not pass in the Alabama State House, the college decided in March to close its doors permanently. Now, the last remnants of Birmingham-Southern will be felt in Eastlake with bats, balls and gloves for at least two more games. “This is just a really special ride for a lot of reasons,” Coach Jan Weisberg told The Associated Press. “... We just want every minute we can.” The D-III CWS is a double-elimination format. The Panthers (32-14) will enter as the No. 7 team and play 2 seed Salve Regina from Rhode Island in their tournament opener May 31. First pitch is scheduled for 4:45 p.m. Before the news of the school’s upcoming closure, Birmingham-Southern was 13-10. Since then, it is 18-4 and heading to the CWS. “Just with all the emotions that we’ve been facing, to not have that one on our back of, ‘God, this could be the last game in this dugout,’” Weisberg told The Athletic . “It was a release, and I think they’ve played with that.” The team is led by infielder Andrew Dutton and starter Drake LaRoche. Dutton is batting .344 with seven home runs, 39 RBI and 56 runs. LaRoche is 8-3 on the mound with a 3.21 ERA and 66 strikeouts. If the school’s pending closure wasn’t enough, on May 26 reportedly nine players dealt with food poisoning during the Super Regional at Denison — with two reportedly needing to be admitted to a nearby hospital for fluids. “Nine of our guys woke up with food poisoning,” Kristin Waters Sullivan, sister of the school’s athletic director Kyndall Waters-McCormack, wrote on Facebook. “Two were in the hospital during the game. Half the team were hooked up to IVs behind the dugout. (Denison) was ranked number 2 in the country. This my friends is all heart. World Series bound.” To help with travel expenses, the cost of championship rings and helping players find a new school following the CWS, a group created a GoFundMe for Birmingham-Southern on May 25 with a goal of raising $50,000. As of May 27, it has raised more than $80,000 . Birmingham-Southern athletics tweeted this weekend, “Campus may be closing, but the story is still to be written.” The improbable story continues this weekend in Eastlake.",

        "content": "Monday night's Crimecall show on RTÉ will feature an appeal by Gardaí for information on the fatal hit and run which claimed the life of a man 10 years ago. Keith Byrne, 35, was killed in Co Louth after being struck by a vehicle while returning from his local pub in the early hours of the morning of Sunday, 11 May 2014 on the L1140 road, one minute from his house. The driver of the vehicle fled the scene and Keith later died of his injuries. Monday's Crimecall episode will feature the show's presenter Carla O'Brien travelling to Co Louth to meet with the sister of the victim, Niamh and brother David, to learn about how the family have coped with his untimely passing throughout the past 10 years. Keith was a \"one of a kind\" and a \"wonderful brother\" who would do anything for his family, according to Niamh. David said Keith \"lived life to the fullest\" and would \"light up the room\" when he walked in. READ MORE: Man arrested over suspected stabbing after being found 'covered in blood' READ MORE: Pictured - Man found with fatal injuries in Kerry village as locals tell of shock and pair arrested The family admit to having struggled greatly with thoughts of the tragic incident which cut Keith's life short. David recalls how he felt after finding out what happened. He said that the hardest thing to comprehend is how close Keith was to his house, stating: \"another minute, he would have been at the house.\" Niamh says that one of the hardest things for her to deal with since Keith's death is realising all that he has missed out on over the last decade. She says it is frightening how \"your life and family can change in one second.\" Gardaí, and the Byrne family, are making a direct appeal to the driver to come forward or for anyone who the driver may have confided in over the last ten years. Niamh believes that \"somebody does know something\", and she and the entire Byrne family are hoping that their appeal on Crimecall tonight will encourage someone to come forward to help see justice done for their much-loved brother and son.

        "description": "A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports.",
        "content": "ATLANTA — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer. AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "description": "Yellowstone prequel 1923 will be back for a second outing but an update has left some feeling saddened.",
        "content": "Yellowstone spinoff 1923 season two is on its way with fans to expect a big change following an update. Starring Hollywood icons Helen Mirren and Harrison Ford, 1923 follows in the footsteps of fellow spin-off 1883 which starred Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. In 1923, the focus is on the Dutton family in the late 19th century as they made their way from Texas to Montana, struggling to survive the drought, prohibition and cattle theft. Kevin Costner told Yellowstone writers to 'kill me' after explosive feud How much does the Yellowstone cast make? Salary breakdown as new season begins filming The first series on Paramount+ went down a storm with subscribers so it wasn’t too much of a surprise when it was renewed for a second season. However, this new series is going to look different from the first after its creators gave an update on shooting the Western drama. 1923 season two is going to be swapping Montana for a new filming location in South Austin, Texas. The show is going to be shot at ATX Film Studios, according to Austin Business Journal, even though the majority of season one took place in Bozeman Town, Butte, in Montana. Other scenes were filmed in South Africa, throughout Europe and Tanzania but was predominantly in Montana so it will be a big change. As of yet, it is unclear if other locations beyond Texas are going to be used for 1923’s second season. Don't miss: Yellowstone has begun production and fans can't contain their excitement Yellowstone's Kevin Costner says he wants to shoot series but hasn't seen any scripts Taylor Sheridan shocked Paramount execs when he denied season 2 of 1883 Not everyone is happy with the change in direction that the show’s creators have chosen to go with though. Speaking to the Montana Standard, chief executive of Butte-Silver Bow County JP Gallagher said: \"The decision to film the Yellowstone series of 1923 in Texas is disappointing. \"Nevertheless, we respect the production team's decision and acknowledge that these choices are influenced by factors beyond our control. “We were in talks with the production about 1923 coming back to Butte because of the positive experience they had here, but state tax incentive programs were a major factor for the production to move to Texas.\" So far, details on the new series of 1923 have been few and far between and if the new location is going to impact the plot. It is known that both Mirren and Ford will be reprising their roles as the show’s leads Cara and Jacob Dutton respectively. Filming has not yet started for season two so it is unlikely 1923 will be back before the end of the year. The Yellowstone franchise is available to watch on Paramount+.",

        "content": "Bailey Island resident Minerva “Minnie” Vazquez wears her Honor Flight Maine T-shirt in her home on Bailey Island on May 2. Vazquez served in the U.S. military for more than 20 years. J.W. Oliver / Harpswell Anchor Retired U.S. Army 1st Sgt. Minerva “Minnie” Vazquez, of Bailey Island, served in the military for more than 20 years. As a medic stationed in San Francisco during the Vietnam War, she cared for troops wounded in combat. Like many soldiers of the time, she encountered hostility from anti-war protesters. But on the last weekend in April, Vazquez felt nothing but respect and appreciation on a VIP tour of Washington, D.C., with Honor Flight Maine. “It felt good,” Vazquez, 81, said about the acknowledgment she received from Honor Flight. “But at the same time, I mean, that was my job. ... I didn’t do it because I have to. I just love to do it. I just love to serve others and take care of others.” Vazquez volunteered to serve in Vietnam, but the military was not deploying female medics at the time. She ended up in San Francisco, a hub of anti-war activity where rank-and-file soldiers often became targets for anger about America’s role in Vietnam. “When I was in San Francisco, we were afraid to (wear) our uniform outside,” Vazquez said. Soldiers would change into street clothes to venture off the base. Like many of those soldiers, Vazquez has seen a shift in attitudes toward Vietnam-era veterans — and nowhere was that shift more evident than on her trip with Honor Flight. “The way they look at us now, it is different from before,” Vazquez said. “It is more like respect — thank you for taking care of me.” Honor Flight Maine, a volunteer-run nonprofit, takes veterans on group trips to the nation’s capital, where they can experience and reflect at memorials and other sites of significance. “Veterans experience camaraderie, bonding, and even healing,” the organization says on its website. Vazquez’s tour included stops at the Military Women’s Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, as well as Arlington National Cemetery. Bailey Island veteran Minerva “Minnie” Vazquez holds a photograph of herself from her time in the U.S. Army. Vazquez worked as a medic and was responsible for the setup and operation of field hospitals. J.W. Oliver / Harpswell Anchor Participants witness the changing of the guard at Arlington’s Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a monument to unidentified service members who were killed in action. The reverent ceremony “was the best part” of the trip, Vazquez said. The veterans receive VIP treatment throughout the trip. People salute them and thank them for their service. They pay for nothing. They board planes first, and everything they need is brought to them. On the way home, Honor Flight surprises the veterans with a military-style “mail call.” The veterans receive thank-you letters from family and friends, their congressional delegation, students, and other groups and individuals who want to show appreciation. Veterans often become emotional at the memorials or during mail call — a reaction known as “Honor Flight allergies.” Vazquez was not immune. Vazquez grew up in Manati, Puerto Rico. As a young woman, she followed her oldest brother to New York City. She worked in a factory and a hospital, but wanted something different. She joined the U.S. Women’s Army Corps in October 1969. In addition to her service as a medic, she oversaw the setup and operation of field hospitals. She served in Germany and across the U.S., in Alabama, Texas, Georgia, Washington state, California and Hawaii. In 1978, Congress disbanded the Women’s Army Corps and its members were integrated into the Army. Vazquez remembers the formerly all-male units as welcoming. Most of the men “were happy to see us and train together,” she said. Vazquez retired from the military in October 1991. In retirement, she has dedicated much of her time to community service. She has volunteered with the Red Cross for 30 years and built homes with Habitat for Humanity. Since settling on Bailey Island, she has given her time to Harpswell Aging at Home and other local causes. Despite the climate, the island reminds her of Puerto Rico. Vazquez recommends the Honor Flight experience to fellow veterans — even though she didn’t enlist for recognition. “I just do things, and I don’t expect you to do anything in return,” Vazquez said about her service. “I just did it because ... I want to do it and I love to do it.” Honor Flight Maine arranges trips as it has funds available. The average cost per veteran is $1,000, and it has more than 450 on its waitlist. The organization serves veterans of all eras, but prioritizes older vets. For more information, go to honorflightmaine.org. Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

Miranda told exclusively earlier this year that she was when bringing this story to life. “I read a story about people who were doing a home renovation in their backyard, and they found a car just buried there,” the author explained. “They had no idea how long it had been there or how many years it had been there. And it made me start thinking about all the mysteries that might just be existing around us — hidden just under the surface.” When it comes to placing big reveals in her novels, Miranda admits she will “hold back” on certain things to hide it from the reader and keep the story going. “Those reveals allow me to provide a backbone of information that changes the perspective that the readers are seeing,” she added.

        "content": "RUTH Langsford once insisted she wouldn't be friends with an ex in a resurfaced clip, amid her shock split from Eamonn Holmes. The TV couple announced at the weekend that they are divorcing after 14 years of marriage . And now a clip from when Ruth and Eamonn, both 64, presented This Morning has revealed how she really feels about keeping in touch with former partners. While Eamonn said: \"It's easier to stay friends.\" But Ruth replied: \"Why would you need to stay friends? You aren't with them anymore, you don't need to be friends. \"My thing is you weren't just friends, you were married or had a relationship.\" Another forgotten interview from the pandemic saw Eamonn confess he and Ruth \"needed space\" from each other. In a joint interview with TalkTV host Kevin O'Sullivan, Eamonn admitted that the only time the pair really interacted was when they were working together. He said at the time: \"Although we live together, we're not really together, we don't watch the same TV, Ruth likes her own space, when we do This Morning it's a rare time we actually interrelate.\" Today it was reported that Ruth \"orchestrated\" her split from Eamonn , with him \"refusing\" to sign off on their joint statement. It’s believed Ruth was the one who OK’ed the simple statement, with Eamonn wanting no part in it. The Daily Mail claims Eamonn ‘told friends he didn’t want to get involved’ and ‘Ruth could do what she wants but keep him out of it’. The statement eventually simply read: “Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes have confirmed their marriage is over and they are in the process of divorcing.” While sources have said they are ‘dedicated to making the split amicable’, Eamonn has already left the family home for a property nearby. The couple have one son together, 22-year-old Jack. Before the shock split announcement, Ruth and Eamonn seemed like one of the strongest couples on UK TV – even with their signature bickering style. Here's how their romance played out 1997 - The couple first meet after being introduced by mutual friends, two years after Eamonn splits from his first wife, Gabrielle, with whom he has three children. 1997-2002 - To be respectful to Gabrielle, the couple kept their relationship out of the limelight. Ruth told Daily Mail : \"I thought it spoke volumes about the sort of man he was, the sort of father he was and the integrity he had. It made me love him more, not less.\" 2002 - Ruth and Eamonn welcome their son, Jack, to the family 2005 - Eamonn finalises his divorce with Gabrielle 2006 - The pair begin to host Friday episodes of This Morning together 2010 - Eamonn proposes to Ruth while at the Cheltenham Races, after asking Ruth's mother for her hand June 2010 - Eamonn and Ruth marry at Elvetham Hall, Hampshire 2016 - Eamonn undergoes a double hip replacement in the first of many health battles. June 2019 - On This Morning, Ruth and Eamonn say the secret to their happy marriage. Eamonn credits \"compromise, consideration and lots of conjugals,\" while Ruth said it was \"laughter and an equal marriage\" November 2020 - Ruth and Eamonn are replaced on their regular Friday slot by Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary in a 'show shake-up' December 202 1 - After a year of being moved to the bank holiday presenting slot, both Eamonn and Ruth left This Morning January 2022 - Eamonn makes his debut on GB News, while Ruth stayed with ITV in her long-standing role on Loose Women. September 2022 - Eamonn undergoes spinal surgery after years of back issues including a trapped sciatic nerve. November 2022 - Eamonn falls down the stairs of his Surrey home with Ruth and breaks his shoulder, requiring a new operation September 2023 - Eamonn has a spine and neck stretching procedure as part of his year-long recovery May 2024 - Ruth and Eamonn announce they have split after 14 years of marriage and 27 year relationship",

Obviously, you can give your kids your login and they can play your games under your account, but if you wanted to legally transfer your games to a loved one after you pass on, there is no real way to do it. This issue extends to digital movie purchases, music, apps and other software that you can only use within one app. Basically, if you can’t find the source file and move it around easily, you don’t own the program in perpetuity — just a license for it.

        "content": "France’s President Emmanuel Macron on Monday raised the alarm over the “ill wind” of the rise of the far right in European politics, during a state visit to Germany ahead of key EU elections. Macron noted a “fascination with authoritarian regimes” in Europe, singling out Viktor Orban’s government in Hungary for criticism. “Everywhere in our democracies these ideas thrive, pushed by the extremes and in particular the far right,” Macron said in a speech in the eastern city of Dresden, a bastion of support for Germany’s far right. “This ill wind is blowing in Europe, so let us wake up,” he said in front of the city’s famous Frauenkirche church. Macron’s trip comes two weeks ahead of European Union elections in which polls are indicating his centrist coalition is trailing the far right. It could even struggle to reach a third-place finish. Macron, undertaking the first state visit by a French president to Germany in a quarter of a century, made a plea for the defence of democracy against nationalist forces as he arrived on Sunday. In Germany too, all three parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s coalition are polling behind the far-right AfD in surveys, despite a series of scandals embroiling the anti-immigration party. – ‘New responsibility’ – “Europe is not just a place where we give ourselves common rules, it is a set of values,” Macron said. “We must find the strength and commitment to defend it everywhere,” he added. Macron also underlined the threat posed by Russian aggression since the invasion of Ukraine, saying Europeans had a “new responsibility” to guarantee peace. Without supporting Ukraine and stopping Russia from imposing the “law of the strongest” on the battlefield, there would be no peace in Europe, Macron said. “In Ukraine, it is your security, our peace that is at stake,” Macron told the Dresden audience. And Europe, he said, must think about “its own defence and security”. The French president repeated a warning that “our Europe could die”. – Holocaust memorial – Earlier, Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron together with the German presidential couple visited the Holocaust memorial in Berlin that commemorates the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis. Accompanying them was Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld and his German wife Beate, who underlined a resurgence of anti-Semitism, fuelled by Israel’s offensive in Gaza following Hamas’s attack on its territory. “It’s very good that the French president is meeting the German president before this monument, especially at a tragic time for the global Jewish community,” said Klarsfeld. The Klarsfelds have faced controversy lately over comments in favour of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whom they praise for her engagement against anti-Semitism as opposed to her father Jean-Marie Le Pen. Macron on Sunday labelled Le Pen’s National Rally a “threat to Europe”, stressing that he does not see them as “just another party”. The French president however skirted the issue as he presented the Klarsfelds with honours at the French embassy in Berlin to acknowledge their work “opening eyes” to the past and confronting crimes committed under the Nazis. Macron will on Tuesday travel to Muenster in western Germany, where he will be presented with the Westphalian Peace Prize. He will later meet with Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Meseberg, near Berlin, for a joint Franco-German meeting of ministers. Relations between the two leaders have been strained over their attitudes towards Europe and support for Ukraine, with the French president striking a more strident tone against Russia.

        "content": "Gujarat: The Rajkot court on Monday sent three accused men to a 14-day police remand in the game zone fire incident that claimed 28 lives. The additional judicial magistrate BP Thakar remanded three accused Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki, Nitin Jain and Rahul Rathod in police custody for two weeks, informed Tushar Gokani, special public prosecutor (SPP). Answering to media on Monday, Gokani said, “We told the court that the main accused are on the run, and these accused persons make evasive replies and are not cooperating with the investigating agencies”. An FIR has been lodged against six individuals, including the owner of TRP Game Zone, Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki, the manager Nitin Jain and others, at the Rajkot Taluka Police Station. Yuvraj Hari Singh Solanki and Rahul Rathod, both partners in Raceway Enterprise that operated the TRP game zone, along with Nitin Jain, the manager of the recreation centre, are currently under police detention. As per the FIR among the 28 bodies recovered, 15 were males, six were females and three were children. Due to severe burns, the gender of the three bodies remains undetermined and only fragments of one person were found. Forensic experts have been assigned the daunting task of identifying the victims via DNA analysis, a process that could span up to a week. This identification is crucial for bringing solace to the bereaved families. A team of forensic specialists has reached Rajkot to gather samples from the scene. The Gujarat government ordered the suspension of seven officials, including two police inspectors and civic staff of Rajkot Municipal Corporation, for “their gross negligence in allowing this game zone to operate without necessary approvals,” which led to the fire incident at a gaming zone in Rajkot. Following the incident, all the gaming zones in Vadodara were inspected and temporarily closed. The police are investigating all the facets of the said documents and investigation on the matter is underway, the SPP Gokani said. The Gujarat High Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the fire tragedy and has termed it a prima facie “man-made disaster”. The court noted that highly inflammable materials such as petrol, fibres, and fibreglass sheets were stored at the facility. The Gujarat government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) and announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 4 lakh to the family of each deceased person and Rs 50,000 for the injured. Additionally, the Central government has announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 2 lakh to the next of kin of each deceased person.",

        "content": "Beyoncé wasn’t always Queen Bee, according to her mom, Tina Knowles. “She was very shy, and she got bullied a bit,” the Knowles matriarch, 70, said in a video for Vogue , which she shared on Instagram. “But the day that she stood up for someone — she didn’t stand up for herself she stood up for them. I’m getting emotional talking about it. I was just, I couldn’t have been more proud of her.” Tina also discussed her other daughter, Solange, 37, describing her as an “activist.” She later praised Kelly Rowland, whom she has long considered a daughter. The Destiny’s Child alum moved in with the Knowles family as a tween. “Kelly was always this kid that just tried to protect everybody,” Tina said. “I have a memory of her with her best friend Barbara and her being a mediator and just being this little peacemaker.” The fashion designer then captioned the video by gushing about her three daughters. “Each child is different! But all so special. I believe kids are born with their personalities,” she wrote. “My three girls All handled things very differently. Learn their personalities and respect the individuality. “Never compare the negatives , always praise the positive differences and pay attention to the things that you can brag on about them. They love it and it encourages positive behavior.” Knowles is fiercely loyal to her girls. Most recently, she came to the defense of Rowland , who made headlines for scolding a security guard at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival. Start your day with Page Six Daily.

        "content": "The mother of two profoundly deaf children has described it as “shocking” that her children do not have Irish Sign Language support assistants. Emma Dooly O’Gorman’s daughter Pippa is seven and her son Jack is six and are in Senior Infants and Junior Infants respectively. “Both have had bilateral cochlear implant surgery which is the device that helps them to hear on a day to day basis,” Ms Dooly O’Gorman explained to The Hard Shoulder . “I suppose they have additional needs in addition to being deaf and wearing cochlear implants. “Pippa, firstly, has verbal dyspraxia which affects her ability to speak and Jack is autistic.” Since they entered formal education, Ms Dooly O’Gorman has searched “high and low” for someone to work with them as an Irish Sign Language Specialist Classroom Support professional. “It’s so much more than just interpreting,” she said. “It’s being there to help her to be in the classroom and be part of the class and part of the community in the school. “Yes, they teach our children ISL as well because obviously none of us are born knowing [ISL], so they have to learn the language first. “That is why it’s such an important role that they need to be able to access in a school environment.” The family regularly contacts the Department of Education but is “not getting any response” despite their best efforts. Increasingly, they are worried about the impact on their children’s mental health as well as their education. “You constantly get no information and that’s the most frustrating part,” Ms Dooly O’Gorman said. “In Jack’s class, there are two profoundly deaf children. “There’s only seven in Jack’s class, Jack goes to a special school and two of those children are profoundly deaf. “Both wearing bilateral cochlear implants and both not being entitled to this role. “The other little boy, both his parents are deaf, so Irish Sign Language is the only language that he is open to in his environment on a day to day basis. “It’s just shocking.” In the 2022 census, 233,420 people reported that they are deaf or have a hearing impairment.

        "content": "Prime Minister Hun Manet’s wife, First Lady Pich Chanmony, graced the Cambodian Children’s Fund (CCF) with her presence to commemorate 20 years of dedicated service to improving the lives of impoverished children and families in Cambodia. On the opening day of celebrations on Sunday she joined the festivities at Phnom Penh’s Stung Meanchey commune, where the CCF began its journey two decades ago. In her address, Chanmony expressed profound joy and pride for the privilege of presiding over the event, calling it an historic moment for the organisation’s noble cause. “Today marks a joyous and proud moment as I preside over the 20th anniversary of the Cambodian Children’s Fund and an unforgettable historic moment for the Cambodian Children’s Fund in its notable cause of the past two decades,” she said. Accompanied by Scott Neeson, founder of CCF, Chanmony lauded his genuine compassion and dedication towards Cambodian children, which she said had inspired her and her husband to support CCF’s mission. “Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Scott,” she said. She expressed heartfelt gratitude on behalf of Mr Hun Manet, urging both national and international philanthropists and stakeholders to extend their support to CCF. “Your assistance in all forms, whether through financial contributions to fund operations, donations of essential educational materials and equipment, or sharing of ideas, skills and knowledge, is invaluable to ensure the continued success of the Foundation’s endeavours,” the First Lady added. During the celebrations, Chanmony actively engaged with guests and toured various booths and displays, further strengthening her bond with the CCF community. Over 3,000 CCF students, family members, and invited guests attended a vibrant community street festival highlighting the celebrations. The event featured games, music, and performances by renowned artists, including Princess Norodom Jenna, Sai, Miss Vis, Puthika, and Sok Serey. Reflecting on CCF’s journey, Neeson reminisced about its humble beginnings, which started with the rescue of one girl and her family from the garbage dump in Stung Meanchey. “It started with one eight-year-old girl, Srey Nich, who lived and worked in the most horrendous conditions on the dump with her mom and sister. Today, we have around 2,000 children working towards a better life for themselves and their families,” he said. “We have expanded our reach to provide education, healthcare, and community support to impact more than 155,000 lives, which is remarkable.” Among the success stories is Sophy Ron, the first CCF student to win an international scholarship in 2017. After graduating from the University of Melbourne, she now works at a private school in Australia, crediting CCF for her achievements. “CCF has done so much for me. I would not be where I am today without CCF. They have given me everything,” said Sophy. Another inspiring tale is that of Heuv Nhanh. After spending years scavenging on the garbage dump, he found a new path through support from the organisation. Now a successful filmmaker, 30-year-old Nhanh emphasises the transformative power of education for shaping one’s destiny, saying, “I thought I would be a garbage picker for life; I didn’t think I had a future.” “When I think about the past, I cannot believe how much things have changed. If you have an opportunity to study like I was given, then you take it. And that’s your chance to change your destiny. You cannot change the past, but you can change the future,” he added.",

        "content": "The AUD/NZD is presently trading with mild fluctuations, expecting key figures from Australia and New Zealand along the week. On the Australian side, the focus is primarily on the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) and data. The CPI is projected to register a slight decrease, dropping to 3.4% YoY while Retail Sales are expected to recover somewhat. The outcome of the data might shape the expectations of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which has lately advocated for a cautious stance. On the other hand, the attention in New Zealand is directed towards the ANZ business survey data for May on Tuesday. The outcome might also shape the bets on the next Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ)'s monetary policy decisions. While the bank suggested a potential rate hike, market prediction indicates an opposing view, leaning towards a first rate cut in November. AUD/NZD technical analysis In the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits within negative territory. Despite an uptick in the latest reading to 30, the pair remains pressured, as the positive momentum observed earlier in the week has considerably waned. The negative trend, as suggested by the RSI, is further confirmed by the rising red bars of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram, affirming the downside momentum. AUD/NZD daily chart On a positive note, the pair currently trades above its 100 and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating potential medium-to-long-term upward momentum. However, the AUD/NZD's positioning below the 20-day SMA highlights the near-term volatility anticipated.",

        "content": "Jammu, May 27: The Special Judge for CBI Cases, Jammu Monday convicted two accused, including an investigator on the panel of Oriental Insurance Company (OIC), Jammu and a claimant, in a case related to bogus insurance claims. The quantum of punishment will be pronounced tomorrow i.e., May 28, 2024. According to a spokesperson of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the case was registered by Bureau on April 13, 2007 against the accused, including the duo convicted by the court on Monday (May 27, 2024) on the allegations that these persons entered conspiracy with one another, submitted bogus insurance claims for the dwelling houses reported to be located at Srinagar and which were reported to be gutted in fire during the year 1997-98. “It was further alleged that the accused obtained undue claim to the tune of Rs 9,52,913, approximately from the insurance company i.e., Oriental Insurance Company Limited though no fire incident took place during the relevant period as per the records of J&K Fire and Emergency Services Command, Srinagar,” the CBI spokesperson said. After completion of investigation, a charge-sheet was filed on February 18, 2009. The charge-sheet in relation to false claim in respect of residential building of Satish Chander Wasoori was filed against accused Subhash Saraf, surveyor; Raj Nath Tickoo, investigator; Satish Chander Wasoori, claimant (private person) and Badri Nath Koul, Development Officer, Oriental Insurance Company. Charges were framed on November 16, 2010 against all the accused. The accused Subhash Saraf, surveyor and Badri Nath Koul, Development officer expired during the trial, hence charges against them were abetted, the spokesperson said. After trial, the court held accused R N Tickoo and Satish Chander Wasoori guilty. “CBI examined 32 witnesses and 97 documents in support of the charges which stood the test of trial in the court,” the spokesperson said.",

In its recent newsletter, 10x Research pointed out ways to capitalize on the current Ethereum ETH/USD rally, offering insights into optimal strategies and market behaviors to watch. What Happened : In its newsletter titled “Should Traders Embrace The Ethereum Rally?,” 10x Research notes the impact of understanding new narratives that can “override everything.” For example, Bitcoin BTC/USD saw a 150% rally before its futures launch in December 2017 and an 80% increase prior to Coinbase's direct listing in April 2021. This pattern highlights the potential for the ongoing Ethereum rally, sparked by the narrative surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs . The team around lead analyst Markus Thielen points out several key observations. ETH > BTC Trade: Bitcoin has seen a modest 3% increase in futures open interest, while Ethereum’s surged by 45%, indicating a strong preference for ETH over BTC as the catalyst of choice. “The trade might be ETH > BTC, as that is the catalyst,” 10x Research notes. Institutional Moves: The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs can lead to significant price movements. Even the anticipation has already caused Ethereum futures open interest to increase by $4 billion. As ETF issuers prepare for sufficient capital on launch day, the rally may continue, driving ETH prices higher. Sectorwide Impact: The surge in DeFi's total value locked, increasing by $17 billion in a week to $107 billion, is also notable. Lido LDO/USD and Ethena ENA/USD have seen marked increases in their TVL, implying broader bullish sentiment that extends beyond just Ethereum. Lido (LDO) rallied from $1.50 to $2.60 after the announcement of unstaked ETH ETF approval, with more potential upside left.

Ethereum is up 25% over the last seven days compared to Bitcoin’s more muted 3% increase over the same time frame. Cryptocurrency traders have pointed out that Ethereum-related tokens like Ondo Finance ONDO/USD will benefit from the launch of spot exchange-traded funds. ONDO is up over 30% over the last seven days. Ethereum-based meme coins, such as Pepe PEPE/USD , up 75% over the last seven days, have also benefited. Price Action: At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,930, up 2% over the last 24 hours. Loading... Loading...

        "content": "With the rise in drowning cases at stone quarries, chief minister Pramod on Monday said state govt has started fencing stone quarries across the state. He said that people can visit waterfalls during the monsoon, but they should not venture into the water for swimming to avoid untoward incidents. State govt has taken all steps with regards to disaster management , the chief minister said a day after the two district magistrates issued orders prohibiting swimming in waterfalls, abandoned quarries, rivers, lakes and other water bodies in the state. “Those who were involved in illegal operation of stone quarries have left those quarries abandoned. Govt through disaster management funds will fence those quarries,” he said. The chief minister said that fencing has started, and it will be completed within the next two months. “People should not go to swim at these stone quarries as it is too risky. These quarries are deep and even those who know swimming have died in those quarries,” Sawant said. The chief minister said that the directorate of mines and geology (DMG) has directed all legal lease holders of stone quarries to install fences to avoid untoward incidents. State govt cannot deploy security at each and every waterfall, Sawant said. “We will install a precautionary board with instructions that people should not swim at the waterfall,” he said. Sawant chaired the State Disaster Management Authority meeting on monsoon preparedness at Mantralaya, Porvorim. He said that emergency working plan for both the airports in the state have been put in place for timely response. The CM said that the chief secretary and revenue secretary held various meetings with different departments as part of monsoon preparedness. He said state govt has granted Rs 1 lakh, Rs 50,000 and Rs 25,000 funds to the Corporation of the City of Panaji, municipalities and panchayats respectively. “We will provide more funds,” he said. Sawant said that 400 trained “Apada Mitras” have been trained by the fire department and police to tackle monsoon-related damages. He said that there are 11 multipurpose cyclone shelters in the state. “We can provide 500 people food and stay at these shelters,” the CM said.",

        "content": "Kishtwar, May 27: The Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kishtwar, Abdul Qayoom Monday convened a comprehensive security and crime review meeting at the District Police Lines (DPL) Kishtwar. The meeting was held in preparation for the upcoming religious festivities and Yatras and was attended by Additional SP Kishtwar; SDPOs; SHOs; In-charge Police Posts, Investigation Officers (IOs) and other senior officers.

The primary objectives of the meeting were to review recent crime trends; progress in ongoing investigations; enhance community policing; evaluate crime prevention initiatives; combat drug abuse; addressing bovine smuggling and review anti-militancy operations. “A thorough examination of recent crime trends and statistics in the Kishtwar district was conducted to identify areas of concern. The status of ongoing criminal investigations was reviewed to ensure timely resolution and justice for victims. Besides, strategies to strengthen community policing and enhance public safety were discussed, with an emphasis on community involvement in maintaining law and order,” a police spokesperson said. During the meeting, the effectiveness of current crime prevention initiatives was assessed to optimize resources and improve outcomes; measures to tackle drug abuse within the district were deliberated, focusing on prevention, rehabilitation and enforcement. Strategies to curb bovine smuggling activities were reviewed, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts to combat this illegal practice and updates on anti-militancy operations and strategies were provided, highlighting the importance of vigilance to ensure the safety and security of the region, the spokesperson said.

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Hashim Suleiman: Sycophancy around leadership; a big bane Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport Opinion Hashim Suleiman: Sycophancy around leadership; a big bane Published on May 27, 2024 By Daily Post Staff I was just listening to a programme on television about the ground breaking of the controversial coastal road that should have been an awesome project but for the mismanagement by the sort of individuals that my article of today wishes to describe and I indeed reconfirmed to myself that leadership may not necessarily be the problem but rather the availability of critical helpers and vision carriers even though it is incumbent on leaders to have all it takes to identify true love and fake one. His Excellency, Hope Uzodinma had been called upon to make a remark at this event and he showered encomiums on the President as expected and went to to inform the President that all Nigerian families were elated and happy because their children are benefiting from the Student’s Loan policy of Mr President and I paused owing to my criticality and be like, is this man not speaking about the same Student’s Loan of which the portal for application was launched barely a week or little more before now? You also had a Permanent Secretary by name Kofarmata adorned in his Yoruba cap and venturing into politics and calling to question a need to know questions by opposition and citizens, a critical ingredient of democracy, when did it become mandatory for civil servants to sycophant around a leader instead of itemizing professional tendencies around the workings of the policies of the president? Even though, I ascribed Governor Uzodinma his right to sycophancy as is with every or most Nigerians around power, my greater expectation was for the President to have recognized that was a lie and call him out immediately or afterwards unless of course if anyone was to tell me the President himself was not aware about the level of progress on the Student Loan programme and that would be pathetic and must elicit scare in a 42 years old self because I thought we should have since passed this stage of leaders allowing lies pass by them without identifying them immediately and calling them out for deterrence. All this can confirm in the interim perhaps is President Tinubu is not aware of the granular workings around his major policy statements and how they are being worked to fruition, recall Student Loan was one of those. For Governor Hope Uzodinma himself to boldly lie to the president by way of praises means he’s aware perhaps that indeed the president is not aware about the detailed workings and direction of his government. Such kind of shenanigans have become the bane of leadership from the Goodluck Jonathan era till date, when you see how supporters insist there cannot be criticism of the administrations and that lies must be told to the leader to make a point, in fact a popular rumor had it that different newspapers are printed for the presidents, this narrative was more prominent during the Buhari Presidency. I must also share the Goodluck Jonathan regime episode of me insisting to a confidant of the administration that the President cannot win the north owing to what I see back home and a meeting was conveyed with another northerner like me who worked with the then Vice President and this fellow denied me flat and made me look like a hater, he insisted Goodluck had no problems whatsoever in the north with the likes of Bafarawa, Shekarau etc, people whom I knew had become more of expired politicians at the time owing to the dissent that was developed on Goodluck Jonathan in that region, a lot has changed after all. Story short, this guy’s narrative was over my own and I was sure his sort of narrative held sway at the presidential villa, the rest is history. Go on the X handle today (formerly twitter) and see the conversations, the supporters of ruling parties at the federal or state levels simply disagree for their governments to be criticized, they insist everyone must tell the boss all is well per second and what they foolishly forget is their actions are the ones preventing their own participation in the various governments because who would want to loose attack dogs who can lie and attack everyone for a pot of porridge. It is when the government is under pressure that a need for shakeups can come up which can offer opportunities for those on the sidelines to get involved but their intellectual laziness which in the first instance is the reason they chose sycophancy will not allow them see and know that. Finally, while I agree that a leader may not have the luxury to know everything happening around them but I do know that certain leaders have all it takes to assemble machinery that is well equipped to fetch them the facts and critically examine them to ensure synergy with the ongoings in their administration and that was why in 2022, I had highlighted that those beautiful Asiwaju Tinubu recruits of 1999-2007 themselves do not know how to recruit sound people like them and such is leading to the so many errors and incoherence that is attracting too many bashings on the administration of President Bola Tinubu and I wish anyone could send this narrative to the president.

        "content": "World leaders were urged Monday to keep working toward an unprecedented agreement among nations that would give the World Health Organization (WHO) a stronger voice in fighting the next pandemic. The announcements came after negotiators failed to produce a draft of the agreement by the May 24 deadline, although talks are still ongoing and some form of pact is said to be on the table. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged delegates at the 77th World Health Assembly in Geneva to stay the course despite the missed deadline. The Ethiopian expert also said he was confident that such a goal could still be reached shortly. Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on the agreement in time for this health assembly and cross the finish line, but I remain confident that you still will because where there is a will, there is a way. Tedros also pointed out that the WHO negotiators had undertaken an immense task technically, legally, and politically for which they had been operating on a very ambitious timeline. You have demonstrated a clear commitment to reaching an agreement, he added. Ghebreyesus also underlined the uphill task posed by a torrent of misinformation that was undermining your negotiations. After negotiators brief the Assembly bringing together dignitaries from all 194 WHO Member States on Tuesday about what has been achieved so far, the body is to decide which course of action to take in the following months, including a revision of the 1969 International Health Regulations (IHR) governing health emergencies in a legally binding manner. These proposals might have a better chance of being adopted this week, it was explained. The WHO is interested in avoiding an encore of how the Covid-19 crisis was handled in the early 2020s: It was all about “Me first,” Ghebreyesus said of how vaccines were purchased and distributed, which triggered the Pandemic Agreement initiative.",

        "content": "Prince William hosts garden party at Buckingham Palace Prince Philip, who was known for his frankness and quick wit, left his grandson, Prince William , in stitches after making a sweary remark during a photoshoot. Despite not being the head of the monarchy, Prince Philip wielded significant influence behind the scenes, and his passing in 2021 prompted an outpouring of heartfelt tributes from fellow royals. Prince Harry lauded his late grandfather's \"seriously sharp wit\" and his knack for \"holding the attention of any room due to his charm - and also because you never knew what he might say next.\" Prince William was all too familiar with his grandfather's propensity for off-the-cuff remarks, and was once spotted trying to suppress his laughter when Philip lost his cool. It happened in 2015, during the 75th anniversary celebration of the Battle of Britain - a pivotal event in World War II where the British Armed Forces defended Great Britain against German air attacks.

The photographer was taking his time getting everyone ready for the picture, which irked Prince Philip, who was 94 years old at the time. Philip, who served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, snapped - and used some pretty informal language to make his displeasure known. \"Just take the f*****g picture,\" Philip told the photographer, a moment that was caught on film by the Telegraph.

Philip's son Prince Edward - who now holds his late father's title of Duke of Edinburgh - also seemed to attempt to hold in his own giggles at Philip's impatience. Needless to say, the photographer quickly obeyed Philip's pretty brusque request, and once the picture was successfully captured, Philip was free to leave his posed seated position and got up immediately.

        "description": "The aircraft is the fifth to join the airline's fleet.",
        "content": "The gang is finally together! On Saturday, Azul Linhas Aéreas received its final Disney-liveried aircraft, an Airbus A320neo, with Goofy as the main character. In 2023, announced it would add a fifth Disney-themed aircraft to its fleet. At the time, it had already received four and had completed the “family,” or so we thought. Every one of the planes has been a new delivery from the Airbus facilities in Toulouse, France. Azul has nicknamed its Disney planes the “Magical Fleet,” playing on Disney’s marketing. Yesterday, the family was complete with the arrival of Goofy. The new aircraft is an Airbus A320neo. It began its journey from Europe on Friday and arrived on Saturday night at Aeroporto Internacional Belo Horizonte (commonly referred to as Confins because of its location near the city). There, the aircraft will go through its certification procedures to join the airline’s operations. According to Azul, the livery was designed by Walt Disney World Resort artists. The livery highlights Goofy’s special characteristics, like his iconic ears. After its assembly in Toulouse, the A320neo was painted at Airbus and delivered to the airline. “The aircraft in the ‘Most Magical Fleet In The World’ are very special to us at Azul because of the way they make customers happy and impact the customer experience. The happiness and sparkle in the eyes of adults and children when they discover they are flying on one of these planes is evident. Goofy is a classic, representing diversity and good humor, and we believe that the aircraft does just that.” Daniel Bicudo, Marketing and Business Director, Azul Linhas Aéreas In November 2021, Azul received its first Disney aircraft, ‘Mickey Mouse Nas Nuvens.’ Like Goofy, the Mickey plane is an Airbus A320neo. Registered as PR-YSH, the A320neo was the 50th of the type to join the airline’s fleet. Mickey was followed by ‘Minnie Mouse Nas Nuvens’ and ‘Pato Donald Nas Nuvens’, in February and June of 2022, respectively. The Minnie Mouse aircraft is the only one in the fleet on an A321neo, of which Azul has only six. When the Daisy aircraft joined the fleet, it was thought it would be the final one. Then, in February of 2023, the airline announced a pleasant surprise: there would be a fifth aircraft. There had been speculation for a long time that there would be a fifth plane and that it would be Goofy. And the rumors were true. Azul held a special event at its Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) hangar at Aeroporto Internacional de Viracopos, its main hub, to announce the fifth aircraft. All the characters from the first four planes made a special appearance, and two Brazilian singers gave a special performance of When You Wish Upon A Star. Azul’s CEO and Disney Destinations’ Senior Vice President were present to make the announcement.",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Army reopens Banex plaza Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport Metro Army reopens Banex plaza Published on May 27, 2024 By John Gabriel The Nigerian Army said it has met with the leadership and management of Banex Plaza, Wuse, over the unprovoked attack by unidentified hoodlums on Nigerian Army personnel and resolved to reopen the plaza immediately. DAILY POST recalls that unidentified hoodlums, on Saturday, May 18, 2024, launched unprovoked attacks on Nigerian Army personnel at Banex Plaza, Wuse, Abuja, leading to the closure of the plaza. Major General Onyema Nwachukwu, Director, Army Public Relations, said in a statement that a meeting was convened in the Office of the National Security Adviser in the presence of the Principal General Staff Officer to the NSA, FCT Commissioner of Police, FCT Director of the Department of State Services, a representative of the Directorate of Abuja Environmental Protection Board, and the national chairman of the Mobile Phone Traders Association, where the leadership of Banex Plaza was instructed to lock up Shop C93 with immediate effect. According to the statement, the owners of the shop that orchestrated the mob attack on the soldiers are to be arrested and handed over to the Nigerian Police. The statement further added: “Market leaders are to remain vigilant and report any remaining perpetrators to the authorities. Furthermore, the two individuals already arrested have been handed over to the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police for further action.” The Nigerian Army said it will also thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the presence of its personnel at the plaza and the subsequent attack. “It must be reiterated that acts of violence against military personnel are not only condemnable but also pose a significant threat to national security and public order. We therefore urge members of the public to exercise caution and restraint when interacting with military personnel and other security operatives, especially when they are in uniform. There are established channels for reporting grievances or misconduct by personnel to the appropriate authorities,” the statement stressed.

        "content": "ABUJA – The Transmission Company of Nigeria, (TCN) on Monday decried the increasing spate of vandalism of electricity assets in the North East region, saying that as its engineers are working on reconstructing and restringing the four vandalised towers, three towers along the Biu – Danbua 132kV transmission line were also vandalized with 16 spans of conductors stolen. Ndidi Mbah, the General Manager, Public Affairs, who made this known in a statement, said that these vandalism incidents collapse three towers along Biu-Dambua 132kV and remove tower members on one tower along Makurdi-Jos 330kV transmission line. According to the statement, the incident occurred at about 7am, on 27th May, 2024, morning while the contractor was stringing the cable on the last tower, which was supposed to enable the final jointing of the power cable in time for energizing of the line the same day. “TCN hereby states that tower number T290, one of the four new towers erected by TCN contractors along the Jos – Gombe 330kV transmission line collapsed during the cable stringing process. “The incident occurred at about 7am, this morning, 27th May, 2024, while the contractor was stringing the cable on the last tower, which was supposed to enable the final jointing of the power cable in time for energizing of the line today. “Despite of the security challenges in the area, TCN contractors and some of our engineering staff worked tirelessly to fast-track the project, doing all that was humanly possible to meet the time-line. Daily, the contractor, TCN engineers accompanied by security operatives consistently left the site by 10pm in the night and resumed work at 6am every day. “Constructing towers and stringing power cables at such heights is highly technical, although TCN contractors and staff have successfully completed similar projects in other parts of the country. The collapse of the fourth tower is a significant setback, given the extensive efforts to ensure that today’s power restoration timeline was met. “Our contractor is currently dismantling the collapsed tower members, to enable its reconstruction and final restringing of the cable. “It is unfortunate to note that while TCN is working on reconstructing and restringing the four vandalised towers, three (3) towers along the Biu – Danbua 132kV transmission line were also vandalized with 16 spans of conductors stolen. The towers, which have all collapsed include towers T1690, T1691 and T1692. TCN has mobilized a contractor to commence their reconstruction. This discovery was made by TCN patrol team, last Friday. “Additionally, this morning, the TCN lines patrol team discovered that tower T540 along the Makurdi – Jos 330kV double circuit transmission line has been vandalised. Sections of the tower have been removed, although the tower remains standing. TCN has contracted emergency repairs, to prevent its collapse. “We reiterate our commitment to restoring normal bulk power supply through the distribution companies serving the North East and other areas affected by vandalism. There is however an urgent need for everyone to join hand with TCN in protecting our collective assets by being vigilant and reporting any suspected acts of tower and line vandalism promptly” the statement reads in parts.",

        "content": "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Java Blend employees have won their union. After a settlement was reached yesterday, ballots cast a year ago in a vote to unionize were finally counted this morning – and 91% of workers voted to join SEIU Local 2. “We are very proud – this wasn’t easy,” said Andy Mawko, one of the worker leaders. “We stood up for ourselves and fought for what was right. When we fight, we win!” “We are excited to start negotiations in good faith as soon as possible,” said Em Kristensen, another one of the terminated leaders. “We are looking forward to winning a collective agreement that addresses concerns like job security, health and safety protections and setting the foundation for a long-term relationship between the Java Blend and our Union.” This is a big win for the workers at Java Blend. “We have an important message to the beautiful community that supported us,” said Cailen Pygott. “Together, we can achieve incredible things! From regular customers to prominent leaders, artists like El Jones, and from businesses that believe in doing the right thing: Thank you. Halifax is a Union town — and we encourage all non-union service workers to unite and organize.” There is an agreement to start good faith bargaining soon and to reach the best possible collective agreement over the next four weeks. The agreement includes a provision to start recalling terminated employees; their dismissal was the subject of an Unfair Labour Practice complaint filed by SEIU, which has now been withdrawn. The Union won a bargaining unit that includes the Java Blend cafes on North St and Sackville in Halifax, the production and roastery warehouse on Borden Ave. in Dartmouth, as well as the Cortado Tasting Room in Bedford. If a deal is not ratified in the agreed timeframe, the parties have agreed to conciliation. The Union has called off the boycott of Java Blend and all it’s products.

Making this disclosure while speaking on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Monday, Tanko revealed that Nigerians were tired of the misrule of the current government. “You see, the fact is that Nigerians, political parties and leaders are tired of the shenanigans and the propaganda that is already happening in Nigeria...In that regard, many Nigerian politicians are interested in working with Mr Peter Obi to get Nigerians out of the woods,” Tanko said. Naija News reports that his comment comes as news of a possible merger between Peter Obi’s Labour Party and Atiku’s People Democratic Party continues to circulate. 2027: Peter Obi Replies Atiku, Discloses Only Condition That Would Make Him Agree To A Merger The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 elections, Peter Obi has given conditions that would make him agree to a merger between his party and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2027 elections. Obi stated that he would only enter into a merger with any party or individual if it serves the greater good of Nigeria. The former Anambra State governor disclosed this during an interview with NoireTV at the weekend. Reacting to a statement by the presidential candidate of the PDP and former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, on the likelihood of a merger between both parties, Obi insisted that an alliance must be focused on improving governance and helping the poor, not just winning elections or for state capture.",

        "description": "Walton always said, “Life is about growing.” Only now does he stop.",
        "content": "There is so much to talk about today now that the great Bill Walton has died at the age of 71 , died and left behind a world that won’t be nearly as smart without him, or curious, one that could never be as much fun without Bill Walton in it. He was the basketball hippie who played for John Wooden, he was tent follower for the Grateful Dead, and was a campus activist at UCLA, a 60s kid there even though he didn’t arrive until the 1970s. And later in his life, much later, he reinvented himself all over again as everybody’s colorful and occasionally crazy uncle talking about basketball on television, wanting you appreciate the game he was watching as much as he did. “I know they call soccer the beautiful game,” he told me once. “Not as beautiful as basketball.” So on the day of his passing, a day when basketball mourns a death in its family for a man famous in that sport for more than 50 years, what you need to remember about Bill Walton is that he was the one with the beautiful game. Bill Walton was the one who played the position of center with an unparalleled combination of skill and grace and imagination and passion, who when he was young and before he started getting hurt, played that position as well as it could possibly be played. My dear friend Bob Ryan, the great columnist and Hall of Fame NBA writer from the Boston Globe, someone who wrote about pro basketball as well as it could ever be written, once said that if you brought all the all-time best players to an imaginary playground, and your job was to pick the best team, his first pick would have been the young Bill Walton. He is talking about the Walton from UCLA who once shot 21-for-22 in an NCAA title game; the Walton who won a championship with the Trailblazers in 1977, beating Julius Erving and George McGinnis and a kid named Darryl Dawkins in the Finals after losing the first two games; the Walton whose Trailblazers were 55-10 the season after that title before Walton injured his foot and his basketball life was permanently changed. “He just exuded life,” Ryan said on Monday afternoon after he had learned of Walton’s death from cancer. “He exuded life and loved life and in all the years when I knew him, there wasn’t a part of life that he didn’t find interesting. And he loved basketball completely, mostly because he considered it an art form.” Walton played on a high school team, Helix High, in La Mesa, Cal. that won its last 49 games. He once won 88 games in a row at UCLA after his team won its first 73 games. In that ’73 title game against Memphis, he scored 44 points and had 13 rebounds and seven blocked shots. He became an MVP with the Blazers and MVP of the NBA Finals and then, after years of surgeries on his feet and ankles, he came back with the Celtics and became Sixth Man of the Year on the 1986 Celtics team that had Larry Bird and Robert Parish and Kevin McHale and won it all. When Walton was traded to the Celtics that year, one of the first things he did was drive over to Robert Parish’s house and say, “I’m not here to take your job. I’m here to help.” And help he did, becoming one of the most remarkable sixth men in NBA history, and forming an extraordinary combination with Parish at the center position. This from a man who used to joke that his legs were really shot by the time he got to UCLA and that “I really peaked when I was 12.” And, of course, his fierceness about his beliefs and political convictions was as deep as his love for his sports. He was arrested in 1972 for protesting the Vietnam War and, in a world before we ever even thought about things going viral, the image of him being arrested on Wilshire Ave. did go viral, Walton’s arms above his head. Truly, he was a child of the 60s in that moment, a kid who had grown up watching Muhammad Ali make protest and political dissent into something noble. He would later become a far more controversial figure because of those beliefs, supporting his friend Jack Scott when the FBI was after Scott for harboring members of the Symbionese Liberation Army. Walton spoke out against his own government again, referring to the FBI as “the enemy.” At the time, there wasn’t another prominent white athlete in America staking out political ground like this, or speaking out in protest as Walton did from Black churches. But Walton never did these things for show, whether you agreed with his positions or not. He believed what he believed. “One of a kind,” that’s the way NBA commissioner Adam Silver describes him. And Bill Walton was. “I know I’ve gotten twice as much as I deserve because I’m white,” Walton once said. Even long after his playing career ended, Walton’s body continued to betray him. He would speak on more than one occasion about debilitating back pain in his 50s that he said had him considering suicide. He once calculated that he’d had three dozen orthopedic surgeries in his life. This still a remarkable life, when you consider the sweep of it from high school on. Walton was eventually voted as one of the 50 best players in NBA history. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame 31 years ago. And through it all, whether as a player or broadcaster who overcame a speech impediment, Bill Walton continued to do this one thing: He made the gym better as soon as he walked into it. I was lucky enough to see him play at his best. I was lucky enough to get to know him later in his life, and mine. I was glad my sons got to meet him. Bill Walton always said, “Life is about growing.” Only now does he stop.",

        "content": "The Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Cambodia office convened the 2024 ‘Host Organisation Annual Meeting’ of the World Friends Korea (WFK) programme on Friday. Attended by esteemed guests including Phana Veunida, Deputy Secretary-General of the Cambodian Development and Cooperation Board of the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDCB/CDC), and Choi-Moon Jung, Country Director of KOICA Cambodia, alongside representatives from approximately 21 governmental organisations, the conference aimed to introduce the volunteer programme and foster discussions on various pertinent topics, including safety and security, volunteer regulation, small-scale project support, and volunteer competency. Since the signing of the diplomatic agreement on volunteer dispatch between the Republic of Korea and Cambodia in 2001, WFK-KOICA volunteers have served as agents of mutual understanding and progress. The inaugural cohort of five volunteers arrived in Cambodia in 2003, marking the commencement of a significant partnership. Over the years, the WFK volunteer programme has grown substantially, with nearly 960 volunteers having contributed to various sectors such as Korean language education, early childhood education, computer education, and nursing. To streamline volunteer efforts and facilitate effective communication between KOICA and partner governmental organisations, the KOICA Cambodia office has made it a tradition to host an annual conference for volunteer host organisations. The conference saw the recognition of outstanding partner organisations within the WFK programme. The Kampong Thom Provincial Office of Education, Youth and Sport and the National Technical Training Institute (NTTI) were lauded for their exceptional collaboration, training services and care provided to volunteers, and efforts to support the sustainability of volunteer-led projects. The conference served as a platform for robust discussions and idea exchange, with partner organisations actively contributing insights for programme enhancement. Choi-Moon expressed gratitude to all participants for their valuable contributions and reiterated KOICA’s commitment to elevating the quality and scope of the volunteer dispatch programme. She outlined plans for promoting multi-year volunteer teams, performance-driven initiatives, and gradually restoring pre-COVID-19 dispatch levels. Veunida emphasised the strategic partnership between Cambodia and South Korea, underscoring their joint commitment to enhancing cooperation and partnerships.

        "description": "Police said they closed the elevated wooden walkway just after midnight after receiving an \"irrepressible number\" of complaints about an \"extremely large number of young adults & juveniles\" flooding the shore town.",
        "content": "The New Jersey shore town Wildwood closed its popular boardwalk for a few hours early Sunday morning after hordes of “unruly, undisciplined” teens descended on the walkway, local officials said. Police shut down the boardwalk to the public just past midnight after receiving an “irrepressible number” of complaints about an “extremely large number of young adults & juveniles” visiting the boardwalk for Memorial Day Weekend, according to a statement from authorities. City officials did not cite a specific incident that led them to shut down the boardwalk, but claimed that cops were addressing “civil unrest.” Conditions “began to deteriorate despite the presence and efforts of local police officers and multiple mutual aid law enforcement agencies,” the statement adds. Wildwood Mayor Ernie Troiano, Jr. said that the city had declared a “state of emergency” – which allows it to send an abnormally large police presence to the area – and blamed the situation on “unruly” teens. “Wildwood will not tolerate unruly, undisciplined, unparented children nor will we stand by while the laws of the state tie the hands of the police,” Troiano, Jr said in a news release. “We wholeheartedly support the City of Wildwood Police Department in protecting this community from these nuisance crowds on our boardwalk and in the city,” the mayor added. Local cops were so busy responding to the “unrest” on the boardwalk that “we were unable to respond to certain calls for service within the city for a period of time,” Wildwood city officials said in the statement. Police re-opened the boardwalk at around 5:30 a.m., removing police tape that had been set up at the walkway’s entrances, according to a report from NBC10 Philadelphia. A rainstorm that erupted overnight also helped disperse whatever crowds remained, video from the scene shows. Local authorities said they would be giving “no further statements or interviews” explaining why they declared the state of emergency “in honor of the solemness” of the Memorial Day holiday. The boardwalk shutdown comes a day after a 15-year-old boy was stabbed on the boardwalk in nearby Ocean City Saturday night, spending panicked crowds of beachgoers fleeing the area.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON — UCLA Chancellor Gene Block found himself in the nation’s culture wars hot seat this past week, interrogated by members of Congress about his handling of complaints of campus antisemitism, amid student protests over the Israel-Hamas war. For Republican Congress members, the hearing organized by the GOP-led House Committee on Education and the Workforce was a chance to present the University of California, Los Angeles as exhibit A in how not to deal with protests. Almost as soon as activists set up a Palestinian solidarity encampment April 25 in the heart of campus, Jewish students and faculty complained that demonstrators established checkpoints restricting access to many students, at times singling out students they identified as Zionists. After pro-Israeli counterprotesters attacked the encampment on April 30, it was dismantled May 2, with law enforcement arresting more than 200 people. “Over the course of years, decades even, universities gradually nurtured a campus culture of radicalism, in which antisemitism grew and became tolerated by administrators,” Virginia Foxx, the commitee chair, said in her opening remarks. The Republican from North Carolina assailed Block for allowing UCLA’s protests to spiral out of control. “For days, you stood by as Jews were assaulted and illegal checkpoints blocked access to campus in broad daylight,” Foxx said. “Your actions were too little, too late.” In his opening testimony, Block conceded that UCLA made errors in judgment. The encampment, he said, “disrupted normal access to some classes” and “impeded our educational mission.” “With the benefit of hindsight,” he said, “we should have been prepared to immediately remove the encampment if and when the safety of our community was put at risk.” Block did not specify what UCLA should have done to prevent discrimination or violence as protests ramped up. And he did not explain why the university did not take action as students reported discrimination from protesters and outside agitators gathered on campus. Striking a mild, noncombative approach throughout, Block did not say what campus discipline had been — or would be — meted out to students who violated UCLA rules. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., criticized UCLA leaders for standing by for hours as a “mob of agitators” gathered near the encampment. Block said he rejected the premise of the question. Block said the Los Angeles Police Department was working to identify the attackers. Rep. Kevin Kiley, a California Republican, asked Block whether physically obstructing students from entering campus based on their race, ethnicity or religion is an expellable offense. ‘There is a disciplinary process,” Block said. “It could be.” Kiley played a viral video showing UCLA protesters blocking a student, Eli Tsives, from passing a checkpoint. “Were those students who formed blockade?” Kiley said. “Were they disciplined?” Block said he didn’t know, repeating that he sent out a memo April 30 instructing the campus community that blocking students’ passage was intolerable. Block, who is Jewish and has family members who died in the Holocaust, said UCLA has a problem with antisemitism. “I am fully aware that many of our Jewish students have had to confront rhetoric and images on campus that any reasonable person would find repugnant,” Block said in his opening statement. “Trust me, I understand their pain.” Asked by Rep. Kathy Manning, a Democrat from North Carolina, about emails dating to 2014 that show alumni had alerted the chancellor of growing antisemitism, Block said the university had tried to respond with training. About 90 percent of students, he said, had taken an online training course that includes discussion of antisemitism. Manning asked whether students and staff need additional training. “I think we need to do more,” Block said.",

        "content": "A woman will stand trial Aug. 19 for allegedly possessing almost 2 pounds of cocaine in her residence. Charnelle N. Mond, 27, listed with an alternate residence in , appeared Friday in and entered a not-guilty plea for a charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, a Class X felony. Mond was charged April 25 after drug agents raided a Peru dwelling and seized about 900 grams of purported cocaine, according to prosecutors. Elevated drug felonies are weight-dependent, meaning Mond could face 12 to 50 years in prison if convicted and if lab testing confirms the volume reached 900 grams. Mond, who was granted the services of a public defender, will next appear Aug. 9 for a motions hearing. She had been granted pretrial release. Mond was charged after the Tri-County Drug Enforcement Narcotics Team and Peru police officers executed a search warrant of Mond’s residence and found ammunition and guns (including a stolen shotgun, police said) “littered throughout” the residence, prosecutors had said. Although Mond had a firearm owner’s identification card, a second individual is charged with unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon in addition to the drug charge. Robert L. Wright Jr., 38, was denied pretrial release in part because authorities allege that the convicted felon was within “arm’s reach” of a firearm during the drug raid, the judge had said. Wright is in custody and thus is subject to a speedier trial demand. He will next appear July 11 for a motions hearing and again July 18 for a final pretrial conference.",
