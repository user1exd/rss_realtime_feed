        "description": "Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5 000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future.",
        "content": "That figure is an increase from the 1 000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said some Gaza residents had arrived in Canada under the program, but a precise tally was not immediately available. Nearly 36 000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike.",

For decades, the CIA has analysed African heads of state ahead of their visits to the United States, profiling them through \"visit pieces\" for the use of government officials, according to Judd Devermont , a former White House Africa director.",

        "description": "The DA is filing an an application in the Electoral Court against President Cyril Ramaphosa, for violating the Electoral Code of Conduct and the EFF wants an investigating into the \"misuse\" of the state broadcaster, the SABC.",
        "content": "The DA is hauling President Cyril Ramaphosa before the Electoral Court, accusing him of abusing his office for political gain using a \"national address\" to the nation via the SABC. Opposition parties have lashed out at Ramaphosa over his address to the nation on Sunday night. According to the DA, Ramaphosa violated the Electoral Code of Conduct when he \"abused the highest office in the land for flagrant electioneering\". In his address, Ramaphosa detailed the progress made during the sixth administration. The EFF wants an investigation into the \"misuse\" of the SABC by Ramaphosa's office to avoid a repeat in the future. Ramaphosa also spoke on the significance of Wednesday's election and other security matters, but a large part of his speech was about his government's successes. These included the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, tackling corruption and gender-based violence. READ | 'We don't live in castles in the sky,' says Zille on DA's chances of winning 51% nationally in polls The signing into law of the National Health Insurance Bill was also one of Ramaphosa's major talking points. But DA leader John Steenhuisen is taking Ramaphosa to task on this issue by filing an application in the Electoral Court for violating the Electoral Code. In a statement, he said the Electoral Code of Conduct, as contained in the Electoral Act, states expressly that no person may abuse a position of power, privilege or influence, including parental, patriarchal, traditional or employment authority, to influence the conduct or outcome of an election. \"Ramaphosa's manipulation was cynical, calculated and designed to influence the outcome of the election by providing the ANC with unearned airtime [that was] not made available to any other party contesting the election. \"Not for the first time, Ramaphosa has chosen his corrupt political party over South Africa. As the president, he should have known better and must be held to account. This type of abuse cannot be allowed by anyone,\" Steenhuisen said. WRAP | COMMENT: Ramaphosa 'abuses' national address to cynically campaign for the ANC According to Steenhuisen, the \"desecration\" of the office Ramaphosa holds confirms that he is panicked. \"Because he has finally realised that the people are about to hold the ANC to account for the corruption, misrule and hardship they have inflicted upon the people of South Africa. The DA, therefore, calls on voters to turn out to the polling booths in their millions to help us bring an end to the ANC's impunity and abuse of our democracy for narrow personal and political gain,\" he said. Furthermore, Steenhuisen said Ramaphosa \"has clearly signaled that the ANC is prepared to undermine our constitutional democracy to try to cling to power\". \"This should serve as an urgent warning to all of our democratic institutions, including the IEC. If Ramaphosa is willing to abuse his office for narrow political gain even before the ANC has lost its majority, what else will he be willing to do to subvert the will of the people and cling to power after voters take away the ANC's majority on Wednesday? \"If voters needed any further confirmation that the hunger for power and the corruption of the ANC constitutes an urgent threat to the values upon which our constitutional democracy is based, Ramaphosa provided it last night,\" he said. Presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya told News24 the criticism is unfounded because Ramaphosa's address was a stately account of the work done during the course of the sixth administration. \"The president was, therefore, being accountable to the nation as we end the term of the 6th administration. Secondly, he was taking the responsibility of assuring South Africans that these elections are going to be free and fair and, more importantly, safe. That responsibility can only be discharged by a sitting head of state,\" Magwenya said. He also argued that in his address, Ramaphosa, did not mention the governing party, nor did he criticise other political parties. \"In fact, he commended all parties for the peaceful manner in which they have campaigned and thanked all parliamentarians for the work they've done over the concluding term. Lastly, the president paid tribute to all South Africans who worked together with government when the country was going through challenging times, like the Covid-19 pandemic, the floods in KZN and other parts of the country and during the 2021 riots,\" he said. According to Magwenya, the address was not about campaigning. \"The president, as he must, was being the president of all South Africans with the address,\" he said. Meanwhile, the EFF has also expressed its concern and condemned Ramaphosa for using the SABC for political gain. The party condemned the \"hijacking of the state broadcaster for partisan purposes\". \"It is clear that there is fear within the ANC ranks of an imminent loss and they are resorting to desperate measures to stay in power,\" the EFF said in a statement. \"The unscheduled address is a blatant misuse of presidential powers and state resources, aimed at furthering the interests of the ANC rather than serving the South African public.\"",

        "content": "A popular shopping hub in the nation's capital, Banex Plaza, has now been reopened after it was closed for a week due to clashes between soldiers and traders. According to PoliticsNigeria, the plaza resumed operations at 2:30 PM on Monday, May 27, marking the end of a tense period that had disrupted business activities. The closure was initiated after an incident involving personnel from the Nigerian Army Corps of Military Police and traders at the plaza. The confrontation escalated into physical altercations involving passersby and security guards, leading authorities to temporarily shut down the facility to ensure public safety and order. According to reports, the reopening was agreed upon after successful resolutions between the traders involved in the altercations and military authorities. This agreement comes as a relief to many business owners and customers who frequent the bustling electronics and telecommunications market. The initial clash that prompted the closure occurred when four military police personnel retaliated against traders following a previous disagreement. The reopening signifies a return to normalcy and the restoration of business activities at one of Abuja’s major commercial centers.",

If it is so, why not allow our local people to fly our flag? Why bring a foreigner to fly our flag? “So nobody should deceive you that it is Air Nigeria. Air Nigeria must be indigenous, wholly Nigeria or must be for the full benefit of Nigerians. Not that 60 percent of the profit is given to another country. “How does that benefit us? It remains suspended. It remains so,” he said. Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "Operatives of the Rivers State Police Command have arrested four serving personnel of the Nigerian Army and nine others for hijacking and diverting trailer-loads of goods in Rivers State. Also arrested was a personnel of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and eight other civilians who are members of a 13-man syndicate that specialises in hijacking and diversion of trailer-loads of goods. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Grace Iringe-Koko, in a statement in Port Harcourt on Monday, gave the names of the soldiers as West Isaac, Abdul Musa, Mgbe Geoffrey and Innocent Okwoli. Iringe-Koko also disclosed the identity of the NSCDC personnel as Jabila Kammangar, while their civilian collaborators are Olisa Emeka, George Obilor, Sampson Wilson, Alfred Abeke, Barry John, Auwalu Aliyu, Uchenna Nwali, and Alhaji Sofinu Haruna. The statement reads in part: “Investigations by the Rivers State Police Command, following arrests for attempted burglary, have revealed a wide range of criminal activities. “On March 4, 2024, at approximately 11 pm, the Rivers State Police Command received a distress call about burglars who were attempting to vandalise warehouses in Elimgbu owned by Mr. Emmanuel Nwangwu and Mrs. Ndifreke Ekanem. The police promptly mobilised to the scene and arrested five suspects who had been severely beaten by a mob. “The wounded suspects were taken to the police hospital as investigations began. During the investigation, it was discovered that one of the suspects, West Isaac (08NA/61/2653), was a corporal in the Nigerian Army serving in Delta State. “Another suspect, Jabila Kammangar, also known as ‘Kaka,’ was an officer of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps serving in Kabba, Kogi State. They confessed to abandoning their posts to engage in criminal activities in Rivers State due to its lucrativeness. “Corporal West, a 36-year-old father of four from Buguma, Rivers State, joined the Army in 2008 and was assigned to the 3rd Battalion in Warri. He left his base on a sick pass and failed to return even after it expired, remaining absent for over a month until his arrest. “West disclosed to the police that he met Kaka while serving in the Army’s Anti-Bunkering Unit, and together, they engaged in several illegal activities. He further revealed that he came to Port Harcourt after receiving a call from Kaka about raiding warehouses, which led to their capture. “Further investigations revealed that they were part of a larger criminal ring specialising in armed robbery, hijacking, and goods diversion. Corporal West disclosed to the police that he and other Army personnel had been key players in the group. Besides ransacking warehouses, they had a network of informants who provided information about the schedules of goods-bearing trailers. “They would then dress in full military gear, lay in wait for the trailers, and accost them with a white Hilux van as they approached. They would intimidate the drivers, assault them, and hand their keys to designated drivers, who would then divert the trailers to waiting receivers. “Based on his confessional statement, the police were able to track down and arrest Lance Corporal Abdul Musa (13NA/70/10545), Lance Corporal Mgbe Jeoffrey (16NA/75/6896), and Corporal Innocent Okwoli (12NA/68/6552), all personnel of the Nigerian Army. “Additionally, eight civilian collaborators in the syndicate were arrested: Olisa Emeka, George Obilor, Sampson Wilson, Alfred Abeke, Barry John, Auwalu Aliyu, Uchenna Nwali, and Alhaji Sofinu Haruna. “The group’s key coordinator was Corporal Innocent Okwoli, a native of Otakpo in Benue State and a soldier stationed at Intels in Onne. Okwoli stated that he started leading hijacking operations after being introduced to the activity by an individual named Abbas and two unnamed Naval officers. Following a successful operation, he formed his team.” Police listed their numerous crimes to include hijacking of a trailer loaded with fertiliser valued at N25 million belonging to Alhaji Sadiq Adams on February 17, 2024. “On March 4, 2024, the group attempted to burgle warehouses owned by Emmanuel Nwagwu and Ndifreke Ekanem. “In February 2024, a 40-foot container filled with imported clothing from China was hijacked and diverted. “In February 2024, a trailer carrying POP cement was hijacked and diverted. The police have since recovered the stolen POP cement and are working to retrieve a trailer load of fertiliser from its receiver. Additionally, a white Toyota Hilux used in the gang’s operations has been recovered from the NSCDC officer. Three of the affected soldiers have been dismissed by the Nigerian Army after being handed over by the police.” Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Rivers State, Olatunji Disu, has expressed his profound appreciation for the swift and decisive cooperation of the military authorities. Disu lauded their prompt actions in addressing the involved officers’ misconduct and subsequent handover to the police for prosecution. The Police Commissioner, who emphasised that this collaborative effort underscores a strong commitment to upholding justice and maintaining public trust in law enforcement institutions, praised the officers involved in the arrest and urged them to remain vigilant.",

        "content": "Mike Tyson is \"doing great\" following a reported health scare the former heavyweight champion had on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday. According to a report by , Tyson -- who is scheduled to face Jake Paul in a boxing match on July 20 -- had a medical issue that required paramedics to board the plane upon landing and assist. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" Tyson's representatives said in a statement. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" There were rumors that the flight was delayed because of Tyson's medical issue, but his representatives debunked that. \"It's false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,\" the rep stated. \"This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" Tyson, 57, is slated to return to the boxing ring for his first professional fight in nearly two decades when he faces Paul, 27, in a blockbuster showdown at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The fight will be streamed live on Netflix. By the time the two combatants step into the ring for their heavyweight clash, Tyson will have celebrated his 58th birthday and be 31 years older than Paul. The fight will be contested over eight 2-minute rounds with each fighter using 14-ounce gloves.",

        "content": "PARIS -- lost in the first round of the French Open to 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that . And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the \"incredible the amount of energy\" it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. \"It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,\" said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.\" It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of \"Ra-fa!\" from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev, the runner-up at the 2020 US Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against in 2010 and against in 2015 and 2021. \"To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,\" Zverev said. \"It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It's Rafa's moment.\"",

        "content": "Baldur’s Gate 3 players can’t believe others avoid Bernard, a Construct NPC who guards the Underdark’s Arcane Tower. Players who will meet Bernard on the top floor. The Construct guardian will only attack under certain circumstances, but, due to the difficulty of the fight, many players have decided to skip the encounter completely. Redditor counts as one such Baldur’s Gate 3 player, claiming Bernard’s is the only battle they avoided during their Honour Mode run. The user explained in part, “Just fought him in Tactician for the first time, and YIKES am I glad I skipped him in Honor; he just about took me apart.” While several people in the comments agreed that leaving Bernard alone on harder difficulties is a smart choice, many others questioned the need to fight him at all. It’s possible to encounter the Construct and walk away from him on a friendly note; , too. One popular comment under the post notes, “...you don’t even have to fight him when you meet him. Just read some of the books. He can even hug you.” Someone who’s played Baldur’s Gate 3 four times added, “Me just sitting here like ‘wait, people fight Bernard?'” To make nice with Bernard, players must find command phrases written on documents scattered around Arcane Tower. Answering each of his questions with the correct answer will turn him passive, thus avoiding a fight. However, those who do face off against Bernard will have to best him in regular combat. One person in the Reddit thread suggested planting Sussur Flowers near the smaller robots to shut them down. From there, it’s a matter of drawing Bernard to the building’s edge, so Wyll can shoot him with an that knocks him off the ledge.",

        "content": "A clip of Dumisani Dlamini talking about his daughter Doja Cat has re-emerged amid her latest rant, in which she calls him a “deadbeat dad.” The US singer was born in 1995 to the South African actor and muso and his then-partner, Deborah Elizabeth Sawyer. Dumisani – who also fathered a son, Doja’s brother Raman Dalithando – left the US to return home. Doja has yet to visit South Africa. It’s unclear if she has ever met Dumisani. DUMISANI DLAMINI ON DOJA CAT: ‘ONE DAY SHE’LL COME HOME’ On social media, Doja Cat and Dumisani Dlamini became trending topics because of her choice of words regarding her South African father. One tweep reposted a clip of Dumisani talking about his daughter in an old interview on Mzansi Magic. Speaking of his Grammy-winning child, he said: “She’s my daughter. It just blew up now as if there is something wrong. People are changing stories.” He added, “We don’t want to dwell [on the past]. One day, she will come home, and everyone will see her.” Dumisani insisted he was proud of Doja “even before she became a superstar”. Speaking to Tshisalive, Dumisani claimed that he planned to bring his US family back to South Africa – a move that never materialized. Dumisani has yet to address Doja Cat’s latest rant WHAT DID DOJA CAT SAY ABOUT HER DAD? On Monday, 27 May, Doja Cat launched a foul-mouth social media rant aimed at her father, Dumisani Dlamini. In it, she called him out for “abandoning” his family and being a “b*tch”. One follower – likely a South African – was not impressed with Doja’s words, commenting: “You are messing with the wrong one. Zulus don’t play...your ancestors will humble you”. Doja Cat clapped back: “Go give the deadbeat a kiss on the lips for me.” She added: “[Dumisani] gave me a lazy eye and dipped.” Under a post on Dumisani’s Instagram account, Doja Cat commented: “F**k you”. In a 2019 interview with Leah Henry and DJ Quicksilva, Doja opened up about not knowing her father. She said: “I have never [met him], and he’s on Instagram. And he comments on my pictures sometimes. He’s an incredible dancer and great actor, but yeah, I don’t know him very well”. ‘SHE’LL REGRET WHAT SHE’S DOING’ Meanwhile, several South Africans are calling out Doja Cat for disrespecting not only her father but also her African roots. @theHirohito : “Can we all agree that in African culture, swearing at your parents publicly is an equivalent to cursing yourself, like Doja Cat is doing there on IG? @Priddyzaddy: “She’s playing with fire this one.” @__ThapeloM : “She’ll regret what she’s doing.”",

Addressing election rallies in Patkura and Kakatpur, the senior BJP leader asked, “One ‘T’ means teamwork. Is there any teamwork in Odisha? The elected MLAs, MPs and ministers don’t have any power to exercise. Here only a team exists...that is in between Pandian and his wife and only one T, which stands for Tamil Nadu.” Neither the State Cabinet nor any officer has the power in Odisha. Only two persons (Pandian and his wife) have all the powers, Himanta alleged. He blamed the BJD government for the rising unemployment in Odisha. “Today, the youth of Odisha are migrating to other States due to unemployment. On the other hand, one lakh government posts are lying vacant in the State and the Odia youth are not being employed in local industries”, he said.",

        "description": "LUCENA CITY — Eight personnel of the Lucena City Police Station (LCPS) were arrested and detained for allegedly harassing a civilian inside her house here in Purok Masagana, Barangay Ransohan on Friday.The complainant, 52-year-old Renelyn Rianzales, filed a case of violation of domicile, grave threats and unjust vexation against eight police intelligence operatives, namely Cpt. Aaron Agbaya Herrera, SMS Richie Ledesma Yuayan, SSg Henry Mascariña Mago, Cpl.Rainier Reyes Zaballa, Cpl. Allan Daluz Abdon, Cpl. Wilson Peñaverde Bantilan, Cpl. Rene John Martinez Bartolata and SSg. Junar Cabuyao Cabalsa.In her complaint, Rianzales recounted that around 3.15 a.m. on Friday, she was awakened by loud banging on her door as unidentified armed men wearing dark clothes and masks kicked at her door until it gave in.The armed men then barged into her unlocked bedroom, identified themselves as policemen and pointed their guns at her.The operatives, apparently, were looking for Jonathan, the live-in partner of Rianzales.When asked where Jonathan is, Rianzales said he is not home but at work in Laguna.The policemen searched the rest of the house and left when they could not find Jonathan.Rianzales, who was with her two grandchildren inside the house at that time, said she counted five men who entered her house and later learned there were three more posted outside.After around 30 minutes, Rianzales sought the help of Armando Paderon who accompanied her to the police station to report the incident.While she was giving the investigator her statement, Rianzales was informed that a police drug operation was scheduled in her barangay by intelligence personnel on the same day.When the operatives were presented to her, she recognized the armed men who harassed her by the build of their bodies and other bodily marks.Upon learning of the men's identity, Rianzales immediately filed complaints against them.The eight police intelligence personnel are now detained at the Lucena PNP temporary lockup facility while cases were filed against them on Friday. They were also inquested on the same day.Lucena police chief LtCol. Reynaldo Reyes was also relieved of his post on the same day and was replaced by LtCol. William Angway as officer in charge.",

        "content": "INEOS are \"convinced\" Manchester United and Nice will both be allowed to compete in the Europa League next season. Erik ten Hag's side qualified for the competition by winning the FA Cup on Saturday. 1 Ineos are confident Manchester United and Nice will both be allowed to play in the Europa League Credit: Alamy But Nice, who are owned by Ineos, also booked their place in the Europa League by finishing fifth in Ligue Un. However Ineos, who own a 27.5 per cent stake in United , are confident both clubs will be allowed to feature following talks with Uefa. Ineos issued a statement which read: “We are aware of the position of the two clubs and we are in direct dialogue with UEFA. \"We are convinced that we have a solution for next season in Europe.\" There were fears the Red Devils could be bumped down to the Europa Conference League as Nice finished higher in their respective league, with United coming eighth in the Premier League. But United appear to have reached an agreement with Uefa as Sir Jim Ratcliffe's stake is less than the 30 per cent threshold for multi-club ownership rules to apply. However Ineos' stake reportedly includes a plan to invest a further £245m for infrastructure works which would take their ownership to more than 30 per cent. Passing this threshold would put Ineos in violation of ownership rules and force one of the teams to be relegated to the Conference League.

Article 5.01 b. of the Uefa regulations states no individual \"may simultaneously be involved, either directly or indirectly, in any capacity whatsoever in the management, administration and/or sporting performance of more than one club participating in a UEFA club competition.\" This would have seen United being booted out of European football entirely. Man Utd set to battle Arsenal for transfer of £35m wonderkid, 18, team-mates call 'best youngster they've seen' Fortunately for them, in March Uefa relaxed its rules on multi-club ownership ahead of the 2024/25 season. And Article 5.04 now says a club that is replaced in one competition \"may still be admitted to another UEFA club competition (i.e. in descending order: UEFA Europa League or UEFA Conference League) to which the relevant national association has access”. Earlier this season, Brighton and Aston Villa were only allowed to play in Uefa competitions when their owners reduced their stakes in clubs on the continent to under 30 per cent.",

        "content": "DEAR DEIDRE: My mate’s wife seduced me as I gave her a driving lesson. We ended up having sex in a woodland layby. My head is all over the place right now. I’m a fit guy of 36 and I work out at a boxing gym. My mate is 51 and he is a boxing coach. He’s been a friend of mine for ten years and I have great respect for him. He lost his driving licence recently due to having some sort of epileptic fit. We were all there for him and supported him. His wife is 40 and she’s been finding it difficult to get around as they live in a village with little public transport and she hadn’t ever learned to drive. Now they need her to learn, so they can use their car again. My friend asked me if I could take her out to practise driving at weekends and I was happy to oblige.

Fill out and submit our easy-to-use and confidential form and the Dear Deidre team will get back to you. You can also send a private message on the DearDeidreOfficial Facebook page or email us at: deardeidre@the-sun.co.uk We’d been out for a couple of lessons when she hit a rabbit in the road one evening. She was so shaken up I got her to pull over. My reassuring hug suddenly turned into a passionate kiss. We were both pretty hot under the collar and so when she suggested we go to a quieter area, and then pulled into a layby, I couldn’t help myself. We had sex in the back seat — it wasn’t the longest session I’ve had but it was the most intense. Afterwards she told me my mate hadn’t had sex with her for weeks because he’s been worried any excitement would bring on another seizure. We’ve had sex three times since, during her weekly lessons. I feel really bad but can’t help myself. MORE FROM DEAR DEIDRE DEIDRE'S STORIES Connor's controlling girlfriend finds out he's at the park DEAR DEIDRE My mummy's boy husband is a love rat & has been cheating since she passed away DEIDRE SAYS: This arrangement doesn’t sit well with you, or you wouldn’t have written in. I’m afraid you’re paying lip service to “respecting” your friend. While he’s been worrying about his health, you’ve been betraying him. You may not have been the instigator but you’ve enjoyed every moment. Encourage this woman to help your friend and get clear support from his doctor. Tell her that you aren’t comfortable taking advantage of a friend’s wife and do the decent thing and end it. If you don’t, you stand to lose this friend altogether and potentially other friends along the way. My support pack called Your Lover Not Free explains the pitfalls about these sorts of relationships. Dear Deidre: Cheating and can you get over it",

        "content": "Amma Gyan wants to give more people the ability to proudly proclaim exactly that after expanding her Amanartis business into atria Watford. The artist and designer joined forces with Watford Borough Council in 2020 to re-imagine the chapel at Vicarage Road Cemetery into a creative space where artists can originate and exhibit their work. That will continue but Amma, who moved to Watford from East London approaching 15 years ago, has been seeking a more central location in the town to reach more people. After speaking to the shopping centre management, a proposal was accepted and she has taken on a lease for the Gallery area on Level One, next to Palace car park. Amma Gyan in the House of Amma in the Gallery \"It's always been the Gallery but it's never been fully occupied as such,\" she said. \"I think the centre manager's very experience-driven and wanted to make the most of it. Art and all things creative is one of the ways you can do that because it's different and it changes. \"I think it was fortunate that I'd had the chapel so I had a bit of a track record of doing something similar that had been received well.\" Amma has taken the rooms at...

        "description": "IPL 2024: Everything that this season taught us – from a new style of batting to the ramifications with new rules.",
        "content": "What will be the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL) season remembered for? Recency bias might suggest the closely-contested matches it produced, or the underdog stories. Beyond the prima facie observations, however, the tournament was all about debunking narratives, as it taught us some consequential lessons, which could shape how the format, the tournament, and also the Indian cricket team , will transition from here onwards. Here are what we learned from IPL 2024: ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD 1. Adios Anchors, Make Way for the New Template IPL 2024: The likes of Jake Fraser-McGurk have established a new template for T20 batting. (Photo: BCCI) Two decades since its inception, the shortest format of the game has gone through a metamorphosis. The ideal T20 template – a phrase used in every debate across the Indian cricketing circles since the 2022 T20 World Cup – has been entrenched, and it has no provision for the now-anachronistic terms like ‘anchor,’ ‘holding the fort’ and ‘calculative cricket.’ The new format is all about being uninhibited with the bat, unceasingly attacking the bowlers. To contextualise – in the first 16 editions of the tournament, where 1032 matches were played, we witnessed only a couple of 250+ scores. In this edition, that barrier has been traversed an astonishing eight times in 74 matches. . @delhicapitals ' Flying Powerplay ð¤© Fraser-McGurk increases the temperature with some explosive stroke play ð¥ Watch the match LIVE on @JioCinema and @StarSportsIndia ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #DCvMI pic.twitter.com/e2VdyReaPu — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 27, 2024 0 A total of 1260 sixes were hit, which outclassed the previous best figure of 1124 by a mile. 42 of those sixes were struck in the match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Punjab Kings, which happens to be the highest-ever figure in any T20 match. Notably, Punjab chased down a target of 262 runs in that match, which was the highest successful chase in this format. The match between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Sunrisers Hyderabad saw 549 runs being scored, which is the highest aggregate in a T20 match. That, however, is not all, for the pre-IPL highest aggregate (517) was surpassed on two other occasions – Kolkata Knight Riders vs Punjab Kings, and Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Mumbai Indians. Hyderabad’s score of 287/3 was also the highest ever by a team in any franchise league across the globe.

Albeit, it cannot be denied that the rule has had a role to play in the monstrosity we witnessed this year. Orange Cap winner Virat Kohli, who recorded his best-ever strike rate this year, admitted having an additional batter led to the transformation in his approach, but is not a proponent of the rule. I say it how it is. Entertainment is on one side, but never in my life have I seen a situation where bowlers think they will concede a four or a six every ball. Not every team has a Jasprit Bumrah, or a Rashid Khan, or a mystery bowler. So what will you do? I am telling you, one extra batter is the reason why I am playing with a 200-plus strike rate in the powerplay. I know there is a batsman coming in at number 8 as well. Virat Kohli Virat Kohli on impact player and the downfall of bowling in IPL pic.twitter.com/GPHCBsI3VS — Agnik (@lordkohli18) May 20, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD This is one facet of the criticism of the rule. The other, and perhaps, more consequential facet, is that it has completely stagnated the development of potential all-rounders for the Indian cricket team. Consider Shivam Dube’s example as a case study. He already has 8 T20I wickets and 46 T20 wickets to his name, but since the impact player rule was introduced, has only bowled a solitary over. Among the reasons why KKR found it justifiable to retain Venkatesh Iyer ahead of Shubman Gill prior to the 2022 mega auction was the former’s all-round skills, with Iyer picking up three wickets in IPL 2021. He also made it to the Indian team and picked up five wickets. Since the rule was implemented, however, he has bowled only one over like Dube, with the teams no longer requiring jacks of all trades. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Speaking on this, Indian captain Rohit Sharma told on the Club Prairie Podcast: I am not a big fan of impact substitute rule. It is going to hold all-rounders back. Eventually, cricket is played by 11 players, not 12 players. You are taking out so much from the game to make it entertaining for people around. If you look just from the cricketing aspect of it I feel guys like Shivam Dube and Washington Sundar aren't getting to bowl, which for us is not a good thing. Rohit Sharma ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Crores of Rupees Down the Drain? You Better Think Again IPL 2024: Eyebrows were raised when KKR signed Mitchell Starc for Rs 24.75 crore, but in the end, it was all worth it. (Photo: BCCI) The IPL 2024 auction saw more eyebrows being raised than paddles, with a few preposterous price tags floating around. Pat Cummins was the first cricketer who broke the record for the highest-ever bid, as Sunrisers Hyderabad spent Rs 20.50 for his services. Cummins might have the honour of being called the World Cup-winning captain for eternity, albeit the honour of being IPL’s most expensive cricketer lasted only a few minutes. The abdication took place when Kolkata Knight Riders spent Rs 24.75 crores on Cummins’ Australian teammate, Mitchell Starc. The general consensus on 19 December 2024 was that the Sunrisers and the Knight Riders have all but lost their rationale, and have committed to almighty blunders. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Six months down the line, those two teams competed in the final. With his 18 wickets, and his excellent leadership, Cummins led the Hyderabad resurgence, taking the last-placed team of IPL 2023 to second in the standings. Starc, meanwhile, had a difficult start to his life in purple and gold. Yet, considering the way he bowled in the second half of the competition – ending up with 17 wickets, and delivering arguably the ball of the tournament in the final – it seemed that he had taken co-owner Shah Rukh Khan’s ‘Haar kar jeetne waalon ko Baazigar kehte hain’ a bit too seriously.

That, with teams deploying analysts and strategists like Nathan Leamon and Gaurav Sundaraman, it is likely that they know what they are doing. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Pace-Bowling All-Rounder – Found. Power-Hitting Finisher – Found. IPL 2024: Nitish Reddy could be the pace-bowling all-rounder India are looking for. (Photo: BCCI) An uncontested prior to IPL 2024 was that India lacked youngsters for two specific roles – a pace-bowling all-rounder, and a power-hitting finisher. Let’s consider the former first. The ‘Who after Hardik Pandya?’ question has been doing rounds in the Indian cricketing circuit for a while now, with answers being only names without any corroboration. But this edition saw the emergence of a certain Nitish Reddy – the 21-year-old all-rounder from Andhra, who won the Emerging Player of the Season award. Not only did he score 303 runs at a strike rate of 142.92, but Reddy also scalped three wickets in the limited bowling opportunities he was provided with.

The presumed lack of a power-hitting Indian finisher sparked bidding wars whenever Shahrukh Khan came to auction, for he was among the rare cricketers to fit the bill. That list has had new additions, with arguably the most prominent among those being Ashutosh Sharma. The Punjab Kings batter scored 189 runs at a strike rate of 167.25, including a 28-ball 61 against Mumbai. Another player on this list, albeit comparatively older, is Ramandeep Singh. The Kolkata Knight Riders batter scored 125 runs at a strike rate of 201.61, including an unbeaten 6-ball 25 against Lucknow Super Giants.

(Photo: BCCI) Barring the Virat Kohli-led team of 2008, the 2018 batch was contestably the most proficient Indian U-19 team, considering the panache and flair with which they blew away every single opponent who stood in their way. It seemed that the majority of those players will represent the nation in the years to come, albeit, only Shubman Gill has managed to carve his identity. But when India take on Zimbabwe for a five-match T20I series in July, expect a couple of Gill’s teammates to debut in blue, in Abhishek Sharma and Riyan Parag. ð toð half-centuries for Riyan Parag He continues his good form with the bat ðð Watch the match LIVE on @JioCinema and @StarSportsIndia ð»ð± #TATAIPL | #MIvRR | @rajasthanroyals pic.twitter.com/tAnDaCghYm — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 1, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD The former had an excellent campaign in 2022, but the foundation for escalation slipped from under his feet when he could only score 226 runs last season. This year, however, Abhishek was among the standout performers, scoring 484 runs at a strike rate of 204.22 – the highest among players with 350+ runs. Parag’s case is slightly different, for despite making his IPL debut way back in 2019, he had never really established himself. Having scored 600 runs in the first five seasons, he has quietened the sceptics with a 573-run season, at an average of 52.09. ADVERTISEMENT REMOVE AD Questions on Umpiring Standards IPL 2024: The umpiring standard this season has raised questions. (Photo: BCCI) Considering this tournament is called the Indian Premier League, it is only right that over 80% of the umpires are Indians – 17 among 21. However, the standard on display this season has sparked questions. There were plenty of controversial decisions across the 74 matches, despite having the assistance of technology. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), alongside the players and coaches, will be hoping for a better show from the umpires next season.

        "content": "The midfielder was not part of David Moyes’ plans for the 2023/24 season and it was decided that the 25-year-old would gain more experience in England’s second division. Downes helped the Saints achieve promotion to the Premier League and was impressive in the play-off final against Leeds on Sunday. Downes featured in 37 games for Southampton this season, scoring two goals and providing a further three assists; however, it was the Englishman’s overall performances that have impressed Saints fans. Many supporters would have been hoping to keep the midfielder at St Mary’s Stadium for their return to the Premier League, but West Ham may have dropped some hints that he will be returning to London. Southampton are believed to have a in Downes’ loan deal, but the Hammers may well keep the 25-year-old. West Ham hint at Flynn Downes’ return According to , West Ham have dropped hints that Downes will be returning to the Premier League club for the 2024/25 campaign. In an article on the after Southampton’s play-off victory on Sunday, the East London outfit made a point of clearly stating it was the end of the 25-year-old’s time with the Saints. On four separate occasions, West Ham referenced the fact the game represented the end of the player’s loan deal. It is uncertain if Downes will have a big role to play under Julen Lopetegui next season but the midfielder could be a solid squad player throughout the campaign.",

        "content": "New Plymouth boss Wayne Rooney has promised to give the club’s young players a chance to follow in his footsteps and make their names as teenagers. Rooney, who burst on to the Premier League scene as a 16-year-old at Everton, has been handed the reins at Home Park less than five months after losing his job at Birmingham.

Asked about his management style, the 38-year-old told Argyle TV: “Obviously I had my playing career, which I loved, but if you want to go into management, you quite quickly have to move on from there. Advertisement “I’ve put a lot of work in, a lot of time in to try to develop myself as a coach, try to improve, try to get better, and I want to be a coach who helps players, helps teams, develops players, academy players. Advertisement “Academy players are really important as well, to try to improve them, because I was a player who came into the first team at 16. I think a lot of young players are good enough, but maybe don’t get the chance, so I’ve got a real passion for that as well.” Rooney, who acknowledged his journey to Plymouth via spells at Derby, DC United and Birmingham had its challenges, is excited about the latest phase of his career, which will see him link up once again with the club’s director of football Neil Dewsnip.

Dewsnip was the head of Everton’s academy who eased him through the ranks and the pair will now work together to plot the way forward for Argyle. Rooney, who admitted the two men had not seen each other for around 10 years until Birmingham played at Plymouth in December last year, said: “Of course with Neil’s role at the club and my role at the club, it’s going to have to be a daily basis I’m speaking to Neil now. “I think ultimately the important thing in that is we’re both trying to do the right thing, we both want the right thing, we’re both on the same wavelength now to make sure the club moves forward on players coming into the football club, style of play, how we want to move forward.

        "content": "Nigerian banks appear poised for another round of losses as investors continue to weigh their options regarding the impending bank recapitalization plans. The NGX Banking Index fell sharply at the end of last week, shedding a whopping 7.35%, one of the worst weekly performances this year. Aside from Stanbic IBTC, all the major banking stocks posted losses, with UBA, FBN Holdings, and ETI shedding 12%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. UBA and Zenith Bank closed the week at a year-low of N19.2 and N30, respectively. A worried investor opined, “The Central Bank recapitalization policy has decimated bank stocks. How can they raise N3 trillion at these valuations? Investors are spooked, and I doubt the capital raise will be successful.” Month-to-date, banking stocks are down 5.29%, 28.77% for the quarter, and 18.26% year-to-date. This is a stark contrast to the end of the first quarter of the year when banking stocks were up 14.76%. Banks like Access Holdings are trading below their earnings per share, delivering a price-to-earnings multiple of 0.837x. UBA, with a price-to-earnings multiple of 0.96x, is also trading below its earnings per share. Zenith Bank, which is trading at its year low, has a borderline 1x multiple to its earnings. READ ALSO: UBA leads as banks generate N425bn from e-transactions in 2023 The sell-offs are all the more remarkable when you consider the massive profits being declared by Nigerian banks and the record amount of dividends being paid. However, it appears investors are more concerned about the spate of rights issues planned by commercial banks as they struggle to meet their banking recapitalization targets. Most banks have announced plans for rights issues, which many investors view as a major first step toward achieving their recapitalization goals. Investors with knowledge of the situation opine that the strategy of raising capital via rights issues may be the major reason why the share prices are depressed. Rights issues are typically capital raises that only allow existing shareholders to exercise their rights by purchasing the shares of the company. This suggests that a lower share price might be favourable to insiders, especially those with majority control, even though it could lead to the creation of more shares. READ ALSO: CBN directs banks to suspend charges on deposits For example, for Access Corporation to raise N300 billion via a rights issue, it would have to sell 18 billion shares at the current share price of N16.4 versus just 10 billion shares if it sold at its year high of N30 per share. However, this means investors will pay nearly twice the current share price of N16.24. Most rights issues are also priced at a discount to their current share price, even as existing regulations do not require the trading of the stock to be suspended. This suggests the rights issue price could initially be lower than the current share price. Another reason given by some analysts is the amount of dividends declared by most banks, which have been in record figures. For example, Zenith Bank declared about N100.4 billion in dividends in 2023 compared to N125.5 billion declared this year already. GTCO also declared N94 billion this year versus N91 billion a year earlier. UBA also declared N95 billion in dividends this year versus N37.6 billion reported a year earlier. Fidelity Bank, which plans to raise about N370 billion, also declared dividends of N27.2 billion this year versus N22.4 billion in 2023. This perhaps explains why bank share prices have plummeted in recent weeks and could fall further as the rights issue dates are confirmed and selling prices revealed. READ ALSO: U.S. bankrolling creation of deadlier, more contagious bird flu strains Most analysts also suggest some of the dividend payouts may be reinvested in the company by the beneficiaries in the form of subscribing to their rights issues. Just last week, the chairman of UBA, Tony Elumelu, promised to invest his entire dividend in the rights issue. Most bank majority shareholders are expected to do the same. While this benefits the market, especially retail investors, the adjustments of share price following dividend payments also add to the pressure on their share price as they achieve lower lows. One other concern some investors have is that most bank stocks are not just experiencing a price decimation, but they are also doing this at a higher volume of trade, which suggests even lower prices. For example, FBNH traded 20.4 million shares on Friday at a lower price close. Zenith Bank, UBA, and ETI also experienced a similar trend. For instance, ETI recorded a volume of 554.9 million shares on Friday at a closing price of N21.65, compared to the previous day’s volume of just 347,214 shares at N24.05. This suggests there are likely more sellers in the market than buyers.",

        "description": "The council law is being reviewed to address the existing loopholes in governing the maritime sector.The post Tajudeen, Oyetola, others back review of shippers’ council law appeared first on Premium Times Nigeria.",
        "content": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives , Abbas Tajudeen, and the Minister of Blue Economy, Gboyega Oyetola, have expressed support for the repeal and enactment of the Shippers’ Council and Economic Regulatory Bill. Messrs Tajudeen and Oyetola backed the bill on Monday at the public hearing organised by the House Committees on Shipping Services, Ports and Harbours, Maritime Safety, Education, and Administration. The repeal and enactment bill seeks to address the loopholes in the existing law which governs the maritime sector. According to its synopsis, the bill seeks to create a robust economic regulatory framework that prevents unfair practices, promotes fair pricing, and encourages competition. It also seeks to protect the interests of both service providers and users by ensuring transparency and accountability in the imposition of tariffs and charges, as well as automate and digitalise cargo-related processes to align with international best practices. Mr Tajudeen, represented by a member of the House, Sada Soli (APC, Katsina), said the bill would create an enabling environment for investors to invest in the maritime sector with their investments guaranteed. The speaker said the mandate of the Nigerian Shippers’ Council has evolved significantly from its original role as a protector of shippers’ interests, noting that “it has now become the economic regulator of the entire Nigerian port system, a responsibility that extends beyond the Nigerian Ports Authority.” PREMIUM TIMES delivers fact-based journalism for Nigerians, by Nigerians — and our community of supporters, the readers who donate, make our work possible.

Mr Tajudeen said the bill is critical to ensure the Nigerian Shippers’ Council performs in its expanded role. “To effectively fulfil its expanded mandate as the Port Economic Regulator, it is imperative, therefore, that the necessary legislative bill is passed. This bill will formally empower the Council, providing it with the authority and tools required to oversee and manage the economic activities within Nigerian ports, ensuring efficiency, fairness, and competitiveness across the sector,” he said. On his part, Mr Oyetola, while canvassing the need to establish the regulatory agency, said the bill would improve the nation’s economy. The minister, represented by the ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Oloruntola Olufemi, said it would be a welcome development if the bill became an Act. The Chairperson of the Shipping Line Association of Nigeria, Boma Alabi, however, raised concerns about some specific parts of the bill and called for the intervention of the lawmakers. She said the association had already raised some of the clauses with the committee. She said the association is ready to back any measure that will improve efficiency, lower cost, and reduce the bottleneck in the sector, but some of the clauses leave room for abuse. “We must be more efficient, and we welcome this regulatory agency that will be created to make things more efficient. “We have expressed our concern internally and externally, and this committee, which has been involved in this process, must work on some areas of concern.

        "description": "The Dolphins' star receiver had some playful jabs to dish out to Wes Welker over the weekend.",
        "content": "Back in January, the marched into Arrowhead in the Wild Card round of the playoffs after blowing a massive lead in the AFC East. The team had lost ten straight games when kickoff occurred in sub-40 degree temperatures before that game. Unfortunately, their streak continued as the handled them with ease, 26-7, in one of the . Despite leading the team with five receptions and 62 receiving yards, as well as scoring the team's lone touchdown in the loss, star receiver was for his lackluster performance (relative to his regular season success). Wide receivers coach Wes Welker has been working closely with Hill this offseason, and it's clear the rapport between them has grown. When prompted by a Twitter post, Hill joked that Welker's reputation had exceeded his actual production while in the NFL. Hill's post is all in good fun, as earlier this offseason that Welker deserved more offensive coordinator and head coaching interview. If Welker's tutelage can help arguably the league's best wide receiver get even better, opportunities for those gigs will come knocking soon. Welker: Hill Has \"Separated Himself\" From WR Pack Hill is , and it's a scary thought to imagine that he could improve even further. Yet, he and Welker appear hellbent on making that happen. In an of the Palm Beach Post, Welker had lofty praise for Hill, calling him a complete receiver, and even going so far as to compare him to Hall of Fame receiver (and Welker's former teammate) Randy Moss: \"Randy Moss was the best deep ball receiver in the game. Tyreek Hill runs the whole route tree. Name a route he can't run. How he approaches every day and every game is very impressive. That's where he separates himself.\" Hill's marks of 7.4 receptions and 112.4 yards per game were both near the top of the league last year (the latter stat led the NFL), and he's somehow become even more dominant since the fateful trade that sent him from Kansas City to Miami. Outside of maybe , it's hard to make the case for any receiver currently in the league over Hill. He's wholly dominant as a vertical target, and he's proven to be more than adept at filling the traditional possession x-receiver role in recent years. After not eclipsing more than 87 catches in any of his first five seasons in the league, he's gone over 110 receptions in each of the last three. Over the last two seasons, Hill has finished top-ten in MVP voting and top-five in Offensive Player of the Year voting. He is the first wideout to accomplish that feat since Jerry Rice in 1994 and 1995. Welker, Hill and the Dolphins must now attempt to regroup despite this offseason. Due to salary cap issues, some of the franchise's biggest faces and personalities, such as and , were forced out of South Beach. The good news is that all six players who earned for the Dolphins last year - , Raheem Mostert, , Alec Ingold, Terron Armstead, and Jalen Ramsey - are returning for the 2024 season. The team also just on receiver Jaylen Waddle and edge rusher Jaelan Phillips, which should keep the core of the team in place for a little while longer. There's still time for the team to earn its first playoff victory since 2000, especially as long as McDaniel is calling the plays for the league's most prolific offense (NFL-leading 401.3 yards per game in 2023). If Hill somehow continues to improve while working with Welker, then the Dolphins may be truly unguardable come next season.",

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. His career record at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament is now 112-4. The match was played with the retractable roof shut at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the loud cheers for Nadal from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed throughout. Nadal, who owns 22 major trophies in all, turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat. His three other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",

        "content": "RAF grounds Battle of Britain planes after tragic death of pilot who was killed in crash during memorial show Mark Long was tragically killed in a Spitfire crash on Saturday afternoon By Dan Grennan Published: 17:11, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:54, 27 May 2024 e-mail 4 View comments The RAF has grounded the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) planes after a Spitfire pilot was killed in a shock crash. Squadron Leader Mark Long's plane crashed a few minutes after taking off from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire as part of a memorial show to mark the 85th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Saturday afternoon. The RAF have now said they have taken the decision to ground BBMF aircraft - which operates six Spitfires, two Hurricanes, a Lancaster, a C47 Dakota, and two Chipmunk aircraft - while investigations into the crash take place. A spokesperson said: 'Following the tragic accident at RAF Coningsby, and while the formal investigation is ongoing, the RAF has instigated a temporary pause in flying for the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF).' Squadron Leader Mark Long pictured pictured beside an RAF aircraft Sqn Ldr Mark Long pictured reading a map on an RAF airplane Mark Long flying the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire MK356 Pictured are floral tributes and handwritten notes left at the scene yesterday Tributes left by supporters at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, for renowned pilot Mark Long Grief-stricken supporters Nicki Housam, 53, a former prison officer and partner Andy George, a construction manager, pay their respects to the pilot The RAF also paid tributes to the father-of-two in a touching statement, describing him as 'a great friend, colleague and a passionate, professional aviator' who will be 'sorely missed'. The Typhoon pilot took to Instagram just weeks before the memorial show to share his excitement. In a post dated March 4, the Squadron Leader shared videos of Hurricane and Spitfire airplanes in flight with the caption: 'We are only a few weeks away from getting back flying in these iconic aircraft. Cannot wait!!!' In a post dated March 4, the Squadron Leader shared videos of Hurricane and Spitfire airplanes in flight with the caption: 'We are only a few weeks away from getting back flying in these iconic aircraft. Cannot wait!!!' In an older post, the experienced pilot shared a video explaining why they have to be careful about the conditions they fly the vintage aircrafts in. 'We have landed here with the Hurricane and Spitfire ready for react later this afternoon. The reason we landed in Gloucester is actually for cross winds. 'I'll show you around the aircraft and you will see what we are operating and why we are so precious about how we pick our winds, surface and flying conditions.' From under the Hurricane, Long said: 'What a lovely summer we are having right now as temperatures are soaring. The unique element of the Hurricane is that it gets really hot inside but it actually does quite well at keeping itself cool, 'So you have got the massive propeller at the front of the 17-litre Merlin engine but that on the ground forces the air through the radiator'. Leading tributes to the pilot yesterday, Gp Capt Robbie Lees, commander of the RAF's Display Air Wing, said: 'Mark was a Typhoon pilot here at RAF Coningsby and for the last four years he has been a pilot with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. 'A great friend, colleague, and a passionate, professional aviator he will be sorely missed by all that knew him.' He said an investigation into the cause of the 'tragic event' was now underway. 'I would like to extend a sincere thank you to the RAF personnel, and our emergency services colleagues who responded so swiftly yesterday. Squadron Leader Mark Long shared footage of a World War II-era plane in flight just weeks before his tragic death. In the post, he said he 'cannot wait' to fly the vintage aircraft in a few weeks The scene where the pilot died in a crash during a Battle of Britain event near RAF Coningsby A Spitfire flown by the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight pilot Mark Long in April The RAF said in a touching statement that he was 'a great friend, colleague and a passionate, professional aviator' 'Our thoughts remain with Mark's family and friends to whom we offer our deepest sympathies. We ask that their privacy be respected at this tragic and shocking time.' This was the first fatality involving a BBMF aircraft since its creation in July 1957, a retired RAF leader told the BBC. BBMF operates six Spitfires, two Hurricanes, a Lancaster, a C47 Dakota, and two Chipmunk aircraft. The pilot qualified to fly Spitfires in 2021 and was lined up to take over running the BBMF next year. His most recent RAF posting was as a flight commander flying Eurofighter Typhoons. He joined the Air Force in 2003, having graduated from the University of Warwick. During his career, Sqn Ldr Long was posted to 11 Squadron at Coningsby, deploying to the Baltics and the South Atlantic. A spectator who witnessed the horrific moment the Spitfire plane nose-dived to the ground, killing the pilot instantly, said: 'Sadly he didn't stand a chance.' The former RAF air craftsman, speaking after the death of the experienced and respected flier during a Battle of Britain event, said: 'I've seen a lot of terrible things in my life but this is up there with the worst.' Sqn Ldr Long flying the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire MK356 last weekend Mark, who declined to be fully named, saw the horror unfold as he was plane spotting with his partner and her RAF fan 10-year-old son from a car park overlooking the base. Read More BREAKING NEWS Prince William and Princess Kate say they are 'incredibly sad' to hear of death of pilot in Spitfire crash during Battle of Britain event at RAF Coningsby Recalling the tragedy, he said: 'There was an event going on and I saw a Spitfire taking off and flying at about 300 feet towards East Kirkby. 'It was in the distance and suddenly it turned round and was coming back to base. It was swaying and swaying from one side to the other. He would have known there was a problem with the craft and it was awful to watch. 'The pilot would have realised there was a fault and was coming back to try and land safely but suddenly it just plummeted from about 150 feet. 'It just nose-dived, sadly the pilot didn't stand a chance. The way it went down so quickly and people were watching from the car park in horror and disbelief. 'I was hoping it would be a different outcome but I knew there was no surviving that. 'I was there with my partner and her son, who was beside himself with sadness, like many of us. It was devastating to watch. 'You just don't expect something like this to happen .' Tony, speaking yesterday as he lay flowers at the much loved RAF base along with dozens of air enthusiasts and supporters, added: 'A Hurricane was going to take off after the Spitfire but his flight was aborted.' He said the pilot 'must have known there was a problem and he was in difficulty' and would have raised the alarm, saying: 'He would have radio called because in less than a minute the fire service and ambulances were there. 'The whole episode from take off to crash probably only lasted two and a half minutes. Tributes left by supporters at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire to the deceased pilot Dozens of flowers have been left lined up along the fence by the airfield Heartwarming handwritten notes accompany some flowers, reading 'fly high' The location where the Spitfire crashed in a field on on Langrick Road at RAF Coningsby Emergency services arrived following reports of a crash of a single-occupant aircraft in a field on Langrick Road (stock image) 'It is too difficult to estimate the speed.' 'I couldn't clearly see the spot it came down but pictures show it was right beside a house and a tractor so no doubt other people witnessed it too. It is a terrible tragedy.' The man, who lives locally, told how he often took his step son to watch the planes in action at the airfield. He paid warm tribute to the pilot as a 'remarkable and wonderful man' and thrilled children with his 'pep talks.' He recalled: 'At the end of a flight Mark would always make a point of coming up to the big wire fence and give the kids a pep talk through it. 'He'd still be in his uniform, and he'd still have his flight maps pinned to his trousers, above the knees and would pass them to the children through the fence. 'I didn't know him personally but I knew him by reputation as a great pilot and a remarkable and wonderful man. 'He always made time to speak to people so I had to come here today to pay my respects. 'He told the kids that it was dream to become a pilot but he had failed four or five times. 'His message to them was never to give up and that you can always live your dream. 'It is such a terrible tragedy that it was to end in this way for him.' The Spitfire came down at around 1.20pm on Saturday during a display at RAF Coningsby. File image shows the Prince and Princess of Wales with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, at RAF Fairford last year Photos from the scene show emergency services gathered around the wreckage of the plane just feet away from a house. It had been taking part in a civilian airshow just nine miles from the base to commemorate the RAF's role in fending off German attacks during the Second World War This year represents the 85th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. The Prince and Princess of Wales have shared their condolences, saying they were 'incredibly sad' to hear of the tragedy. Kate and William, who himself served as an RAF Search and Rescue pilot, said in a joint statement that it was 'incredibly sad to hear of the news' and added that their 'thoughts this evening are with the pilot's loved ones, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and the wider RAF family.' Prime Minister Rishi Sunak wrote on X: 'Awful news to see the life of a serving RAF pilot cut short in this tragic event. My thoughts are with their family and loved ones.' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was 'deeply saddened' by the news, and thanked the emergency services for their response, adding 'my thoughts are with the pilot's family at this awful time.' The crash has been described as a 'tragic accident' by officials but an investigation has been opened into the cause. Police and ambulance crews raced to the scene and a rescue helicopter was scrambled from neighbouring Humberside. A statement from the Ministry of Defence stated: 'It is with great sadness that we must confirm the death of an RAF pilot in a tragic accident near RAF Coningsby today [Saturday]. 'The pilot's family has been informed and we ask that their privacy is respected at this time.' The pilot who was tragically killed in a Spitfire crash during a Battle of Britain event has been named as a Squadron Leader Mark Long (pictured) due to take over the memorial fight next year Spitfires played a crucial role in the war, especially during the Battle of Britain which earned the plane's power status. Designed as a short-range, high-performance plane, over 20,300 Spitfires were built to secure British success during WW2. It proved to be a watershed moment for the Nazis' territorial aims as they then shifted their focus to conquering Britain. Aware of the resilience of the RAF, German aircrafts bombarded British airfield bases until the autumn of 1940.

It was highlighted that at the commissioning of the Lagos-Calabar Coastal Superhighway on Sunday, President Tinubu also unfurled his other bold road programmes. These include: work will soon start from the Calabar end off the Lagos-Calabar Superhighway. Minister of Works, Dave Umahi, had said the designs have been done and the procurement will follow. According to the State House report, also on is the design and procurement for the 1,000km Sokoto-Badagry Highway, which is expected to connect Sokoto to Badagry in Lagos State, passing through Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, and Oyo States. President Tinubu had virtually flagged off the design and procurement for the 461km Enugu-Abakaliki-Ogoja Road, which will traverse Benue, Kogi, and Nasarawa States, terminating at Apo in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). President Tinubu had also performed the virtual flag-off of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of 330 roads and bridges across the six geo-political zones of the country. President Tinubu formally commissioned the Apapa-Oworonsoki concrete road, financed by Dangote Industries and built by Hitech in Lagos last Sunday. The President also commissioned the refurbished Third Mainland Bridge, completed by General Ibrahim Babangida in 1990.",

        "content": "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin is reminding home and business owners about Arkansas laws affecting post-storm clean-up. Griffin said that the governor’s state of emergency declaration on Sunday triggered a specific Arkansas law into effect to prevent price gouging. The law prevents businesses from charging more than 10% over pre-disaster prices for goods and services. The ban is in place for 30 days and may be extended for an additional 30 days, Griffin said, adding that for home repairs the law is in effect for 180 days. Goods listed in the state law include food and water, fuel, blankets, medicine, bandages, flashlights, batteries and construction materials. “Price gouging will not be tolerated as Arkansas recovers, and I will bring the full power of my office to bear on anyone who violates our law,” Griffin said. Griffin also offered advice for those contracting for repairs to avoid scammers. “Those with storm damage should call their insurance company before paying any company or individual a deposit,” Griffin said. “Post-storm scammers will offer quick repair jobs for an immediate deposit and may even claim that insurance will reimburse the purchaser.” Griffin encouraged anyone eyeing such a contract not to feel pressured into taking an immediate solution that appears too good to be true. Arkansans who wish to report concerns about the subject of this Consumer Alert or desire more information should contact the Arkansas Attorney General’s Office by calling , emailing consumer@arkansasag.gov or by visiting .",

        "content": "Leeds are coming to terms with the stark realisation that they will play Championship football for a second successive campaign after missing out on the chance of an instant return to the Premier League following a shattering loss to Southampton in the play-off final at Wembley . The result will have major financial ramifications for Leeds, who face the prospect of sanctioning some key sales with the club still having £79m in existing transfer instalments to pay. Advertisement Advertisement Did you know with a Digital subscription to Yorkshire Post, you can get access to all of our premium content, as well as benefiting from fewer ads, loyalty rewards and much more. In 2023-24, Leeds’s first year of parachute payments following relegation from the top flight, they received 55 per cent of the amount paid to Premier League clubs - around £45m. Next season, that will drop to 45 per cent - and should they fail to get promoted in 2024-25, they would fall dramatically to 20 per cent, accentuating the need for the club to go up in the next campaign. The future of a host of players loaned out last season including Jack Harrison , Brendon Aaronson, Marc Roca, Rasmus Kristensen and Max Wober remains unclear. Harrison has been linked with a permanent move to Everton. While any sales could help improve the financial shortfall, the expectation is that Leeds will have to cash in on some of their leading lights from 23-24 to help balance the books. Advertisement Advertisement Crysencio Summerville and Wilfried Gnonto are widely perceived to be two players who would not want to stay in the Championship next season, while there is highly likely to be considerable interest in star asset Archie Gray. Farke says that the club had made contingency plans in the event of failing to be promoted on Sunday and they will now be acted upon. Stressing that he has full belief in the project at Elland Road under owners 49ers Enterprises, Farke said: “I totally trust this club. \"I totally trust also the key people because my experiences since I sign the contract was, after a difficult start (last summer) with the (player) exit clauses that we had to suffer until more or less September, this club is totally on the right path. Advertisement Advertisement “Yes, it is always a bit difficult when you don’t know at the end of May exactly in which league you are because of different scenarios. “For sure, it's always a bit tricky, but in the background we’ve prepared a lot. There will be lots of work to do also over the upcoming weeks, that's definite for sure. \"I am not sure if everything (with the squad for next season) will be ready by pre season, but once the new season starts, we will definitely be prepared.” Bringing in some more top-level Championship experience to compliment the club’s younger players is likely to be a thrust of recruitment, with Farke also admitting that his side badly missed the injured Patrick Bamford on Sunday. Advertisement Advertisement He added: \"If you go pretty deeper and analyse it, a bit more experience would have definitely helped, yes. It would have definitely helped to have Patrick Bamford available for such a game like this, but it was not meant to be.”",

Ms Allan, who is standing down at the general election, endorsed Reform's Alan Adams to succeed her in the Shropshire seat. Following her public declaration of support for Mr Adams, the Conservatives took immediate action and suspended Ms Allan from the party. But, in the latest blow to Rishi Sunak during a bumpy start to the PM's general election campaign, she claimed she had already quit the Tories in order to back Mr Adams' bid. Ms Allan claimed the Reform hopeful was 'genuinely the best person for the job' and warned against allowing the Labour candidate a 'walkover' in Telford. Outgoing MP Lucy Allan has quit the Tories in order to support a Reform UK candidate to replace her in her Telford constituency Ms Allan, who is standing down at the general election, endorsed Reform's Alan Adams to succeed her in the Shropshire seat It is the latest blow to Rishi Sunak during a bumpy start to the Prime Minister's general election campaign She said: 'I have resigned from the Conservative Party to support Alan Adams to be Telford's next MP. 'I have known Alan for many years and he is genuinely the best person for the job. I want the best for Telford and I can't just let the Labour candidate have a walkover. ' Ms Allan added: 'As a Royal Navy veteran, Alan knows what it means to serve. 'He is the candidate who is most in touch with Telford people and best able to represent them. He will serve all residents, not just those who vote for him. 'Alan is not in it for personal advantage, power, or control over people. Alan's motivation for standing for election is profoundly honourable. He will be honest with Telford and put Telford first. 'Alan gives Telford a choice, so that Telford does not have to settle for more of the same politics and more of the same politicians.' Ms Allan had made her astonishing endorsment of Mr Adams in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. She wrote: 'I am supporting Alan Adams to be Telford's next MP. If you want to help Alan or donate to his campaign, sign up on his website alanadams.co.uk.' Reform MP Lee Anderson, a former Tory deputy chairman, replied: 'Thanks Lucy. A great move.' Asked about Ms Allan's revolt against the Tories, Mr Sunak said: 'I think when it comes to Reform, I understand people's frustrations, but it is very simple: either Keir Starmer or me is going to be PM on July 5. 'So if you are someone who wants strong borders and wants to get a grip of illegal migration, if you are someone who wants a more pragmatic, serious, hard-headed approach to Net Zero which prioritises energy security and cutting people's bills, I am going to deliver that, not Keir Starmer. 'That is the choice at this election. So for people who are thinking about voting for other parties, but particularly Reform, all that is going to do is put Keir Starmer in power and you are not going to see any change on the issues that you care about.' A Conservative Party spokesperson said: 'Lucy Allan has been suspended from the Party with immediate effect. 'The people of Telford now have the chance to vote for a dedicated and hardworking new candidate who will put Telford first. A vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer .' Responding to Ms Allan's endorsement of their candidate a Reform spokesman said: 'Of course we are absolutely delighted that she is backing our candidate in Telford. 'She, like many Conservatives, feels that the Reform Party represents traditional centre-right values and priorities in a way that the Conservative Party has long forgotten.' Ms Allan was first elected as Conservative MP for Telford at the 2015 general election, when she won the seat off Labour. She defended the seat with a near-11,000 vote majority at the 2019 general election. The Conservatives chose Hannah Campbell as their candidate in the constituency in December last year, after Ms Allan announced her decision to stand down at the general election. It is the latest sign of unrest within the Tory ranks following Mr Sunak's decision to call a general election much earlier than most of his MPs had been expecting. Tory peer Lord Goldsmith, an ally of former prime minister Boris Johnson, hit out at Mr Sunak and indicated he believed the Conservatives were on course for an electoral disaster. 'I understand the anger towards Sunak who has damaged the party almost beyond repair and all but guaranteed the majority of his MPs will lose their job next month,' the former minister said. 'But it's hard to muster much sympathy given that none of this would have happened without the complicity of a majority of the party and what is now unfolding was entirely predictable – indeed predicted. 'The hope is that when Sunak disappears off to California in a few weeks there are at least some decent MPs left around which to rebuild.' Mr Sunak this evening insisted he would remain in the UK, whether or not he won the election. Asked about the claim he would move to California, he told ITV News: 'It's simply not true. I mean, it's just simply not true.' Southampton fan Mr Sunak added: 'This is my home. I mean, my football team just got promoted back in the Premiership and I hope to be watching them for years to come in the Premier League.'

New Delhi : The Customs officials arrested 5 travellers from Uzbekistan at the Delhi airport for allegedly smuggling gold into the country. At least 3 kg of gold was found on them, the market value of which was Rs 1.92 crore, said reports. Passengers came via Dubai to avoid detection The accused were intercepted at Delhi Airport’s domestic terminal T-1 on Thursday. They had come from Mumbai, said officials. Officials said that they had hoped to pass through the domestic terminal easily and therefore bought a Mumbai-Delhi ticket, after landing in Mumbai from Dubai. Officials said that they had hoped to evade scrutiny of the customs department by passing through the domestic terminal of Delhi, instead of international arrivals at the Mumbai Airport. However luck ran out for them and they were caught. The passengers after disembarking from the Mumbai flight were brought by the customs officers at the Office of Preventive Customs (Shift) located at the international arrival hall of T-3, IGI Airport in New Delhi. They were checked personally and their baggage was also examined thoroughly. Customs officials found 9 gold chains weighing 2.8 kg on the passengers. The ornaments were worth Rs 1.92 crore in the international market at present, said officials. The passengers confessed that they had bought a ticket from Dubai to Mumbai and then Delhi so as to avoid customs, as they knew that it would be moved out through domestic arrivals and not through international arrivals in Delhi. All of them have now been arrested and proper action will be taken against them, said officials at the Customs Department. Officials also seized the gold they were carrying.",

I’ve never found Le Creuset in the wild,\" they added. This steal was certainly nothing to sneeze at. After all, they had found not one, but four items from the pricey label. The buys were also making some people nostalgic. \"Oh s**t, that is the original stuff with the handle design. We have one from my grandmother. That's awesome,\" wrote one user. They had no doubt saved hundreds on the thrifting spree. High-end kitchenware brand Le Creuset sells Round Dutch Ovens ranging in size from 2 quarts to 13 and 1/4 quarts with prices from $260 to $625.

They’re like 90% literal trash and 10% treasure lol. You have to be dedicated, but I’ve made some amazing purchases there,\" yet another reader chimed in. Why is Le Creuset so expensive? Le Creuset cookware is on the wishlists of many home cooks and bakers. But the French brand's Dutch ovens can cost between $260 and $750, and even a bread loaf pan will set you back $180. So what warrants such hefty price tags? Le Creuset's Dutch ovens are among its most popular items, and they — along with several other pieces of their cookware — are made with high-quality enameled cast iron. They're meant to last a long time and even carry a lifetime warranty \"to be free from defects in material and workmanship.\" \"It’s like, do you really wanna buy a $50 piece of something over and over again, or do you wanna invest in something and know that you’re gonna have it for a long time?\" Nate Collier, Le Creuset's director of marketing and communications, said to Eater . According to Cookware Insider , 15 quality control officers inspect each of the brand's items before they're sold. Of course, they're pretty, too, and quite the status symbol. \"You think of it as a simple piece of cookware, but even the silhouette of our Dutch oven is recognizable,\" Collier said. \"You could show someone a line drawing without any color, and most people that are familiar with cookware would be able to tell you that it's specifically a Le Creuset Dutch oven.\" Celebrity fans include Julia Child, Marilyn Monroe, Jennifer Garner, and Taylor Swift.",

        "content": "In an interview with Fightful , Mark Haskins spoke about Ring of Honor in its current incarnation, which he feels takes a backseat to AEW. Haskins was a part of the original ROH during its final years between 2018 and 2021. He said: “ I think that it’s a very cool take on Ring of Honor. From what I’ve seen, I think that it definitely gets me excited. I’m just glad that things ended, especially with my relationship with it, the way they did because they took so good care of us during COVID. They didn’t release us. They kept us on board. They kept paying us. Then that was one of the biggest driving forces for me was I wanted to be able to come back and be able to repay them in any way that I could. It was a huge motivation for me to be a greater asset by the time that I could get back to America than the time that they last saw me because I was so grateful for the care that they had given towards all of us. So the fact that things ended the way that they did, you know, I’m sad, but what can you do? Do you know what I mean? I’m kind of gutted that they didn’t have another investor just from the The sole point that I think that Ring of Honor was, especially around January, February time, 2020, there was such this vibe that we were, yeah, we’re going to step up. We’re going to take on the world. We’re going to do this, right? So it felt like there could have been another big promotion fighting in that competition between all the big promotions, right? Whereas it’s great that Tony Khan bought it, but I do feel that then it kind of takes a second place to AEW rather than stepping up and being another contender as such. ”",

Asked about his management style, the 38-year-old told Argyle TV: “Obviously I had my playing career, which I loved, but if you want to go into management, you quite quickly have to move on from there. “I’ve put a lot of work in, a lot of time in to try to develop myself as a coach, try to improve, try to get better, and I want to be a coach who helps players, helps teams, develops players, academy players. “Academy players are really important as well, to try to improve them, because I was a player who came into the first team at 16.

Dewsnip was the head of Everton’s academy who eased him through the ranks and the pair will now work together to plot the way forward for Argyle. Rooney, who admitted the two men had not seen each other for around 10 years until Birmingham played at Plymouth in December last year, said: “Of course with Neil’s role at the club and my role at the club, it’s going to have to be a daily basis I’m speaking to Neil now. “I think ultimately the important thing in that is we’re both trying to do the right thing, we both want the right thing, we’re both on the same wavelength now to make sure the club moves forward on players coming into the football club, style of play, how we want to move forward. “That relationship now is going to be so important.”",

        "description": "A home that was rescued from demolition and a site of a major regeneration programme have won awards for being “outstanding” pieces of architecture.",
        "content": "The awards have been given by RIBA, the Royal Institute of British Architects, as they name “outstanding works of the built environment” for 2024. The institute has been celebrating architecture for over 180 years and running the awards for 50 years. It claims that its awards and prizes are “regarded internationally as a mark of excellence”, recognising architecture, architects, research and students. A spokesperson for RIBA said: “Successful projects reflect changes and innovations in architecture, but at their core display a commitment to designing and developing buildings and spaces for the improvement and enhancement of people’s lives.” Here are the some of the places awarded in north London: The house at Templewood Lane was created by modernist architect Trevor Dannatt in 1960, and was at risk of being demolished. However it was reimagined by Coppin Dockray, who contacted Mr Dannatt about the home for an American client. A description by the RIBA reads: “Their coherent new interventions and careful conservation demonstrate a real understanding of how to make the most of light and views. “Poor ground-floor additions have been rationalised to establish the kitchen as the heart of the house, with living rooms to the rear. Above, a new metal-clad extension houses bedrooms. Sustainable through its retention and upgrading of building fabric and services, the house revels in a quiet mastery of its materials palette, both inside and out.” This three-storey office near King’s Cross station, was designed by the Coffey Architects. A description reads: “ Using a diagonal grid optimised the lightweight concrete and steel structure, whilst improving orientation both for views and heat gain. It also enabled the creation of a sawtooth roofline which not only references the industrial context of King’s Cross, but also creates a natural landmark on this corner site. “The façades deploy embossed and intricately perforated aluminium panels over a variety of transparent, translucent and solid curtain walls, providing a fascinating interplay of dappled light over the façade and within.” Work for the Brent Cross Town regeneration is still ongoing, as it’s set to deliver 6,700 new homes, workspaces for 25,000 people, as well as leisure facilities including restaurants and a cinema. But the first building as part of its redevelopment – the three-storey visitor pavilion – has won an award. A description reads: “The project creates both private and public spaces for events, exhibitions, show apartments, and offices, which, together with a café, provide a dedicated venue for the local and wider public to learn about the masterplan. “It is designed as two short two-storey wings acting as galleries off a central double-height space, with a rooftop terrace and further accommodation on part of the third storey. The architects have conceived it with an eye towards sustainability as well as its inevitably changing role over time.” Unity Place introduced 235 social rent homes as part of the 15-year South Kilburn regeneration programme. It offers what is described as affordable homes of different sizes, along with a community hub, play space and parking. A description reads: “Infrastructure constraints and the proximity to conservation areas and listed buildings posed challenges for the design. The architects met these with a varied but unified scheme that reinstates historical street patterns, harmonising high-density housing with the surrounding low- to medium-rise buildings through contextually sympathetic materials.” After the sudden death of his wife, architect Jonathan Wilson crafted a two-storey home for himself in Haringey. A description reads: “A comprehensively rigorous approach to low-energy sustainability has guided every design move. A small oasis in this corner of the city, the house is a simple, calming environment, with a strong inside–outside connection and a piano at its heart. “It succeeds in effortlessly and elegantly meeting the specific living needs of its owner while serving as a demonstration project for how to go about creating a fully Passivhaus-certified dwelling.” King’s Cross has had a major redevelopment after it was first granted planning permission in 2006. The estate includes 100 shops, bars and restaurants and 1,750 homes and 10 public spaces. It resulted in 50 new buildings introduced to the area. The RIBA description reads: “From the start, the project team set out their ‘principles for a human city’, based on offering character, variety, choice, and a sense of belonging which can underpin rapidly changing patterns of social and economic behaviour. \"These have been deployed not in a grandiose manner, but through careful understanding and reshaping of found geometries, stitching a previously cut-off part of the city back into the wider urban fabric. \"Excellent buildings by a range of architects characterise the campus, but all in a way that informs and substantiates the critical open spaces and routes which are the project’s true legacy.",

        "content": "Rooney, who burst on to the Premier League scene as a 16-year-old at Everton, has been handed the reins at Home Park less than five months after losing his job at Birmingham. And the former Manchester United and England forward has backed his ability to develop potential talent in Devon. Asked about his management style, the 38-year-old told Argyle TV: “Obviously I had my playing career, which I loved, but if you want to go into management, you quite quickly have to move on from there. “I’ve put a lot of work in, a lot of time in to try to develop myself as a coach, try to improve, try to get better, and I want to be a coach who helps players, helps teams, develops players, academy players. “Academy players are really important as well, to try to improve them, because I was a player who came into the first team at 16. I think a lot of young players are good enough, but maybe don’t get the chance, so I’ve got a real passion for that as well.” Rooney, who acknowledged his journey to Plymouth via spells at Derby, DC United and Birmingham had its challenges, is excited about the latest phase of his career, which will see him link up once again with the club’s director of football Neil Dewsnip. Dewsnip was the head of Everton’s academy who eased him through the ranks and the pair will now work together to plot the way forward for Argyle. Rooney, who admitted the two men had not seen each other for around 10 years until Birmingham played at Plymouth in December last year, said: “Of course with Neil’s role at the club and my role at the club, it’s going to have to be a daily basis I’m speaking to Neil now. “I think ultimately the important thing in that is we’re both trying to do the right thing, we both want the right thing, we’re both on the same wavelength now to make sure the club moves forward on players coming into the football club, style of play, how we want to move forward. “That relationship now is going to be so important.”",

        "description": "Trump's constant criticism of his trial judge will not play well with the jury, a former prosecutor has said.",
        "content": "Former President 's repeated attacks on the judge in his criminal hush money case will be seen as disrespectful by the jury, a former prosecutor has said. Jim Walden, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, said that Trump doesn't seem to understand that juries have a good relationship with judges. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden told on Monday. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound.\" \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be—a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician—he's a dumb lawyer,\" Walden said. He added that Trump was too involved in his own legal defense. Walden, who previously prosecuted organized crime cases in New York, said the worst defense mistake was calling attorney Robert Costello as a witness. Costello, who had given legal advice to Trump's former attorney and fixer , was called by the defense to undermine Cohen's evidence. Judge Juan Merchan was infuriated by Costello and accused him of interjecting with comments, rolling his eyes and staring at Merchan from the witness stand. Merchan eventually cleared the courtroom of reporters and accused Costello of \"contemptuous\" behavior. He also challenged Costello to stare at him one more time. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden said. \"The defense finally got some momentum, and it all got dialed back because Costello was playing to Trump instead of playing it straight. He had a good story to tell, and instead, they put the throttle right back in the prosecutor's hands.\" reached out to Trump's attorney via email for comment on Monday. Costello told on Friday that he had no comment. The prosecution that before the 2016 presidential election, Trump paid or discussed paying adult film star not to discuss an affair she says they had in 2006. Trump, the presumptive 2024 nominee for president, denies the affair. Manhattan District Attorney charged Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records in April 2023, arguing that the payment to Daniels was made through Cohen and that the payment was an illegal campaign contribution because it was intended to silence Daniels and thereby influence the 2016 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges and maintains that the case is politically motivated. Cohen was later jailed for illegal campaign contributions, tax fraud and other charges. He is now an implacable opponent of Trump and they have attacked each other's characters on social media posts since the trial began.

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria Five academic staff drag UNN to court over removal from governing board Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News Five academic staff drag UNN to court over removal from governing board Published on May 27, 2024 By Matthew Atungwu Five academic staff of the University of Nigeria Nsukka, UNN, have filed a lawsuit against the management of the university at the Federal Court High sitting in Enugu for refusing to allow elected members of the Governing Council to serve out their tenure. The aggrieved academics, comprising three professors, argued that they were elected for a four-year tenure as internal members of the governing board but were not allowed to continue in office after the dissolution and reconstitution of the governing councils of the federal universities. The applicants, through their counsel, Chidioke Ezeh, urged the court for an interlocutory injunction stopping the university from conducting fresh elections into the governing council of the institution. Joined in the suit marked FHC/E/CS/97 2024, were the university governing council, the Senate of the university, Vice Chancellor and the pro-Chancellor of the institution. The applicants prayed for an order compelling both parties in the suit to maintain the peace and status quo pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit. They also demanded any other order or such further orders as the honourable court may deem fit and proper to make in the circumstances. The applicants, in a motion on notice, said they were distinctively elected as internal members of the governing council of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, from the various categories of Senate, convocation and congregation. They stated that they have their own distinct memoranda to council, election results, notice of meeting and minutes of meetings. The suit equally urged the court to construe relevant provisions of the Interpretation Act as to what constitutes four-year under the law. The applicants disclosed that they have held several meetings with the 4th defendant, who is the vice Chancellor of the university, but he has remained obstinate and recalcitrant in doing the unlawful act probably because his tenure as vice chancellor will come to an end sometime in June 2024. “We have held several meetings with the 4th defendant, but he has remained obstinate and recalcitrant in doing the unlawful thing probably because his tenure as vice chancellor will be coming to an end sometime in June 2024. “That the contention and reason of the 4th defendant upon which he is currently acting arbitrarily was that the Federal Government of Nigeria at a time suspended all boards of the Federal Government institutions decision of which we know has been rescinded since,” the motion on notice read in parts.

        "content": "Nia Sharma , known for her versatile acting prowess and ability to breathe life into diverse characters, is gearing up for her latest venture, the highly anticipated fantasy-thriller-romance ' Suhagan Chudail '. As the talented actress prepares for the launch of the show, she continues a cherished 13-year tradition that has become an integral part of her creative journey. For over a decade, Nia has been visiting the revered Siddhivinayak Temple in Mumbai, seeking divine blessings and guidance before embarking on new projects. This time is no different, as Nia expresses, \"Before every new venture, I make sure to visit Siddhivinayak. I have been going there for 13 years now, and this time is no exception. Seeking Bappa's blessings today fills me with gratitude. I'm thrilled to be a part of Suhagan Chudail and eagerly await the audience's reaction. Ganpati Bappa Morya!\" The actress looked pretty in a white and sky blue salwar kameez and was very excited to seek blessings from Ganpati Bappa. The actress posed for photos and was presented a picture of Siddhivinayak. She shared a video of her visit to the famous temple and captioned it as, \"Continuing the 13 year long tradition of seeking #blessings at Siddhivinayak Ganpati bappa Moryaa🙌 The journey begins tonight.. Hope to recieve immense love. #suhaganchudail @colorstv #Richa @peninsulapictures @maansingh_110 @zaynibadkhan @debchandrima_official @sarangadutta12 and the entire team ❤️.\" In the new fantasy-thriller-romance 'Suhagan Chudail,' the show warns of protecting loved ones from a deadly enchantress.

However, she is challenged by Deeya (Debchandrima Singha Roy), who fiercely protects Moksh (Zayn Ibad Khan) with her love. Nia is making her fiction comeback with Suhagan Chudail and her look in the show is currently most talked about.",

        "content": "Bay Area air quality officials have launched an investigation into Tesla, charging the electric automaker with letting massive amounts of harmful toxins escape into the air from its Fremont car factory. In a double blow, an environmental group has filed a new lawsuit against the company over such pollution releases. Since 2019, Tesla, which made $17.7 billion in profit last year according to regulatory filings, has allowed 112 illegal toxic releases, each containing as much as 750 pounds of harmful contaminants, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District said in a news release early this month. Even low levels of ozone created when the emitted chemicals meet sunlight can harm health, especially for children, older people and those with asthma, the district said. Other released contaminants can cause cancer and, even at low levels, neurological damage and reproductive and developmental damage, according to the regulatory agency, which pointed to Tesla's paint-spraying booths and paint-baking ovens as sources of the pollution. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment on the district's investigation and allegations or claims in the lawsuit. District officials announced May 2 that they were seeking an order to shut down the Fremont plant's two car-painting departments if Tesla would not agree to hire outside experts to help stop the emissions. The district said this week that it had previously probed Tesla's pollution from the factory and found it resulted from repeated problems in the painting departments' containment systems and production lines. \"Operational changes were made by Tesla, but ultimately, they were not enough,\" said district spokeswoman Kristina Chu, adding that the agency may sue Tesla over the emissions. Despite \"extensive discussion\" between district officials and the company, Tesla has not stemmed the emissions, the district said in its request for an order from its hearing board, which rules on regulatory-compliance issues. Meanwhile, the car maker led by notoriously regulation-hostile CEO Elon Musk is facing a new lawsuit by a local claiming Tesla's \"extensive and ongoing\" pollutant releases are exposing residents and workers in the area to harmful chemicals, including arsenic. \"It feels to us like profits are more important than actually being a good neighbor and supporting ,\" said Tanya Boyce, executive director of the Environmental Democracy Project, a nonprofit corporation that filed the lawsuit last week in San Francisco U.S. District Court. Boyce noted that children attend Bringhurst Elementary school within a mile of the Tesla plant. Her group's lawsuit, which cites \"a long history of noncompliance with environmental laws\" at the factory, alleged Tesla broke federal air quality rules more than 160 times between January 2021 and January 2024. Records from Tesla submitted with the lawsuit list more than 90 violations between January 2022 and June 2023 of the company's permit from the air quality district. Tesla attributed the causes nearly every time to \"unforeseen\" breakdowns and malfunctions, according to the records. The air quality district in its news release described Tesla's emissions as \"foreseeable.\" The Environmental Democracy Project targets pollution affecting communities of color. The City of Fremont describes itself as \"one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse cities in the Bay Area,\" with 63% of residents speaking a language other than English at home. U.S. Census data show the city's population is 62% Asian, 21% White, 12% Latino and 3% Black. In a March letter to Musk, the Environmental Democracy Project said it was planning to sue Tesla in federal court over its alleged violations of the federal Clean Air Act because the air quality district had not done so already, \"leaving it to citizens like EDP to bring their own enforcement action.\" The nonprofit is seeking a court order barring Tesla from violating air quality regulations, and fines of up to $121,000 per day for each alleged violation of the Clean Air Act. The Fremont factory, where Tesla makes its models 3, X, Y and S, has long been a target for regulatory and legal action. In February, eight Bay Area counties sued Tesla, claiming it illegally dumped produced in its Fremont plant and its auto service centers around the region. District attorneys in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano and Sonoma counties along with 17 other California DAs allege in San Joaquin County Superior Court that the company broke a host of laws on labeling, transportation and disposal of toxic materials. In a February 2022 settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Tesla agreed to pay a $275,000 fine for breaking the Clean Air Act at the Fremont plant over a three-year period. Tesla in 2021 was fined $750,000 in a settlement with the air district for committing 33 air quality violations since 2015. In 2019, the company agreed to pay a $31,000 penalty over hazardous waste violations at the Fremont factory in another settlement with the U.S. EPA. Boyce believes the \"very small\" penalties are just \"the cost of doing business\" for Tesla. Musk has frequently defied and disparaged regulations and regulators and tweeted last year, \"Like Gulliver, tied down by thousands of little strings, we lose our freedom one regulation at a time.\" In 2018, Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charge that he misled investors with a tweet about taking Tesla private—then he took to Twitter to mock the SEC. At the start of the COVID pandemic, Tesla kept the Fremont plant running for nearly a week in violation of a public health order, with Musk tweeting that an \"ignorant\" Alameda County health officer was violating \"our Constitutional freedoms.\"",

Because it appeared to still be causing him discomfort, our medical team took X-rays and determined that removing the leg would be the best for Baxter’s long-term outcome. Now healed from his surgery, Baxter is ready for his new family! He has had a lot of transitions and he needs a home that understands it may take him a little while to settle in. Only having three legs doesn’t slow him down at all, and he’ll happily go for walks with you and then have a good snuggle on the couch. If Baxter sounds like he could be your boy, come on in to the Brunswick campus and ask to meet him! Success. Please wait for the page to reload.

        "content": "Kick streamer ‘ShaktyG’ challenged himself to repeat the word ‘Kick’ a whopping one million times in an epic charity subathon. Imagine repeating the same word one million times? It sounds ridiculous and time-consuming, but that’s exactly what happened when streamer ‘ShaktyG’ set out to raise money for charity. After being live for over 233 hours, ShaktyG finally completed his goal, but the journey was not easy, to say the least. Over 233 hours streamed himself saying Kick 1,000,000 times for charity! 💚 Like most , the timer increases with each sub or follow, but ShaktyG faced a problem after taking 115 hours to get half-way through his goal. Even though he was only having 3-4 hours of sleep during the challenge, he remaining to say Kick 1M times, so he decided to keep going, even if the countdown hit zero. Fortunately, the Kick community came through with a massive boost, giving him more time to complete the challenge as originally intended. 70% of the way through! I underestimated the power of the Kick community. I thought the timer was going to run out today and hit 0, but the followers and subs came through, and we still have more than 5 hours on the countdown timer! Eventually, when all was said and done, he was able to hit 1,432 subs and 2,646 follows. Upon saying the final ‘Kick,’ the streamer was on the verge of tears and was visibly trying to hold back his emotions. Following the end of the stream, ShaktyG thanked everyone involved for helping him on his quest. “From fellow streamers raiding and dropping by with words of encouragement, to the Kick staff boosting my reach, and to my parents and girlfriend who even donated because they couldn’t bear to see the countdown timer hit zero! I’m truly blessed to share this moment with you all and am incredibly thankful to be part of this amazing community,” he . “Saying ‘Kick’ a million times was not just about charity; it was a personal challenge to prove to myself that I can achieve anything I set my mind to. No matter how many times I stumble, I’ll always find a way to rise and make you all proud.” The money raised will be donated to the appropriately-named food distribution project ‘Kick out Hunger.’ As for ShaktyG, he’s already about what he’ll tackle next and if it’s anything like his ‘Kick’ subathon, expect big things from this up-and-coming content creator.",

        "description": "THE 17th edition of the annual Toyota Road Trek unfolded on May 15, 2024. This event serves as Toyota's gesture of appreciation to its media allies for their yearlong support, and doubles as an opportunity to showcase the brand's latest products, either recently launched or scheduled for later release.Not everyone receives an invitation to the Toyota Road Trek. It might be perceived as an exclusive gathering, akin to an old boys club (inclusive of women, of course), but it's primarily a logistical matter. Toyota can only accommodate a limited number of automotive journalists for the event, or else risk financial strain.This year's journey promised to be extraordinary as we aimed for Davao City, followed by a retreat at the enchanting Discovery Resort on Samal Island. The plan was straightforward: depart at 8:30 a.m. from Terminal 2 in NAIA, and arrive at Davao International Airport by 10:30 a.m.The itinerary included driving the latest Toyota models around scenic and cultural spots in Davao City and nearby areas upon landing, allowing ample time for picturesque snapshots of the vehicles against stunning backdrops.However, things didn't go as planned.Due to unfortunate circumstances or subpar fleet management, our flight via Philippine Airlines (PAL) was delayed by six hours, departing Manila at 2:30 p.m., throwing the Toyota Road Trek schedule into disarray.This delay not only inconvenienced our plans but also incurred significant costs for Toyota Motor Philippines.Subsequently, we learned that PAL was operating with constraints. Out of the 78 aircraft intended for service, 14 were reportedly grounded for maintenance. Yet PAL persisted with its flight schedules without adjustments, resulting in delays and involuntary boarding denials.In such instances, passengers are often rescheduled onto subsequent flights, potentially on smaller aircraft, necessitating a reduction in the number of passengers accommodated.Four members of our group narrowly avoided being denied boarding, thanks to the intervention of PAL's Corporate Communications head Cielo Villaluna, who ensured our group boarded together.Yet, it's disheartening to note PAL's apparent disregard for customer welfare. Despite the extensive delay, passengers received only fast-food burgers and water to satiate their hunger, surpassing the airline passenger rights threshold of four hours without appropriate compensation.On the return journey, Toyota collected our contact details, indicating PAL's assurance of compensation. However, as of writing, no compensation has been received, leaving doubts regarding its adequacy in compensating for the six-hour disruption caused by flight delays.Nevertheless, Toyota's Road Trek persisted amid the challenges, celebrated with fervor within the limited time available. Once again, Toyota demonstrated its commitment, allowing us to explore the Philippines in their vehicles.Salamat po Toyota! Sa uulitin! (Thank you Toyota! Until next time!)As for PAL ... booooo!!!!",

        "content": "AzmanJaka/E+ via Getty Images It has been a very long time since I covered shares of OSI Systems ( NASDAQ: OSIS ), in fact, it was the summer of 2016 when I concluded that appeal was increasing despite a somewhat troubled deal. Fast forwarding in time, OSI has seen solid growth and this has resulted in real value being delivered for its shareholders, all of which makes an update on the investment case long overdue. Fast forwarding some 8 years in time, OSI has seen continued growth. On a trailing basis, OSI has grown sales towards the $1.5 billion mark, aided by a couple of huge security orders in recent times. This created a strong 2024, although more orders keep the backlog flat here, creating interesting dynamics going forward, as not all segments are putting in their fair share here. Advanced, Reliable And Critical Electronics Solutions OSI provides advanced and reliable electronics solutions for critical applications across various diversified essential markets. The company is active across three segments which includes security, optoelectronics and healthcare. The security business is by far the largest segment, and the most profitable one, responsible for about 60% of sales. These revenues are generated from the development and manufacturing of security screening systems and solutions for governments, civil infrastructure, border & port security, among others. Optoelectronics is responsible for a quarter of sales, with revenues generated from components and solutions such as photodetectors, laser diodes and lex circuits in a wide range of applications. The remaining 15% of sales are generated in healthcare settings, including patient monitoring, cardiology, connected care and remote monitoring in various healthcare applications. In terms of geographies, half of sales are generated in the US, with the remainder generated notably in the EMEA region, APAC and the remainder of the Americas. When I last looked at the shares in 2016, the company had just completed a decade long period during which the company doubled its sales and grew adjusted earnings to $3 per share, while shares traded at a relatively modest $50 valuation. This was in part the result of shares falling at the time due to some operating hiccups, as the company announced a somewhat troubled acquisition as well. Between 2016 and today, the company has grown sales from around a billion to $1.3 billion in 2023, although that earnings doubled to $6 per share over this point in time. All this means that shares, which traded at $50 in 2016, have traded in a $50-$100 range all the way until the spring of last year. A $100 stock in the spring of last year was unleashed and rose to the $145 mark as of recent, actually trading at all-time highs here. Picking Up The Valuation Here In August of last year, OSI posted its fiscal 2023 results. Full year revenues were up 8% to $1.28 billion, aided by very strong results in the final quarter of last year when sales were up 22%. The company actually saw actual gross profitability down, as the company posted operating profits of $121 million, with the company posting GAAP earnings of $6.45 per share. That however included a one-time gain on the sale of property, with adjusted earnings of $5.81 per share actually being down forty cents on the year before. The company operated with net debt of $288 million, a very manageable amount. The company guided for a spectacular improvement in 2024 results, with revenues seen up more than 18%, with adjusted earnings seen up more than 25% on the year before. This was supported by a huge backlog, which rose some 46% to $1.8 billion after the company took in a few large orders, including a huge $600 million border inspection order from Mexico's Department of National Defense. In October of last year, the company posted first quarter results with sales up 4% to $279 million, with adjusted earnings up a modest four cents to $0.91 per share. While these results were not that spectacular, it prompted the company into hiking the full year earnings per share guidance, calling for more than 27% growth on an annual basis Second quarter sales were up some 26% to $373 million, with adjusted earnings up a dollar to $2.21 per share. Following this impressive quarter, the company now saw full year sales grow by more than 19%, with earnings per share growth seen in excess of 29%. In April, third quarter sales were reported up 34% to $405 million, with adjusted earnings up 45% to $2.16 per share. With earnings growth seen in excess of 30% per share here, earnings are expected to surpass $7.50 per share here. Given the greater earnings power here, net debt is down to about a quarter of a billion, as all this momentum is aided and supported by a continued backlog of $1.8 billion here. What Now? With 17.4 million shares of OSI trading at $145, equity of the company is valued at $2.52 billion, for a $2.77 billion enterprise valuation. This values the operations at less than 2 times sales with shares trading at 19 times earnings, after a great momentum run seen, with net leverage seen around 1.5 times. What is of interest is that here is great divergence between the segments. Irony will it that through the first nine months of the year, revenues for the optoelectronics and healthcare division are down, and the same applies for margins. This shows that all this momentum is driven by the security division, which has reported a 42% increase in sales so far this year to $700 million, pushing up its share to two-thirds of sales. This also shows the potential for other value accretive moves as the healthcare segment is barely profitable here, leaving potential for OSI to over time, become a more focused business, as the security business is notably the biggest, fastest growing business and also the most profitable segment out there. Amidst all this, I am performing a balancing act. A 19 times earnings multiple, given the organic growth performance, looks appealing, but arguably a few big orders have been driving 2024 growth. That said, after conversion of these orders one were to expect a decline in sales next year, but the backlog has been rather constant, as the order intake remains sound. This looks positive, but of course, growth has been rather dismal in recent years. Given this, I am performing a balancing act, but expect much tougher comparables here going forward. Given this, and the fact that shares have been doing quite well, having risen to fresh all-time highs here, I am leaning cautious here, anticipating some kind of normalization in fiscal 2025. On the other hand, there is potential for segments outside the security business to create value here as well, and despite the interesting dynamics and set-up, I am quite cautious and not willing to chase the shares here.

        "content": "The Bayelsa State governorship election petition tribunal has dismissed the petition filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Timipre Sylva, challenging the re-election of Governor Douye Diri. In a unanimous decision, the three-man panel led by Justice Adekunle Adeleye held that the petitioners failed to provide credible evidence to support their allegations of irregularities in the governorship poll. The tribunal struck out additional proof of evidence and witness statements filed by the petitioners, citing a breach of electoral laws. It also dismissed allegations of forgery against Deputy Governor Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, stating that the issue was a pre-election matter that had become statute barred. The tribunal noted that the petitioners’ prayers were contradictory, seeking both a declaration as winners and a nullification of the election. It held that the petitioners failed to discharge the burden of proof and unable to show specific polling units where irregularities occurred and how it affected the outcome. Justice Adeleye, who read the lead judgment, noted that some allegations contained elements of criminality that ought to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The tribunal upheld preliminary objections filed by the respondents, challenging the competence of the petition. Opinions Balanced, fearless journalism driven by data comes at huge financial costs.

        "content": "A man died after I didn't speak up, and I still feel guilty about it, says DR SCURR. But second opinions aren't enough to save lives - it's the culture of hospitals that has to change By Dr Martin Scurr Published: 11:55 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 12:41 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 7 shares View comments The tragic death of 13-year-old Martha Mills following poor, possibly negligent care at a major London hospital brought back bitter memories of the death of one of my own patients. It also confirmed for me why, sadly, the plan to introduce Martha’s rule — which would give every patient in hospital the right to a second opinion from other experts at the same hospital — won’t help. In February, the Government announced that hospitals in England were to be offered funding to roll out the rule. Already 143 have signed up, it was reported today, and should be operating the scheme by 2025. Martha’s parents have been heroic in their efforts to try to spare others the awful, needless loss of a loved one . Martha's rule follows the tragic death of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who died after developing sepsis in 2021 under the care of King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in South London But Martha’s rule, while laudable, cannot, I am afraid, do one thing that’s vital to its success: and that is to change our hospital culture . I don’t mean just that people are afraid to speak up, to challenge the hierarchy of senior doctors, for that is still an issue (although it is improving, slowly). I mean the lack of continuity of care — no longer taking full responsibility for a patient for their whole hospital ‘journey’ — which came when the structure of hospital care changed from the late 1990s. There’s no doubt that when you have concerns, questioning the doctor is an entirely acceptable and justified approach. And it can save lives. I have never forgiven myself for not intervening more aggressively on one of my own patient’s behalf, with hindsight knowing that if I had, he would have survived. The only way to stop preventable deaths occurring in the NHS is to change our hospital culture, writes Dr Martin Scurr He’d taken himself to A&E — as in Martha’s case, to a top London hospital (although a different one) — on a Friday night with a high temperature, rigors (sweating and shivering) and severe pain down one side of his abdomen. Yes, he was nearly 90 and had type 2 diabetes and a history of heart surgery, but until the day he fell ill with a kidney infection, he’d been able to work — full time. Always dressed in a three-piece suit and the upright bearing of a gentleman, he was the image of how many of us would like to be seen at that seniority: elegant and cognitively intact. But when I went to the hospital to see him on the Monday afternoon after my morning appointments — with three days’ beard growth, desperately ill with developing sepsis, dehydrated and now slightly confused — he was lying parked in a corner bed, where he’d spent all weekend on a small dose of an antibiotic, by mouth: with sepsis he should have been on an antibiotic drip. I was worried about his state and I phoned the consultant (the ward staff were unhelpful, but I found the name of the consultant over the head of the bed). The consultant told me that as it was nearly 5pm, the patient would now be handed over to a new team. That was where I should have intervened — even though as just his GP, I had as much authority as any loved one. What my patient needed was immediate intensive care, but as I suspect many medics would do, I deferred to the hierarchy — I was treading on territory where I had no mandate, hoping instead that the consultant would inform the colleague who was about to take over, about my concern. But I should have stepped over that invisible line. For while those who cared for him in the real world knew this man in his normal, healthy and magnificent self, the hospital team clearly viewed him as a pre-terminal geriatric with a urinary infection. He died the next day having received minimal care with nobody keeping an eye on him to witness his rapid deterioration. I took his death very badly. I felt very guilty that I had not intervened more successfully. As I see it, a major contribution to this sort of tragedy is fragmentation of care — lack of continuity under one single hospital team. This is the result of the loss of the old system where care was provided by a traditional ‘firm’, a team headed by one or two consultants with senior registrars (just below the level of consultant), registrars, senior house officers (two to three years out of medical school) and housemen (recent graduates from medical school). Read More 'Changing the culture of the NHS': As Martha's Rule comes into force, what it means for you and your loved ones - and the complete list of hospitals already signed up In the old ‘firm’ system there was accountability going up through each level of the team: the most junior members saw the most of the patients and when things went badly, they aired their concerns with the next level up; for example, to the registrar, who may well discuss with the senior registrar, and at times the consultant was then involved. This might sound like a recipe for ‘group think’, a sort of mindless consensus of opinion — but my argument would be that the recurrent audit and introspection about whether the right action is being taken countered that. Also, it was not unheard of for a consultant or senior registrar to make a decision to ask another team to come and have a look — a sort of joint team meeting. The sense of responsibility of the firm meant you would often see the senior doctors pop in on the weekend if they were worried about a particular patient. But in my patient’s case, the old type of ‘firm’ had long gone (the victim of the shift in power to management and new restrictions on working hours). It was a weekend and so there was probably only one harassed junior doctor around, there was no Saturday ward round, probably nobody came to see my patient at all unless maybe one of the nursing team called the duty doctor to come along, who may have then shrugged their shoulders and noted that this was an old person on their way out... The old tight-knit team — caring for patients right through the duration of their period of treatment, holding full responsibility — has evolved into what we have now, with experience and increasing responsibility (and full accountability) lost. We will never get the genie back into the bottle and no amount of increased regulation or Care Quality Commission inspections and sanctions can possibly achieve the diligence of the past. Nor will a legal framework, Martha’s rule, enforcing the option of a second opinion when requested. Despite its undoubtedly good intentions, driven by such heartbreaking and needless tragedy, I believe that such a rule will be a non-starter: fiddling while Rome burns.

Eyebrows were raised when the Magpies made the trip Down Under just days after the conclusion of a long season with a summer of international football ahead. Newcastle beat Tottenham on penalties in a friendly in Melbourne before seeing a second string XI get hammered 8-0 by an A-League All Stars team just two days later. Few could see the justification of the two games on the other wise of the world with club legend Alan Shearer labelling it 'madness' and 'crazy'. And Staveley, who spent the weekend at the Monaco Grand Prix, admits she understands the concerns.

        "description": "Arguing for police remand, the police said that they wanted to investigate the hospital records, mobile phone details and other connected aspects, but accused Dr. Taware's lawyer Jitendra Sawant and others argued strongly against the police custody.",
        "content": "A Pune court magistrate A.A. Pande on Monday remanded two doctors of a government hospital and a peon to police custody till May 30 (Thursday) for alleged tampering of the blood samples of a minor boy whose Porsche car killed two techies. The medicos are -- Sassoon Hospital's Head of Forensics Department, Dr. Ajay Taware and Blood Bank head, Dr. Shrihari Halnor, besides a peon Atul Ghatkamble, who was the alleged conduit for the illegal gratification in the matter. Arguing for police remand, the police said that they wanted to investigate the hospital records, mobile phone details and other connected aspects, but accused Dr. Taware's lawyer Jitendra Sawant and others argued strongly against the police custody. Marking a sensational twist, Pune Commissioner of Police Amitesh Kumar said earlier on Monday that the blood samples analysed by the Sassoon Hospital did not match with the minor accused in the Porsche car crash. Kumar said that the purported blood sample of the 17-year-old who was caught in the car crash, was \"thrown in the dustbin\" and the blood sample analysed was of a 'third person', which is being probed now. The shocking details emerged barely hours after the Pune Police raided and arrested the senior doctors and the peon of the Sassoon Hospital for allegedly 'tampering' with the minor accused's blood report. \"We had taken a second blood sample which was given to another hospital for analysis with the intention of carrying out a DNA test later. Now, it has come to light that the Sassoon Hospital blood forensic report was of some other person,\" Kumar told mediapersons. Kumar said that Vishal A. Agarwal (the accused's father) had telephoned Dr. Taware on WhatsApp which is being probed, and the police now have sufficient technical evidence in the matter to prepare a water-tight case against all the accused. The three accused have been shunted to police custody for three days, as the charges of manipulating the crucial blood samples of the 17-year-old boy and submitting a fake blood test report could directly impact the prosecution case and the direction of the police investigation. \"I shall repeat... our case does not rest on the blood samples. The minor boy was in his full senses and aware of the consequences of drinking and driving the car at high speed,\" reiterated Kumar. The 'clean chit' in the blood test report of the accused minor boy, the son of a prominent realtor Vishal S. Agarwal, had sparked a huge row as it enabled him to get off on bail within 15 hours of the fatal May 19 crash in Kalyani Nagar area. In the same case, Vishal S. Agarwal, who was sent to judicial custody for 14 days, was booked in a case pertaining to the tampering of evidence, confining, luring and threatening driver Gangaram Poojari to take the blame for the accident, but he refused and has become a prime prosecution witness. The fatal crash claimed the lives of two IT engineers -- Ashwini Koshtha and her friend Aneesh Awadhiya -- both 24, and hailing from Madhya Pradesh. The minor boy is currently lodged in a Juvenile Correctional Home in Pune. His father is in judicial custody while his grandfather Surendra Kumar Agarwal is in police custody in the same case that has sparked a nationwide furor. So far, at least 9 persons have been arrested in the Porsche case, including three generations of the Agarwal family. They are -- the 17-year-old boy, his father Vishal S. Agarwal, his grandfather Surendra Kumar Agarwal, the two doctors, a peon, the three owners-managers of the pub and bar where the boy and his friends had partied on Saturday-Sunday night -- while two cops of Yerwada Police Station, PI Rahul Jagdale and API Vishwanath Todkari have been suspended for alleged dereliction of duty and other lapses pertaining to the accident, as public anger continues to simmer.",

        "description": "Two Texas metropolitan areas were the only two in the country to experience price drops in the four weeks ending May 19, according to a recent Redfin report.",
        "content": "While house prices in the U.S. reached another record high during the four weeks ending May 19, , two metropolitan areas in Texas have seen them sliding down in the same time frame, going against national trend. San Antonio and Fort Worth experienced the biggest—and only—year-over-year median sale price decreases in the four weeks ending May 19, with drops of respectively -1 percent and -0.6 percent. As of April, the latest data available on Redfin's website, the median sale price of a home in San Antonio was , up 1.5 percent year-over-year; in Fort Worth, it was $330,000, down 2.9 percent compared to April 2023. In the four weeks ending on May 19, the median U.S. home sale price hit a record $387,600, up 4 percent compared to a year earlier—an all-time high. The national median asking price reached a record $420,250 in the same period, up 6.6 percent year-over-year—another all-time high. contacted Redfin for comment by email on Monday. The steady rise of the price of homes in the U.S., which followed a brief housing market correction between late summer 2022 and spring 2023, is mainly being driven by a historic shortage of homes in the country. But stubbornly high mortgage rates are also playing a role, pricing out aspiring homebuyers and discouraging homeowners from letting go of their lower-mortgage properties and putting them on the market. ​​\"Move-up buyers feel stuck because they're ready for their next house, but it just doesn't make financial sense to sell with current interest rates so high,\" said , a Redfin agent in tah, in a news release. \"The homeowners listing right now are often doing so because they need to: one of my clients is selling because of a family emergency, and another couple is selling because they had a baby and simply don't have enough room,\" he added. \"Buyers should take note that many of today's sellers are motivated; if a home doesn't have other offers on the table, offer under asking price and/or ask for concessions because many sellers are willing to negotiate.\" High housing costs have led to one of the biggest declines in home sales in three months, according to Redfin. In the four weeks ending May 19, home sales were down 4.2 percent year-over-year. In the previous four-week period, home sales were down 4.4 percent compared to a year earlier. Three of the top five metropolitan areas with the biggest year-over-year increases were in California. In Anaheim, California, the median sale price of a home increased by 20.1 percent; in San Jose, California, by 12.9 percent; and in Oakland, California, by 12.5 percent. The other two cities in the top five were Detroit, Michigan, which experienced an increase of 16.9 percent and West Palm Beach, Florida, where the median sale price of a home rose by 12 percent.

        "content": "A couple of days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the infamous \"mujra\" remark about the opposition INDIA bloc in Bihar during the Lok Sabha election campaign, former Bihar chief minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Rabri Devi on Monday hit back in the same coin. She didn't hesitate to ridicule PM Modi when journalists drew her attention to the remark. She said, as quoted by news agency , \"And what does Modi do? Play the tabla?\" Rabri Devi, RJD's founding president and Lalu Prasad Yadav's wife, stated that facing defeat in the Lok Sabha polls, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) had “gone crazy and taken to blabbering\". On being asked to respond to a comment by PM Modi, who alleged that the INDIA bloc was receiving support from 'jihadis' sponsored by Pakistan, she said, \"If it is indeed so, what are the intelligence agencies doing? And before indulging in the dog whistle over Pakistan, they should remember one of their tallest leaders Lal Krishna Advani, who went on to become the deputy prime minister, was born in that country.\" What Asaduddin Owaisi said? Slamming the PM for making such comments, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi said the PM was doing a disco dance with China when the latter's troops reportedly captured around 2,000 square kilometres of the Indian territory. He took to X and wrote, \"@narendramodi Ji, you talked about Mujra, so Asaduddin Owaisi wants to ask you that for the last 3 years, China has occupied 2 thousand square kilometers of Indian land, Modi ji, you are not removing China, so were you doing Disco Dancing with China?\" \"Is this the type of language the prime minister should use? Does Modi think we do not have mouth to speak? ( ),\" Owaisi said. What PM Modi had said Addressing multiple poll rallies in Bihar, PM Modi attacked the INDIA bloc over the reservation issue and accused it of doing ‘mujra’ for the Muslim vote bank. \"I am giving the guarantee to Bihar SC, ST, OBC communities, till Modi is alive, I will not let them snatch away their rights. For Modi, the Constitution is supreme, for Modi, Babasaheb Ambedkar's sentiments are supreme... if the INDI alliance wants to accept the servitude of their vote bank, they are free to do so...if they want to perform mujra (dance), they are free to do... I will still stand with the SC, ST, and OBC reservations staunchly. ,\" he said. Following his comments, he was criticised by several opposition leaders, including Congress' Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge, National Conference's Farooq Abdullah, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal's Tejashwi Yadav.

        "content": "With Young Africans' Stephane Aziz Ki still being linked with a move to the DStv Premiership and his contract on the brink of expiration, the attacker's preferred next destination has reportedly been revealed. The Burkina Faso international's future in Dar es Salaam hangs in the balance. The Tanzanian Premier League season is approaching its end and, consequently, so is the attacking midfielder's time with Yanga, as things stand. The 28-year-old's contract at the Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium expires at the end of the campaign, and his team is seemingly desperate to keep hold of his services after he helped them tremendously both domestically and on the continent. The Ivory Coast-born attacker has 17 goals in the league and is vying for Golden Boot honours, and also has two goals and two assists in the 12 CAF Champions League matches he played in for his club. As such, Yanga want to retain the 12-cap Burkinabe's services, and club president Hersi Said is believed to have initiated negotiations over an extension, but so far, Aziz Ki has not put pen to paper on a new deal. According to , the reason for his reluctance to commit his future to Young Africans is because he is leaning towards a move outside of Tanzania, preferably South Africa. The record Tanzanian champions are believed to have made a lucrative offer for him to extend his stay, but Aziz Ki is believed to be more receptive to accepting a move to the PSL. In recent weeks, the Adjame native has been linked with possible moves to the likes Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, and given that he is approaching free agency, he has his destiny in his own hands.

        "content": "Holidaymakers in Menorca have been barred from its picturesque streets after fed up locals have taken to chaining them off. Residents in the whitewashed town of Binibeca Vell have blocked off some of their labyrinthine, Instagrammable streets which have earned it the title of the \"Mykonos of Spain\". Locals claim the small, cobbled streets have been flooded with tourists intruding on their private properties vying for the perfect holiday snap. Some claim rowdy tourists have even scaled balconies and entered their doorways. Thick ropes and chains with 'no pedestrians' signs have now been strung across some streets in a bid to keep out non-residents between 8pm and 11am. The small town of 500 people on the south of the Balearic island has become increasingly popular with tourists, with 800,000 annual visitors. The blockades are among a spate of drastic measures taken across popular destinations in Europe protesting against mass tourism. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly The town's stunning cobbled streets have been cordoned off to tourists ( Image: MMN/SOLARPIX.COM) Binibeca residents are set to take a vote in August on whether to ban tourists altogether, The Telegraph reports. Head of the town's residents association Óscar Monge has accused Menorcan authorities of not doing enough to mitigate the impact of mass tourism. \"Binibeca is promoted by the administration and tourism companies, but what benefit do we get out of it?\" he said. \"We pay dearly for being the most potent tourist attraction in Menorca.\" Locals in Ibiza have taken to street protests over the number of boozed-up, partying tourists making life chaos for permanent residents, while graffiti in a Majorcan town left the stark message, \"tourist go home\". Meanwhile, thousands staged demonstrations in the Canary Islands last month over fears the influx of visitors is damaging the environment. The town receives 800,000 visitors a year despite only 500 permanent residents ( Image: MMN/SOLARPIX.COM) A statement on Binibeca's website has already asked tourists not to visit in the evenings or early mornings, with pictures showing people splayed out across steps and even sitting in one resident's chair. Mr Monge previously told The Guardian the town was \"not a place of adventure\" but a \"private housing development\". Residents in the town were given nearly £13,000 by the Spanish government to deal with rubbish left by tourists, but it's understood the deal has not been renewed. Some 1.2million people live permanently on the Balearics, which consists of Menorca, Majorca, and party hotspot Ibiza. The figure of full-time residents however is outnumbered dramatically by the 18million who visited in 2023 - a record-high for the archipelago.",

        "description": "Even newbies are clambering aboard at record levels, with a surge in younger passengers deciding weeklong trips at sea aren’t “only for the elderly.”",
        "content": "Virgin Voyages' Scarlet Lady cruise near Weymouth, United Kingdom. Finnbarr Webster | Getty Images News | Getty Images Lots of people will be getting their sea legs this summer. Ports have been packed with cruise ships over the last few years, as vacationers flock to ever larger vessels and operators race to accommodate a surge in post-pandemic bookings — many of them from first-time passengers. The industry expects even more this year. Benjamin Xiang, a San Francisco-based flight attendant, went on his first cruise last August, setting aside his reservations about \"cruise people\" and a type of trip he'd imagined would be \"not my travel style.\" Taking advantage of a Virgin Voyages promotion that let him use credit card points to cover the $2,500 bill, Xiang booked a weeklong, all-inclusive, adults-only cruise from Barcelona, with stops at Mallorca, Ibiza and along the French Riviera. \"I invited my best friend, we prepaid a $600 bar tab, and we were like, 'We'll just hang by the pool, read a book or something,'\" said Xiang, 35. \"Turned out we partied every single night and had a blast.\" He's among the many cruise newbies who've helped power the industry's recent growth. Some 27% of cruise passengers over the past two years have been first-timers, up 12% from the prior two-year period, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), a trade group. \"Will I go back? I think yes,\" Xiang said. \"Will I pay this time? Yes.\" That's exactly what cruise operators are hoping for, and so far they're getting it: 82% of all cruisers say they'll book again, CLIA's latest report found. After welcoming 31.7 million passengers last year, 7% more than in 2019, the industry expects volumes to swell to 34.7 million by the end of 2024. Experts say a combination of newcomers, repeat bookers and younger travelers are powering the uptick. Like Xiang, many first-time cruisers are groups of friends traveling together, said Jennifer Klaussen, who owns Sundari Travel in Malibu, California. \"Once they get on a cruise and realize it's not what they thought it would be, they're usually interested in future cruises and diverse destinations,\" she said, adding that newer operators have managed to \"reduce the stigma associated with cruising — that it's only for the elderly.\" Onlookers gather at South Pointe Park to watch Royal Caribbean's \"Icon of the Seas\", the world's largest cruise ship, as it sails from Port Miami on its maiden cruise, in Miami Beach, Florida on January 27, 2024.

Tesla shareholders get to vote America's child care shortage is pushing military families to a breaking point Passengers under age 40, including kids, made up around 42% of cruisegoers last year, up from 35% in 2019, according to CLIA. While the average age of a cruise customer is 46 industrywide, millennials now make up nearly the same share — 22% — as baby boomers and Gen Xers, who each comprise 24%. \"The cruise industry has been hard at work to launch new ships and experiences that are attractive to a younger, newer demographic,\" said Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic, \"whether that's a big, new ship with eye-catching attractions for families, or more bucket-list-worthy experiences like sailings in the Galapagos or Antarctica.\" Amenities don't hurt either, said Nathan Rosenberg, chief brand officer at Virgin Voyages, which began sailing only in 2021, as the cruise industry rebounded from the pandemic. \"Millennials and Gen Z love the fact that everything is included. Think meals foodies would love, tips covered, Wi-Fi to stay connected and a ton of fitness classes,\" he said. Vessels are getting bigger to handle the growing demand. In January, Royal Caribbean Group launched Icon of the Seas — currently the world's largest cruise ship, with 20 decks, 40 restaurants and room for more than 7,000 passengers and 3,000 crew members. The company, meanwhile, reported a 16% increase in new cruisegoers between this year and last across its various cruise lines. Nearly half of all Royal Caribbean guests are millennials or younger, CEO Jason Liberty said on the company's first-quarter earnings call. Similarly, Norwegian Cruise Lines CEO Harry Sommer told CNBC earlier this month, \"We appeal obviously to older customers, but millennial and Gen Z is the fastest-growing segment of our cruising right now.\" Cruises generally aren't cheap, though, and Sommer noted that the company's target customer is middle- or upper-income. As consumer spending cools down across much of the economy, Americans are adjusting their summer vacation plans to fit their budgets. The share of travelers put off by steep prices hit 32% in Deloitte's annual summer travel survey , up sharply from 24% last year. But more affluent vacationers still seem eager to shell out on everything from first-class airfare to luxury train trips , as the industry continues to push premium offerings . \"More higher-income travelers are headed to cruises,\" whereas \"lower-income travelers are going camping,\" the Deloitte report, released Tuesday, said. (\"RV trips are up across the board,\" it added.) That doesn't mean cruise passengers aren't paying attention to price.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jaclyn Groh will be going on her first cruise in March 2025, sailing around the Caribbean. The 34-year-old therapist and social work professor at Ohio State University in Columbus typically takes her family on boat trips on a lake, beach visits, \"and of course the occasional Disney adventure for the kiddos,\" said Groh. While some of her friends have done family cruises, she's never been interested in the largest cruise ships because they seem \"overwhelming.\" But in shopping around for a vacation next year for just her and her husband, Groh said her travel agent's description of the packages available won her over. The smaller Explora II vessel she opted for has a \"boutique feel that we love,\" she said. And it's priced about the same as the resort in Curaçao where the couple will be celebrating their 10th anniversary this fall. That week on land will run about $6,500, while the cruise comes to about $6,700. \"The price seems very reasonable for all of the inclusions, and yet with the cruise we will get to experience so many new locations and excursions,\" said Groh, who's looking forward to \"a perfect combination of resting in luxury and adventuring.\"",

        "content": "Three of the six outgoing Cyprus MEPs seem to be set for re-election and a far-right party could win its first European seat on June 9, when voters will also have to choose new mayors, municipal and village councillors, a recent opinion poll found. Incumbents Loucas Fourlas from the Democratic Rally (DISY-EPP), Giorgos Georgiou of the left-wing AKEL (GUE-NGL) and Costas Mavrides of the centre-right Democratic Party (DIKO-S&D) could hold on to their seats in the European Parliament, with DISY and AKEL expected to secure two seats each and DIKO one, according to the Kathimerini Cyprus survey. The poll, conducted by Symmetron Market Research among 800 respondents, found that DISY would garner 22.8% of the votes and retain two seats, AKEL would get 21.6% and also secure two seats, while far-right ELAM could win third place with 10.7% of the votes, ahead of DIKO’s 9.1%. With Fourlas expected to get 62% of the DISY preference votes, it will be a close race for the second seat between former Cabinet members Michalis Hadjipantelas (ex-Minister of Health) and Constantintinos Petrides (ex-Finance), who would get 33% and 31%, respectively, according to the Kathimerini survey. From the party of The Left, Giorgos Georgiou is expected an easy win with 49% of the preference votes, followed by newcomer economist Anna Theologou at 28%, marginally ahead of University of Cyprus professor Niyazi Kizilyurek, the only Turkish Cypriot MEP since Cyprus joined the EU in 2004. The surprise of this election race could be ELAM winning its first seat in the European Parliament, with the far-right nationalist party represented by its party spokesman, Geadis Geadi, who is expected to get 46% of the preferences, outbidding former government spokesman Marios Pelekanos who switched camps from DISY, after the EPP-aligned party overlooked him for the EP ticket. The sixth Cyprus seat will probably go to incumbent Costas Mavrides, by far the most popular within DIKO, who would get 62% of the preference votes, ahead of local MP Chrysis Pantelides (26%) and former MEP Dr Eleni Theocharous (24%). The sixth seat was held by Demetris Papadakis, formerly of socialist EDEK (S&D) who broke away from the party, before being sacked, over a conflict with the leadership. Only one woman? This would mean that once again Cyprus could have just one woman MEP in Brussels and Strasbourg, with the traditional parties making a poor showing when it comes to female candidates. The Democratic Front (DIPA), an offshoot from DIKO, would be far below the threshold with 3.8% and would not elect an MEP, nor would EDEK (3.3%), Volt (2.6%) or the Greens (2.3%). The Kathimerini poll also found that the Cypriot public had a positive opinion (60%) about the European Union and 52% had a favourable view about the European Parliament, with 61% saying they would show up to vote on June 9, while 25% said they would not. The economy and rising costs are the determining factor for voters, followed by the Cyprus problem, and migrants. The pollsters Symmetron also asked about the three leading political personalities on the island, with public opinion being generally negative about President Nikos Christodoulides (57%, 31% positive, 12% “don’t know”). Opposition AKEL’s General Secretary Stephanos Stephanou also had a negative view among those polled (46%, 34% positive and 20% “don’t know”) House Speaker and DISY leader Annita Demetrious had a better view among those questioned, with 49% in her favour, 39% negative and 12% “don’t know”. Deputy government spokesman Yiannis Antoniou sufficed to say that these are not presidential elections. “We are watching with respect, avoiding comments,” he said, adding that, “any messages arising from the elections will be reviewed in due course.”",

        "content": "Alexander Zverev scripted history at the Philippe-Chatrier Court after beating Spanish ace Rafael Nadal at the French Open . The German star claimed a 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 victory in the first round to knock out Nadal. Notably, Zverev has become only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros. The latter, who owns 14 Roland Garros titles, returned to Paris after batting successive injuries. Here are the match stats Zverev won a total of 112 points and 44 winners throughout the match. He served eight aces compared to Zverev's two. The German had a win percentage of 58 and 48 in the first and second serves, respectively. Nadal won 19 of his 21 net points. Both Nadal and Zverev recorded 30 unforced errors. They registered three double-faults each. Third man to beat Nadal at French Open Before this match, Nadal had only lost to Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic at the French Open. Soderling defeated him in the fourth round in 2009, while Djokovic remains the only player to defeat Nadal twice in the tournament (quarter-finals, 2015 and semi-finals, 2021). Between 2015 and 2021, Nadal was unbeaten in as many as 35 matches at the French Open. Fourth Roland Garros defeat for Nadal Nadal now has a win-loss record of 112-4 at Roland Garros. He has been knocked out for the first time before the fourth round. Notably, the Spaniard also holds the record for winning 39 consecutive French Open matches. It is worth noting that Nadal won four French Open titles without losing a set (2008, 2010, 2017, and 2020), the most for a player. 14-time French Open winner Nearly two decades after winning his maiden Grand Slam title, Nadal owns a total of 14 French Open honors (2005-2008, 2010-2014, 2017-2020, and 2022). The Spaniard has won eight more Roland Garros titles than Bjorn Borg , who owns six titles (second-most). Nadal also holds the record for winning most titles at a Grand Slam and on a single surface (clay). Unwanted numbers for Nadal As per Opta , this was only the second instance of Nadal trailing by two sets to 0 at the French Open, after the quarter-finals in 2015, whre he lost to Novak Djokovic. Notably, Nadal won nine of his previous 11 matches at the French Open after having lost the first set. Zverev coming off title in Rome As mentioned, Zverev became the third player to claim a French Open win over Nadal, who has faced 74 different opponents at this event. Notably, the German is coming off a title-winning run at Rome Masters. Earlier this year, he lost the Australian Open semi-final to Daniil Medvedev . Zverev is now 29-9 on the ATP Tour in 2024.",

        "content": "This news has been read 98 times! KUWAIT CITY, May 27: Salmiya Club has renewed the contract of Libyan professional Senussi Al-Hadi for two seasons, following his standout performance since joining the team during the winter transfer period last January. Al-Hadi, who has earned the trust of Salmiya’s technical staff led by Croatian coach Ante Misha, played a pivotal role in the team’s success. Coach Misha, who originally brought Al-Hadi to the club, personally requested the renewal of the Libyan professional’s contract. Additionally, Brazilian player Alex Lima’s contract has been extended for another season, as per Misha’s request. Coach Misha himself has a contract with Salmiya until the end of the next season. Meanwhile, decisions are pending regarding the future of three other foreign players: Brazilian Sebastião Junior “Seba”, Ghanaian Issaka Abudu, and Gambian Sang Pierre. While Seba seems likely to continue for another season, Abudu and Sang Pierre’s futures remain uncertain. In addition to securing their foreign players, Salmiya Club has also announced contract renewals with several local players. Badr Jamal and Muhammad Al-Huwaidi have both signed on for two more seasons, while Moaz Al-Asmaa’s contract has been extended for three seasons. Team captain Fahd Al-Mujamd and players Abdul Mohsen Al-Turkmani and Yousef Al-Onaizan have all renewed for one season each. Further decisions regarding the remaining local players are pending, with the club management awaiting a comprehensive report from Coach Misha, which is expected by the end of the week. Looking ahead to next season, Salmiya Club aims to bolster its roster with skilled local and foreign players, to compete for local championships. Despite recent setbacks, including a loss in the Amir Cup final, the club remains determined to return to championship form. Their last major title was the Crown Prince Championship in the 2014-2015 season. Hassan Musa Al-Seyassah/Arab Times Staff This news has been read 98 times!",

        "description": "Ottawa flaunts a variety of cool cultural attractions and outdoor adventure experiences, plus a surprisingly good food scene and great drinking establishments.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Whitewater kayaking or rafting on the Ottawa River is a totally unique way to discover Canada's ... [+] national capital. (Photo by David E. Klutho) Between Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Quebec City, Canada boasts four amazing urban areas that should be on everyone’s travel bucket list. Now it’s time to add a fifth — Ottawa . That may seem like an odd choice. Without doubt, it’s a bastion of bureaucrats, politicians and government agencies. Normally the recipe for a bland or boring visitor experience. Yet Ottawa bucks the trend with a variety of cultural attractions and outdoor adventure experiences, plus a surprisingly good culinary scene — and maybe you can blame the politicians for this last one — great drinking establishments. Located around halfway between Toronto and Montreal, Canada’s national capital sprawls along the south side of the Ottawa River in eastern Ontario , and as such lies on the cusp of both English and French speaking Canada. Yet Ottawa never would have made the leap from backwoods outpost to big city if it wasn’t for widespread paranoia that the Americans wanted to make British Canada part of their new United States. Fearing a Yankee invasion of the St. Lawrence River valley, the Canadians created the Rideau Canal as a watery bypass in case of war. Located at the confluence of the canal and the Ottawa River, it wasn’t long before Bytown (as it was called then) began to boom.

Yet it’s only recently — thanks to a bevy of new experiences and attractions — that Ottawa has burst onto the global tourism scene. Navigating the Rideau Canal between Parliament Hill and the Fairmont Chateau Laurier. Outdoor Adventure in an Urban Setting Ottawa makes great use of its riverside location with a range of ways to work up a sweat. One of the most thrilling is Interzip , a 1,200-foot-long double zipline that whisks riders 120 feet above the Ottawa River at a speed of around 25 miles per hour. Farther upstream, Wilderness Tours offers guided whitewater trips in rafts, kayaks and sportyak flexible one-person dinghies on the Ottawa River. The aquatic adventures range from low to extreme intensity, and there’s also flatwater tubing for those who prefer it slow and easy. One of the coolest ways to explore Ottawa is scooting around town on a muscle-powered or electric bike. Escape Bicycle Tours on the Sparks Street pedestrian mall rents various types of bikes and scooters, and offers guided cycling tours that include Parliament Hill, Rideau Hall park, and two bridge crossings over the Ottawa River. Running right through the middle of the city, the historic Rideau Canal provides plenty of scope for outdoor fun. The Rideau Canal Eastern Pathway , a leafy hiking and biking trail, stretches five miles between the Senate Building and Prince of Wales Falls. Or hire a cabin cruiser at Le Boat on Dow’s Lake for overnight voyages down the Rideau Canal from Ottawa into the Ontario wilderness. T-Rex ambush in the dinosaur gallery at the Canadian Museum of Nature. Indoor Art and Adventures Located in the castle-like Victoria Memorial Building, the Canadian Museum of Nature offers a cutting-edge glimpse of the nation’s incredibly diverse flora, fauna and geology. With many hands-on exhibits and a dinosaur gallery with more than 200 specimens, the museum is ideal for families with children. Over on the art side, the National Gallery of Canada runs all the way from the Renaissance and Baroque through Impressionism 20 th -century Canadian and American painters and sculptors. Designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie, the gallery is an artwork all on its own. And don’t forget to snap a selfie with Maman , the giant metal and marble spider by artist Louise Bourgeois out front. Duck into the Canadian Senate and House of Commons on Parliament Hill on short, guided tours, or a self-guided (free) immersive experience that includes a 360° multimedia show. Even if you don’t go inside, scan the lofty Peace Tower for stone gargoyles and grotesque human figures. Ottawa’s most unusual indoor attraction is on the outskirts of the city and underground — Diefenbunker: Canada's Cold War Museum . Between 1961 when it was completed and 1994 when it was decommissioned, the massive, four-story concrete bunker was a fallout shelter where the Canadian government would take refuge in case of a nuclear attack. One-hour guided tours cover the bunker’s history and highlights. Colorful cocktails at Stolen Goods. Ottawa Eats and Sleeps Sure you can get poutine, butter tarts and salmon steak. But the city’s culinary scene has grown increasingly diverse, restaurants that focus on various global cuisines or modern Canadian cooking. One of the hottest tables in town is Riviera on Sparks Street. The menu offers modern takes on Canadian favorites like smoked duck breast, Alberta sirloin steak, steelhead trout and Newfoundland codfish and mussels in a revitalized Art Deco interior that was once a bank. Slated to open later this year, Antheia restaurant is the latest creation from chef and owner Briana Kim, who won top prize at the 2023 Canadian Culinary Championship with her innovative takes on vegetarian and vegan foods. Ethnic eats step into the limelight in the Byward Market neighborhood, which includes the historic redbrick market pavilion (built in the 1920s) and surrounding streets. The selection ranges from dim sum and Southeast Asian street food at Sidedoor and classic Canadian-style shawarma at Three Brothers to Indian cuisine at Shafali Bazaar and tasty leaves from around the planet at Teastore . Ottawa’s best new bar is Stolen Goods , a tiny cocktail lounge on Sparks Street with a racoon mascot, delicious seafood snacks and offbeat drinks like the Three Brothers vegan gimlet and the Jungle Adventures tropical cocktail with Fruit Loops foam. Unveiled in 1912 as one of Canada’s elegant railway hotels, the Fairmont Château Laurier remains the iconic place to overnight in Ottawa. Located beside Parliament Hill and the Rideau Canal, it affords an ideal base to explore the city by foot or bike. If modern designer-savvy is more your style, book a room with a view at the high-rise Le Germain Hotel , which is right beside the Ottawa Art Gallery and walking distance to Byward Market. Or go totally homey at the Auberge King Edward Bed & Breakfast , in a 1902 Victorian manse between Ottawa University and Byward Market. Halibut with clams and fava beans at Riviera restaurant.

        "description": "Former chief executive Paula Vennells was booed by wrongly convicted subpostmasters last week",
        "content": "News | UK Scotland Yard has recruited around 80 detectives for its criminal investigation into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal, it emerged on Monday. The Metropolitan Police announced a nationwide probe will examine potential offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice by senior executives and tech giant Fujitsu. Since January 2020, a core team of officers and staff has been looking at wide-ranging allegations following a referral from the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Guardian reported Yard chiefs asked the government for a special grant of at least £6.75 million to fund the operation. Resources will be similar to UK-wide counter-terrorism investigation. Last week former Post Office boss Paula Vennells was booed by wrongly convicted subpostmasters at the ongoing public inquiry in central London . More than 700 were prosecuted by her investigators and handed criminal convictions between 1999 and 2015. Fujitsu’s faulty Horizon IT system made it appear as though money was missing at their branches. Hundreds are still awaiting compensation despite the Government announcing that those who have had convictions quashed are eligible for £600,000 payouts. Commander Stephen Clayman, overseeing the probe, said on Monday: “We understand the widespread and devastating impact the Post Office IT Horizon scandal has had on hundreds of sub-postmasters across the country. “The Met began a criminal investigation in January 2020 focused on offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice. “A team of detectives has been painstakingly working through millions of documents manually and with the help of specialist software, in parallel with the Public Inquiry. “This is very time consuming and we cannot cut corners and risk missing evidence.

        "content": "The Texas A&M baseball team’s path to Omaha will run through College Station. The Aggies were selected as the No. 3 overall seed in the NCAA tournament Monday, and will have the opportunity to play on their home field the first two weekends of the postseason. A&M (44-13) will face fourth-seeded Grambling (26-26) on Friday at noon on ESPN+. Texas is the No. 3 seed in the Bryan-College Station Regional and will face second-seeded Louisiana on Friday at 5 p.m. on ESPNU. The regional round is a four-team, double-elimination format. The winner of the regional advances to the super regional round where the winner of the best-of-3 series moves onto the eight-team College World Series. A&M's regional is paired with No. 14 overall seed UC-Santa Barbara, which is hosting Oregon, San Diego and Fresno State. This will be the third time A&M has been paired with rival Texas in a regional during the schools' 13-year hiatus as conference foes. The Aggies were eliminated by the Longhorns in the 2014 Houston Regional final and lost to the Longhorns in a winner's bracket game in the 2018 Austin Regional. A&M beat Texas 9-2 this season on March 5 in a midweek game played in Austin. The Longhorns are 35-22 overall this season and were 20-10 in Big 12 Conference play. A&M is 2-0 all-time vs. Grambling. The schools last met in 2013. The Aggies are 14-9 all-time vs. Louisiana. The Cajuns were in the College Station Regional in 2022. The Aggies beat the Cajuns in a winner's bracket game. In 2007, A&M came through the loser's bracket and beat Louisiana twice in one day to advance to the super regionals. The Aggies learned Sunday night they would host a regional for the 13th time in school history. This marks the highest seed in program history as the Aggies earned a national seed for the fourth time. The NCAA announced the Aggies would be a top-four seed on Monday morning. Tennessee, which won the Southeastern Conference regular and tournament titles, is the No. 1 seed. Kentucky is the No. 2 overall seed. Success in conference play and an undefeated nonconference record helped the Aggies secure a high seed despite losing two of their last three conference series and going 0-2 in the SEC tournament. The Aggies get to return home, though, where they are 32-3 this season. Should A&M advance, it would get to play on its home field in the super regional round as it pursues an eighth appearance in the College World Series. The last time A&M was an NCAA tournament host was 2022 when the Aggies earned the No. 5 seed and went unbeaten in the regional and super regional rounds en route to the College World Series.

        "content": "Decision soon on Enzo Maresca to Chelsea plus update on other candidates We keep hearing so many stories about the Chelsea manager situation, which is normal of course after the departure of Mauricio Pochettino, and with so many other clubs also changing managers this summer, but I wanted to clarify some things here. As things stand, Ruben Amorim is not in talks with Chelsea – my understanding is that he is not a candidate as Chelsea would prefer someone with experience of working in English football. So, despite rumours, Amorim is not holding talks over the Chelsea job. Kieran McKenna also looks to be out of the running now, though he’s also wanted by Brighton and they’re waiting for his decision. They want an answer from him soon as they search for a replacement for Roberto de Zerbi. Finally, Xavi has also been linked with the Chelsea job but again I’m not hearing anything concrete on that one. Xavi is open to opportunities after leaving Barcelona, but at the moment it’s all quiet there and I have no news on any talks taking place or being planned with Chelsea. So, the situation is that Chelsea are interested in Enzo Maresca and he’s also interested in the Chelsea job after positive contacts took place over the weekend. It’s now up to Chelsea – decision time is coming soon, and Leicester are waiting to see what happens there before they then decide on who to hire as a replacement. Sofyan Amrabat drops hint over future but it could depend on the manager situation While there has understandably been a lot of talk about the Manchester United manager situation, with Erik ten Hag’s future recently looking about 50-50 for him to stay or leave Old Trafford, there was also another interesting story to follow after the Red Devils’ FA Cup final win over Manchester City. Sofyan Amrabat had a good game for United and spoke afterwards to hint that he could still end up staying at the club. However, my understanding is that nothing has been communicated to Fiorentina or the player side yet. It will depend also on the manager situation, so it will be part of the review that Man United will do this week. In January, Juventus and Barcelona were interested but Man United never opened doors for Amrabat to leave. Liverpool have scouted Leny Yoro but Lille’s asking price will be important One of the top young centre-backs in Europe right now and one to watch on the market is Leny Yoro of Lille. I’ve reported on his future before, with a lot of interest, a lot of clubs scouting him, and now we’re seeing more reports and links about strong interest from Liverpool. As I’ve mentioned previously, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are absolutely in the race for Yoro. It’s also the case that Liverpool have been scouting him, but at the moment the situation is really based on what kind of price Lille will ask for – all clubs are basically waiting for that. Liverpool could strengthen at centre-back this summer, as I’ve reported before, but let’s see if this scouting and monitoring of Yoro turns into anything more concrete. For now, it’s just normal scouting of a top talent, and my understanding is that PSG and Real Madrid are very much in the race for his signature. Arsenal linked with left-back, plus possible exit It could be an important summer for Arsenal, but at the moment some of the we’re seeing may be a little premature. I’m aware, for example, of a lot of stories coming out involving Fenerbahce left-back Ferdi Kadioglu, but I don’t have concrete updates on that for the moment. Kadioglu is always been linked with several clubs – there have been stories about Aston Villa as well as Arsenal – but there is no news yet. A move to the Premier League is concrete possibility, but for now we have to wait a bit longer and see which club will really go for it. It’s also been reported that Fabio Vieira could leave Arsenal after a lack of playing time. My understanding, however, is that it depends on proposals. So far it’s quiet but for players like Vieira (not all of them) there’s a chance to leave in case of a good proposal coming in. We just have to be patient on that one.",

        "content": "DEAR DEIDRE: When I said I didn’t want another baby until our relationship improves my partner went into a full-blown rage. He works away most of the time on the oil rigs. He is 38 and I’m 35. He’s a good dad when he’s here but most of the time, I feel like a single parent. I had postnatal depression after our little one was born and my partner only stayed a week at home. I was left to cope. He comes home and all he wants is sex. If I refuse him, I get the big sulk which can last days. He doesn’t trust me. If I arrange to go out while he’s away, he contacts my friends to check that I’m with them. He thinks I cheat on him but I don’t. It’s caused such arguments, so when he said he wanted a baby brother or sister for our toddler, I said no. Get in touch with the Dear Deidre team Every problem gets a personal reply from one of our trained counsellors. Fill out and submit our easy-to-use and confidential form and the Dear Deidre team will get back to you. You can also send a private message on the DearDeidreOfficial Facebook page or email us at: deardeidre@the-sun.co.uk I feel things between us are toxic right now. He loves our little boy but he doesn’t help me with DIY or general chores. I don’t think this is the right time to bring another baby into our family. MORE FROM DEAR DEIDRE DEIDRE'S STORIES Connor's controlling girlfriend finds out he's at the park SO HOSTILE I'm dating a girl my mum hates but don't know how to tell her DEIDRE SAYS: You’re right. A child deserves two loving parents, not two warring ones. People often think that a baby will paper over the cracks in a relationship but the stress caused with deprivation of sleep and a diminished bank balance can drive a wedge between the strongest of couples. Give a child the best start in life by making your relationship as good as it can be. Tell your partner that you need more emotional support and a better understanding about your sex life – when you say no, it doesn’t mean that you don’t love him. There’s no shame in asking for help so find couples counselling locally or contact the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (bacp.co.uk, 01455 883 300).

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email Maintaining seamless business connectivity is more crucial than ever in today’s digital age. Companies rely on robust IT networks to ensure they remain competitive, agile, and capable of meeting operational demands. Effective network support is the backbone of uninterrupted business processes, supporting everything from basic internet connectivity to complex data analysis tasks. The importance of network support At its core, network support ensures that a company’s network infrastructure functions optimally. This infrastructure includes various components such as servers, desktops, mobile devices, and connectivity hardware. IT network support encompasses monitoring, maintaining, and continuously improving these systems to prevent downtime and ensure efficient operations. Enhancing security with managed firewall services A managed firewall is a key aspect of network support that significantly enhances security. A managed firewall is a service that provides enhanced security measures to protect a company’s network from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and data breaches. By having a dedicated team managing the firewall, businesses can ensure that the firewall’s configurations are continually updated to defend against the latest threats. This proactive approach secures the IT environment and optimizes the network’s performance, ensuring that security measures do not impede business operations. The role of IT professional services To further strengthen network infrastructure, businesses often turn to IT professional services . These services provide expertise and technical skills that many businesses may not possess in-house. IT professional services can include everything from network design and configuration to troubleshooting and ongoing support. By leveraging these professional services, businesses can ensure their network is robust, secure, and aligned with their needs and growth objectives. Business benefits of robust IT network support Below are the key business benefits of maintaining a strong and responsive IT network, each contributing significantly to the operations’ overall success and scalability. Increased productivity A well-supported IT network directly contributes to higher productivity levels. Employees can perform their duties more efficiently with fewer interruptions due to technical issues. A strong network keeps business operations running smoothly, whether it’s faster internal communication, quicker access to cloud resources, or reliable remote access capabilities. Improved customer experience In the digital economy, customer expectations are continually rising . A reliable network ensures that customer-facing platforms are always operational, enhancing the customer experience. Online transactions, customer support interfaces, and digital product delivery systems depend heavily on uninterrupted network performance. Cost efficiency Investing in quality network support can reduce the overall IT costs for a business. Regular maintenance and timely upgrades prevent costly downtime and expensive emergency repairs. Moreover, with managed services, businesses can predict their monthly IT expenditures more accurately, which aids in better financial planning. Scalability As businesses grow, their network needs evolve. Quality IT network support includes scalability as a core feature. As your business expands, your network grows, seamlessly supporting more users, processing more data, and integrating new technologies without performance lapses. Final thoughts In today’s dynamic business environment, mastering IT network support is essential for organizations aiming for long-term success and resilience. By incorporating comprehensive IT professional services like network support and managed firewall capabilities, companies can enhance operational efficiency, fortify security measures, and ensure seamless communication across all channels. With a trusted IT management partner like Vital Integrators , your company can fully leverage the benefits of advanced technology to foster growth, innovation, and enhanced customer engagement. Keeping up with the latest trends and adopting best practices will ensure that your IT network support strategy is effective and flexible, ready to adapt to future challenges and opportunities in the ever-changing world of technology.

        "content": "Don't criticise Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer for asking Erik ten Hag proper questions. They rose above TV football's wasteland of vacuous chummery and prehistoric banter, writes OLIVER HOLT The BBC duo have been criticised for their post-FA Cup questions of Erik ten Hag But all criticism of their interview with the Man United boss should be laughed at Their second goal was one of the great FA Cup goals... Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Oliver Holt Published: 17:23, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:07, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Let me tell you what happened after the FA Cup Final finished and the BBC moved into the post-match phase of its coverage late on Saturday afternoon. It’s not complicated. Neither man fawned over Erik ten Hag after United’s shock victory over Manchester City . Neither man attempted to make him laugh with a lame joke because they were scared of angering him. Neither man ducked the responsibility of confronting the issue everyone was talking about. Neither of them took the easy way out of blaming ‘the media’ for the criticism that Ten Hag has received over recent months, a favourite of former athletes who have a habit of forgetting that they are now ‘the media’, too. Lineker and Shearer are superb broadcasters and both of them did their job as interviewers. They were respectful and polite towards Ten Hag but they are not wide-eyed kids talking to their heroes. Gary Lineker quizzed Erik ten Hag on his future in the immediate aftermath of Man United's FA Cup triumph Lineker and Shearer have defended themselves following criticism, insisting they did not overstep the mark The Dutchman's FA Cup victory means United have now won two trophies in two seasons under Ten Hag Podcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola? EPISODE 90: How Manchester United CAN win crunch FA Cup clash EPISODE 89: Why Manchester City aren't the reason the League is boring 'It hasn't worked!' Is VAR the problem or the solution? EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify So they asked the questions they needed to ask, about why United, who finished eighth in the Premier League, had not played like this before. And whether Ten Hag knew if he would still be at the club next season. They were entirely legitimate questions. They many not have been the questions Ten Hag wanted to answer but that is irrelevant. READ MORE The secrets behind the success of Chelsea's next manager: Enzo Maresca has Johan Cruyff quotes as his WhatsApp profile image and even wrote a THESIS on tactics... but 'Diet Pep' will have to reign in his erratic behaviour It’s the BBC. It’s not a fan-channel. It’s not MUTV. It’s not Pravda. It’s not Sky Sports, whose reporters in the north east, for example, boast about being fans first. Lineker and Shearer asked the questions we should expect to be asked by a competent broadcast network. And then, because television audiences in this country have been force-fed a diet of vacuous, flaccid, tame post-match interviews for too long, because they have grown used to that diet, Lineker and Shearer were roundly criticised for their conduct towards Ten Hag. They were accused of being disrespectful, aggressive, rude, of not letting Ten Hag enjoy his moment. All those accusations should be laughed out of town. For a start, if Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the United minority owner, had simply said Ten Hag’s job was safe and that he would be the manager next season, no one would have needed to ask Ten Hag the question. Ratcliffe has let him swing. And if Ten Hag is within his rights to be irritated by ongoing questions about his job prospects at Old Trafford, maybe he should direct his ire at the people who are, inadvertently perhaps, encouraging speculation through their silence. A previous regime at United sacked Louis van Gaal the day after he won the FA Cup for the club in 2016. It’s not much of a stretch to ask Ten Hag, who presided over a dismal league season, if he fears the same fate. Part-owners INEOS - headed by Sir Jim Ratcliffe (left) are expected to make a decision on Ten Hag's future this week Ten Hag's future is yet to be decided as United chiefs weigh up whether to terminate his contract early United's majority owner Avram Glazer (right) looked delighted as he shook hands with Ten Hag at Wembley So the criticism of Lineker and Shearer is pathetic. What is wrong with a robust question, anyway? Ten Hag’s a grown man in a high-profile job. If he can’t cope with a couple of gentle inquiries, he should be in another line of work. They were supposed to wait, apparently, and let Ten Hag enjoy his moment. Television doesn’t work like that. News doesn’t work like that. And football doesn’t work like that. The question has to be asked when the man is in front of you or it will not be asked at all. The absurd reaction to the interview hinted at a bigger picture: the arid landscape of the post-match, post-fight, post-race television interview has been allowed to become, over the past few years in this country, a wasteland of gurning ingratiation, vacuous chummery and self-congratulatory, prehistoric lad-banter. The BBC’s coverage of the Olympic Games often sets the gold standard in this hyperventilating medium where being friends with an athlete appears to be valued above all else, sycophancy is a pre-requisite and looking the other way when bad things happen – particularly if it happens to British competitors - is non-negotiable. United endured a miserable second season in the Premier League under Ten Hag as they finished eighth United's FA Cup victory - their 13th in the competition - might have given Ten Hag a lifeline Ten Hag’s a grown man in a high-profile job. If he can’t cope with a couple of gentle inquiries, he should be in another line of work Every viewer is different. We all value different qualities in our interviewers. For those of us who value insight over jocularity and prefer our analysts to analyse rather than throw themselves into the arms of a former teammate as they leave the pitch or the track, sober, serious, intelligent interviewers like Gabriel Clarke are increasingly hard to locate in the genre. READ MORE It would now seem MAD to sack Erik ten Hag: OLIVER HOLT explains why this FA Cup final is different to Louis van Gaal's Wembley last hurrah It is a failed state peopled increasingly by those so dazzled by the light of the game, which they recognise instinctively as the light that once shone from them, that they are incapable of any meaningful interaction with interviewees beyond the non-negotiable imperative of establishing that they, too, once were warriors. So, the exceptions to the rule, when they come, are even more welcome. There are many of these exceptions, by the way. Too many to mention here but it was a particular treat to listen to the radio show hosted by Jim White and Simon Jordan on TalkSport last week and hear their conversation with the boxing promoter, Frank Warren. If Ten Hag is within his rights to be irritated by ongoing questions, maybe he should direct his ire at the people who are, inadvertently perhaps, encouraging speculation through their silence For 20 minutes or so, they engaged in an argument about Tyson Fury, one of Warren’s fighters, who had lost an epic world heavyweight title battle with Oleksandr Usyk a few days earlier. Some might call it a row. Both sides stood their ground in an articulate, passionate exchange of views. It was utterly compelling. Nobody won or lost. Neither Warren, nor Jordan gave ground. Both stuck to their arguments and maintained their loyalties and their opinions. Again, it was the kind of conversation that happens far too rarely. Jack Stephens showed his true leadership values against Leeds I went to the Leeds United-Southampton Championship play-off final on Sunday. It was a brilliant atmosphere but it wasn’t the best game. Southampton deserved to win. They had one chance and they took it. But the thing that made the biggest impression on me all afternoon happened after the final whistle. As the Southampton players sprinted away towards their fans, I looked over at the other end of the stadium where the Leeds players had collapsed to the turf in despair. Saints captain Jack Stephens consoled Leeds players immediately after Southampton's victory in the Championship play-off final Stephens (left) showed his true leadership qualities as Southampton were promoted at Wembley Jack Stephens, the Southampton captain, had not run to celebrate with his club’s supporters and his teammates. Instead, he made his way from one Leeds player to another, consoling them, hugging them, lifting them from the floor. In the melee, Stephens’ leadership shone through. IShowSpeed is football's new publicity mogul I didn’t think anyone could make more publicity off the back of football than Salt Bae. IShowSpeed is proving me wrong. Chelsea's appalling track record Good luck to Enzo Maresca, or whoever it is who takes hold of the poisoned chalice that is the Chelsea job these days. Chelsea have moved a step closer to appointing Leicester's Enzo Maresca as their new boss Given that the manager at the club is now expected to be, in many ways, a subservient part of the hierarchy, it will be interesting to know if the first to pay the price for the next failure at Stamford Bridge will be the manager or the sporting directors, Paul Winstanley and Laurence Stewart, who seem to be higher up the food chain. Their record so far has been appalling but there is only so long, surely, that they will be able to wield power without taking responsibility.

        "content": "The 17 'red flag' colorectal cancer symptoms young people need to look out for, according to study of 25million patients READ MORE: You should get a colonoscopy if you have two common symptoms By Emily Joshu Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 15:51, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:51, 27 May 2024 e-mail 29 View comments A major study has revealed the 17 most common symptoms of the fastest growing cancer in young people. Colorectal cancer diagnoses in people under 50 were most often preceded by rectal bleeding, stomach pain, and changes in bowel movements. Unexpected weight loss , fatigue, changes to appetite and other digestive issues were among the most common symptoms associated with the disease. Researchers in six countries including the US made the finding after analyzing data from more than 80 studies, which included nearly 25million colorectal cancer patients under 50. Young patients are being urged to get checked if they suffer any of these symptoms because they are not routinely screened for the disease. The above table shows the most common signs of colorectal cancer in young people, according to a study in JAMA Network Open The above graph shows colon cancer cases among under 50s by year. There is a drop in 2020 because the Covid pandemic led to fewer people coming forward for screenings The finings come as colorectal cancer rates are expected to double from 2010 to the end of the decade . Doctors are still trying to work out what's behind the rapid rise. Processed foods, chemical contamination and the overuse of antibiotics have all been touted as possible factors. 'Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC), defined as a diagnosis at younger than age 50 years, is increasing, and so-called red flag signs and symptoms among these individuals are often missed, leading to diagnostic delays,' the researchers wrote. 'Improved recognition of presenting signs and symptoms associated with EOCRC could facilitate more timely diagnosis and impact clinical outcomes.' The research team used the data to determine which symptoms were most common, which signs put patients most at risk of colon cancer, and how long it took patients to get a colon cancer diagnosis. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: health@dailymail.com Advertisement They found that rectal bleeding was linked to a five-fold increase in early onset colon cancer risk, making it the largest risk factor. Additionally, one in 10 patients had their symptoms come on quickly and severely . The researchers initially combed through 12,859 research papers and narrowed down the list to 81 studies conducted between 2000 and 2023. They found that 45 percent of patients experienced rectal bleeding or blood in their stool, and 40 percent suffered abdominal pain. Additionally, 27 percent had changes in their bowel habits, which could include having more or fewer movements. Weight loss was seen in 17 percent of patients, while 15 percent had a loss of appetite. And while 12 percent had an acute presentation, meaning their symptoms came on quickly, it took an average of four to six months for them to get a diagnosis. 'Younger patients may experience ongoing signs and symptoms and delay seeking medical attention,' the researchers wrote. 'Potential reasons for these delays include a patient believing they are too young to worry about cancer or a lack of access to primary care of health insurance.' Rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel movements are the key signs of colorectal cancer in young people, according to a study in JAMA Network Open The researchers looked at 81 studies to determine the most common signs of colorectal cancer in young people. They found that rectal bleeding or blood in the stool was the most common sign Rates of GI cancers rose most sharply in the youngest age group, followed by the 20-29 year old cohort. There were also more cases of GI cancers among older people, though in that case it is still considered early-onset cancer And even if a patient does seek medical help, 'patients and clinicians alike may downplay symptom severity and fail to recognize key red flags and clinical cues that should trigger suspicion of colorectal cancer,' the team said. They noted that, too often, rectal bleeding, the most common sign, is attributed to harmless conditions like hemorrhoids. A 2020 survey from Colorectal Cancer Alliance , for example, found that 68 percent of patients experienced blood in their stool, and many of them were misdiagnosed or dismissed. Read More EXCLUSIVE 'If we can get colon cancer, anyone can': These three patients were 45 and in the 'best shape of their lives' when they were diagnosed with 'death sentence' disease - now they're issuing a plea to young people More than half of the participants said they were misdiagnosed with conditions such as hemorrhoids, IBS, anemia, and mental health issues. Patients ages 19 to 39 were the most likely to feel dismissed, the team found. Alarmingly, these are the age groups that colon cancer is rising the quickest in. Recent statistics suggest that colon cancers have grown by 500 percent in children ages 10 to 14 and 333 percent in teens ages 15 to 19. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 106,590 cases of colon cancer and 46,220 instances of rectal cancer this year, along with 53,010 deaths. It's currently the fourth most common cancer in the US behind lung, prostate, and breast cancers. And nearly one in four patients are diagnosed after the disease has already spread to other organs. Overall, 'delays in diagnostic workup after sign or symptom presentation are up to 40% longer compared with older individuals with colorectal cancer,' the researchers wrote. They advised doctors to work with patients to ensure they are diagnosed quickly. They also suggested patients should ask for a colonoscopy or stool test if they experience symptoms. The review was published last week in the journal JAMA Network Open .

        "content": "One of the most recognizable homes in movie history is officially on the market – and could be yours for just $5.25million. The house from Home Alone , the 1990 Christmas classic starring Macaulay Culkin, Catherine O’Hara, Joe Pesci and John Candy, has been listed for sale on Zillow. The five-bedroom, six-bathroom property, located in the Winnetka area of Chicago , Illinois, was actually used as the exterior for the film – and the 1992 sequel – but looks hugely different from when Kevin McCallister turned it into his own house of horrors to capture burglars Harry and Marv. Gone are any traces of his dastardly traps, the awkwardly-placed statue in the driveway, that creepy tarantula or that red and green wallpaper adorning all the walls. Instead, the previous owners renovated the entire place in 2018, with a tasteful monochrome color scheme throughout – Katie Moor of Coldwell Banker is currently listing the property. And what do you get for the whopping $5.25million price tag ? Well, quite a lot actually... As well as being able to own a piece of cinema gold dust , buyers can enjoy a ‘gracious foyer,’ with an ‘inviting’ back garden – housing a huge porch and a wood-burning fireplace overlooking the gigantic yard. They also get not one, but two living rooms, as well as two laundry rooms and a heated garage with space for three cars. The primary bedroom includes a fireplace, a walk-in closet and a dreamy ensuite, with a giant freestanding tub and separate sinks – meaning tenants can copy Kevin McCallister’s iconic shaving routine in peace. While the basement in the gym housed that creepy furnace in the movie, in real life it has been replaced by a gym, a movie theater, bathroom and indoor sports court. Basically, loads of hiding spaces if Harry and Marv ever pop by unannounced again. ‘A legendary holiday dream home, reimagined for modern-day luxury: The stately brick Georgian residence of Home Alone fame brings forward a rare opportunity to own one of the most iconic movie residences in American pop culture,’ the listing reads. ‘Nestled on a picturesque, tree-lined street in the heart of east Winnetka and elegantly poised behind a wrought-iron gate, the property epitomizes classic Chicago suburban architecture. ‘The residence itself is a masterpiece of traditional style with an effortlessly flowing floorplan brimming with warmth, character, and exquisitely crafted detail. ‘From the promise of movie nights and game days to holiday gatherings surrounded by loved ones, this magical family home truly transcends its architectural pedigree. ‘It’s a chance to own a piece of cinematic history and create lasting memories within its iconic walls.’ Although most of the interior scenes of Home Alone were filmed at a nearby school gym, the Winnetka property served as the exterior for the shoot, and was actually home to a family. Lauren Abendshien lived there at the time, and lifted the lid on what it was like to open her doors up to the biggest Christmas film ever made. Appearing on This Morning in 2020, Lauren – who was six years old when production came knocking – explained the wild measures they had to take in their own home to avoid interrupting the action. ‘We stayed in the house pretty much the entire period they were filming, between four and five months they were there,’ she said. What I Own: My partner and I bought our own home before we were 30 — through a loophole I pay £395 a month to live in an underground doomsday bunker 'Magical' town with two castles named best place to live in the South West What I Rent: 'I pay £1,925 for a one bed flat but it revived my social life after divorce' ‘In order to avoid appearing on screen, we would have to crawl around under the window line from room to room. ‘Especially in the evening when it would be much easier for that to show up on camera, You had to do an army crawl from spot to spot in the house.’ ‘They would spend time in the house when they weren’t actively filming their scenes,’ she continued. ‘Macaulay Culkin actually used my room as the place he would go to study with his tutor. His brother, who played his cousin Fuller in the film, Kieran [Culkin], he wasn’t filming as much so he would just hang out in my room.’ Got a story?

        "content": "Less than a week after rolling out of its two-year early access period into full release, Songs of Conquest has now surpassed 500,000 copies sold—and more importantly, developer Lavapotion has unveiled big plans for the future, including four DLC releases and a \"major expansion\" planned for summer 2025. The expansion, called Bleak East, will add two new factions to Songs of Conquest—the Vanir and the Roots—and \"a large singleplayer campaign that will tell the story of how they came to be and how they will affect the larger world of Aerbor.\" \"The Bleak East lies to the North-East of Patrium, and is the home of descendants from both Arleon and Barya,\" lead game designer Carl Toftfelt wrote on Steam . \"Hardy settlers who now live their lives free of their former masters on the coast of the Bleak East. But they are not alone, and we can barely wait to share their Song with you.\" Unfortunately, they—and you—will have to wait a full year for Bleak East to arrive, and that's where the four DLC releases come into play. \"We want to keep telling the story of Songs of Conquest at a higher pace than only faction expansions would allow,\" Toftfelt explained. \"So we’re introducing something we call Tales of Conquest in the form of DLC, releasing roughly every quarter. These Tales will move the story of Songs of Conquest forward, as well as expand our gameplay, through story missions following each one of the existing factions.\" The first Tales of Conquest DLC, called Rise Eternal , will focus on the Barony of Loth undead faction: An undead scholar named Kastus Maal will seek vengeance against Arleon baroness who killed him at the Battle of Grey Tor, \"and with his guidance the Risen will be more powerful than ever before.\" Rise Eternal is planned for release this fall, and will also include new artifacts, set bonuses, and \"general improvements to the Risen of Loth\" faction, most of which will be added to the base game for free, making them available to all players, even if they don't purchase the DLC. After that will come Essence Awakened, focusing on the Arleon, which is expected to be out \"around December,\" and then two more, based on the Barya and Rana factions, which are slated for sometime in the second half of 2025. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. That schedule is vague, and even as far as it goes nothing is carved in stone—Toftfelt warned that \"things will always change, and timelines can shift forward and back\"—but Lavapotion clearly has big plans for the future: \"We just wanted to let you know right away that we plan to support Songs of Conquest for years to come.\"",

According to Pandey, such shops were why dogs became \"aggressive\".

The incident occurred when the siblings played outside their house on Sunday night and were attacked by stray dogs.

        "content": "Kolkata Knight Riders dismantled the batting powerhouse of Sunrisers Hyderabad for only 113 runs to set up an eight-wicket victory Sunday and a third Indian Premier League title. The $2.9 million signing Mitchell Starc rattled Hyderabad's top-order with 2-14, and all six Kolkata bowlers took wickets before the most aggressive batting team this season was bowled out for the lowest ever total in the history of IPL finals. Venkatesh Iyer then led Kolkata to 114-2 in 10.3 overs with a blazing 26-ball unbeaten 52. Rahmanullah Gurbaz scoring 39 in 32. \"It was comprehensive,\" said Kolkata captain Shreyas Iyer, who also played in an IPL final for Delhi Capitals in 2020 when his team lost to Mumbai Indians. \"This is what we demanded from the players and they stood up. It's difficult to express the feelings, so much to cherish right now. There was no one individual who took us here, it was a cumulative effort, it was a flawless season for us.\" Kolkata previously won the IPL titles in 2012 and '14 and had dominated this season by finishing on top at the end of league stage with nine wins from 14 games. It even dominated the most aggressive Hyderabad batting lineup by winning both in the league stage and also in the qualifier, where Australian paceman Starc stood out before routing Pat Cummins' team in a one-sided final. Starc and Cummins will combine in Australia's squad at the Twenty20 World Cup, which starts Saturday with the United States taking on Canada in Dallas. The IPL gave some of the world's leading players time to prepare for the World Cup in the U.S. and Caribbean. The six-week tournament culminated with the final, and Cummins had first choice had winning the toss and deciding to bat. But the Sunrisers were deflated inside the first seven overs as they limped to 47-4 against an impeccable attack of Starc, Harshit Rana (2-24) and Vaibhav Arora (1-24). Starc started the rout when he clean bowled Abhishek Sharma with a ball that swung away from the left-hander and knocked back the off stump. Travis Head, who regularly scored quick runs for Hyderabad this season, edged Arora's first ball and went for a golden duck. At 6-2 in two overs, Hyderabad struggled to recover from that double loss. Starc's three-over spell in the power play gave Kolkata another wicket when Rahul Tripathi top-edged the left-arm quick. There was no power-hitting from the South African pair of Aiden Markram, who made a struggling 20 off 23 balls, and Heinrich Klaasen (16 in 17) as Kolkata kept picking up wickets at regular intervals. Markram's weak pull shot against Andre Russell landed in the lap of Starc at long-on and Klaasen departed in the 15th over when he dragged Rana's off-cutter back onto his stumps. Russell mopped up the lower order with 3-19 and Hyderabad was in danger of not reaching 100 before Cummins hit 24 off 19 balls and was the last man dismissed in the penultimate over. \"Russell has got a magic wand and he is looking towards me to bowl,\" Shreyas Iyer said. \"In the majority of the games he gave us breakthroughs.\" Kolkata lost Sunil Narine before Venkatesh Iyer, who smashed three sixes and four boundaries, and Rahmanullah Gurbaz effectively sealed the game with some aggressive hitting in a 91-run stand. It was heartbreak for Hyderabad, which had toppled IPL batting records throughout the season and three times posted totals exceeding 265. However, it got bowled out for its lowest total of the season at a venue where Kolkata, owned by Bollywood celebrity Shah Rukh Khan, had happy memories of winning its first IPL title in 2012. \"We were outplayed,\" Cummins said. \"They didn't give us anything ... they bowled fantastically.\"",

        "content": "The weakening tropical storm Remal flooded dozens of coastal villages and left nearly 30 million people without power Monday in southern Bangladesh and eastern India. At least 10 people died in Bangladesh. About 3.7 million people along the coast were affected, said Bangladesh's junior minister for disaster management and relief, Mohibbur Rahman. More than 35,000 homes were destroyed and nearly 115,000 were damaged. Nearly 800,000 people were evacuated from vulnerable areas on Sunday. Bangladesh, a delta nation of nearly 170 million people, has a history of violent storms. Disaster preparedness programs have upgraded the capacity to tackle natural disasters, resulting in fewer casualties. Changing climate patterns have increased storms' intensity, making preparations more urgent. Remal weakened after making landfall in Bangladesh's Patuakhali district early Monday, with sustained winds of 111 kilometers (69 miles) per hour. India's Meteorological Department said it was likely to weaken throughout the day, but warned of heavy showers over Assam and other northeastern states for the next two days. India's Kolkata airport reopened after being shut Sunday. Bangladesh shut the airport in the country's second largest city, Chattogram, and canceled all domestic flights to and from the coastal district of Cox's Bazar. Loading and unloading at Chittagong seaport was halted. Strong rain and winds battered the Bangladesh capital, Dhaka. Many roads were submerged. Authorities ordered all government officials to stay at their stations until the situation improved. Aid agencies said they deployed thousands of volunteers in Rohingya refugee camps and other affected areas to provide emergency support. Bangladesh has sprawling camps housing more than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar in Cox's Bazar. In India's West Bengal state, thatched roofs on houses were blown away and electric poles and trees were uprooted in some coastal districts. Heavy downpours inundated streets and homes in low-lying areas of Kolkata. All schools in the region were closed until further notice.",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden marked Memorial Day with a pledge that the country would continue the work of the nation’s fallen toward creating a more perfect union, “for which they lived, and for which they died for.” Delivering remarks at a solemn remembrance ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Biden said each generation must ensure the sacrifice of the country’s service members is not in vain. “Freedom has never been guaranteed,” Biden said under gray skies in the memorial amphitheater. “Every generation has to earn it, fight for it, defend it in the battle between autocracy and democracy, between the greed of a few, and the rights of many.” He added: “On this day, we came together again to reflect, to remember, and above all, to recommit to the future they fought for, a future grounded in freedom, democracy, opportunity and equality. Not just for some, but for all.” Before the ceremony began, Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. In his remarks, Biden invoked the anniversary this week of the death of his son Beau, who served in Iraq and later died from brain cancer that the president attributes to his time stationed near toxic burn pits, to highlight the importance of honoring the service of those who came home with injuries, in addition to the dead. “Last year, the VA delivered more benefits and processed more claims than ever in our history,” Biden said, crediting the PACT Act which grants automatic coverage for certain health conditions suffered by veterans by presuming they result from their military service. “For too long after fighting for our nation, these veterans had to fight to get the right health care, to get the benefits they had earned, not anymore.” Biden began the day hosting a breakfast at the White House for administration officials, military leaders, veterans, and Gold Star family members.

        "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to actively monitor the ongoing outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza, also known as bird flu, and says that the public health risk remains low. Dr. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, says scientists and public health officials have known about avian influenza for decades. \"What's different today is that since 2020, we're seeing the largest outbreak of avian influenza among wild birds , poultry and backyard bird flocks,\" he says. \"The virus has also been found in certain mammalian species , most recently in dairy cattle, which is a little bit unprecedented and unique. And every time we see the virus go from birds into mammals, we worry about the virus adapting closer and closer to being able to infect and be transmitted efficiently between humans,\" Dr. Binnicker says. Bird flu has been detected in the milk of dairy cattle , raising concerns for potential transmission to humans. The Food and Drug Administration found no traces of live virus in dairy products available to the public. \"The good news is that the pasteurization process used in the United States and many countries inactivates avian influenza. The milk that we drink, if it's been pasteurized, is safe. Any animal products, such as eggs, beef or chicken, that you would cook to the recommended internal temperature renders that product safe to eat,\" says Dr. Binnicker. There are steps people can take to ensure their food remains safe from any viral or bacterial pathogen. \"As with any potential infectious disease associated with food, cooking to the recommended internal temperature that the CDC lists on their website is really important. And if you do that, you inactivate viruses like influenza, you inactivate bacteria and parasites that could cause a human infection,\" says Dr. Binnicker. The CDC recommends using a food thermometer to ensure foods are cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature. Always wash your hands with soap and water, and disinfect cooking surfaces when handling raw or uncooked meat and poultry. Dr. Binnicker says millions of birds have been infected with avian influenza, and the risk to humans remains low because the virus hasn't adapted to humans at this time. He recommends precautions for those who spend time outdoors or work with birds. \"If you're interacting with birds, either through a backyard bird flock or a poultry farm, and there are birds that are either sick or have died, you need to wear an N95 mask. You need to wear eye protection and gloves,\" says Dr. Binnicker. \"Most importantly, you need to contact your state or local public health officials so that they're aware of what's going on in your poultry facility or backyard bird flock.\" The bird flu doesn't normally infect people, but some rare cases have happened. Infection can range from no symptoms to mild illness (like pink eye) to very serious and even deadly, according to the CDC. \"If you come down with symptoms, especially after interacting with a sick or dead bird, get tested for influenza and let your doctor and local public health officials know,\" he says. \"The good news is that influenza tests that we currently use for human strains of influenza should be positive if an individual is infected with avian influenza. The current tests just won't tell us specifically that an individual has avian influenza .\" The CDC is working with diagnostic test manufacturers and clinical laboratories to develop tests to specifically determine if it's avian flu. Dr. Binnicker says those tools should be available in the months ahead.",

        "content": "The last may not have been heard about the crisis between Turkish Airlines and Nigeria’s National Union of Air Transport Employee (NUATE), over the sack of seven Nigerian staff by the airlines, as the aviation workers described its $600,000 ticket racketeering claim as false. LEADERSHIP reports that NUATE had picketed Turkish Airlines over alleged high handedness and severe maltreatment of workers, including unjustifiable dismissal and forced resignation of seven workers. The picketing resulted in passengers being stranded at the Lagos and Istanbul Airports. However, in a statement signed by NUATE’s general secretary, Ocheme Aba, and a copy of which was made available to LEADERSHIP, it stated that the report that the sacked staff were involved in ticket racketeering was untrue. According to Ocheme, it was the sales manager, a Turkish national, who asked staff to use the PNR obtained online by the customers to process their tickets. Ocheme said manual processing of tickets were necessary since customers can’t pay online due to sales restriction circular from the airlines as a response to the difficulty in repatriating their proceeds. The union leader said, “We wish to let the public and stakeholders know that the accusations are blatant and poorly formulated lies. In the first place, the claim that the Airline lost $600,000 is mere phantom. What happened is that sometime in April, 2023, Turkish Airlines’ headquarters issued a sales restriction circular which allowed sales of only two premium classes of tickets as a response to foreign airlines’ difficulty in repatriating their proceeds to home countries due to foreign exchange constraints in Nigeria. “But, in a contradicting manner the Airline had an advertised fare on the website which was much lower than the permitted fares. Therefore, intending passengers who accessed such fare, but could not pay online were directed by the global call center to approach the Nigerian offices. As the workers could not attend to the customers due to the sales restriction, the passengers resorted to creating ugly scenes at the sales offices which became riotous at times. “As an image saving measure, the then sales manager asked the sales staff to use the PNR obtained online by the customers to process the tickets if the Airline’s booking system could route the tickets. The sales staff simply complied. As a matter of fact, the then sales manager, a Turkish national, sold this tickets too to confirm that this was the local management’s approved approach to resolving the problem created by the website. “The Airline’s accountants received all due monies from all tickets sold and all sales report were daily submitted to sales manager, signed by him and accounts department and scanned to HQ. If monies were not fully received, the account would not have balanced, and sales could not have been concluded. Therefore, no monies belonging to Turkish Airlines is missing. And no staff has taken any monies belonging to Turkish Airlines. Importantly, no staff had any pecuniary benefit from the so-called internet sales. “It is, therefore, disingenuous for the General Manager to hold the workers to the charge of failure to comply with the sales restrictions when it is clear that shortcomings on the part of the Airlines ICT (on the website) combined with Local Management’s decisions on managing an otherwise ugly situation were responsible for the sales in question. “It is noteworthy that while the Nigerian staff have been dismissed, the Turkish Sales Manager has been promoted and redeployed, and the ICT of the airline has answered no charges. Talk about racism. What better example than this.” Meanwhile, the aviation union has declared the general manager of Turkish Airlines in Lagos, Lokman Balkan, persona non grata, over allegations that the sacked Nigerian staff were involved in ticket racketeering. The union, however, threatened to instruct all aviation workers not to attend to him at any Nigerian airport, except at his exit from Nigeria. The union stated that if compelled, NUATE shall internationalise the GM’s ostracising from the global aviation family. “NUATE wishes to state that the high-handedness, plain wickedness and undiluted arrogance of Mr. Lokman Balkan, the General Manager of Turkish Airlines in Lagos makes him totally unfit to hold such important position as to manage people. He has demonstrated total disdain for Nigerians and Nigerian laws – even aviation laws. “There is no hiding the fact that Lokman is averse to ethical behaviour, and constitutes a present and definite danger to airline business in Nigeria. In order climes, Lokman would have been arrested and deported by now at the very least. “On our part, however, NUATE has declared Lokman Balkan persona non grata. We shall instruct all aviation workers not to handle him at any Nigerian airport, except at his exit from Nigeria. And if compelled, NUATE shall internationalize his ostracizing from the global aviation family. At the appropriate time he will also answer to the defamation of the character of the hapless staff. “In conclusion, NUATE wishes to, on the one hand, assure Mr. Lokman Balkan, GM of Turkish Airlines in Lagos that his mission to exterminate the Union from the Airline will meet with utter failure. If anything, it will be he, not the hard working Nigerian staff, who will leave the Airline. “On the other hand, NUATE assures the public and aviation stakeholders that our justified position will be pursued in the manner that other aviation businesses will not be negatively impacted, but only to the extent that we are allowed to prosecute our struggle without unlawful hindrances,” the statement stated.",

It will be available this fall for middle school students. While rowing isn’t easy, it is one of many sports that teaches team work. KIPP OKC College Prep Athletic Director David Duplissis plans to be the coach, while his son Dillon and student Carlos Williams plan to be on the team. The soon to be eighth graders are hoping the workouts they did on the rowing machines Friday can translate to when they do the real thing in the fall. LOCAL NEWS: RIVERSPORT offering free learn to row day “Just giving the opportunity to be exposed and create opportunities for kids that they normally wouldn’t have,” David Duplissis said. In April, students like Williams and Duplissis got to take part in RIVERSPORT’s Outdoor Adventure Education Research, or ROVER, program.

From there, a rowing team was born. This spring, they met every Tuesday for practice. “They enjoyed every bit of it,” David Duplissis said. They plan to take part in Junior League. It’s competition Duplissis hopes can teach kids lessons. “Resiliency, risk management, and, you know, just a holistic view of helping a child succeed in life,” he said.

        "content": "Rafael Nadal knocked out of the French Open in the first round as legendary Spaniard loses in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in likely Roland Garros farewell Rafael Nadal bowed out valiantly at the French Open after his first round defeat Alexander Zverev triumphed 6-3 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 in a three-hour marathon contest Legendary Nadal, a 14-time winner in Paris, is unlikely to return to Roland Garros By Matthew Lambert Published: 17:27, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:17, 27 May 2024 e-mail 5 View comments There is a statue of Rafael Nadal at Roland Garros, forged not from stone but shards of metal. While most sculptures appear static this is a kaleidoscope of movement. Nadal is depicted with left leg in the air, left arm wrapped around his body in a forehand, and mouth open in that primal snarl of effort. That is how he will be remembered, not as the man who was beaten in straight sets by 27-year-old Alexander Zverev on Philippe Chatrier; not as this shadow of the titan he once was. But this defeat – only his fourth here in 19 years and his first in the opening round - will form part of his legacy nonetheless. It is one thing to fight towards victory, quite another to scrap in the face of almost certain defeat. He saved 12 break points and a run of shotmaking brought him close to snatching the second set. It was comfortably his best performance of this, almost certainly the final season of his career. But Zverev is younger, fitter and more powerful and sometime sport is as simple as that. The German No 4 seed joins Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic as the only men to have beaten Nadal at the French Open . He should absolutely be counted among the favourites for this title. Rafael Nadal's French Open swansong came to an early end after his first-round knockout Nadal went down in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in what may be his final year on tour 'I don't know if it's the last time I will be here,' said Nadal, 37. 'It's so special for me to feel the love of the people in the place that I love the most. 'I was competitive I had my chances but it was not enough against a great champion like Sacha. 'To the people here, the feelings you have made me feel are unforgettable. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.' This was an emotionally significant match for Zverev, too. It was here against Nadal in the 2022 semi-finals when a knife edge match was ended by a horrific ankle injury. He has just this year begun to fully rebuild from that and Zverev will feel like this win finally laid those ghosts to rest. That this was the most anticipated men's first-round match in history was demonstrated by those in the crowd. Nadal was watched on court by his greatest rival Novak Djokovic and the heir to his Spanish throne Carlos Alcaraz and his successor as the most dominant player at Roland Garros, Iga Swiatek. Alcaraz stayed the longest. He was asked in a video this week to name his favourite tennis player. 'Rafa is my favourite everything,' he replied. Zverev inflicted only Nadal's fourth French Open defeat and his first ever in the first round The legendary Spaniard fought valiantly under the closed roof on Court Philippe Chatrier Zverev looked a little cowed at times by the febrile atmosphere. He was clumsy around the net and wasteful of opportunities but he landed 77 per cent of his first serves and struck 44 winners. He punctured Nadal's defences with his majestic backhand and broke him six times. In the end, the layers of Nadal's genius had been stripped away until that famous aura was all that remained. And that aura matters. It has won him sets, matches and perhaps even titles here and it probably saved him from a more embarrassing scoreline against Zverev. But an aura cannot hit forehands and it cannot make returns - and it is in those fundamental currencies of the sport that Nadal is now lacking. Especially in the first half of the match, there was spin on the forehand but no depth, no venom. The backhand did not have its usual penetration. The Spaniard said before this match that he was feeling fully fit for the first time since his comeback at the start of the year, and this was a much improved performance compared to his struggles on the clay so far this season. He will curse the fact that he was not able to rebuild physically sooner, and come into Roland Garros with more matches in his legs. But what a legacy he leaves here. He has dominated this corner of Paris's 16th arrondisement in a manner that is without parallel – not just in tennis but surely in any sport. He fought Zverev, the No 4 seed, after dropping down the rankings due to infrequent play All being well, Nadal will be back on the same court for the Olympics later this summer He will finish – if this is indeed to be the end – with a 112-4 record at this tournament. I would argue he has never lost here when fully fit. He arrived here as a 19-year-old in 2005 and won the title on debut. The hair was longer, the shorts baggier and the sleeves non-existent. He has the kid who could get any ball back and never made a mistake. But what has given Nadal the record he has is his indefatigable greed for improvement. When he first began playing here his serve was little more than a way to get the point started but he reforged it into a powerful weapon. He became more aggressive, and turned himself into, for my money, the best volleyer in the world (sorry, Roger). With those improvements he became the complete package. Not just the best clay court player there has ever been but the best that could possibly be imagined. All being well, Nadal will be back on this court for the Olympics, playing the singles and the doubles with Alcaraz. But at the French Open, this was surely the end.

        "description": "The insurer aims to focus on topline growth FY25",
        "content": "By Anshika Kayastha Comments READ LATER Life Insurance Corporation of India posted a net profit of 13,763 crore in Q4, up only 2.5 per cent year-on-year, as a 15.3 per cent jump in expenses of management to ₹24,709 crore for the quarter weighed on the bottomline. In the earnings call, CFO Sunil Agrawal said there was a sharp increase in expenses of management in Q4 due to the wage revision impact in Q4, which includes arrears of payments, gratuity and leave encashmant and pension liability. The arrears and gratuity have been completely accounted for in Q4 whereas the pension liability will be amortised over financial years. LIC had changed its accounting policy in September 2022, regarding transfer of accretion on available solvency margin from Non-Participating Policyholders account to Shareholders account. Accordingly, it transferred ₹29,519 crore (net of tax) in FY24 compared with ₹27,241 crore in the previous year, which supported profitability. The transfer for Q4 was ₹8,058 crore against ₹4,542 crore in the year-ago period. Also read: Mukesh Ambani weighs listing RJio first The profit after tax for FY24 was at ₹40,676 crore, 11.8 per cent higher y-o-y. The life insurer sold total of 2.0 crore individual policies in FY24, 0.2 per cent lower on year. Overall expense ratio for FY24 was 15.6 per cent compared with 15.5 per cent for FY23. Total premium income for FY24 was ₹4.8-lakh crore, marginally higher than ₹4.7-lakh crore in FY23. Individual business premium grew 3.8 per cent to Rs 3.0 lakh crore, whereas the group business premium income fell 5.5 per cent to ₹1.7-lakh crore. “During FY24, we focused on directional changes in our product mix and enhancing margins in the business. We have more than doubled our share of non-par business within our individual business. Now, we intend to focus our strategic interventions to maximize our market share across categories,” said Chairperson Siddhartha Mohanty, adding that the focus will also be on the topline growth trajectory. Post listing, LIC had adopted some directional changes in approach to business, particularly product mix, with a focus on high margin products. Due to this margins have improved but topline has been muted, which is why the insurer will focus on growing the topline without losing sight on margins, Mohanty said adding that topline growth will be driven by multiple projects been undertaken including one for transformation of the agency channel, and the launch of new products. Value of New Business (VNB) was up 4.7 per cent for FY24 at ₹9,583 crore. Net VNB margin increased 60 bps to 16.8 per cent. Total premium, on Annualized Premium Equivalent (APE) basis, rose 0.5 per cent to ₹56,970 crore. Of this, 67.5 per cent (₹38,433 crore) was accounted for by the individual business and 32.5 per cent (₹18,537 crore) by the group business. Within Individual Business, share of Par products was 81.7 per cent (₹31,392 crore). Non Par APE grew over two-fold to ₹7,041 crore, comprising 18.3 per cent of individual business as against 8.9 per cent a year ago. Also read: Satin Creditcare raises ₹332 crore from Dutch Entrepreneurial Development Bank FMO LIC continued to lead in market share, in terms of first year premium Income, with a share of 58.9 per cent. The life insurer had a market share of 38.4 per cent in individual business and 72.3 per cent in the group business. LIC’s AUM increased 16.5 per cent to ₹51.2-lakh crore, and the solvency ratio improved to 1.98 from 1.87 at the end of FY23. The 13 th month persistency ratio, on premium basis, improved slightly to 77.7 per cent from 77.1 per cent but for the 61st month deteriorated to 60.9 per cent from 61.8 per cent. On the basis of number of policies, the 13 th month persistency improved to 67.0 per cent from 64.3 per cent whereas the 61 st month persistency fell to 48.6 per cent from 49.9 per cent. The share price of LIC gained 0.58 per cent to close at ₹1035.80 on the BSE. Comments",

Email katherine.lawton@mailonline.co.uk By Katherine Lawton Published: 17:38, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:38, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments A music lover spent £79 on drinks and hours standing in the Co-op Live arena waiting for Nicki Minaj only for the gig to be cancelled after the singer was arrested. The rapper, 41, was arrested on suspicion of possessing soft drugs in the Netherlands on Saturday, just hours before she was supposed to be on stage at Manchester's Co-Op Live arena. She was held at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport before continuing her tour in Birmingham on Sunday. Lottie Gibbons, a fan of the star, said the evening turned out to be 'shambolic' after she bought several rounds of drinks while waiting inside the arena, only to be told hours later that the show had been postponed. Her friends had flown from the Isle of Man and booked a two-night stay in Manchester's city centre, while Ms Gibbons made the journey from Liverpool to join them. The first warning sign appeared when Minaj tweeted a video showing her being detained at the airport following a luggage search. Did YOU attend the concert? Email katherine.lawton@mailonline.co.uk Lottie Gibbons (pictured) said the evening turned out to be 'shambolic' after she bought several rounds of drinks while waiting inside the arena, only to be told hours later that the Nicki Minaj concert was cancelled Nicki Minaj, 41, (pictured) was arrested on suspicion of possessing soft drugs in the Netherlands on Saturday Fans leaving the Manchester Co-op Live venue after the Nicki Minaj show was postponed A text message alert informed fans that doors would open just 30 minutes later than scheduled, with Ms Gibbons and her friends heading over to the arena at around 7pm. 'This marked the beginning of a downward spiral, where the recently opened Co-op Live Arena, plagued by delays and teething problems, revealed its lack of experience,' she wrote for the Liverpool Echo . Once inside the arena, Ms Gibbons claimed her and her friends bought three rounds of drinks with 'wildly varying costs' - with two gin and tonics and one vodka and coke costing £38 - while the next round of two drinks costed £21. The fans then spent more than two hours looking at an empty stage without any updates from the arena, according to Ms Gibbons. 'Finally, at 9.35 pm, the first and only announcement over the tannoy confirmed the concert's postponement, prompting boos and a mass exodus of 20,000 disappointed fans,' she wrote. Minaj was held at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport before continuing her tour in Birmingham on Sunday Ms Gibbons added: 'The whole night felt like a cash grab. While I understand the need to get people inside for safety reasons, it was clear from Nicki's arrest that the concert was unlikely to happen.' A statement from Co-op Live on Saturday said: 'Nicki Minaj's scheduled performance at Manchester's Co-op Live on Saturday, May 25 has been postponed. Tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled performance which will be announced ASAP. 'Despite Nicki's best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight's show happen, the events of today have made it impossible. We are deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused. More information will be available at your point of purchase.'

        "content": "German Ambassador to Nigeria, Annett Gunther, has claimed that renewable energy can create over 112 million jobs by 2030. She said this in Abuja at a reception organised by the Federal Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology for a German delegation on green hydrogen, recently. She highlighted that the sector had already generated employment opportunities for at least 390,000 individuals in Germany. Gunther declared, “The hydrogen industry is growing, stimulating economic growth and creating jobs in the process. “Hydrogen does not only seek to meet the climate change goals but also seeks to feed the population in this part of the world. “We are on the same page in this partnership on hydrogen and it will be in the interest of both countries.” The German Government was in partnership with Nigeria to combat climate change and related issues in the country, the German ambassador said. She added that the perennial floods in parts of Nigeria are a global challenge, aggravated by the climate change phenomenon. She noted that all hands must be on deck to tackle the root causes of climate issues, adding that decarbonisation and zero emissions would help to solve the problem not only in Nigeria but globally. The ambassador added that Nigeria had an ambitious goal in its energy transition plan, developed under the previous administration to ensure zero emissions until 2060, adding that, if properly implemented, it could be impactful. She revealed, “In our cooperation talks, we are interested in how to help Nigeria achieve that goal. “We, therefore, have opened a hydrogen diplomacy office called the German-Nigerian hydrogen diplomacy office where experts organise meetings, conferences, and discussions and bring together stakeholders in the area of renewable energies and particularly on hydrogen. “Even though gas is currently the primary source of energy and power, we have to chart the way forward. We need to have these discussions to reach our climate goals earlier or as soon as possible.”",

        "content": "UNAI EMERY has signed a bumper new five-year contract which ties him to Aston Villa until 2029. It is the news that every Villa fan has been longing to hear after the Spaniard transformed their club from Championship dodgers to Champions League contenders in 19 eventful months. 2 Unai Emery has signed a new five-year deal with Aston Villa Credit: PA 2 Emery guided Villa to a Champions League spot this season Credit: Getty And it is the perfect way to begin the club's 150th Anniversary season as the Birmingham side looks to celebrate being back in the big time after years of stagnation. Emery said: “I am very happy to take this step and the responsibility of leading this club.\" Chairman Nassef Sawiris said: “We are building something special here at Aston Villa with Unai at its core and we are delighted that he has signed a new deal with the club until 2029. “As we move into our historic, 150th anniversary year, there is a lot to look forward to with Unai at the helm.” Emery has been rewarded by billionaire owners Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens for transforming the club's fortunes following a high-level meeting this week. Villa's owners met with Emery, the club's President of Football, Monchi, and Director of Football Damian Vidagany to review the season. But top of their list of priorities was to tie their Spanish boss down on a lucrative new five-year deal. SunSport understands Emery will become the highest paid boss in Villa's history and will pocket a cool basic £8million a season before bonuses - or around £154,000 a week.

Fans baffled as Unai Emery spotted shouting at Aston Villa star who was sat on substitutes bench “There’s a great chemistry in Aston Villa. And the element of the fans’ support also makes the difference to feel like home. \"We are really excited to continue this journey with no limits to our dreams.” Emery's impact at Villa Park has been sensational and Sawiris and Edens wanted to reward him for leading the Villans to a surprise fourth place finish last season. That remarkable achievement, with an injury-hit squad, secured Champions' League qualification for the first time in 41 years and European qualification for the first time since 2010. The 52-year-old also led Villa to the brink of the Uefa Conference League final, losing out to Olympiakos in their first European semi-final for 42 years. That achievement resulted in Villa triggering a one-year-option to extend Emery's contract until 2027. However Sawiris and Edens made it clear that they wanted to tie Emery down on an even longer deal, as some of Europe's biggest clubs including Barcelona , AC Milan , Chelsea , Manchester United and Liverpool cast envious eyes towards the successful Spaniard. They will be delighted they now have the stability they want as they embark on Champions League football, well ahead of the five-year target they had set Emery to achieve their No.1 target. Emery made it clear in April when he agreed to his short-term extension that he wanted to stay at Villa Park and return Villa to their historic place at English football's top table. He said: “We are enjoying our way together with Villa fans, the club owners, management and this great group of players that we are proud of.

However, the second set saw the former World No. 1 showcase his resilience, pushing Zverev to the limit. Cameras captured Djokovic’s keen interest as he watched the thrilling encounter. Djokovic is watching too 👀 #rolandgarros pic.twitter.com/vcJAaWQIf9 — Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 27, 2024 Rafael Nadal had a notable spectator during his first-round match at the French Open 2024, as World No. 1 and longtime rival Novak Djokovic watched from the stands. Joining Djokovic were Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, who also came to see Nadal in action against Alexander Zverev. This match marked Nadal’s return to Grand Slam tennis this year, as an injury had sidelined him from the Australian Open. Due to his low ranking, Nadal entered the tournament unseeded and faced a challenging draw. It will be interesting to see whether the Spaniard will play next year or will decide to put an end to an illustrious career of tennis.

        "content": "PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 on Monday in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion’s last match at his favorite tournament . Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Howard Fendrich, The Associated Press",

        "content": "Nazareth’s Sean Kinney and Lehighton’s Reese Balk, a pair of senior 285-pounders, are the 2024 recipients of the annual Christian Luciano Memorial Pinner Awards. Kinney was 39-1 this season with 32 pins on his way to a third consecutive PIAA Class 3A championship for coach Dave Crowell’s Blue Eagles. Balk was 35-10 with 29 falls for the Indians. He was a District 11 Class 2A champion and Southeast Regional sixth-place finisher for coach Floyd Brown. Balk was 73-21 in his career. Kinney, who is headed to Lafayette to play football, finished his wrestling career with a 125-5 record with 98 pins. He won four District 11 and four Northeast Regional championships and was a four-time state finalist. The Blue Eagles standout was the first in PIAA history to reach four state finals in the same weight class and the first three-time state heavyweight champion. Kinney, who also shared the District 11 Class 3A Scholar-Athlete of the Year award with Easton’s Ben Fanelli, and Balk were honored earlier this month at a reception at The Gin Mill in Northampton. The award is given annually in memory of Luciano, Northampton’s 1998 state champion who died in a car accident in 2007 at age 28. The four-time state medalist and one of Northampton’s winningest wrestlers was inducted in 2022 into the Lehigh Valley Wrestling Hall of Fame. He won the state’s pinner award (both classes) as a senior. Michael Luciano, Christian’s father, created the award in 2008.

        "description": "'We are appalled at what he went through'",
        "content": "The family of a \"loving\" 19-year-old who is reported to have taken his own life at a Welsh prison have slammed his \"appalling\" experience at the troubled jail. Michael \"Mikey\" Horton, from Newport, is one of nine inmates at Bridgend's HMP Parc to have died suddenly in the last three months. Mikey's family were among the dozens of people who protested outside Parc on Monday morning, calling for G4S — the private security giant that runs the prison — to be stripped of its £400million contract . Bereaved families led chants of \"G4S out\" and marched around the edge of the prison with placards bearing messages such as \"stop the drugs\" and \"HMP Corrupt to the Core\". It comes after WalesOnline revealed allegations from former staff members and prisoners of drug-dealing, violence, corruption, chronic understaffing and a lack of mental health support. G4S said the safety of staff and prisoners was their priority and that they \"have a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs\". They said all mental health support is based on an assessment and operates in the same way as it would in the community. READ NEXT: Baby mauled by pocket bully dog in 'tragic accident' READ NEXT: Kebab shop leaves 50 people ill and 11 in hospital with food poisoning Frances Jones, 60, described her nephew Mikey, who died on May 7, as \"a very loving boy\". She said: \"He was always in trouble but he was paying for his crime and doing his time. He deserved to walk out of here in November, not come out in a black bag. \"He had a very severe addiction on the outside world. We nearly lost Mikey around a year ago through boys who thought it rather funny to give Mikey these drugs and left him on a doorstep to die. We thought we had got through that. When someone goes to prison, you don't expect them to get the drugs in here. It is appalling.\" Although Mikey's family said G4S has told them the death was a suicide, they suspect drugs played a significant role in the lead-up. He had told them that the laundry where he had been working was a distribution point for drugs, the family said. Eventually the family say they started receiving calls from people asking for hundreds of pounds because Mikey \"had run up a drug debt\". They said he was subjected to controlling behaviour from dealers, who allegedly ordered him to throw boiling water on another prisoner. Frances said Mikey refused to do this, which they say led to him receiving threats and fearing for his own safety. Frances added that there were times when Mikey was locked in his cell for 23 hours a day. \"He was a very lonely boy,\" said Frances, who believes he should have received more mental health support. On the morning the family learned of his death, they allegedly found out more detail from WalesOnline's reporting than they had received from G4S. Frances claimed that it was only after fighting for answers from the G4S liaison officer that the family learned Mikey had been found hanged. They are awaiting toxicology results to find out if he had taken drugs before his death. “We are appalled at what he went through,” said Frances. “We want G4S out now, and we will do whatever we can to get them out.” Also protesting outside the prison were the family of Justin Lewis, a 29-year-old from Newport who reportedly took his own life on March 16. Justin's niece Shanna Hiscox, 20, described him as “charismatic and charming\" with an \"incredible\" talent for art, a love of magic tricks and \"a great sense of humour\". His sister Naomi Lewis, 31, said he was meant to be under monitoring every hour for potential self-harm, but alleged he was not checked for five hours before his death, which G4S has told the family was a suspected suicide. She believes staff should have safeguarded Justin better, given he had been admitted to hospital for serious self-harm just weeks before his death. Naomi said the family were left \"in disbelief and heartbroken\" by the news of Justin's death. Responding to prisons minister Edward Argar’s recent claim that Parc is \"safe\" and \"well-run\", Naomi claimed: “No, I disagree. You don't see [deaths] happening on this scale in other prisons. \"They are understaffed, there is no duty of care, they get all this money and they are not doing their jobs properly.\" And speaking about the reports of rife drug-dealing, she said: \"It's shocking. It's just so easily accessible... Families are losing their loved ones. We don’t want to see anyone else die.” Tanya Hardy travelled hundreds of miles to Parc from her home in Suffolk to raise awareness of the wider problems in the UK prison estate. She said her son Guy-Scott Pallemaerts, a 28-year-old father of two, died by suicide in the Mount prison in Hertfordshire last October after an alleged lack of mental health support. “Prisons should be about losing your liberty, not your life,” she said. You can see more of our coverage from the protest here . A G4S spokewoman said: “We extend our sincere condolences to the family and friends of those who have died recently at Parc. As with all deaths in custody, these are being investigated by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. The safety of staff and prisoners is our priority. We have a zero-tolerance policy towards drugs and use a range of tactics to tackle the ingress of drugs and reduce demand. This includes robust security measures for staff, visitors and prisoners as well as substance misuse support to those in our care.\" She continued: \"The vast majority of our staff are hard working and honest. As with every other prison in the country, we work closely with the Police and the HMPPS counter-corruption team to crack down on the small number who may break the rules. All mental health support is based on an assessment and operates in the same way as it would in the community. In line with national policy, prisoners at risk of self harm or suicide are managed by a multi-disciplinary team and have a tailored support plan.” The spokeswoman added that Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board provides primary and secondary healthcare services at Parc. We have approached the health board for comment. Two of the nine recent deaths are thought to be from natural causes and at least four from drugs, according to the Ministry of Justice, which has issued an urgent notice on G4S to improve security at Parc. For mental health support, contact the Samaritans on 116 123, email them at jo@samaritans.org or visit samaritans.org to find your nearest branch.",

        "description": "After an ankle injury slowed down his 2023 campaign, Cam Jordan is looking to be back at 100% for 2024.",
        "content": "After 11 straight seasons of strong play, Cameron Jordan turned in a disappointing 2023 campaign. While he is getting older, and down years can happen to even the best of players, another key reason was a sustained ankle injury in November that hindered his play through the back-half of the year. But the 34-year-old is looking to bounce back in 2024, after undergoing surgery to help him get back to full strength. Currently, he is still in recovery, but the eight-time Pro Bowler told reporters that he is feeling good, and hopes to be back on the field soon for the ' offseason activities. He wasn't the only member of the defensive end room to need surgery, though. also needed neck surgery this offseason. The 25-year-old signed with the team on a one-year deal worth up to $13 million. With a chance to contribute at defensive end, . The New Orleans' front seven was mildly disappointing in 2023, as the defensive line was battered with injuries and limited with depth. Still, there were some bright spots like Carl Granderson and Bryan Bresee who helped inspire optimism for the team moving forward. Then, despite being strapped for cash, the team made plenty of quality moves to help fill out the line this offseason. The defensive end room is now likely a four-man rotation with Granderson and Jordan as starters. But if Young can take the next step, the team will have a great pass-rushing trio to help elevate their team. Additionally, Tank Kpassagnon is a decent depth option, while young pieces like Isaiah Foskey and Payton Turner could still develop into contributors eventually. : Cameron Jordan has been one of the most consistent pass rushers in the NFL over his 13-year tenure. He has posted 7.5 sacks every season except his rookie year and 2023, meaning he reached the threshold 11 consecutive times (2012-22). Having Young learn from a player like Jordan, who has dominated with dependable play and well-rounded production for the large part of his career, gives the 2020 second-overall pick a chance to work under one of the best defensive ends of this era and lets him operate in an understudy role to potentially further develop his game. Additionally, the interior defense added Khalen Saunders on a three-year, $12 million agreement to help provide some run defense in the middle. The team also added Northern Iowa nose tackle Khristian Boyd in the sixth round, who had a lot of fans in the media. New Orleans Saints' Pass Rush - 2023 Sacks 34 T-28th Pressures 118 28th Pressure % 18.7% 28th QB Knockdowns 38 T-27th Knockdown % 6.8% 27th QB Hurries 46 15th Hurry % 7.3% T-14th After narrowly missing out on winning the in 2023, the team is gearing up with hopes of competing once again. If they can find a way to improve their play in the front seven, then their chances take a huge step forward.",

The former heavyweight champion, 57, became nauseous and dizzy, forcing flight staff to ask passengers if there was a doctor on board to provide assistance. Paramedics boarded the plane, which had already been delayed by two hours in Miami because of the heat, once it touched down in Los Angeles to give treatment. It comes just two months before the boxing legend is due to fight YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in Dallas. 'Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,' his representatives told The New York Post. Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Sunday Tyson's fellow passengers were asked if there was a doctor on board to give him assistance Read More Mike Tyson feels 's*** and sore' as he trains to fight Jake Paul at age 57 - as he opens up on the brutal toll camp is taking at New York press conference 'He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing. 'He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.' Typical symptoms of an ulcer flare up include nausea and vomiting, bloating, belching and gas pain, as well as chest pain and fatigue. It comes after In Touch first revealed on Monday morning that Tyson 'had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded'. Sources claim the cabin crew 'issued an announcement asking for a doctor 30 minutes before landing and the message even came on everyone's screens.' 'He was in first class, but we were an exit row,' an eyewitness added. 'They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter. [The stewardess] said something like, \"He's a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he's OK.\" I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words \"Mike Tyson\" and she nodded her head yes.' Once the plane landed at LAX, there was another delay of around 25 minutes while the paramedics treated Tyson. Tyson, who has previously admitted he uses marijuana daily, has given the drug up while training to fight Paul because it is on the list of banned substances used by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation. He also revealed he's given up sex temporarily as part of his training regime. Tyson admitted he uses marijuana daily but has given the drug up while training to fight Paul Fans have raved about Tyson's physique and punching power during recent training videos It comes just two months before the boxing legend is due to fight Jake Paul in Dallas 'He only stopped as a means of following all of the rules,' his publicist Joann Mignano recently told USA TODAY Sports. 'But he is still a strong advocate for the medicinal benefits of cannabis for his personal well-being and others like him.’' Read More REVEALED: VIP tickets for Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson to cost $2MILLION... here's what fans get in lucrative package Tyson will be 58 on July 20, when the fight against Paul is set for AT&T Stadium - the home of the Dallas Cowboys. The fight has been marred by criticism in recent weeks, particularly at the vast age gap between the two fighters. 'I don't see too many people critical about it. Look at this,' Tyson said at a press conference earlier this month.. When a reporter suggested there were critics, Tyson said, 'Who? Name me somebody. You? Who?' The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation is sanctioning the fight as a professional bout, but it will be eight two-minute rounds instead of 10 or 12 rounds lasting three minutes each. The gloves will be heavier (14 ounces instead of 10), which is supposed to reduce the power of punches. Tyson retired in 2005, but most recently fought in an exhibition in November 2020 against Roy Jones in California, which wouldn't declare it a pro fight. Tyson was mostly annoyed by the scene and the questions, including when asked what it meant to have a chance to fill AT&T Stadium. 'I was doing this years ago, so this is nothing new to me,' said Tyson, who won 50 fights with 44 knockouts before retiring. 'This is new to this young boy over here.'

        "description": "Leaders push for policy development and collaboration to accelerate energy transition and avoid losing public support.The post Losing public support would jeopardize climate efforts, International Energy Forum chief fears appeared first on Digital Journal.",
        "content": "LISBON — “One of the things I’m really worried about is losing public support for climate policies and energy transition,” Joseph McMonigle, Secretary General of the International Energy Forum (IEF), said during the opening plenary of the Lisbon Energy Summit & Exhibition. “I’m worried that the public starts to equate high prices and volatility with today’s energy with the energy of the future, and the energy transition will lose public support. That would be a terrible thing.” With members from 73 countries, the IEF is the world’s largest international organization of energy ministers. McMonigle was joined on stage with speakers from McKinsey & Company, bp, the European Commission, Portuguese energy company, REN, and an advisor for the European Commission. McMonigle said issues around climate change and energy are existential, and if policymakers and the energy industry lose the public’s support, it will jeopardize efforts to address climate change through the energy transition. “We don’t have another shot at getting them back,” he said. “It’s a one-and-done type of proposition.” McMonigle’s angst around losing public support comes as businesses and governments around the world plan short- and long-term initiatives and develop policies to reduce emissions in the global path to net zero. With 80% of power still coming from fossil fuels globally, major infrastructure investments are required to bring on other forms of energy, and that process is slow and expensive. Happening this week in Portugal, the Lisbon Energy Summit & Exhibition kicked off with a focus on accelerating energy transition through supportive policy, with a particular focus on three areas: energy security, affordability, and sustainability. As rising energy costs threaten to exacerbate poverty and dampen competition needed for economic growth around the world, energy affordability is now at the top of government agendas globally. Diversifying the energy mix and ensuring a stable supply are also central to the energy security focus for companies and delegates in attendance. Diversification was touted as a way to avoid supply disruptions, price volatility, and geopolitical tensions while still also supporting sustainability goals. The third component of the opening plenary centered on sustainability, with an emphasis on broadening the discourse to encompass clean energy initiatives beyond decarbonization. This included discussions on investment and supportive policies aimed at fostering the development of new clean technologies, while ensuring the protection of conventional oil and gas sources and infrastructure. “What we’re trying to do is basically try a full energy transition within a few decades without necessarily having cost or technology leadership yet, and therefore policy needs to be at the center of what we’re trying to do,” said Giulia Chierchia, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Sustainability and Ventures at bp. Chierchia notes that policy framed toward energy security will be critical for energy transition, and that has become evident in the wake of Russia’s war in Ukraine. “We’ve seen what happened in the aftermath of the Ukraine war, and a system which isn’t secure and that isn’t affordable isn’t a system which will enable an energy transition,” she said. In addition to energy security to fuel the energy transition, Chierchia noted that technology will be critical, but that governments and leaders need to be technology-neutral and avoid setting technology choices beforehand. “We’re navigating an environment of technology uncertainty, and we don’t really know what the answer is going to be,” she said. “The perfect solution might not be the solution that actually delivers most progress in the short term.” Paula Pinho, Director at the Directorate-General Energy in the European Commission said collaboration will be needed, and siloing will be the achilles heel for energy transition if it is not managed. “Forget about policymakers writing the legislation on net zero,” Pinho said. “Forget about industry alone being able to drive it forward. We really need cooperation between the private sector, academia, and financing institutions.” That extends to public-private cooperation, Pinho said, with a focus on training and universities teaching needed future workforce skills. She urged private companies to avoid viewing each other solely as competitors when it comes to talent development, and instead work together to provide training that upskills the future workforce for energy transition jobs. “The worst thing which could happen is we have efficient legislation, even the financing, yet we don’t have the necessary skills,” she said.

        "content": "Taking a dig at India's T20 World Cup 2024 squad after the conclusion of the IPL, former Pakistan skipper Wasim Akram has said that at least this time, Indian players will not make an excuse of being tired during the upcoming mega event. The final between KKR and SRH didn’t include a single Indian player who is going to the T20 World Cup which will be played in the United States and West Indies from June 1. Only Rinku Singh was a part of KKR but he is going to the World Cup as a travelling reserve. Talking to Sportskeeda Cricket , Akram joked: \"At least this time, Indian players will not make an excuse of being tired during the mega event.\" \"Well, now at least none of them will have to say that they are tired. They were thinking ahead, what is the point of reaching the final, India is more important, we will play with the country. But it could be a blessing in disguise for India,\" he said. \"We discussed in the previous show that I was worried that they might be tired, and they will be tired, no doubt. Even America is not their road. I think Pakistan's first match is Dallas if I remember. Now they will go and play there, one or two practice matches. It will be okay, I suppose. It is T20, the boys will recover, nowadays fitness levels are very high.” The first batch of Indian players, who did not play in IPL playoffs, left for the USA on Saturday evening including their captain Rohit Sharma and others. Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Suryakumar Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Dube, Mohammed Siraj, Axar Patel and Shubman Gill left India on Saturday night for the upcoming T20 World Cup.

        "description": "INFLATION will likely not breach target this month, Cabinet officials said, supporting the central bank's more dovish outlook on interest rate cuts.Speaking at the Philippine Economic Briefing on Monday, both Finance Secretary Ralph Recto and Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said that May consumer price growth was expected to stay within 2.0-4.0 percent.\"I would expect [it to be within target],\" Balisacan said, \"but I know I've been proven wrong before ... but so far, there have been no surprises.\"Recto said that rice inflation, which was instrumental in the ongoing rise in inflation, was expected to decline moving forward given lower prices due to increased output and lower tariffs.Inflation, earlier expected to top 4.0 percent in the second quarter, was a lower-than-expected 3.8 percent in April. Data for May will be released next week.Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) Governor Eli Remolona Jr. has said that inflation could breach the target this month but then decline moving forward and that monetary authorities could start easing policy as early as August.The BSP's policymaking Monetary Board earlier this month kept key interest rates steady, noting that inflation expectations remained tilted toward the upside.However, it lowered the risk-adjusted and baseline forecasts for this year to 3.8 percent and 3.5 percent from 4.0 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.Those for 2025 were raised to 3.7 percent from 3.5 percent and 3.3 percent from 3.2 percent.Economists polled by the BSP also have also lowered their inflation expectations and said that rate cuts of as much as 150 basis points (bps) could be ordered this year.Preliminary results of the BSP's survey of external forecasters for May led to a mean inflation forecast of 3.7 percent for this year, down from 3.8 percent in April, the central bank said in its latest Monetary Policy Report.The mean forecast for 2025, meanwhile, was unchanged at 3.5 percent but was higher at 3.5 percent for 2026 from 3.4 percent.Monetary policy settings are expected to remain unchanged for the first half, and majority of the analysts expect this to extend to the third quarter.Some, however, expect a 25-bps cut in July-September and \"by the end of 2024, the BSP is expected to reduce the policy rate by 25 to 150 bps,\" the central bank said.\"For 2025, BSP is seen to further loosen its policy stance by a range of 25 to 250 bps. For 2026, analysts expect an additional reduction of about 50 to 150 bps in the policy rate.\"The central bank's benchmark rate currently stands at 6.5 percent, the highest since 2007, following a 450 basis points of hikes beginning May 2022 as inflation surged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Recto, a member of the BSP's policymaking Monetary Board, told the Philippine Economic Briefing that he expects cuts totaling 150 bps up to next year.\"It's possible that you may have a rate cut this year and possibly more rate cuts next year. Surely, I don't expect interest rates to go any higher,\" he added.Remolona's having flagged an easing as early as August, ahead of the US Federal Reserve that is widely seen to start doing so in September, led to a run on the peso.The currency, which fell to an 18-month low last week, regained some ground on Monday but remained at the P58:$1 level.Remolona has downplayed the drop, noting the country's ample reserves, and said that the Fed's moves were only one of many data points to be considered.International Monetary Fund Resident Representative Ragnar Gudmundsson agreed that the BSP should be data-dependent but added that it should still consider the Fed's actions.\"I know they're moving in the right direction because we are now back within the BSP's target range ... the trends are encouraging,\" he said.\"However, I think we need to be aware that there are still upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"Given the upside risks, he said the central bank \"should probably maintain a sufficiently restrictive monetary policy stance until we are really firmly within the BSP's target band.\"",

        "content": "Sport | Tennis Rafael Nadal suffered a first-round exit on what could prove to be his final French Open appearance, as he was beaten in straight sets by Alexander Zverev. Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were among those in the stands for a blockbuster first-round clash, with a partisan crowd under the Philippe Chatrier roof not enough to drag Nadal to victory. The 37-year-old was competitive throughout and showed glimpses of his very best, but Zverev proved too strong as he battled to a 6-3 7-6 6-3 victory in just over three hours. Nadal, a 14-time champion at Roland Garros , was unseeded in Paris, due to his long spells away from the court with injury issues, and it left him vulnerable to a nightmare draw, up against Zverev. The fourth seed arrived in Paris after winning the Italian Open, and he is one of the favourites to go all the way and secure a first Grand Slam title. Zverev is just the third player to ever beat Nadal in Roland Garros, joining Robin Soderling and Novak Djokovic in a very exclusive club. Nadal, who has a 112-4 record at the tournament, is expected to return to Paris later this summer, to represent Spain at the Olympics. He has suggested this will be his final year on tour before he retires, but has not yet ruled out the possibility of competing at Roland Garros in 2025. He said on court after defeat to Zverev: \"It’s difficult for me to talk. I don’t know if it’s going to be the last time for me to be here, in front of you. Honestly, I am not 100% sure. “But if it is the last time, I enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing during the whole week of preparations and today. The feeling that I have today are difficult to describe in words. It’s so special to feel the love of the people in the place that I love the most. “It is a big percentage this was my last match at Roland Garros but I cannot say for sure. I am enjoying travelling with my family. My body is feeling good. Maybe I two months I say it’s enough, I can’t give more. But I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That’s another chance. I hope to be prepared.” How to watch French Open 2024: TV channel and live stream for tennis today French Open order of play today: Nadal, Swiatek, Norrie and more Murray 'proud' of French Open legacy as Wawrinka ends likely swansong Past AXA Startup Angel winners share their tips Nadal was broken in the opening game of the match by Zverev and was never able to get back on terms in the opening set, with the German in ruthless form on serve to maintain his advantage and then break again to take his third set point. The Spaniard increasingly found his feet, though, flattening out the trademark forehand and stepping up the aggression, and he broke to lead 3-2 in the second. Nadal could not, however serve it out, broken to love by Zverev for 5-5, and it went to what always felt like a pivotal tie-break. Zverev took it, Nadal shaking his head in frustration after a couple of poor drop shots, and a double fault then handed Zverev two break points in the first game of the third set. Nadal, as ever, was in no mood for rolling over and held firm to hold, following it up with a break of his own as he sent a forehand winner searing down the line. Zverev’s response was as immediate as it was impressive, breaking straight back to get it on serve again, and he landed the crucial blow in the seventh game of the set, a stunning backhand winner met with frustrated silence in the stands as he took a 4-3 lead. Nadal could not take two break points in the following game and the end was near, the Spaniard dropping serve when attempting to prolong the match as Zverev ended his tournament and, potentially, his French Open career.

        "content": "Ahmedabad, May 27 (PTI) The identities of nine bodies recovered from the fire-ravaged TRP Game Zone in Rajkot have been established through DNA analysis, said Gujarat Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi on Monday. As many as 27 persons, including children, were killed in a massive fire at the recreation centre on May 25. Since the bodies were charred beyond recognition, the state government is taking the help of a forensic science lab to identify the victims through DNA profiling. As the process is time-consuming, several anxious families waiting outside the Rajkot civil hospital to collect the bodies of their kin got into a heated argument with local police on Monday. Sanghavi visited the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Gandhinagar and announced that it has so far identified nine victims by matching their DNA samples with the samples of their relatives. “I can understand the anger of the families who have lost their loved ones. FSL is also working round the clock. Entire FSL staff have cancelled their holidays and other travel plans so that all the samples are analysed as early as possible. I have reviewed the progress and Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel is also taking updates every hour,” Sanghavi told reporters. Since it was impossible to collect blood samples from the charred bodies, forensic experts have collected bone samples to match the DNA of the deceased and their relatives, said Sanghavi. “It would have taken nearly four hours if samples were brought to Gandhinagar by road. To expedite the DNA matching process, the CM ordered the deployment of an air ambulance” he said. The minister said the process of matching DNA started at FSL early on Sunday morning and a team of 18 forensic experts has been working round to clock since then so that the bodies can be handed over to their relatives after identification. “This process is lengthy and it involves nine steps. Blood samples of relatives are matched with blood or bone samples of the deceased for matching DNA. Usually, each sample analysis would take nearly 48 hours. Till now, nine dead bodies have been identified. Eight samples are currently under analysis. We will inform the relatives as soon as reports arrive,” he added.",

Dan Charlton was standing in his back garden in the early hours when he saw a green light and heard a 'whoosh' as the object plummeted to earth. The next day he discovered a small charred rock lying in a street close to his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, that he said was 'warm and smelt burnt'. Dan said: 'I went outside and looked up and saw this light and thought, \"Is that a firework?\" Dan Charlton was standing in his back garden in the early hours when he saw a green light and heard a 'whoosh' as the object plummeted to earth The next day, he discovered a small charred rock lying in a street close to his home in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, that was 'warm and smelt burnt' 'It was really close. It came down in a straight line and what was interesting was it had a green flame, like a hue, that burnt and then disappeared. 'You could hear it make a brief \"whoosh\" sound and then I was expecting a big bang but it was just silent. 'There was no one else around and I though, \"That's definitely a meteorite\". 'I was fascinated. If I had my camera I could've caught the last second - that would've been awesome.' He later showed a geologist a picture of the object, who told him it 'appears to be a meteorite' and said a simple test could prove it. He later took the rock to the University of Leeds where he met Professor Simon Kelley from the School of Earth and Environment Professor Kelley inspecting the object under a microscope to figure out what is was made of Dan explained: 'He said that it would have a light magnetic field so I got a magnetic and found that it worked.' He later took the rock he found on May 6 to the University of Leeds where he met Professor Simon Kelley from its School of Earth and Environment. Dan said: 'He looked at it a few times under the microscope. 'He wasn't 100 per cent convinced but he didn't really know what the rock was. He suggested it could be volcanic.' Professor Kelley said it was too early to tell the provenance of the rock but felt it was unusual and planned to carry out further testing. He said: 'When I looked at it with the microscope, there were clues that made me lean towards it being a terrestrial rock. Professor Kelley said it was too early to tell the provenance of the rock but felt it was unusual and planned to carry out further testing 'First of all, I could not see any evidence of a fusion crust. 'Meteorite falls normally have a thin coating of black melted rock which forms as a result of the friction of falling through the atmosphere. 'Also, I could see what appeared to be holes and medium-sized crystals. 'Most meteorites are extremely fine-grained and contain very characteristic circular structures called chrondrules. 'However, there are other types of meteorites, so we can't be certain about the rock's classification just yet.' Professor Kelley, whose areas of expertise include planetary science and geochronology, added: 'To be absolutely sure, we will investigate further. We will begin by cutting a slice of the rock. 'That slice will then be ground and polished so that it is so thin we can shine light through it and we will be able to identify the internal structures and minerals. 'That will take a couple of weeks to complete and we'll then get back in touch with Dan to share the details of what makes up the rock he found.'

Nadal has indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday that he is not 100% sure he won’t play again at the French Open. And he reiterated that after Monday’s defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. When it ended, in anticlimactic fashion, with 22-time Grand Slam champion Nadal simply unable to play at his usual level after 1 1/2 years of hip and abdominal injuries, he thanked the raucous Court Philippe Chatrier crowd for the “incredible the amount of energy” it provided throughout the 3 hours, 5 minutes of play. “It's difficult for me to talk. I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100% sure,” said Nadal, whose 1 1/2-year-old son, Rafael Jr., sat on his mother's lap in the stands. “If it's the last time, I enjoyed it.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. The match was played with the retractable roof shut, and the loud chants of “Ra-fa!” from most in the capacity crowd of about 15,000 echoed. Nadal turns 38 on June 3 and he has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023, limiting him to 15 matches and an 8-7 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275 and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That is why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 U.S. Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal's other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2010 and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. “To be honest, I don't know what to say. First of all: Thank you, Rafa, from all of the tennis world,” Zverev said. “It's such a great honor. I've watched Rafa play all my childhood, and I was lucky enough to play Rafa when I became a professional. ... Today is not my moment. It’s Rafa’s moment.” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis",

        "content": "The Nigerian Senate, on Monday cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. The Senate Committee on Capital Market, chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of all three Executive Commissioners namely: Frana Chukwuogor, Legal and Enforcement; Bola Ajomale, Operations; and Mrs. Samiya Usman, Corporate Services. Agama’s appointment has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1 trillion economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, he was appointed to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth, stressing that “we are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointment by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market,” he added The new DG noted that the commission would implement innovative policies and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Continuing, Agama said: “you must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that,” he stressed.",

        "content": "Women affairs minister Uju Ohanenye’s decision to file a suit that put paid to the impending mass marriage of 100 orphaned girls in Niger State is well-intentioned, but she might soon discover that she played God for nothing. While addressing a press conference, the minister pointed out that she stopped the ceremony so the ministry could find out if the girls to be married out were of the appropriate ages, determine the (self-)interests of the organisers/ sponsors, and crucially, if those women gave their consent. Now, the last point is where her good intentions might meet some blowback. Yes, it is good to inquire if those marriages are consensual. But what is consent and what does it mean to give it amidst the circumstances of choicelessness, social/religious pressures, manipulation, and fear of the uncertain (especially for poor rural women with limited education and marketable skills)? When women whose possibilities are narrowed by material poverty and limited upward mobility choose marriage as a face-saving option, a means to claim some social respectability, what does it mean to have made a “choice”? Sometimes, people consent to a legal contract like a marriage because they have no other choices. For all her good intentions, Ohanenye might soon find out that the road paved with the good intentions of gender empowerment might still lead to the Nigerian social and religious hell. Why? Given how much the controversy is wrapped in religious sentiment, it cannot be that hard for the girls’ family circles and the religious patriarchs in their community to “persuade” (read: coerce) the young women into giving “consent.” Merely for the audacity of a southern Christian woman to challenge what they would like us to believe is an expression of the Islamic North culture, “consent” can be extracted from the girls to vindicate the decision of their religious leaders who have socialised them into believing that marriage is their destiny. So, if those women insist to the minister’s emissaries that they gave their “consent” as legal adults, would that still justify the decision to mass marry them off? What would the minister then do if those women insist the marriage is their choice? That is why I think she needs to be careful about uncritically elevating “consent” into the main issue at stake here. Many a “consents” inked into legal documents were never truly consensual; they were merely inconvenient choices made within the constrictions of choicelessness. What I think needs to be severely discouraged is the culture of public officials using public funds to mass-marry people. Northern governors do it frequently, but it is a misuse of public resources. Other than a mad obsession with seeing women’s heads buried between the laps of domesticity, the men—and it’s always men!—have never advanced any logical reason for mass marriages and why the government should sponsor them. They say marriage is better than waywardness, but why are those the only options available to a woman? Being married goes beyond the wedding ceremony. Marriage is a serious business that should be reserved only for those who can afford it—physically, emotionally, socially, and quite crucially, financially. Those who do not have the money to stage a ceremony can do themselves the favour of getting married quietly in front of a judge, go home, and start building their lives. Nobody needs to get married on charity, period. Marriage is also a private business, and nothing—and I repeat, nothing—says having a grand wedding makes you more married than those who have the dignity to wed according to the limit of their means. The issue of using public funds for marriage is another reason I see those criticising the minister for her intervention as clowns. You cannot purport to get married with other people’s money and then turn around to tell them they have no business in your private (religious) affair. Speaker of Niger State House of Assembly, Abdulmalik Sarkindaji, the culprit who announced his plans to sponsor the ceremony as his “constituency project,” is also playing God by making the girls’ wedding his business. Yes, those girls lost their parents in banditry attacks in Mariga Local Government Area (which he represents), but why is it his business to pay the girls’ dowry? He is a lawmaker, and a public representative should not assume a paternalistic role in other people’s private lives. It would be a different argument if he were a private individual using his money to sponsor weddings. Rich and generous people sponsor weddings; it is their prerogative. Sarkindaji’s legislative overreach is the fallout of a political culture that hands lawmakers a huge sum of money to carry out something called “community projects,” initiatives well outside their responsibilities as lawmakers. For long, lawmakers have loosely defined what constitutes constituency projects, which is why people like Sarkindaji can stretch the meaning beyond tolerable elastic limits. The mass wedding event, which would have taken place tomorrow but is now suspended, was to be conducted alongside the flagging-off of a road network and—this is where it gets interesting— distribution of cars to the eight district heads and other critical stakeholders in the local government area. That the wedding of 100 couples is not even the main point of the event—just one item to check off the agenda—makes you wonder why the spectacle was necessary in the first place. That old men will be gifted cars while young women will get husbands illustrates how the skewed allocation of resources makes for poor productivity in this country. If Sarkindaji wants to be a proper sugar daddy, he should consider giving the car gifts to the women instead. Who knows, that initiative might be their chance at an independent life which, I can bet, Sarkindaji’s daughters enjoy. Though imperfect, Ohanenye’s challenging Sarkindaji is commendable. In fact, it is about time someone stood up to people who mass-marry poor women for dubious reasons and instructed them there is more to life than continuously satiating the region beneath your waistline. Mass marriage, as it takes place in northern Nigeria, is an agenda to keep poor people poor and perpetually beholden to predatory religious and political leaders. The problem of northern Nigeria has been a problem of the libido. To contain the libidinal urges, they stage mass (and early) marriages that produce mass children whose impoverished existence culminates in mass poverty, mass urchins that prowl the streets and eventually grow up into mass terrorists and mass bandits. If Nigeria is the poverty capital of the world today, most of it has to do with the North. They reproduce an ever-growing army of children merely born to give them political victories and decommissioned soon after every election. Nobody has plans for those children’s future. And for a long time, nobody could challenge them because of their propensity for violence. Their leaders’ inability to think of serious means of resolving their social issues outside of frequently tucking people inside marriage to reproduce has created a mass problem for Nigeria, one that will unfold for at least another 50 years. Finally, media reports stated that in response to the audacity of Ohanenye to file a suit against an impending mass marriage, the Muslim Lawyers Association declared that they had raised 32 lawyers—five of them Senior Advocates of Nigeria—to challenge her in court. As much as I doubt whether the minister is on firm legal ground on this issue, I think 32 supposedly trained professionals coming up to challenge her judgment is another pathetic example of the Nigerian tendency to overdo things. I would not worry about them too much though. If that many lawyers had to bunch themselves up like firewood just to pursue one case, they must be incompetent, ineffective, and frankly, unserious.",

        "description": "Hundreds of Colchester residents have been left without electricity because of roadworks on Northern Approach, a man has said",
        "content": "The mass transit system project has caused upheaval in Northern Approach Road and residents have previously complained tremors caused by the roadworks have damaged their homes. People are now saying they have been left without internet and landline access for three weeks after claims builders cut through broadband wires to a nearby cabinet in Wallace Road. The situation is compounded by the fact building contractors John Sisk and Son have fenced off a wire cabinet which BT engineers need to access to carry out the repair. After weeks without internet, broadband, and landline access, residents have now had enough, with one saying it has been “more than a nightmare”. Mr Joshi, of Hakewill Way, Colchester said: “It was reported on May 3 when builders cut through copper cables. “BT Openreach have been out but they can’t do anything because there’s a fence around the cabinet. “They might as well cut everything else off whilst they are at it.” Another resident, 31-year-old Matt Whitehead, said he logged on to start his shift on Tuesday morning only to find the internet was down. He said: “I couldn’t log on so I had to call colleagues to sort out my customers. “I called BT and they said it would be back at 3pm, then they said it would be 7pm, and then they said it would be 7pm the following day. “It was extremely inconvenient because I had to drive to my nearest office in Ipswich.” Mihaela Lazurca, 44, said her internet was seriously affected in January when her son was sitting university exams. She said: “We didn’t have internet for three to four days – it was very bad because he couldn’t submit in time.” A spokesman for John Sisk and Son said: “Although the works are statutory diversions associated with the RTS, Sisk is not responsible for the contractors undertaking the works. “We have been actively working with Openreach from the onset of the project to co-ordinate activities.” BT was contacted for comment, but did not respond at the time of going to press.",

        "content": "New Delhi: Former Team India cricketer Yuvraj Singh has sent legal notices to two Delhi-based real estate firms invoking arbitration clauses over alleged violation of his privacy rights in promotion of construction projects and for delayed delivery of possession of a dwelling unit to him, reported PTI. One notice, sent by Rizwan Law Associates on behalf of Yuvraj, has sought “adequate damages in terms of delay caused in completion of the Project and issuance of the Letter of Possession in the absence of any reasonable cause or extension in timeline.” It has further sought “delivery of proper quality, standard, class and grade of the Apartment to My Client who was promised a premium quality Apartment and has been offered an extremely inferior quality Apartment.” A member of the 2007 T20 World Cup and 2011 ODI World Cup-winning Indian teams, Yuvraj had booked a dwelling unit in 2020 at real estate firm’s project in Hauz Khas. The notices have been sent to M/s Brilliant Etoile Private Limited and M/s Uppal Housing Private Limited, pertaining to delayed possession of dwelling unit. Yuvraj’s second notice, issued to Brilliant Etoile Private Limited only, is about infringement of his privacy rights. “That this dispute principally concerns with the violation of Intellectual Property Rights with respect to the Personality Rights and misuse of Brand Value of the Celebrity i.e., My Client in contravention to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding dated 24.11.2020, however, My Client reserves the right to add the detailed instances and elaborate in further specificity in the Statement of Claim,” the notice said. According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), Yuvraj was to promote and endorse the project. However, despite the MoU expiring on November 23, 2023, Yuvraj is aggrieved by the alleged continued commercial use of the services provided by him, including use of his photographs on billboards, project site, social media posts, and articles despite the expiry of the MoU, the notice pointed out. It was in complete violation of his Copyright, Personality Rights, and Right to Publicity enshrined under the laws and protected as his Intellectual Property Rights, the notice said.

Those with only a primary education often find jobs in agriculture or are self-employed.Citing census data, the World Bank said that about 8.7 percent of Filipinos, or approximately 9.4 million, identify as indigenous and many live in geographically-disadvantaged areas.This underscores the need for interventions to reduce poverty in these regions, the World Bank said, adding that more data also needs to be collected to improve and focus such programs.\"Understanding the interplay of ethnicity, gender, and geography is crucial to comprehending the challenges faced by indigenous peoples, which are closely linked to the conditions within their geographic locations,\" Diop said.The obstacles posed by data gaps, the World Bank said, can be addressed by incorporating indigenous peoples indicators in national surveys, and including ethnicity variables in government statistics, among others.Despite these challenges, however, almost 90 percent of indigenous peoples said they were proud of their identity and over 70 percent claimed a strong sense of belonging to the country.The World Bank said that continuing to strengthen and protect the legal recognition of their rights to ancestral domains would be a further means of improving indigenous peoples' welfare.The World Bank said that while certificates of ancestral domain titles had been approved for approximately 20.5 percent of the Philippines' total land area, processing has been slow.\"For indigenous peoples, land is a fundamental aspect of their identity, culture, and subsistence,\" World Bank senior social development specialist Carlos Perez-Brito noted.\"Protecting indigenous peoples' land rights is therefore a crucial step in addressing poverty and conflict in the country.\"",

        "description": "A successful takeover of Anglo American Plc under the arrangements BHP Group has offered could lead to outflows of $4.3 billion from South Africa, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysis. The post JPMorgan Says BHP Plan Risks $4.3 Billion S. Africa Outflow appeared first on Daily Maverick.",
        "content": "Such an outflow, if a deal goes ahead, could weaken the rand, which has gained 4.4% against the dollar, the most of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, over the last five weeks.The deal, proposed by BHP and rejected by Anglo, would involve Anglo distributing its holdings in its South African iron ore and platinum units to shareholders. That, according to JPMorgan’s South African mining analyst Catherine Cunningham, would lead to developed-market investor index funds selling the unbundled stocks, resulting in the outflow. While Anglo has spurned BHP’s $49 billion bid, it has agreed to talk to the company, which must now make a firm offer by May 29. A successful deal could also affect the share prices of the units, Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., Cunningham said. “There is now a materially higher probability that BHP will reach an agreed deal,”she wrote in the May 23 note to clients. “We see downside risk to the share prices of both Amplats and Kumba.” Cunningham didn’t assess the potential impact on the rand. Read More on The Takeover Battle: BlackRock Pressed Anglo to Extend Talks With BHP, FT Reports BHP Has a Week to Convince Anglo Its South African Plan Can Work Anglo Opens Talks With BHP After Rejecting $49 Billion Offer According to her analysis, developed-market funds would sell $9.4 billion in stock and $5.1 billion would be bought by emerging-market investors, resulting in the net outflow. JPMorgan estimated the index fund holdings in Anglo American based on publicly available data. “Locals will not sell anything, developed market index funds will sell every share they receive and DM active and others will sell 90% of what they receive,” Cunningham estimated. “EM active funds will buy 50% of what’s for sale.” Amplats, which has a market value of 192 billion rand ($10.5 billion), is nearly 80% owned by Anglo American. Kumba, which has a capitalization of 170 billion rand, is almost 70% held by Anglo American. Developed-market index funds would need to sell their shares as Johannesburg-listed stocks wouldn’t fit their investment mandate. Active investors are likely to want to limit their exposure to single-commodity and -country stocks. Kumba’s mines are all in South Africa while Anglo Platinum has one small operation in Zimbabwe, with the rest in South Africa. Spinning off the companies would also add $14.2 billion to the market capitalization of the MSCI South Africa index, or about 6%, Cunningham wrote. In response to BHP’s approach Anglo rushed out its own plan to streamline its business. That would include spinning off Anglo Platinum while retaining control of Kumba.",

In a statement to mark the 2024 children’s day celebration made available to newsmen by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Nsa Gill, he quoted the Governor saying, “You are the future of our state and the pillars of our society. Your innocence, creativity, and boundless energy bring joy and hope to our lives. Our responsibility is to nurture and guide you so you can reach your full potential and contribute positively to our state’s growth and development.” Governor Otu maintained that he wants the Children to know that as the Governor, he is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for all to thrive. “My administration’s continuous investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure is to ensure children can access the best opportunities and resources. “Our State is richly endowed in agriculture, and this administration has already taken steps to make agriculture the mainstay of our economy.” The Governor, in his statement, urged the children to continue to dream big and work hard towards achieving their goals. In his words, he said, “Remember that there is no limit to what you can achieve with determination, resilience, and a positive attitude. “I also want to express my gratitude to all parents, teachers, and caregivers who play crucial roles in shaping the lives of our children. Your dedication and love are instrumental in their growth and success. “As we celebrate this year’s Children’s Day, I charge you to remember the less fortunate children in our society and strive to impact their lives positively. “Once again, I wish you all a happy Children’s Day. May you continue to be a source of joy and inspiration to us all. Keep shining bright and making us proud,” Governor Otu concluded.",

        "description": "A man from Colchester has won an award for a car he has owned for more than 25 years",
        "content": "Frank Butler, from Colchester, recently collected the Masters of the Marque award for his rare 1953 Rover P4 Pinin Farina Drophead. Mr Butler has owned the car for more than 25 years. Designed by Battista Pininfarina, the car was declared as ‘The one we would most like to steal for Great British Car Journey collection’. The prestigious award was received at the Rovers Return event held at Derbyshire’s Great British Car Journey museum. The event, honouring 120 years of Rover car production, was attended by more than 200 classic Rover owners from across the UK. Rover cars were manufactured in the UK from 1904 to 2005, becoming the nation’s largest car manufacturer before going bust. The Masters of the Marque awards are sponsored by Wera Tools UK and organised by the classic car museum. They recognise individuals who cherish their classic cars. Museum founder Richard Usher said: \"The awards follow the slightly quirky nature of the museum. \"I wanted to give classic car owners an incentive to visit us when we promote days celebrating specific British cars and I am delighted that Wera, who make a massive range of top-class tools, have decided to support the awards.\" The top winner at each event earns a year’s membership of the Great British Car Club, an engraved glass trophy, and a variety of Wera tools. Every participant receives a commemorative plaque, and the £10 entry fee per car gives the driver complimentary access to the museum and its facilities. Future Masters of the Marque events are planned until the end of the year at Great British Car Journey. Fleet enthusiasts can register for events and purchase discounted advance tickets at the museum’s website. The next event titled 'A Fiesta of Fords' will be held on June 2, following by 'Morris Minor Day' on June 9. Other upcoming events include 'Reliant Regatta' on June 23, 'MG Summer Festival' on July 14, and 'Show Your Rootes' on August 18.",

        "description": "Mike Tyson became 'nauseous and dizzy' during a Sunday flight. His team said that setback will not impact his July 20 fight with Jake Paul.",
        "content": "“Iron” Mike Tyson went a few rounds with an ulcer issue during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, but was able to answer the bell when the plane landed, according to his representatives. “Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great,” his publicist told the Daily News Monday. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” The former heavyweight champion “became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing,” but has since bounced back, his representative said. Tyson’s team knocked down reports that the 57-year-old boxer’s medical setback caused disembarking delays Sunday and blamed an unrelated “air conditioning issue” for the inconvenience. Tyson is scheduled to in Texas on July 20. His handlers said the ‘s gastrointestinal issue will have no affect on that plan. Critics have expressed concern about the bout due to the 30-year age difference between the combatants. Boxing Insider Promotions promoter Larry Goldberg said in March there’s no way he could get the New York State Athletic Commission to allow a spectacle like that to take place in New York City. “The doctors would never sign off on it,” Goldberg said. “We couldn’t even suggest something like that here.” Tyson retired from professional boxing in 2005, but in 2020 for an exhibition with fellow former champion Roy Jones Jr., which ended in a draw. His professional career included 50 wins and six losses. The Brooklyn native won 44 matches by knockout.",

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email In the ever-evolving realm of technology, businesses face the constant challenge of updating their systems and processes to stay competitive and efficient. IT project planning is pivotal in this process, supporting successful technology upgrades and implementations. The essence of a robust IT project lies in a well-crafted project management plan that ensures projects meet their goals within scope, time, and budget constraints. Understanding the scope and objectives The first step in any IT project planning is clearly defining the scope and objectives. This involves discussions with all stakeholders to align the project’s goals with the business’s strategic objectives. A clear understanding of what the project aims to achieve ensures that the planning process is targeted and effective. Setting up a strong project management plan Once the goals are set, the next crucial step is to develop a comprehensive project management plan. This plan acts as a roadmap for the project, detailing the resources, timeline, and budget. It also outlines the roles and responsibilities of each team member, ensuring everyone knows what is expected of them. The project management plan should be revisited and updated regularly to reflect any project scope or objectives changes. Integrating the right technology solutions Choosing the right technology is critical to the success of IT projects. Whether upgrading hardware, implementing new software, or adopting cloud solutions , the technology chosen should align with the business’s long-term IT strategy. Cloud solutions, in particular, offer scalable and flexible options that can significantly enhance operational efficiency and data security. Resource allocation and management Effective resource management is essential to prevent bottlenecks and ensure the project progresses without delays. This includes managing both human and technological resources. It is crucial to allocate the right people to the right tasks and ensure they have the necessary tools at their disposal. Sometimes, leveraging outsourced IT support can provide the expertise needed to handle specific aspects of the project, such as specialized software installation or cybersecurity enhancements. Risk management and mitigation No IT project is without risks. Identifying potential risks at the earliest stages of planning is critical. Once identified, the project team should develop strategies to mitigate these risks. This could involve contingency planning, risk-sharing mechanisms, or alternative strategies that can be implemented if the original plan proves untenable. Monitoring and evaluation Regular monitoring and evaluation are key to ensuring the project stays on track. This includes regular status updates, performance evaluations, and financial audits. Feedback mechanisms should also be in place to capture insights from team members and adjust plans as necessary. Effective monitoring helps in the timely detection of issues and allows for quick corrective actions. Communication and stakeholder engagement Clear and consistent communication is vital throughout the project lifecycle. Keeping all stakeholders informed about the project’s progress, challenges, and plan changes helps manage expectations and foster a collaborative environment. Stakeholder engagement is not just about sharing information but also about actively listening to feedback and suggestions. Final thoughts By leveraging services like managed IT support, companies can navigate complex challenges and seamlessly integrate technologies that enhance operational efficiencies, such as cloud-based solutions. The key to sustained progress lies in a comprehensive, well-executed IT strategy customized to meet your business’s unique demands. With a trusted IT management partner like Trinity Networx , your organization can maximize the potential of your technology investments to foster growth, drive innovation, and enhance customer satisfaction. Keeping abreast of the latest trends and best practices will ensure your IT strategies are flexible and dynamic, ready to meet future challenges and capitalize on new opportunities.

A Monte Carlo, nella zona al porto riservata alle barche di lusso, un motoscafo è improvvisamente piombato, senza controllo, su uno yacht fermo e un piccole gommone su cui, per fortuna, non c'era nessuno.

By Sarah Ewall-wice, Senior U.S. Political Reporter In New York, Ny For Dailymail.Com Published: 16:51, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:50, 27 May 2024 e-mail 134 View comments As the trial of Donald Trump over hush money payments to a porn star heads into its final stage, Trump's wife Melania Trump has been noticeably absent from the courtroom. Over the course of five weeks, a series of Trump supporters including Republican lawmakers, former administration officials, vice presidential hopefuls and a few of his own kids have been in court. They've sat through hours of salacious testimony as the ex-president stands trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment for pornstar Stormy Daniels . Melania Trump, however, has remained far away from the New York criminal court room home in Florida . Melania Trump with former President Trump as they arrive at a GOP fundraiser in Palm Beach, FL on April 6 just over a week before the hush money trial began in New York Read More Probation officers checking up on him, teaching school kids about crime and cleaning up graffiti: What Trump could face if he is convicted in New York and avoids jail Legal experts tell DailyMail.com that while it is often beneficial for a jury to see defendants with their spouse by their side in the courthouse, in this unique case it doesn't matter. 'Generally speaking, jurors pay attention to who is seated in the courtroom,' explained Anna Cominsky, Managing Attorney of New York Law School Legal Services. 'Defense attorneys usually like to have 'support' for their client evidenced by friends and family - it's something that humanizes the client. That said, this is a very different case. The jurors know that this is the former president.' Cominsky also pointed out that this particular courtroom is ' completely packed with people from both sides.' She said it makes it hard for the jury to distinguish who is there for whom. Ex-president Trump seated in the Manhattan criminal courtroom on May 21 as he stands trial on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records Berkeley Law professor John Yoo also said he did not think her absence matters much and may perhaps have a benefit to the defense. ' I could see how some jurors would ask where Melania Trump was. Perhaps her presence would show her support for Trump's story that his fling with Stormy never happened,' he added. 'But her presence would also buy into the prosecution's underhanded effort to make the trial about Stormy [Daniels], and not about whether any bookkeeping misdemeanors occurred and whether they concealed some greater crime.' Yoo argued Trump's defense team has done a good job of attacking the failure of the prosecution to prove its case on the law. He said they were smart to keep the focus on that and not alleged affairs. Cornell law professor Randy Zelin believes no one would care and 'it would look contrived anyway.' On Tuesday, both sides are set to give closing arguments before the case goes to jury for deliberations. While Melania has not traveled to New York to stand by her husband's side as he came face-to-face with Daniels or others testifying about the hush money payment , the former first lady has been spotted along side her embattled husband elsewhere. Earlier this month, the two sat side-by-side at their son Barron's high school graduation in Florida and the former first lady was seen smiling and clapping as Barron's name was called. Court in New York was recessed early for the week so the ex-president could attend. Former First Lady Melania and Trump were all smiles at the ceremony as their son Barron graduated from high school on May 17 Melania attended the Republican fundraiser hosted by billionaire John Paulson that raised more than $50 million as Trump runs for a second term in the White House The Trumps arriving to vote in Florida on March 19. When asked if she would be joining Trump on the campaign trail she responded 'stay tuned.' The former first lady has not attended any of Trump's 2024 rallies or primary election night celebrations to date Melania was also in attendance last month in a stunning purple jumpsuit for a campaign fundraiser hosted by John Paulson in Florida where the ex-president raised more than $50 million for his presidential bid. The former first lady jumped back into politics to speak at a fundraiser for the pro-conservative LGBT organization Log Cabin Republicans last month. But she has not hit the campaign trail for her husband as he holds rallies in battleground states across the country or celebrated his primary nights in early contest states. When asked if she would be joining him on the campaign trail in March while joining her husband to cast ballots in the Florida GOP primary, Melania responded 'stay tuned.' DailyMail.com has inquired with the Trump campaign about any future plans for Melania to hit the campaign trail. While Melania has not been spotted in court, both of Trump's older sons Don Jr. and Eric and his daughter-in-law Lara Trump have been in attendance for some of the many hours of testimony. His sons could be seen arriving and leaving the court with their father's large entourage and sitting a few rows behind him in the courtroom. His adult daughters Ivanka and Tiffany Trump's names have come up in the testimony during the hush money trial, but they have not appeared in the courtroom to support their dad. Both live in Florida. Trump's son Eric and daughter-in-law Lara Trump returning to the courtroom from a break in the hush money trial on May 14 Eric Trump has been a regular in the Manhattan criminal courtroom to support his father. Here he is returning to court behind the former president and lawyer Todd Blanche on May 6 Don Jr. looking on in the Manhattan criminal court as his father speaks before the media on May 21 Don Trump Jr. speaking in support of is father with other Trump supporters outside the Manhattan criminal court on May 21 Even without Melania's support in the courtroom, her name has surfaced across testimony from multiple witnesses. During her days of lurid testimony, Daniels recalled Trump telling her in 2006 before their alleged sexual encounter that Trump told her the couple slept in separate bedrooms . Michael Cohen claimed Trump was not worried about Melania leaving him over the Daniels affair story and even claimed the then presidential candidate said 'how long do you think I'll be on the market for?' But other witnesses painted a picture of a very different relationship between the former first couple during testimony.

She also testified about observing Trump and Melania's 'special' relationship up close Trump and Melania departing the White House to board Marine One a last time in January 2021 Trump's White House executive assistant said during her tearful testimony that Donald and Melania had a 'special' relationship. Madeleine Westerhout told the court she believed they had a relationship of mutual respect and Trump cared a lot about Melania's opinion. 'There was no one else who could put him in his place,' Westerhout testified. She also recalled Melania texting her asking when Trump would be coming up for dinner while they were in the White House and Trump calling Melania from the Oval Office while he was president to chat.

The three-member panel of justices, headed by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, held that the petition was bereft of substance and accordingly dismissed it. The tribunal held that the petitioners – the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and its candidate, Murtala Ajaka – failed to prove the allegations of over-voting and non-compliance with the Electoral Act 2022 in the petition. The panel, in a unanimous decision, held that all the witness evidence filed before it were incompetent and full of inconsistencies. It also agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the allegations of forgery raised in the petition were pre-election matter, which ought to have been raised 14 days after the documents were submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Kogi had on 11 November 2023 held its off-cycle election in which Mr Ododo of the APC emerged winner, beating his closest rival, Mr Ajaka of the SDP with a wide margin. Mr Ajaka, dissatisfied with the outcome of the election, filed a petition before the tribunal, challenging Mr Ododo’s victory. The case, which commenced in December 2023, came to its highest point on 13 May when SDP, Mr Ajaka, APC, Mr Ododo and INEC adopted their final written addresses, after which the tribunal reserved judgment in the petition.

Game 7, if necessary, will also be in Glens Falls on Wednesday. Adirondack looked lackluster, suffering back-to-back shutouts, in Games 3 and 4 in Florida last week, but rebounded to bring the series back home with a 4-2, Game 5 victory on Saturday. Ryan Smith scored what proved to be the game-winner at 5:19 of the third period from inside the right circle. The goal, his ninth of the playoffs, came off a well-placed pass from defenseman Darian Skeoch behind the right side of the net. Zach Walker also collected a helper on the play. Meanwhile, goaltender Jeremy Brodeur, making his first start of the series, stopped 35 shots to earn the win and keep Adirondack’s quest for a Kelly Cup championship alive. The Thunder jumped out to an early, 2-0, lead on first-period goals by Filip Engaras and Erik Middendorf. Engaras beat Everblades netminder Cam Johnson with a snapshot from the top of the left circle for a 1-0 advantage. Defenseman Will MacKinnon was credited with the lone assist on Engaras’s fifth goal of the playoffs. Middendorf made it 2-0 with 4:27 left in the first stanza on a wrister from the bottom of the right circle. Skating from behind the net to the bottom of the circle, he turned and fired a shot over Johnson’s left shoulder. Jackson van de Leest and Connor Blake were credited with assists. But the second period was all Florida’s as they outshot the Thunder, 19-6, and knotted the score at two goals apiece. Riese Zmolek beat Brodeur with a wrister from the hash marks at 16:31 of the frame and Cole Moberg scored on a power play with just 1:28 left in the period. Adirondack regained the lead on Smith’s goal, but the outcome was far from determined with almost 15 minutes left to play. With two minutes left on the clock, Thunder forward Ryan Wheeler went to the penalty box on a somewhat controversial call, for delay of game. The puck went above the glass but replays showed that a Florida player lifted Wheeler’s stick. Yet the call stood and the Everblades pulled Johnson in favor of an extra attacker, giving them a 6-on-4 power play. Tristan Ashbrook sealed the outcome by firing a shot into Florida’s empty net after winning a face-off at center ice. The goal was Ashbrook’s eighth of the postseason, shorthanded and unassisted. Ashbrook’s 15 points are the fifth-most among all ECHL playoff performers. Toledo’s Riley Sawchuk tops the leaderboard with 17.",

        "description": "Israel says it will investigate unexpected death toll; officials in France, Germany, EU call for ceasefire",
        "content": "-- Shares Facebook Twitter Reddit Email An Israeli strike on a camp near Rafah that had been designated as a \"safe zone\" for displaced Palestinian civilians killed at least 45 people on Sunday and injured more than 200 others, according to multiple media reports and the Gaza Health Ministry. CNN reported that video apparently shot at the Tal al-Sultan camp showed \"scenes of horror: charred bodies being pulled from rubble, a man holding the headless body of a child, fire raging from tents in the background.\" Reaction from around the world included many expressions of outrage, with the EU's foreign policy chief, the German foreign minister and French President Emmanuel Macron all calling for an immediate ceasefire. By Monday morning, the Israel Defense Forces announced it would launch an investigation into the \"circumstances of the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike,\" under the auspices of a semi-independent fact-finding body. Israeli officials initially stated that the attack had killed two senior Hamas commanders, and had not been expected to cause significant civilian casualties. On Friday, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its military operation in Rafah. On Monday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock described the ICJ's rulings as \"binding,\" adding, \"of course they have to be followed.\" Speaking before a special meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Baerbock continued, “We are currently experiencing the opposite. ... At the same time we see that it is no gain for Israel's security, that no hostage will be freed when right now people are being burned in tents. International humanitarian law applies to everyone, including Israeli warfare.\" This may represent a significant change in tone. For obvious historical reasons, Germany has long been Israel's closest European ally. At the same Brussels conference, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell criticized Israel for continuing \"the military action that it has been asked to stop,” adding that it was \"completely unacceptable\" for Israeli officials to accuse the International Criminal Court or the ICJ of antisemitism. Macron, who has held a series of talks in Paris aimed at resolving the Gaza conflict, said Monday that he was \"outraged\" by reports of the devastating strike on the Rafah camp. \"I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,\" the French president concluded.

        "content": "The cost of living will remain the Government’s “focus” in this year’s Budget, Simon Harris has promised. Inflation shot up after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and averaged out at 8% in 2022. It began to slowly fall in 2023 and is forecast to drop further to 1.9% this year . Despite this, the Taoiseach said he is aware that “people are still hurting” and pledged to keep this in mind during budget negotiations. “Cost of living increases have left [people] feeling that their personal finances are somewhat insecure and, indeed, a real worry that they might not withstand any further shocks,” Mr Harris said. “Therefore, I believe that recognising the existence of cost of living pressures must once again be the focus as we plan for the next budget, building on previous measures over the last number of years.” Out on the streets of Dublin, a lot of people were keen to talk about how difficult it is to get by in the current economic climate. “Today I had to dip into my savings,” one woman in Dublin told Newstalk. “My savings actually consisted of €20, so now I’m down to my last €6 I would say and that was for lunch. “I would say we’re very much still in a cost of living crisis . “A lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck, rent is getting higher, everything is increasing and even though the minimum wage has gone up, you’re just on par with what it was before. “So, I don’t really think I’ve seen any improvement.” One man said he felt the cost of living crisis was far from over. “Being a student, it’s well documented how we get affected by this kind of thing,” he said. “I’m on placement in Dublin at the moment and I’m living with my uncle and I went through three years of college living with my Grandad. “If I didn’t have that availability there, I don’t know if I’d be able to see out the three and a bit years of college.” Speaking on The Hard Shoulder , DCU Economics Professor Edgar Morgenroth said wages have yet to catch up with the galloping inflation of the past two years and so so “on average people are worse off”. “There are some sectors, some groups in the economy that seem to have higher wage increases but most definitely down relative to inflation,” he said. “So, yes people are in real terms worse off than they were.” Professor Morgenroth said the poorest in society always suffer “much much more” when inflation is high and urged the Government to consider this when drawing up budget measures. “If we are going to support people, I would argue that we should support those that are actually most affected and that would be those on lower incomes,” he said.

        "description": "Manchester United defensive midfielder Sofyan Amrabat may be handed the opportunity to stay at Old Trafford",
        "content": "star Sofyan Amrabat could be handed the chance to extend his Old Trafford stay after being 'criminally underused' during his loan spell from , but transfer insider has told GIVEMESPORT that boss Erik ten Hag's potential sacking will play a pivotal role in deciding the defensive midfielder's future. The Dutch tactician as he led the Red Devils to FA Cup glory thanks to sealing a 2-1 win over rivals Manchester City - courtesy of goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo - at Wembley last weekend. Although INEOS chief executive Sir Jim Ratcliffe and other board members were when an end-of-season review got underway on Monday, plans have also been put in place for the fast-approaching summer transfer window. , according to transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, and the Red Devils have also stopped short of holding discussions with Fiorentina over whether they want to take advantage of the option to turn the loan deal into a permanent agreement. Writing in his Daily Briefing for CaughtOffside, the Italian journalist suggests that the managerial situation at Old Trafford will dictate whether the Morocco international - who victory - is kept in his current surroundings heading into the 2024/25 campaign. In the aftermath of being handed a start under the Wembley arch in Casemiro's absence, as talks are set to take place behind the scenes, while he also hinted that his wish is to become a permanent member of the squad. Sofyan Amrabat's statistical averages per 90 minutes this season compared to Casemiro Sofyan Amrabat Casemiro Pass completion percentage 87.0 81.8 Percentage of dribblers tackled 54.8 48.1 Progressive passes 6.35 5.09 Passes into the final third 5.96 5.64 Interceptions 0.77 0.77 at Old Trafford, having agreed the fee during initial negotiations with his parent club in September, meaning they would part with in the region of £30million in total after also shaking hands on an £8.5million loan fee. Sofyan Amrabat made two tackles, registered as many clearances and blocked one shot during Manchester United's FA Cup final win over Manchester City Jones believes that ten Hag has been guilty of refusing to give Amrabat enough game time to demonstrate his capabilities, which could come back to haunt the former Ajax head coach as he fights to save his job during internal discussions led by co-owner Ratcliffe over the course of the coming days. The respected journalist is adamant that the ex-Utrecht man's performance in the FA Cup final highlighted that he has the talent to adjust to the rigours of the Premier League, and it would not come as a shock if the Red Devils opt to take advantage of the buy option written into his loan deal should a change be made in the dugout. Jones told GIVEMESPORT: \"Sofyan Amrabat has been criminally underused when you consider the flaws that Manchester United have had in their side this season. \"That FA Cup final performance was evidence of what he is capable of, and to leave it until the last day to shine through like that might be one of the things that reflects badly on Erik ten Hag in his review. \"Why was he only starting 10 Premier League games in a season when they really struggled to find a good performer in his position? \"He is definitely Premier League standard and, if ten Hag does leave Manchester United, it would not be a surprise to see Amrabat targeted for another season at Old Trafford.\" Amrabat could be handed a Premier League lifeline even if Manchester United eventually opt against keeping him among their options heading into next season as, according to The Sun, domestic rivals after putting plans in place for the summer. The report suggests that both London clubs have been put on red alert due to the Old Trafford loanee's potential availability and, ahead of , the Eagles and Cottagers sent scouts to watch him in action during the closing stages of the campaign. GMS sources recently revealed that following the expiry of his loan spell, which would have given Crystal Palace and Fulham hope of striking a deal, but an upturn in form has led to the hierarchy contemplating making a U-turn.",

        "description": "Manchester City winger Jack Grealish has plenty of uncertainty surrounding whether he features in Pep Guardiola's long-term plans",
        "content": "star Jack Grealish's future at the Etihad Stadium is 'in some doubt’ after an underwhelming year under Pep Guardiola, transfer insider has told GIVEMESPORT. The 28-year-old, who in 2021, only for the champions this season and faces an uncertain future in his current surroundings. After an FA Cup final loss against Manchester United, from a disappointing year that saw new signing Jeremy Doku leapfrog the England international in the pecking order. In 36 appearances for the title holders this season, , averaging a successful contribution every 353 minutes. Grealish's hopes of making an impact on the international stage increased when he was boss Greath Southgate earlier this month, but he is heading into the transfer window with uncertainty over his long-term future at club level. However, Jones believes that there are doubts over the 28-year-old’s inclusion in the final list, while his days at Manchester City could be numbered. The respected journalist told GIVEMESPORT: \"This is a significant period for Grealish because suddenly he is coming under scrutiny. He was an unused substitute in the FA Cup final for Manchester City and soon we will find out if he makes the cut for England and is on the plane to Germany or not. “I think that position is in some doubt, and I also think we are getting to the stage where his Manchester City future is in some doubt and I wonder how Pep Guardiola is viewing him.” In what could be an eventful summer for the winger, and reuniting him with his England compatriot Harry Kane at the Allianz Arena. Jack Grealish Stats (2023-24) Competition Games Goals Assists Premier League 20 3 1 Champions League 8 0 2 FA Cup 3 0 0 EFL Cup 1 0 0 According to the Sun, Bayern’s next manager Vincent Kompany is a fan of the Man City star and would like him to reignite his career in the Bundesliga. Grealish could seek inspiration from Jadon Sancho’s recent example. The Manchester United winger was left out in the cold by Erik ten Hag, but a return to Borussia Dortmund proved to be a success as the team reached the Champions League final. However, Jones suggests any move away from the Etihad Stadium would feel like a step down for Grealish: “He is not easy to go and sign for any other club because he was a £100million signing. “But, at this stage, I think he has done well enough at Manchester City that he can consider the transfer a success. “With the rumours about Pep Guardiola leaving, I suspect he will aim to stay and see this through as wherever he goes from this club is going to feel like a step down, and he now has very high expectations for what he will win and achieve through his career.\" According to MailOnline, Manchester City are likely to have a new manager as soon as next summer, as . With Grealish’s future in doubt, the Spanish tactician's decision could be key to the winger’s Sky Blues career. The England international still has three years left on his current deal, expiring in 2027.",

        "description": "Chelsea are looking to up the ante in their bid to identify the ideal successor to Mauricio Pochettino",
        "content": "are closing in on a move to appoint boss Enzo Maresca as their new manager, and journalist has told GIVEMESPORT that the Italian tactician could head into the Stamford Bridge hot-seat in the coming days as co-owner Todd Boehly is keen to oversee a 'fast-moving process'. Mauricio Pochettino only took charge of the Blues 12 months ago, but a sixth-placed finish did not meet expectations. Despite a positive run at the end of the Premier League campaign, it was announced last week . With the likes of Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Cole Palmer among the playing squad at Chelsea, aspirations are high for what is a young and promising squad of players. There have already been glimpses of potential as the team went on a run all the way to the Carabao Cup final before they were narrowly defeated by Liverpool. Maresca has now emerged as the standout candidate to take charge at Stamford Bridge, according to Jacobs. Chelsea are said to be in direct contact with Leicester, who won the Championship and clinched promotion during the 2023/24 campaign, with things expected to progress quickly. The journalist told GIVEMESPORT: “Chelsea are advancing on Enzo Maresca after positive discussions over the last 24 hours. They are now in direct contact with Leicester and are looking to advance things. “At this stage, Maresca can be termed the favourite in what is expected to be a fast-moving process.” Maresca’s previous experience includes a role as the manager of Manchester City’s Elite Development Squad. In 2021, he was then tasked with guiding Serie B side Parma to promotion, but he failed to do so and returned to England to join Pep Guardiola’s senior coaching staff at the Etihad Stadium. His second attempt at senior management proved far more fruitful as he took charge of a relegated Leicester side in June last year. It was a brief spell in the Championship for the Foxes as Maresca, who , guided them to a title-winning and promotion-clinching season in the 2023/24 campaign. Ipswich Town boss Kieran McKenna has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs this summer after guiding his club to back-to-back promotions from League One and the Championship in the last two years. The Tractor Boys finished just a single point behind Maresca’s Leicester as they secured a return to the top fight for the first time in 22 years. McKenna’s impressive rise has earned him suitors at Brighton & Hove Albion, Manchester United and Chelsea in recent times. However, Jacobs has shared that the London club are no longer pursuing the 38-year-old as they close in on Maresca. Jacobs also told GIVEMESPORT: “Yesterday, Kieran McKenna was ruled out. Chelsea called him directly to let him know, which was done out of respect. It shows how highly Chelsea think of McKenna.”",

        "description": "Zverev defeated Rafael Nadal in the first round of the French Open.",
        "content": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline German tennis star Alexander Zverev defeated Spanish legend Rafael Nadal in the first round of the French Open on Monday, moving on to the second round at Rolland Garros, though in just days, the German star’s appeal of assault allegations will head to trial. Alexander Zverev defeated all-time great Rafael Nadal in the first round of the French Open. Key Facts The six-foot-six Zverev, 27, is the fourth-ranked men’s singles tennis player and considered one of the favorites in the tournament. Zverev defeated 37-year-old Nadal in a highly anticipated first-round match Monday morning, taking the match in three sets over 14-time French Open champion Nadal, who has struggled to return from injuries and ranked only No. 276. Off the court, the 27-year-old’s career has become marked by scandal: Zverev was accused in an October 2023 lawsuit of “physically abusing and damaging the health” of a woman during a May 2020 argument in Berlin, according to the suit filed in Germany. That woman was later identified as his former girlfriend Brenda Patea, a model and the mother of Zverev’s daughter, and Zverev has denied the allegations. Later in October, a German criminal court fined Zverev $488,000 (450,000 Euro) over the charges (public prosecutors in German courts can seek penalty orders when there is compelling evidence that does not necessitate a trial, The Athletic and The Guardian reported). Zverev appealed the order, bringing the challenge to trial in Berlin court, calling it “completely bulls**t” with his lawyers slamming it as “scandalous.” Patea has since gone public about the allegations, telling German magazine Suddeutsche Zeitung in November that Zverev pushed her against a wall and proceeded to choke her. Zverev’s trial in Berlin is slated to start on May 31, putting it in the middle of the French Open, though he will not be required to appear in person at court, at least at first, the BBC reported, though he could still “theoretically” be asked to attend later in the trial, a court spokesperson said. The trial is expected to last eight non-consecutive days that could take proceedings into mid-July, ESPN reported.

Tangent This assault case follows previous abuse allegations against Zverev from his former girlfriend Olya Sharypova, who accused the German star of punching her in the face and covering her face with a pillow, leaving her “scared for [her] Chief Critics In the wake of the allegations, Zverev faced public criticism after he was elected to an ATP advisory council in January. U.S. tennis star Sloane Stephens told reporters at the time a women’s star facing similar charges would not have been elected to the WTA player council, while Iga Swiatek, the No. 1 women’s player, told reporters “it’s not good when a player who’s facing charges like that is kind of being promoted.” Surprising Fact Zverev starred in an episode of Netflix’ since-canceled docuseries “ Break Point ” last year dedicated to his recovery from an ankle ligament tear and a surgery that sidelined the German star for months. Controversially, the episode never mentioned the allegations against Zverev. The show was canceled in March. Contra Nadal, regarded as one of the best tennis players of all time, has 92 singles titles to his name and holds the record as the winningest player in men’s singles competition at the French Open, though this year he entered the tournament unseeded following a string of injuries that kept him sidelined for months. He last won the French Open in 2022, defeating Zverev in the semifinals, when Zverev stumbled and injured his ankle so badly he left the court in a wheelchair and was sidelined from the sport for months. What To Watch For Zverev’s next match is scheduled for Wednesday against the winner of the first-round match between Germany’s David Goffin and France’s Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard. Big Number Over $2.6 million. That’s how much the winner of the men’s singles competition at the French Open will take home as a grand prize (roughly 2.4 million Euros). Key Background Zverev broke onto the international tennis scene as a 20-year-old in 2017, defeating three-time French Open winner Novak Djokovic at the 2017 Italian Open and Swiss star Roger Federer at the Rogers Cup that same year. In 2018, he was named on Forbes Europe’s 30 Under 30 in Entertainment, along with artist Dua Lipa, actress Millie Bobby Brown and actor Daniel Kaluuya. Zverev has since won gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but has not yet won a grand slam singles title. Further Reading Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions",

        "content": "Archaeologists make gruesome new discovery about first English settlers in North America READ MORE: Jamestown's original four colonial leaders discovered By Nikki Main Science Reporter For Dailymail.Com Published: 15:55, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:35, 27 May 2024 e-mail 11 shares 213 View comments The first English settlers to arrive in North America ate dogs to survive an extreme period of starvation, according to a gruesome new study. Researchers at the University of Iowa discovered the remains of 16 indigenous dogs at an archaeological site in Jamestown , Virginia , that strongly suggest the 17th Century settlers ate at least six canines. Their remains showed hallmark signs that the colonists had skinned the animals, dismembered their limbs and removed the flesh from their bones between 1609 and 1617 AD, the team said. The events occurred during the 'Starving Time', when food shortages, fractured leadership, disease and violence with the Indigenous tribes wiped out the Jamestown community. Archaeologists found the remains of 16 Indigenous dogs and confirmed that English settlers killed them for food in the early 17th Century. The canines were found in the Jamestown, Virginia settlement Archaeologists excavated roughly an acre of land within the boundaries of the James Fort. They recovered 181 canine bones from trash deposits in a former workshop, two wells and within a construction trench for the fort's defense walls. The 'butchered dog remains... unquestionably date to Jamestown's Starving Time during the winter of 1609–1610, indicating that Indigenous dogs were eaten during this period of severe famine,' the study said. Archaeologists said the practice was not uncommon at the time. 'Although the consumption of dog flesh in modern Western societies is considered taboo, there is a long history of eating dogs during periods of stress in England and other parts of Europe ,' they wrote. The Starvation Period killed 80 to 90 percent of the English colonists because of food shortages, contaminated water supply and a harsh winter. Archaeologists found 181 canine bones belonging to 16 dogs, and said that at least six had been eaten by English settlers between 1609 and 1617 Jamestown's checkered past Church burnings, cannibalism and slavery By the spring of 1610, only about 60 of the original colonists were still alive and George Percy - one of the original settlers - authored an account of what occurred in the wake of the starvation period. 'Now all of us at James Town, beginning to feel that sharp prick of hunger which no man truly describe but he which has tasted the bitterness thereof. '... Then having fed upon horses and other beasts as long as they lasted, we were glad to make shift with vermin as dogs, cats, rats, and mice,' Percy wrote in excerpts of his account called 'Starving Time,' archived by the National Humanities Center . He added that the settlers turned to cannibalism as a means to survive and dug up 'dead corpses out of graves and to eat them, and some have licked up the blood which has fallen from their weak fellows.' The archaeologists reported that the dogs' DNA was of Native American ancestry, sharing similarities with the Hopewellian, Mississippi and Late Woodland period dogs from eastern North America. This signified the social issues that arose between the colonizers and Indigenous communities, according to the study. It 'suggest(s) complex forces at play before, during, and after the Starving Time that influenced the presence of these dogs in the fort and led the residents of Jamestown to consume dogs with Indigenous ancestry,' the study said.

        "content": "KOLKATA: Rabindra Sarobar as well as all the parks and lakes maintained by the Kolkata metropolitan development authority (KMDA) which were shut from 3pm on Sunday due to cyclone 'Remal' will remain closed till 8pm on Tuesday until further orders due to the inclement weather and disruptions that have occurred by felling of trees. The lake and parks were supposed to open from 3pm on Monday. All the clubs at Rabindra sarobar have also been instructed by KMDA to keep shut till 12 noon on Tuesday and rowing activity in the lake will be allowed only after the authorities conduct an inspection. \"Rowing activity in Rabindra sarobar will commence only after a joint inspection by KMDA and police,\" said an official. The decision to further keep the lakes and parks closed till Tuesday night was taken after KMDA officials went to inspect the condition of Rabindra sarobar on Monday afternoon. \"At least eight to nine full grown trees fell and branches of many trees continued to fall in many places inside the lake premises. We would try to replant the trees as much as possible depending on whether the trees are retrievable or not,\" said a KMDA official. The authorities cleared the trees on Monday and kept aside for replantation if found to be suitable. \"We are receiving many requests from NGOs for replantation of the trees. We are allowing them to replant the trees by themselves if they want to after the weather condition improves,\" an official said.",

I’m a woman of 37 and I’m the oldest of three with a brother and sister. I get along well with my sister and my mum but my brother is something else. He’s 34, single and still lives at home. He’s always been better at things than I am. He was better at sports and did better in his exams than I did. I always felt a letdown in comparison. Dad is 59 and is always making comments about my weight. I’ve become heavier since I had my two kids. My brother drinks a lot and he’s got a beer belly but Dad says nothing about him. At a barbecue last weekend it was my birthday, and my brother gave me bathroom scales as a gift. My dad and brother laughed their heads off when they could see how embarrassed I was.

It was a cruel jibe and they are behaving more like school bullies than the men in your life who should look out for you. When you have a quiet moment, tell your father that you felt hurt and humiliated and it makes you not want to socialise with him or your brother.

        "content": "Days after skirmishing with Destiny’s Child alum Kelly Rowland on the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival , a security officer was scorned by the internet for her treatment of a K-pop star—marking her third uncomfortable run-in with a celebrity so far. Rowland went viral for pointing her finger at the guard during their encounter last week. She later explained that she felt she had been mistreated and shooed off the red carpet because of her race. “The woman knows what happened. I know what happened,” Rowland said. “I have a boundary, and I stand by those boundaries. And that is it.” “There were other women that attended the carpet who did not quite look like me, and they didn’t get scolded or pushed off or told to get off,” she added. “And I stood my ground, and she felt like she had to stand hers. But I stood my ground, and that was it.” Soon after, the same security guard, who has not been identified by name, visibly irritated Dominican actress Massiel Taveras, seemingly by trying to move her forward along the carpet. Taveras reacted by pushing the guard away. Then, over the weekend, the guard put up an arm and blocked K-pop star turned actress Yoona, who had turned to greet her fans. The incident was somewhat less dramatic, as Yoona did not react visibly, but still attracted negative attention for the guard’s rough tactics, and because all three celebrities she tussled with are women of color.",

        "content": "New Delhi, May 27 (PTI) A court here on Monday rejected the bail plea of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's close aide Bibhav Kumar and said there appeared no \"pre-meditation\" by AAP MP Swati Maliwal in lodging the FIR and that her allegations could not be \"swiped away.\" The court underlined that as injuries were apparent four days after the alleged incident in the medico-legal case (MLC), the delay in lodging the FIR was not of much impact on the case. Additional Sessions Judge Sushil Anuj Tyagi was hearing the bail plea of Kumar, who is accused of assaulting Rajya Sabha MP Maliwal in the CM house on May 13. \"The allegations raised by the victim have to be taken on their face value and cannot be swiped away. The mere delay in registering the FIR would not have much impact on the case as the injuries are apparent in the MLC after four days,\" the judge said. \"There seems to be no pre-meditation on the part of the victim as if it would have been so, then the FIR would have been registered on the same day,\" he added. The FIR was registered on May 16 under various Indian Penal Code provisions, including criminal intimidation, assault or criminal force on a woman with the intent to disrobe and attempt to commit culpable homicide. The court said that the investigation was still at the nascent stage and the apprehension of influencing the witnesses or tampering with the evidence could not be ruled out. \"Keeping in view the allegations made against the applicant (Kumar) at this stage, no ground for bail is made out,\" it said dismissing the bail plea. Noting Maliwal's allegations about being \"abused and brutally assaulted on her vital parts including chest, abdomen and pelvis area\" by Kumar, the court said her version in the complaint was corroborated by the MLC and her statement before the magistrate. According to the investigating officer (IO), Kumar, who was not cooperating in the investigation, was arrested to prevent tampering with \"crucial evidence\", it added. \"The victim is a sitting Member of Parliament from Aam Aadmi Party and as per her allegations, she has been brutally beaten up and her modesty has been outraged at the CM's house by the applicant,\" the court said. Kumar was present at the CM's residence despite his termination as the personal secretary, it added. \"The investigating agency has also reported that the applicant has formatted his mobile phone and has not provided the password for opening his mobile phone. The CCTV footage collected from the Hon'ble CM's camp office is stated to be blank at the relevant time and period,\" the court said. Kumar is at present in jail and he is expected to be produced before a magisterial court on Tuesday after the expiry of his four days judicial custody. Kumar was arrested on May 18. He was sent to five days police custody the same day by a magisterial court, which observed that his anticipatory bail plea had become infructuous because of his arrest. Last Friday, he was sent to four days judicial custody.",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria ASUU kicks against student education loan, calls for intervention in tertiary institutions Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News ASUU kicks against student education loan, calls for intervention in tertiary institutions Published on May 27, 2024 By Lovina Anthony The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Calabar Zone, has vehemently opposed the proposed Student Education Loan of the Federal Government. It described the loan as not only “strangulating” but has the capacity of subjecting the benefiting students to slavery, perpetual debt, depression and eventual suicide. Addressing a press conference in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State capital on Monday, the Zonal Cordinator of ASUU, Happiness Uduk flanked by all the Chapter Chairmen of the zone said it was disheartening that the people who attended schools on scholarship, enjoyed meal subsidies, bursary awards among others were the ones making some of these obnoxious policies saying that the union would not relent in opposing such policies. Uduk in a statement jointly signed by the eight union Chairpersons reasoned that instead of giving loans for students education; FG could use the money for interventions in higher institutions saying that such would bring about positive turnaround of events that would make the institutions self reliant with highly subsidized tertiary education in the country. According to her, “It is disheartening that people who attended schools on scholarship, enjoyed meal subsidies, free laundry services and bursary awards are the same running our economy today. Their Children are on scholarship in the best foreign universities in the world but after siphoning our economy, they turn around to impose a strangulating Education Loan in tax payers’ children so that they will be enslaved and remain indebted to the country forever. They do not mind the devastating effect of this scheme on the country, such as depression, suicide, and collosal loss of intellectuals. “To this end, we vehemently condemn the idea of Education Loan and state clearly that using the money for intervention in higher Institutions will be about a positive turn-around of events that will make our institutions self reliant on highly subsidized tertiary education in Nigeria.” The union also called on the federal government to come to a renegotiation table and reconvene a committee to review the agreement reached by ASUU leadership and Prof. Nimi Brigs-led Government committee with the view of adjusting the document according to the current economic realities so as to have acceptable salary structure for university lecturers. The union also condemned the indiscriminate proliferations of universities in Nigeria without adequate funding by both the Federal and state governments, noting that 2020 ASUU-FGN Memorandum of Action (MoA), which stressed the need to review the NUC Act to make it more potent in arresting the reckless and excessive establishment of universities, should be fully implemented. “We urge the President Tinubu-led administration to refrain from further proliferation of universities and rather consolidate on the already existing ones. What we need are universities that are adequately equipped and empowered to address the challenges confronting Nigeria, not glorified schools,” the statement added. On the ongoing minimum wage negotiation, the ASUU Calabar Zone urged FG to immediately deploy the instrumentality of collective bargaining to conclude the social dialogue, saying that such would lessen the invasive decline in the socio-economic lives of Nigerians. It further urged federal, state and local governments to take a critical look at all unworkable policies and programmes sponsored by international money lenders such as the World Bank and IMF with a view to reclaiming the country’s sovereignty and restoring the confidence of Nigerians. The union, however, advised governments and her agencies to read the Act establishing universities and stop interfering and threatening the autonomy of the universities, especially in terms of policy, academic planning and administration, even as it advised that suspended members in Ebonyi State University be recalled in obedience to the declarations and orders of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria. It added that outstanding salaries of academics in all institutions should be paid without further delay, noting that failure to accede to their demands would make them embark on industrial action, even as it regretted that it resorted to strike to press home its demands as that was the only language the government understood.

        "content": "Glamorous doctor 'faked cancer diagnosis to scam friend out of $160,000' Monica Kehar allegedly defrauded her medical colleague out of thousands She claimed she had cancer and needed money to foot her housing bills READ MORE: 'Fake' California doctor treated thousands of patients By Mackenzie Tatananni For Dailymail.Com Published: 16:37, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:23, 27 May 2024 e-mail 5 View comments A glamorous Canadian doctor has been banned from practicing medicine and shamed by friends who say she scammed them out of $160,000 with a fake cancer diagnosis. Monica Kehar is accused of fabricating the illness to bilk friend Dr. Meaghan Labine out of the money before vanishing. The pair met in 2018 when both were chosen to sit on the national body representing the College of Family Physicians of Canada . Labine says Kehar preyed on her conscience, asking her for the money after lying about a breast cancer diagnosis and claiming she was struggling to afford housing for a residency program in Calgary. 'It just seemed like no matter how much I lent, it was never enough,' Labine told CBC News . Monica Kehar is accused of scamming a fellow doctor out over $160,000 CAD after faking a cancer diagnosis and asking for money Labine plied Kehar with contracts that she signed, promising to repay her, but the requests didn't stop. 'I felt absolutely humiliated,' Labine told the publication. 'How could I be so stupid as to be led on like this?' She would later learn that Kehar had not only lied about the illness, but had not been accepted into a residency program in Calgary, either. In fact, Kehar was expelled from her medical program following a series of infractions that culminated with the fabrication of a medical condition. On November 13, 2020, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba Investigation Committee censured Kehar 'as a record of its disapproval of her conduct.' According to documents reviewed by DailyMail.com, Kehar registered with the College and enrolled as a first-year family medicine resident at the University of Manitoba in February 2019. Kehar was expelled from a program in Manitoba following a series of infractions that culminated with the alteration of documents and the fabrication of a serious medical condition The College later learned that Kehar defrauded 'substantial sums of money' from two medical colleagues after lying about the state of her health 'to garner sympathy and support.' However, she began participating in an elective in Saskatchewan without the proper license. Kehar would later claim that this slip-up was 'inadvertent.' After she was alerted to the problem, Kehar immediately stopped practicing and altered an email she had received from the College before forwarding it to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan. 'This was an apparent attempt by Ms Kehar to remedy the situation and to deflect responsibility for this error from herself onto the College,' the document reads. The College discovered the alteration on February 14, 2019 and reported to the University of Manitoba the same day. The finding prompted both the College and University to conduct months-long investigations into Kehar’s behavior. She denied altering the email, but was placed on paid leave of absence pending further review. Meaghan Labine says she has yet to be paid back despite winning a default judgement against Kehar in 2022. Kehar has a lengthy history of lying, as evidenced by documents from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Manitoba Investigation Committee Kehar later contacted administrators, claiming 'she had received an email from another person who confessed to hacking her account and altering the February 13, 2019 email.' Around March 13, Kehar was allowed to return to her resident duties, and around two days later, the University provided her with a report showing there was no evidence to support the hacking claims. Kehar ultimately took responsibility for altering the document, blaming 'a brief episode of mental exhaustion.' She claimed the decision had arisen from 'fear, stress, exhaustion and nervousness.' Also in 2019, Kehar had her French bulldog, Django, registered as an 'emotional support dog' for 'stress related' reasons in Alberta, documents reviewed by DailyMail.com show. She later admitted that she had altered the offending email, and was expelled from the University of Manitoba's Family Medicine Program on May 7. 'Her expulsion was based on her admission to having altered the e-mail in question, and the Faculty's finding that Ms Kehar had been dishonest in relation to certain other academic events, which she denied,' the document states. Just weeks later, Kehar appealed her expulsion to the University's Local Discipline Committee. In the appeal, she 'described a concern that she might have had a serious health condition... and that she underwent a surgical procedure to address the concern in January of 2019.' The document quotes her as saying, 'Though I am not comfortable discussing this issue, I now understand that it is relevant to this matter and had an impact on me and my actions during this time.' On May 28, seven days after filing the appeal, Kehar was interviewed by the College Investigator. She described 'going through a very difficult time' beginning at the end of 2018 and 'feeling extremely stressed at the time.' Following her expulsion from a residency program at the University of Manitoba, Kehar opened up an electrical muscle stimulation clinic in Surrey, British Columbia Kehar also insisted that she had undergone surgery on January 8, but failed to provide documentation. The appeal of Kehar’s expulsion was heard and dismissed that June - but she filed again in July. In August, Kehar provided the College with a letter purportedly written by the office manager of her surgeon's clinic as proof of the aforementioned surgical procedure. Her lawyers claimed that there was no documentation from the hospital because Kehar 'did not stay overnight.' Subsequent investigations by the College found no evidence to support Kehar's assertion of a diagnosis, nor her claim of having undergone surgery at the hospital she named. Moreover, an investigation found that the letter she provided had been written much earlier and about a different matter, but Kehar altered it. The surgeon she identified confirmed that the only procedures he had ever performed on Kehar were in October 2017 and February 2018, and neither were related to the supposed 'serious medical condition.' The second appeal of her expulsion was heard on January 24, 2020, and dismissed five days later. The College later learned that Kehar had lied to two colleagues about her personal circumstances, including the state of her health, 'to garner sympathy and support.' Those colleagues loaned Kehar 'substantial sums of money in response to requests from her for assistance on multiple occasions,' according to the document. Kehar 'acknowledged that her conduct was a serious mistake and expressed remorse over her actions in retrospect,' and 'acknowledged that she has demonstrated an unfitness to practice.' Despite being barred from practicing medicine, former clients insist Kehar advertised 'M.D. provided services' and presented herself as a licensed medical practitioner Her expulsion was upheld, meaning she was barred from practicing medicine in the country. Despite this, Kehar moved to British Columbia and founded Prestige Body Lab, an electrical muscle stimulation clinic, billing herself as a doctor all the while. Business cards viewed by DailyMail.com promise 'M.D. provided services' at the clinic in Surrey, which has since shuttered. Per Canadian regulations, Kehar is still allowed to refer to herself as a doctor or MD, but cannot mislead the public into believing she is licensed to practice medicine. And some former clients insist this is just what she did. Read More My friend Belle Gibson faked cancer, met real patients and mimicked their symptoms... I suspected she was lying after seeing her excessive drinking and tanning habits On the clinic's Instagram page, which has since been taken down, Kehar offered 'free MD consultations' and services in exchange for honest reviews. One comment beneath a testimonial from May 2023 asserts that Kehar 'lied to thousands of women by presenting as an active doctor.' 'Just giving you a friendly heads up as many influencers have had to put out public, apologies to the women in the greater Vancouver area as they were being held responsible for promoting this particular businesswoman in return for free sessions or discounted sessions,' the commenter wrote. Another user claimed they were 'one of her victims' and thanked the original commenter for 'saving lots of people from her.' Despite winning a default judgement against Kehar in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2022, Labine has yet to be reimbursed for the thousands of dollars she lost. She recently filed a lawsuit in British Columbia in an attempt to get her hands on the money. While Kehar has promised to pay her back, Labine has her doubts. 'When pressed for specifics or meeting with my lawyer, she provides nothing,' she told CBC News.

        "content": "Sport | Cricket Jos Buttler has left the England squad ahead of Tuesday's T20 international against Pakistan with his wife about to give birth to their third child. The England captain made a match-winning 84 on Saturday as England took a 1-0 lead in the rain-hit four-game series. But Buttler will miss the third game of the series, with vice-captain Moeen Ali set to take over. Moeen said last week that he is ready to lead England at the upcoming T20 World Cup if Buttler misses part of the tournament on paternity leave. England play their World Cup opener against Scotland in Barbados on June 4 after the Pakistan series wraps up at the Kia Oval on Thursday. Ben Duckett seems set to replace Buttler at the top of the order in Cardiff, with Will Jacks staying at three after his 23-ball 37 against Pakistan at Edgbaston on Saturday. Pace bowler Jofra Archer could be rested in Cardiff ahead of the Oval finale. Archer played his first game on English soil at Edgbaston since 2020 after an injury-hit few years where he had been troubled by repeated issues with his right elbow.

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Tourism in Japan has witnessed an unprecedented surge, with the country’s rich heritage, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences attracting visitors from across the globe. However, this influx of travellers has brought about unforeseen challenges, as Japan grapples with the delicate task of preserving its cherished cultural traditions while accommodating the growing tourism demand. As iconic destinations bear the brunt of overcrowding and disrespectful behaviour, the nation finds itself at a crossroads, seeking to strike a balance between welcoming guests and safeguarding its way of life. As per a news channel, recently, tourists have been banned from certain private streets in Kyoto’s famous historic Gion district, traditionally home to the teahouses where geisha (geiko) and maiko (apprentice geiko) performers work, largely due to antisocial behaviour. A video titled “Don’t do this in Kyoto” shows a tourist intruding on a geisha’s privacy by filming her persistently.",

        "description": "The High Court in Mombasa has certified as urgent",
        "content": "The High Court in Mombasa has certified as urgent a case filed by two Kenyans challenging the ban on muguka in Mombasa and Kilifi counties. Justice Olga Sewe directed petitioners Peter Agoro and Michael Makarina- to serve their application on the governors of Mombasa, Kilifi and Taita Taveta counties immediately. She said she would issue further directions on the cade on May 31. The duo in their petition claim that the crop (miraa) regulations 2021 recognise both miraa and muguka as legitimate crops in Kenya. \"Muguka is not perceived as a drug and that is why it is legal in the country. The National Agency for the Campaign Against Drug Abuse (Nacada) has not declared Muguka narcotic nor banned it,\" they said. They argue that there is no law separating miraa from muguka and no law prohibiting its sale or consumption and that only the national government has the mandate to effect such a ban. \"The county governments cannot choose to regulate a product or service by banning it altogether,\" Agoro said. On May 25, Mombasa Governor Abdulswamad Nassir banned the sale and use of muguka and its products in the county. In an executive order dated May 22, Nassir said henceforth no motor vehicles carrying the products will be allowed entry into Mombasa. In the order, Nassir also directed that all outlets whether retail or wholesale selling or distributing the products be closed immediately. “...The county departments are directed to enforce this order without exception,” it reads in part. He explained that he had made the decision in consultation with the National Authority for the Campaign for Drug Abuse (Nacada). He observed that the scientific use of muguka has established that it causes mental health disease and disability. On Friday, Kilifi Governor Mung'aro followed suit and banned the entry, transportation, distribution, sale, and use of muguka within the county. Mung'aro further ordered that motor vehicles transporting the product shall not be allowed entry into the county. He directed multi-agency bodies to swing to action and enforce the order, warning that any officer who would collude with culprits would face the law.",

        "content": "This news has been read 99 times! KUWAIT CITY, May 27: Al-Arabi Club President Abdulaziz Ashour has announced the renewal of Coach Nasser Al-Shatti’s contract, ensuring his position at the helm of the team’s technical leadership for the upcoming season. During the regular general assembly, Ashour also mentioned that the administrative staff’s status will be determined at the season’s end. He commended the administrative staff for their hard work and dedication throughout the season and praised the efforts of both the technical and administrative staff across all club activities. Regarding professional players, Ashour confirmed that Moroccan player Hamza Khaba will continue with Al-Arabi in the new season. He also stated that the club is actively working to attract high-caliber professionals to strengthen the team and make a significant impact in the Premier League. However, Ashour did not comment on the future of Nigerian professional Anayo Iweala, Moroccan Walid Sabar, Tunisian Ayman Sfaxien, and Algerian Imad Eddine Boubacar. Addressing Al-Arabi’s participation in the Asian Challenge Cup, Ashour expressed surprise at any skepticism, noting that the decision for the league champion and runner-up to participate in international competitions was made in May 2022 and is well-documented in Federation records. He emphasized that participating in the Asian Championship is a right of the Al-Arabi Club. Ashour also highlighted that preparations for the new season are in full swing, with training set to begin on June 23. The team will then head to an external training camp in mid-July before returning for friendly matches and the start of league matches on August 9.

        "content": "Kolkata, May 27 (PTI) Two Kolkata Metro rakes, manufactured by renowned locomotive maker Dalian, arrived in the city from China, an official said on Monday. These two new rakes are part of an order for 14 rakes from the firm. While one rake is already in use, the two latest rakes arrived at the Noapara shed here on May 26. According to a Metro spokesperson, the city port is expected to receive the remaining 11 rakes from Dalian in the next six months. The first 18 rakes for Kolkata Metro were built by Integral Coach Factory (ICF), a unit under the Ministry of Railways. These non-AC Metro rakes with a DC propulsion system have since been retired after reaching the end of their service life. Following the corridor expansion from Tollygunge to New Garia (Kavi Subhas), ICF built 13 AC rakes with a propulsion system from BHEL, commissioned between 2010 and 2013. Additionally, ICF produced another 18 rakes, commissioned between 2019 and 2022. To meet the future requirements of new corridors, ICF has already placed orders for sub-assembly parts and initiated production of additional rakes. By 2026, out of a total of 131 rakes, 117 will be indigenously manufactured by ICF, Chennai, and BEML Bengaluru, a central PSU.",

He told reporters on a campaign visit in Buckinghamshire: “I think when it comes to Reform, I understand people’s frustrations, but it is very simple: either Keir Starmer or me is going to be Prime Minister on July 5. “So, if you are someone who wants strong borders and wants to get a grip of illegal migration, if you are someone who wants a more pragmatic, serious, hard-headed approach to net zero which prioritises energy security and cutting people’s bills, I am going to deliver that, not Keir Starmer. “That is the choice at this election. So, for people who are thinking about voting for other parties, but particularly Reform, all that is going to do is put Keir Starmer in power and you are not going to see any change on the issues that you care about.” Veterans minister Johnny Mercer told Times Radio that Ms Allan’s move was “not good news – but it doesn’t mean the wheels are coming off the campaign”.

Tory peer Lord Goldsmith, an ally of former prime minister Boris Johnson, hit out at Mr Sunak and indicated he believed the Conservatives were on course for an electoral disaster. “I understand the anger towards Sunak who has damaged the party almost beyond repair and all but guaranteed the majority of his MPs will lose their job next month,” the former minister said. “But it’s hard to muster much sympathy given that none of this would have happened without the complicity of a majority of the party and what is now unfolding was entirely predictable – indeed predicted. “The hope is that when Sunak disappears off to California in a few weeks there are at least some decent MPs left around which to rebuild.” Mr Sunak insisted he would remain in the UK, whether or not he won the election. Asked about the claim he would move to California, he told ITV News: “It’s simply not true. I mean, it’s just simply not true.” Southampton fan Mr Sunak added: “This is my home. I mean, my football team just got promoted back in the Premiership and I hope to be watching them for years to come in the Premier League.”",

        "content": "piranka Dear readers/followers You may recall that a number of months ago, back in March, I started covering a UK-based REIT called Big Yellow ( OTCPK:BYLOF ). I considered the company a \"BUY\" at the time, and now I'm updating given a double-digit outperformance to market. I'm downgrading the company at this time for reasons related to company valuation - in layman's terms, it's become too expensive at this particular time. The Big Yellow Group is the largest self-storage business in the UK. I've recently covered other UK REITs as well that you'll see articles on here on Seeking Alpha, and I believe the UK market offers a very compelling, low-valuation entry into what is without a doubt - to my mind - qualitative real estate plays. And this company, dear readers, is most definitely one of those plays. I invest quite a bit in European REITs like Gecina and Icade, as well as now in the Supermarket Income REIT ( OTCPK:SUPIF ), which is one of those plays you will get to read about. But the point here is Big Yellow. Since my last article, we can see the following outperformance for the company here. Seeking Alpha Big Yellow Article TSR (Seeking Alpha Big Yellow Article TSR) As you can see, the outperformance is material, indicating if nothing else that the short-term valuation at the time of my last article was wrong. There's no doubt to me that European REITs are more volatile than their American counterparts. However, I really believe that this has to do with them being misunderstood in terms of risk/reward, such as aforementioned Icade and Gecina. While the European real estate segment is currently in a downturn, this creates what I believe to be excellent investment opportunities for the next 5-15 years. And above all, I look to the long term. Aside from that, England or Great Britain is a great market for me. There is no dividend withholding tax , which makes any investment there even more hassle-free than most of the other European markets I invest in, even with my current circumstances of getting 99.8% of all withholding back within 12 months (specific DTS circumstances in Sweden relatively unique to our tax domicile). So I have a stated target of finding attractive UK-based plays/LSE-based tickers. Let's see, therefore, what we have here. Updating on Big Yellow - a lot to like even now. So, a quick rundown of the company again, self-storage player, the biggest in the UK, has never missed a 5-year estimate negatively, and one of the trickiest markets not only in the UK but in Self-storage. It's already part of the FTSE250, and According to surveys done by the Self-Storage Association in the UK, Big Yellow has the largest brand awareness in the UK self-storage sector. It's comparable, as I see it, to something like Public Storage ( PSA ) here. The company is 26 years old, and exists in the following geography, with an apparent focus, as you can see, on the larger London area. Big Yellow IR (Big Yellow IR) As I said in my initial piece, the company is in a very underpenetrated and fragmented market, offering both growth and consolidation potential. This is unlike the US, which I would characterize as a mostly mature market, especially on the coasts and in urban areas. With customer satisfaction and other quality indicators and the company already mostly digitized, Big Yellow already operates what in the USA would be considered a qualitative operation with scale and very good synergies. The company's assets are primarily freehold RE, with a concentration in large population areas like London and the Southeast. The company's metrics continue to show growth over time, and we're not just talking about any growth, but double-digit growth in profit and revenues. Big Yellow IR (Big Yellow IR) The big news is that we have end-year results reported as of May 20th. But first, I want to show you Big yellows overall returns over time, if you had invested in the company. We're talking quadruple digits 20-year returns, and significant overall market outperformance. Big Yellow TSR (Big Yellow TSR ) Key KPIs for the full fiscal of 2024 include significant revenue growth, a 7% growth in store EBITDA, a 1% growth in profit before tax adjusted, and a flat dividend that nonetheless keeps BYG's payout and yield at a competitive level in the broader perspective, though not necessarily \"great\" as such. BYG currently has a market cap close to £2.5B, which once again makes it a relatively small player. But I want to be perfectly clear that this company does not miss estimates. Despite the lack of a credit rating, the sheer forecast accuracy and earnings and dividend safety could arguably raise it to the safety level of something like a larger, US-based storage REIT. BYG Forecast Accuracy F.A.S.T Graphs (BYG Forecast Accuracy F.A.S.T Graphs) The company has the core focus of driving shareholder value through a combination of new prospects, customer satisfaction, revenue driving. BYG IR (BYG IR) Operating numbers for the year and overall demand indicators are very solid. The total number of move-ins is up 1% for the year. The company characterized this as \"muted conditions\", which mirrors what we're seeing across the pond in the US. Companies are seeing the effects of higher inflation and higher cost awareness. Current occupancy in the established BYG units/stores is at around 84-85%, which is slightly down from last year, with a total occupancy across the entire group nonetheless above 80%. This is slightly below some US averages. I would characterize the reason for this not as a requirement of growing the company portfolio, but rather a current general muted trend, that's likely to reverse over time as inflation and other indicators do so. BYG IR (BYG IR) The full-year results, while muted, provide a good basis for further growth and profit for Big Yellow. The market dynamics, as I see them, are intact. The UK self-storage market remains underpenetrated, especially in urban areas, where concentration remains low. Even at an average 80% occupancy, the company can drive profit with such numbers. Self-storage is also far more a part of the current societal ecosystem than it was only 20 years ago, and the company, like its US counterparts here, has shown resilience and excellent performance during the pandemic. Out of other self-storage players, BYG is by far the largest in the UK, with 90% of inquiries now online-based, and the company's stores are usually located on arterial or main roads, with extensive frontage and high overall visibility. Continued innovation and investment CapEx means the company's technology and solutions are up to par here, and the company's customer satisfaction scores are, as mentioned, one of the highest out there. Fundamentally speaking, despite the lack of a credit rating, nothing is really in a worrying state here. BYG has less than 15% long-term debt to capital, making it one of the most conservatively leveraged players in the entire industry. Let's look at the updated valuation. Valuation for Big Yellow - no longer as appealing So, unfortunately, we no longer have an appealing valuation for entry with Big Yellow. That has nothing to do with company fundamentals, but instead everything to do with pricing for the share. It's a bit sad that I \"have to\" change my rating only 2–3 months, but that's what I do when new facts present themselves - I change my thesis. The new fact here is that we have BYG trading at a P/AFFO of something like 20x, which is not only on par with but above companies like Public Storage (PSA), a similar REIT where I own a significant portfolio stake. PSA, as a comparison, trades at around 18x, but with a yield of 4.41%, far above that of BYG at 3.6%, and also comes with very compelling accuracy ratings. That would mean that currently, between these two, PSA is by far the more preferred \"BUY\" as I see it, and is also reflected in the fact that I recently added to PSA - but did not add to BYG. BYG instead offers us the following upside at a P/AFFO of 20x. Big Yellow Upside F.A.S.T graphs (Big Yellow Upside F.A.S.T graphs) And despite the company's fundamentals, I remind you that I in fact, in my last article, put my PT on BYG at a level of £11/share. I also mentioned that it becomes more interesting as it drops below the 18x level, which it hasn't. It has instead approached 21x. Therefore, my stance change to \"HOLD\" is entirely logical and in line with my overall expectation of a PT of £11/share, and where I put my attractive target ranges. Other analysts are fairly clear on where they consider this company to be interesting. Big Yellow is currently followed by 15 analysts, 7 of which give the company a positive \"BUY\" or \"outperform\" rating. This comes with a low PT of around £9 to a high PT of about £14.3. The average lies at £12.1, which at a price target as it currently is does not really give us any sort of upside. We're also no longer buying BYG at a discount to EPRA NAV. We're, in fact, paying a non-trivial premium to the company's EPRA NAV of just above £11/share. (Source: Author calculations, Big Yellow Group IR) For that reason, I no longer believe this company to be a worthy investment for any value-oriented investor's portfolio, and would consider it a \"HOLD\" with the following updated thesis for May of 2024. Thesis Big Yellow Group is Great Britain's largest self-storage REIT and one that I view as still in its basic growing stages. This company has what I view as a bright future and good prospects to grow even further both inorganically and organically as its services expand to other UK cities and geographies. I also want to point to the company's fundamentals, which are actually very solid. The company may lack a formal credit rating, but it nonetheless offers safety to a degree that I consider to be good enough for investing. It's diversified enough that the company isn't likely to see a sudden downturn from any one market, with perhaps the exception of London, which I consider unlikely. However, as of the most recent update, we do have the company rising too far based on my share price target - and I am not changing my share price target here. I consider Big Yellow Group to be a \"HOLD\" with a PT of £11/share and a P/FFO target of around 18-20x P/FFO at most, and becoming less interesting as it rises above 20x. Remember, I'm all about : 1. Buying undervalued - even if that undervaluation is slight, and not mind-numbingly massive - companies at a discount, allowing them to normalize over time and harvesting capital gains and dividends in the meantime. 2. If the company goes well beyond normalization and goes into overvaluation, I harvest gains and rotate my position into other undervalued stocks, repeating #1. 3. If the company doesn't go into overvaluation, but hovers within a fair value, or goes back down to undervaluation, I buy more as time allows. 4. I reinvest proceeds from dividends, savings from work, or other cash inflows as specified in #1. Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (italicized). This company is overall qualitative. This company is fundamentally safe/conservative & well-run. This company pays a well-covered dividend. This company is currently cheap. This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion. For that reason, the company doesn't fulfill my valuation-related criteria, and now represents a \"HOLD\" here.

        "description": "Another surprise could be awaiting with AMD Ryzen 9000 in the form of new X870 AM5 boards by Sayan Sen Image via AMDIt looks like AMD's upcoming Ryzen 9000 series processors, powered by Zen 5 architecture, will be full of quite a few surprises. The biggest one of them is the apparent lack of support the chips have for Windows 10 according to a supposed Lenovo manager. The Ryzen 9000 naming itself is a bit surprising considering the 8000 series desktop CPU nomenclature is now held solely by the G-series APUs only with much of it going to mobile SKUs. That's not all though as AMD is seemingly looking to rename Strix Point APUs from 8050 series to \"Ryzen AI HX\" potentially looking to capitalize on the AI hype and buzz surrounding almost everything nowadays. If you recall, AMD made a big deal about its Ryzen 8000G APUs as they had the \"world's first NPU in desktop processors.\" The third surprise is allegedly heading our way at Computex 2024 as AMD will be unveiling new 800 series chipset boards that will socket the Ryzen 9000 series processors. The rumour has surfaced from Chinese news outlet Benchlife which has in the past provided credible leaks and it claims it has to do with matching with Intel's chipset naming. In a news article surrounding a newly released Gigabyte B650E motherboard, the site has added that 800 series board for upcoming 9000 series CPUs \"has been confirmed\". It writes (Google-translated to English): GIGABYTE is clearly ready for AMD's next generation Ryzen processors. Obviously, we can expect various motherboard manufacturers to display AMD and Intel 800 series chip motherboards at Computex 2024; it has been confirmed that the chips used with AMD Ryzen 9000 will be called the 800 series, the same as Intel. If this turns out to be true, it will mean AMD is going to skip a digit for the first time in its chipset naming. The company started the AM5 (LGA1718) socket with its 600 series boards and it had stuck with this naming since 300-series back when AM4 was launched alongside Zen 1. Speaking of the 300-series, it is believed AMD started with that number as it wanted to one-up Intel since at that time, Team Blue had 200 series chipsets. So, the rumour certainly seems plausible. One thing that is not surprising about this news is the timing as we have already had evidence about upcoming AMD boards from chipset driver support that was added recently in April.",

        "description": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal was crashed out of the French Open with a 6-3 7-6 (5), 6-3 defeat against German fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI: Rafa Nadal experienced his earliest exit from the French Open on Monday, falling 6-3, 7-6(5), 6-3 in the first round to fourth seed Alexander Zverev. This unexpected defeat has left fans questioning whether the 14-time champion will return to the Grand Slam he has dominated for two decades. The 22-time major champion, who first claimed the Musketeers' Cup in 2005 and last lifted the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury disrupted his career, had hinted that this year might be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier but the 37-year-old ultimately went down fighting. Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland Garros , after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semi-finals. Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched on by his great rival Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.",
