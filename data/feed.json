Lawrance and Ali Daher For Daily Mail Australia Published: 18:00 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 18:00 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Jackie 'O' Henderson has been forced to confront a report she 'stole' Ada Nicodemou's job after her own mother asked her about the rumours. Henderson, 49, admitted on Tuesday's Kyle and Jackie O Show that mum Julie sent her an article from New Idea claiming Jackie had pinched Ada's Stranded on Honeymoon Island job and asked her if it was true. 'I'm completely unaware of that story,' claimed Jackie, adding, 'I actually don't even know if they've got that story right, to be honest.' Jackie admitted Nicodemou had presented the show, for which Henderson will be providing the voiceover, at last year's Seven 'Upfronts'. 'And because she presented that, I mean, she's a Seven personality, they assumed that she would then be hosting that show or narrating that show.' said Jackie, while maintaining that wasn't the case. Jackie 'O' Henderson has been forced to confront a report she 'stole' Ada Nicodemou's job after her own mother asked her about the rumours. Pictured this month 'I don't think they've got the story right at all,' insisted the radio star. Co-host Kyle Sandilands, 52, agreed with Jackie, adding that Ada 'was never even in the running for [the job].' He then joked that the network wouldn't dare 'get someone who left their husband' and was 'floozing around' with men to front the series - an apparent reference to Ada's 2023 split from her partner Adam Rigby and subsequent romance with co-star James Stewart . It comes after Channel Seven 's decision to choose Henderson as narrator of its new dating series Stranded on Honeymoon Island has sparked controversy. Henderson, 49, admitted on Tuesday's Kyle and Jackie O Show that mum Julie sent her an article from New Idea claiming Jackie had pinched Ada's Stranded on Honeymoon Island job and asked her if it was true. Pictured: Nicodemou Dubbed 'Married At First Sight on the beach', the show was widely expected to be fronted by Home and Away star Ada Nicodemou, who introduced a first-look at the program during Channel Seven's 2024 content unveiling last October. According to this week's New Idea , industry sources were surprised by the decision to choose Jackie for the role. Ada, 47, gave an enthusiastic speech at the unveiling, which many believed signalled her involvement. 'If you're bad at relationships and you can't even get to the second date, let alone find the love of your life, what do you do? Well, I have a show for you ... Stranded on Honeymoon Island,' Ada told the audience excitedly. Channel Seven's decision to choose Jackie as narrator of its new dating series, Stranded on Honeymoon Island, has sparked controversy Dubbed 'Married At First Sight on the beach', the show was widely expected to be fronted by Home and Away star Nicodemou, who introduced a first-look at the program during Channel Seven's 2024 content unveiling last October Having been a beloved member of the Seven family for over 24 years, Ada seemed the natural choice for the gig. 'Many eyebrows were raised by this appointment,' an insider told the publication. 'While there is little doubt Jackie is a perfect fit to narrate a show like this one, there is a feeling Seven should have looked internally to someone who has been loyal to the network, like a Home and Away star such as Ada or Emily Weir.' According to this week's New Idea, industry sources were surprised by the decision to choose Jackie for the role Read More Channel Seven release wild trailer for new reality series Stranded on Honeymoon Island Given that the network opted for Jackie, especially after her last reality TV stint with Network 10's The Masked Singer faced challenges, has left many puzzled. A source close to the situation suggested the decision might be driven by business strategy. 'It's good business sense for Seven to hire Jackie for Honeymoon Island,' the source explained. 'Seven bosses likely know that shows like MAFS get a lot of airtime on KIIS airwaves and were smart to secure Kyle for Australian Idol, where he was able to drum up his involvement. Now they've got Jackie to ensure Honeymoon Island is hopefully a ratings hit.' Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Channel Seven for comment.

Despite building a loyal following since launching to stardom in following the first season of their HGTV series, Fixer Upper, in 2013, the couple were slammed for flaunting their wealth. After watching the sneak peek of their latest fixer upper project, uploaded to Magnolia Network's Instagram, a number of fans began commenting that the couple seemed to be 'showing off.' One explained: 'I don't like watching HGTV personalities renovating their own luxury 2nd or 3rd homes. It looks like they're showing off.' 'That show is no longer enjoyable,' another wrote as numerous others admitted they stopped watching their show altogether after they decided to charge 'for their network.' Chip and Joanna Gaines sparked backlash following the release of the trailer for their newest show, Fixer Upper: The Lakehouse, which dropped last week (seen in 2016) In response to the comment accusing the pair, who share five children, of being ostentatious, multiple Instagram users defended Chip, 49, and Joanna, 46. 'Don't be jealous they've earned it,' one fired back. Another asked: What's wrong with other's success?' At no point during the trailer did Chip or Joanna state that they planned on keeping the property as they seemingly renovating the property to flip as they have done in the past. During the trailer, the duo noted that the renovation project falls on the 10-year anniversary of their hit series debuting on HGTV. 'I think with this lakehouse, there's something about it that just feels significant that this project landed on our ten year Fixer anniversary,' Joanna said in the beginning of the trailer. So it kind of feels like...' Chip, then interjects: 'It was really meant to be.' In a press release, obtained by ABC News , for their upcoming six-episode series, which will air on Magnolia Network and HGTV, the couple admitted that they 'couldn’t have imagined the journey we had ahead' of them. 'Though a lot has changed and evolved in the decade between then and now, our love for home is still at the heart of everything we do,' they said.

Fixer Upper: The Lakehouse will premiere on Sunday, June 2. In November, the couple reflected on the 'evolution' of their relationship and their family after 20 years of marriage. The reality stars admitted things are 'shifting' between their romance and raising their five children as they oversee a lifestyle empire that includes a product line at Target and their own TV network during a candid interview with People . 'Jo and I are in this beautiful moment. We're evolving into each other,' Chip said. 'It's the second part of our marriage'.

So they don't ever talk about any of it. I think they love the idea of flying under the radar, feeling normal,' Joanna explained. 'We get that. But maybe they'll be proud of this one day,' she added, referring to the juggernaut of their lifestyle brand Magnolia. The couple said they understand it might mean letting their kids fly the coop and discover a passion other than the family business. 'Obviously at some point it'd be so fun to have one or two of our kids work with us, but that's definitely not what we're saying out loud to them,' said Joanna. 'Chip is really good at saying, \"You need your own identity. When you're finished with college, go do some stuff on your own. Learn some stuff. And then if you want to come back years later and teach us, we're here\"'.

'They kept saying, \"I can't believe something like this is in Waco. We feel like we're in New York City\". That was the biggest compliment,' Joanna gushed. 'I was like, \"Ah, they're finally impressed.\" It felt like a big win.' 'Teenagers aren't notorious for compliments,' added Chip. 'I'm sure we're not the only parents that come home and are like, I wonder it these teenagers even like us, much less are fond of the work we're doing.' 'Jo and I are in this beautiful moment. We're evolving into each other,' Chip said. 'It's the second part of our marriage' (seen in 2021) 'They're working through their own stuff,' Joanna agreed. The couple have clearly worked through their own stuff as well, as they have found a way to appreciate each other after all these years together. 'I think that’s the beauty of relationships in general. If Chip weren’t my partner, I would probably still be in the corner,' Joanna admitted. 'From the moment I met him, he’s always experienced change in a positive way. Even if it was negative, it was, \"All right. What do we do next?\"' She added, 'We’ve had so much change in our lives, and the proof is there: Change is hard, but it’s always beautiful.' 'I hope that it's just the beginning,' said Chip. 'I hope that we get to look back in 20 years from now, and feel just as confident that we were meant to be. We really feel like we are in some ways just getting started.'

        "content": "Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves vows to lead 'most pro-growth Treasury' in history in bid to attract business back to Britain By Kumail Jaffer Published: 22:57, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 23:00, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will tomorrow promise to lead the ‘most pro-growth Treasury’ in history in a bid to attract business back to Britain. In a speech to business leaders she will vow that a Labour government will give companies a ‘bedrock of stability’ in which to operate. She will also propose tough fiscal rules to create a ‘pro worker and pro business’ environment. Labour has come under fire from trade unions after watering down its workers’ rights package in what was seen as a betrayal of the party’s traditional voter base. But tomorrow in the Midlands Ms Reeves will say that Labour’s pro-business pivot over the past four years ‘can deliver a better future for working people.’ Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will tomorrow promise to lead the ‘most pro-growth Treasury’ in history in a bid to attract business back to Britain Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner has drawn up a ‘new deal’ for workers that she wants to introduce in the first 100 days of a Labour government ‘If we can change this party to bring it back to the service of working people; if we can return it to the centre ground of politics; if we can bring business back to Labour, then I know we can bring business back to Britain.’ Ms Reeves’ time as Shadow Chancellor has been notable for her courting of businesses, especially when compared to the previous Labour leadership. Tomorrow she will say: ‘Labour’s plans for growth are built on partnership with business. It is clearer than ever that in this election, in the face of Tory chaos, stability is change. ‘Stability, so that we never again see a repeat of the mini budget and the damage it did to family finances. Read More 'No one is going to give a box of matches back to the arsonists who burnt the house down': Shadow Chancellor RACHEL REEVES says Britain can trust Labour and vows to 'never play fast and loose with your money' in an impassioned plea to Mail readers 'Stability, so that families and business can plan for the future. Stability of direction, so we can bring together government, business and working people in common purpose, to meet the great challenges of our time.’ The general election, Mrs Reeves will say, is a ‘chance for the British people to pass judgment on 14 years of economic chaos and decline under the Conservatives’. She will also claim that Rishi Sunak would never have called the July 4 vote if he believed in his own plan for the economy. But, despite her pro-business rhetoric, senior Tories have accused Labour of undermining firms by introducing French-style union laws. Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner has drawn up a ‘new deal’ for workers that she wants to introduce in the first 100 days of a Labour government. Some major business leaders, however, have warned that the legislation may make it more expensive to hire workers. Laura Trott MP, chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘The bosses of Asda, Marks & Spencer, Currys and the Confederation of British Industry have all warned that Labour’s French-style union laws risk damaging the economy, costing jobs. ‘Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan that businesses can rely on. ‘We took the bold action to deliver the biggest business tax cut in modern history. Labour would tie businesses in red tape and raise taxes by £2,094 for hardworking families.’ Rachel Reeves Share or comment on this article: Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves vows to lead 'most pro-growth Treasury' in history in bid to attract business back to Britain e-mail Add comment",

Tribute videos have poured in for the late college basketball commentator Walton passed away on Monday at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer READ MORE: NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton dies aged 71 after cancer battle By Jake Fenner Published: 17:36 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:59 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments The basketball world is in mourning after the passing of legendary commentator and player Bill Walton at the age of 71 following a battle with cancer . Walton was one of the greatest centers in the history of the game - and by far one of the best college basketball players overall in the sport's history. He won two NBA championships - one in 1977 with the Portland Trail Blazers and again in 1986 with the Boston Celtics . That came after winning three straight college national titles at UCLA. But to a younger generation of fans, Walton is best known for his on-air personality and his antics when covering college basketball. He's best associated with the Pac-12 Conference - which played its final athletic competition yesterday before ten of the 12 schools will depart, essentially killing the league. Tribute videos have poured in showing the highlights of the late commentator Bill Walton (L) Walton, an NBA hall of fame center, died Monday at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer Bill Walton was an ICONIC sportscaster here is a clip of some of his funniest moments on the mic: REST IN PEACE, LEGEND 🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/0i3p6QqV18 — Degenerate George (@DGen_Media) May 27, 2024 There will never be another quite like Bill Walton. His ESPN family will miss him dearly ❤️ pic.twitter.com/mvS0Sh5iWZ — ESPN (@espn) May 27, 2024 Read More BREAKING NEWS NBA hall of famer Bill Walton dies aged 71 after battle with cancer Walton's bombastic, quirky, and larger than life persona was on full display nearly every time that he got behind the mic on radio or television. That he even got there was miraculous after he overcame a stuttering problem at the age of 28 with help from Hall of Fame sports broadcaster Marty Glickman. After his retirement from playing, Walton worked for CBS, NBC, ESPN, and the Pac-12 Network as well as for multiple NBA teams. In the aftermath of his death, multiple compilation videos showed some of the best of his broadcasts. Walton was known for his eccentricities - such has his love for the Grateful Dead and his affinity for tie-dye shirts. He wore those shirts multiple times on broadcasts - and even took one off and went bare chested live on air as he changed into another one. Walton also made inferences to his use of drugs, once going off about the benefits of mushrooms and telling ex-White Sox broadcaster Jason Benetti that he's not a good baseball catcher because he was 'better at getting high than getting low'. Walton once ate a cupcake live on camera - even eating a lit candle in the process He also had a lighthearted side - seen feeding popcorn to the Oregon Ducks mascot Walton (left) overcame a stutter to thrive on the microphone, winning a Sports Emmy in 1991 There was nobody more full of life at all times.

Pasch was also on the receiving end of many gifts from Walton - as seen in the videos - whether it be dirt from Temeculah, various plants, or chocolates thrown at him. Walton even once dumped popcorn on Pasch's head at the University of Oregon before feeding the snack to the costumed Oregon Ducks mascot. Among the many tributes included one from NBA commissioner Adam Silver: 'Bill Walton was truly one of a kind. 'As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. 'Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. Walton is survived by his wife Lori (above) and his four sons Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris 'But what I will remember most about him was his zest for life. He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. 'I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered. 'As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him.

Speaking on ABC, Conroy said Australia has announced a package of $2.5 million of assistance. “It’s an incredibly isolated part of Papua New Guinea. At the moment, I’m advised access can only be achieved through helicopters, so the search and recovery efforts are very very challenging,” Conroy said. Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen “We announced an initial ... package of $2.5 million of assistance, that will include a disaster assistance response team that will arrive in Papua New Guinea this afternoon. That’s made up of teams from Queensland Fire and Rescue, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the National Emergency Management Authority.” Conroy conceded no one knows the full extent of the crisis yet and it was a challenging process for everyone. “The Papua New Guinean government has asked the UN agencies to coordinate partner countries and those assessments are going on right now, but this is an incredibly inaccessible part of Papua New Guinea, and it’s a really challenging process for everyone involved,” he said.

March figures recently shown to the Senate by Home Affairs shows at least 28 of the 153 people released into the community on strict visa conditions after the court declared indefinite detention was unlawful have been charged with offences under state laws. Nationals Leader David Littleproud speaks to the media at Parliament House in Canberra on May 13. Credit: Dominic Lorrimer Speaking on Nine’s Today program this morning, Littleproud said this was more proof the government had failed in managing the detainees. “This gets worse. While the High Court released them, they did give us an insight in June last year, in a preliminary findings hearing, that they were going to make this decision – the government did nothing,” Littleproud said. “We had to let these 153 out, we brought back parliament to put in new powers – powers to actually put a court order to put them back behind bars – and in fact they didn’t even have in the original legislation that we should be tracking these people. “But this has just shown the complete incompetence of this government.” Also speaking on Today, Kooyong independent Monique Ryan disagreed with putting the detainees back in prison, saying we have to abide by the rule of law. “I agree that we have passed laws, with several days of parliament as we pass laws to try and keep Australians safe and that is our first priority,” she said. “But I also think that without further knowledge of this particular situation it’s inappropriate to jump in and have a knee-jerk reaction that we immediately need to up the ante, it wouldn’t be appropriate if we’re talking about jaywalking or traffic offences.” 5.42am Frydenberg warns of rising antisemitism By Lachlan Abbott Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg has returned to breakfast television this morning to raise his concerns about increasing antisemitism in Australia amid Israel’s ongoing war in Gaza. The ex-federal MP for Kooyong, who stepped back from public life after he lost his Melbourne seat and the Coalition was defeated at the last election, appeared on Channel Seven’s Sunrise program to promote a new documentary airing on Sky News tonight titled Never Again: The Fight Against Antisemitism . Josh Frydenberg. Credit: Eddie Jim Frydenberg, who is Jewish, said he felt compelled to speak out about the issue. Here’s a little of what he had to say this morning: I’m ringing the alarm bell about the explosion in antisemitism in Australia, because I want our fellow Australians to know how bad it it really is, and why it is so important that we bring it to a stop, and that’s going to require a national effort to do so. I mean, since October 7th and those tragic events in Israel, which saw more than 1200 innocent people slaughtered, we have seen violent demonstrations outside the Sydney Opera House, in the largely Jewish suburb of Caulfield in Melbourne. We have seen the Carols by Candlelight disrupted. We have seen our War Memorial defaced. And this is just not on here in Australia, in particular, what we are seeing at our university campuses with these campus camps of hate and people chanting slogans.They don’t really understand, but these slogans are an incitement to violence and hatred across the community. More needs to be done and it is Australia’s fight, not just the Jewish community’s fight. Sunrise host Matt Shirvington pressed Frydenberg on whether he thought Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netenyahu should resign amid concerns Israel’s conduct in Gaza had “crossed a line”. But, the former treasurer wouldn’t be drawn on the question, instead saying it was a matter for the Israeli people. “My documentary is about antisemitism in my country, Australia,” he said.

In a statement on Tuesday morning, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese formally announced the panel to conduct a rapid review into best-practice prevention approaches to combat violence against women. Anne Summers says domestic violence is getting worse.

Alongside Summers, the panel includes author and educator Jess Hill, University of Melbourne research fellow Zac Seidler, diversity and inclusion consultant Todd Fernando, RMIT Centre for Innovative Justice associate director Elena Campbell and Victoria Police assistant commissioner Leigh Gassner. Speaking to this masthead, Summers said the increase in technology-enabled abuse was “really quite horrific”.

Police told the protesters on Monday they could continue to protest but that it had to be at another location.

Credit: Alex Ellinghausen “Your current position is situated within the primary fire evacuation zone for the Kambri precinct,” the police said. “Non-compliance with this direction by 12pm [on Tuesday] may result in further action by ACT Police.” Yesterday, those at the camp said they would hold on as they prepared to spend another night in tents amid chilly temperatures. The ANU pro-Palestine encampment is demanding the university cut ties with weapons manufacturing companies, disclose and divest from all entities complicit in the “genocide in Gaza” and cut academic ties with Israel. The escalation at ANU follows news of other camps at the University of Melbourne and Curtin University in Western Australia packing up and going home. AAP 4.55am Netanyahu admits ‘tragic mistake’ after Israeli strike on Rafah camp kills dozens By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Dan Williams Cairo/Jerusalem: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli airstrike triggered a fire that officials say killed 45 people in a tent camp in the Gazan city of Rafah. The mistake only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas, with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip. Credit: AP “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze.

        "description": "Author Michael Pearson's grandfather abandoned his family in 1912, leaving a huge wound. In Pearson's latest book — 'The Road to Dungannon' — he explores literature, identity, home.",
        "content": "Around 1912, Michael Patrick Pearson’s grandfather, an Irish immigrant, abruptly abandoned his wife, infant daughter and three stepsons in the South Bronx, and disappeared. That act reverberated through generations, reinforced by a bog of silence; his daughter’s knowledge of him was cloaked in a degree of shame and confusion, providing scant breadcrumbs for his grandson to follow. McFarland In “The Road to Dungannon,” Michael Patrick Pearson combines literature, travel and place — home. She was the only tangible legacy of an enigma, and her death left no solid path to the man’s story. In his latest book, Pearson describes aspects of his quest to find Alfred Hunter, a man presumably long dead, who’d left no “evidence to sift through, no letters or photos, no books, diaries, maps, or holy medals.” An account of genealogical digging, “The Road to Dungannon: Journeys in Literary Ireland” is not. This journey is more a spiritual quest, for identity, home, belonging. It’s also an interesting Irish travelogue, a detailed and insightful literary analysis, and a virtual catalog of Irish literature. And it is, to a degree, a fantasy. Pearson — a retired professor of creative writing at Old Dominion University who has reviewed books for The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press, and who now lives in Williamsburg — has long lived through reading and travel. His books often track where writers, travel and identity meet, back to “Imagined Places: Journeys into Literary America” (1991). That is his approach to the hunt for Alfred after his mother, a New Yorker to her core, suddenly fades and dies in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. “(W)ith her gone, he seemed a riddle that I was obliged to solve in order to know her and myself properly,” Pearson writes. “Whoever he was, I guessed that Alfred Hunter was shaped by Ireland, and I reasoned that the best way for a professor of literature to discover that country, and perhaps my ancestor and myself, was in its books.” Over the decades before and since, he travels to Ireland. He visits the ecosystems of James Joyce (Dublin) and W.B. Yeats (Sligo), J.M. Synge (the Aran Islands), Frank O’Connor (Cork), Edna O’Brien (the west of Ireland), Seamus Heaney (from Northern Ireland, like Alfred). He writes about several “writers of the new Ireland” — Tana French, Benjamin Black, Sally Rooney, Paul Lynch, Kevin Barry, Roisin Kiberd, Rob Doyle. In “Dungannon” he devotes several chapters to the classic authors, placing them in their habitats and amazingly messy personal lives, and tracing the impact of their circumstances on their work. From time to time he relates something of them to today’s authors, their works and himself. Along the way, he imagines his grandfather and analogous emigrants who walked the same ground and endured famine — the near-genocidal Great Hunger of 1845-52 — before leaving in desperation for America. On a personal level, it is Joyce who seems, even in Pearson’s adolescence, to resonate most. In Joyce’s work the youth sees his own trapped and Catholic life and his search for his distant father. (It also happens to be Joyce with whom infant Pearson shared a nickname, a connection he doesn’t note.) With Edna O’Brien, Pearson finds the old rural Ireland, a “misogynistic stronghold” that bedeviled her, and traits of his mother and mother-in-law: “They could have been models for her characters in their generosity and joy, in their compassion and exuberance of spirit, in their indomitable spirits.” Seamus Heaney’s concerns with Ireland’s violent history, and the protective nature of silence, show in a core metaphor, Pearson writes: the bog, “pointing toward history, both its protective and destructive features ... standing as a place for hiding memory and violence and a means of preserving them.” Heaney’s poem “Whatever You Say, Say Nothing” has a life of its own, and it and the bog live in this book as well. The younger authors’ work reflects the “new” Ireland, one born in part of the mid-’90s boom that vaulted it from poverty to prosperity — and that collapsed with the 2008 global financial crisis. This Ireland, beset by a “cultural unraveling,” is struggling to “(untangle) itself from the post-Celtic Tiger greed and the drug-induced alienation and carnage of its teenagers.” The newer works raise the question: Are “Irish authors” still a “thing”? Some of Pearson’s contemporary authors are difficult to classify: Are they citizens of Europe, the U.S., the world, who happen to be of Irish origin? And are traditional books, particularly fiction, on the way out? For example, Kiberd, a highly regarded author in her early 30s, excuses herself from an interview with Pearson and her partner, Doyle, to conduct a podcast. One concludes that whatever we think of as Irish literature has expanded, exploring new media and sometimes radical formats and subject matter, Through the narrative, the author’s parents appear periodically and briefly, the love, grace and measured silence of his “sweet and big-hearted” mother a sharp contrast to his father, a much larger mystery and enduring wound. Of him, thin details emerge: He is a union man of German lineage. He “drowned his chronic unhappiness in drink and cigarette smoke, often making that 500-square-foot apartment feel like a prison cell.” The sound of him “opening beer cans in the kitchen” surfaces between trips of the rattling, rumbling underground D Train below the bedroom window and through the Bronx. “Books,” the son writes, “shielded me from my father’s despair and some teachers’ sadism.” Books helped him map a way out. As he nears completion of this book, the author notices a “connective tissue” in the others he’s written over three decades: a “sense of displacement and homelessness.” He realizes, “That search for home, for the father I knew too well at times and never enough, for the grandfather I knew not at all, was at the heart of everything I had written.” As for Alfred’s Irish homesite, Pearson has turned up Dungannon, a town in the northern province of Ulster. But in 2022, an Irish relative delivers a surprise, disappointing yet comical, and a new theory to investigate. It’s a shaky theory, but then Pearson — alluding occasionally to Yeats — knows he’s been climbing shaky ladders, fantasies, all along. “The Road to Dungannon” is short but packed with anecdotes and long but pithy quotations from contemporary authors — the transcriptions alone were presumably a massive chore, as many conversations took place in presumably cacophonous public spaces. Though Pearson’s extensive knowledge could induce guilt in the reader for knowing nothing about some of his more modern subjects, the occasional reference to Cormac McCarthy or Flannery O’Connor offers an intellectual lifeline. And he confesses to the same difficulty reading some of Joyce as anyone else. The writing is often lovely and subtle, accented with black-and-white photos by traveling companion John Lawrence. A closer edit might have intercepted repetition, in the author’s extensive citing of other scholars; errors in names (Edmund Hunter or Edwin? Gray or Grey?); and typos and unclear sequences of events. Such flubs do easily creep into projects this complex. Pearson’s latest exploration is a worthy read, especially for people embarking on a personal exploration of Irish literature, or seeking the meaning in another’s.

        "content": "There are breakups and then there are breakups. And the breakup of Kevin Falcon and John Rustad , on full display last week, is a truly nasty one of epic proportions. Rustad, the leader of the BC Conservative Party, rejected a bizarre proposal from Falcon’s party, BC United, to carve up the electoral map along lines that greatly favoured the United side. The next day, Falcon’s party unleashed a full personal attack on Rustad, calling him selfish and accusing him of putting his ambitions ahead of the public interest. Rustad returned fire, saying Falcon was “irrational and unreasonable and prepared to lie.” Hoo boy. But a close examination of what BC United was proposing shows Rustad made the right call if he is truly interested in growing his party and taking on the NDP government. Story continues below advertisement Agreeing to the audacious and somewhat absurd proposal from BC United would have likely buried his party’s chance of emerging as the alternative to the sitting government. Or even climbing to become the Official Opposition party. 8:35 Political Panel: Merger talks with BC United and BC Conservatives The BC United proposal would effectively prevent either party from forming a majority government on its own, as it would allow the BC Conservatives to field a maximum of 47 candidates and the BC United Party a maximum of 46. The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. BC United proposed keeping its 15 incumbent candidates and entering a “draft” which would see the BC Conservatives select three candidates for everyone candidate chosen by BC United until the two sides had equal numbers and then it would be alternative picks. The problem with this approach, from the BC Conservatives’ perspective, is that BC United would get to keep much of the most potentially conservative regions of the province, forcing the BC Conservatives into hitting a wall early on when it came to putting candidates in competitive ridings. Story continues below advertisement For example, the Peace River region, the Cariboo, Kamloops, east Kootenays and south Delta – eight ridings that could quite conceivably line up behind the BC Conservatives come the October election – would all be off-limits because they are all currently represented by BC United incumbents. Trending Now Grayson Murray, 2-time PGA Tour winner, dead at age 30 Government by Gmail: Doug Ford’s chief of staff used private email for ‘political discussions’ The NDP has a vice-grip on about 40 ridings (it won 44 seats with a victory margin of at least 15 percentage points in 2020, and 35 seats with a margin of more than 20 per cent), which means there is precious little real estate left to pursue after you include the 15 BC United candidates. 4:19 What Brad West says about possible BC Conservative and BC United Party merger Under this proposed drafting system, the BC Conservatives would be able to name candidates in about 20 ridings that might be considered winnable. Most of its other candidates would be sacrificial lambs in NDP fortress ridings like Vancouver-Hastings, Vancouver-Renfrew or any of the Burnaby and Vancouver Island ridings. Story continues below advertisement The strongest conservative regions are the North, the Interior and the Fraser Valley, and BC United wants to hang onto as much of its territory in those areas as possible. Hence the wacky proposal, and hence Rustad’s quick and firm rejection of it. The BC United Party, struggling to stay afloat in B.C.’s turbulent political waters, was hoping to be tossed a lifesaver by Rustad and the BC Conservatives. Instead, Rustad and his side opted to throw them an anvil. Keith Baldrey is the chief political reporter for Global BC .

        "content": "Pope Francis shocks bishops by allegedly saying gay men should not be admitted to church seminaries because 'there's already too much f*****ry' Bishops told Italian media the comments were met with 'incredulous laughter' By Elena Salvoni Published: 21:40, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:58, 27 May 2024 e-mail 8 shares 4 View comments Pope Francis has allegedly shocked bishops in Italy by using an offensive slur when saying that homosexual men should not be admitted to church seminaries because there is already 'too much' gay sexual activity. The pontiff told a closed-door meeting at an episcopal conference at the Vatican that homosexual men should not be allowed into colleges to train for the priesthood, Italian media reports. Bishops at the meeting were reportedly taken aback by the language he used to make this statement - the derogatory word 'frociaggine', which roughly translates to f*****ry. The remark was met with 'incredulous laughter', bishops told newspaper Corriere della Sera . They suggested that it was an honest mistake by the Pope, for whom Italian is a second language, and that he did not know how offensive the word was. The alleged comments, which seem to go against recent moves to amend seminary admission rules, have come as a surprise to some in the church as Francis is known for taking a more liberal view than his predecessors on LGBT rights. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past When asked about his views on homosexuality in 2013, he famously said: 'If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?' Last year, he described laws that criminalise homosexuality as a 'sin' and an 'injustice', and allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples in a significant advance for LGBT rights in the church. However, the Pope delivered a similar message on gay seminarians - minus the reported swear word - when he met Italian bishops in 2018, telling them to carefully vet priesthood applicants and reject anyone suspected of being homosexual. Reports about his comments at the May 20 meeting come after bishops approved a document regulating admission to Italian seminaries, according to Corriere. The paper reported that members 'approved by majority vote an amendment that recognized the distinction between simple homosexual orientation and 'deeply rooted tendencies.' This, it suggests, means 'in substance, that a homosexual person could be admitted to the seminary if, like the heterosexual, he gave the guarantee that he knows how to live the discipline of celibacy.' However, it reportedly implies 'that it is more difficult for homosexuals because they will be living in an all-male community for many years.' Francis' latest remarks suggest he is taking 'a more radical' view on the issue, by preventing gay men from being allowed to join altogether. The Holy See has not approved the document, according to reports, and the issue is still under discussion. The comments were allegedly made in a closed-door meeting ahead of the conference. Pictured: The opening session of the 79th general assembly of the Italian Bishops Conference The 2005 Vatican document, which was endorsed by Francis in 2016, states that the Church 'cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called \"gay culture.\"' There is so far no official record of the Pope's latest comments on the issue. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past. He has previously said that if a boy is unsure about his sexuality and is facing mental health challenges he might need 'psychiatric' support. It widely believed he instead meant 'psychological' help, words he has also confused on other occasions.

        "content": "WORTHINGTON — The For Camila Clothing Boutique opened in April in the former Java Nau building on Oxford Street and offers clothing for children from newborn to age five. Store owner Maria Peters said she was inspired to offer children’s clothes in a community she considered to be lacking such apparel. “Seeing the lack of clothing for children in our area is what inspired me to open a business,” she said. “We don’t have a lot of businesses in our area that currently carry infant clothes specifically. I think that’s what sets (For Camila) apart.” Despite the store being named “For Camila,” Peters is a mother of two boys with no daughters of her own. She said the store’s name is a nod to her Mexican heritage while also being a beautiful name. “Camila is just a little girl name that I like,” she shared. “It is a name that is very common for girls in Mexico where I’m from. That’s kind of where it originated.” ADVERTISEMENT Being located in what was once a drive-thru only business, Peters likes the location because of its manageable size for a new business owner and the traffic it sees in its location. She said she has even used its drive-thru windows. “At the time I was looking (for a space), I wanted something that would be manageable for me as far as size,” she said. \"I felt like this was a small enough size to start off at, as well as good exposure with it being located on Oxford Street. We have a drive-thru window, making it more convenient for moms so you don’t even have to get out of your vehicle.” Having a small retail space has posed some challenges — like not having as much inventory as she'd like, but she is just starting the business and wanted to start small. “Inventory is limited, so I really have to maximize my space in here,” Peters said. The size, however, also is a benefit because it allows her to work more closely with her customers — something she said she greatly enjoys as a new business owner. “Having people come in and just talk to people is already in itself fun and what I look forward to the most,” she said. “Seeing the customers wearing the clothes and happy with their purchases here, I think, is a lot of fun. Because we are a small business, we work very hand in hand with our customers and what the customers want. We’re very attuned to what they want and what they need. I love to receive their feedback.” For more information or to view the store’s selection of clothes, visit forcamila.com, For Camila’s Facebook page or call (507) 360-1327.",

        "description": "'The fire department and medical personnel met the aircraft out of an abundance of caution,' a United Airlines spokesperson said.",
        "content": "An engine caught fire on a United Airlines flight at Chicago’s O'Hare International Airport on May 27, causing the pilots to abort takeoff. United Airlines flight 2091 from Chicago to Seattle experienced an engine fire at around 2 p.m. local time at O'Hare airport shortly before takeoff, a spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement. The incident led the FAA to temporarily suspend arrivals to the airport, with normal operations resuming at around 2:45 p.m. local time, the spokesperson added. The aircraft, an Airbus A320, was towed to the gate where passengers “safely deplaned,” per the FAA spokesperson. A spokesperson for United Airlines confirmed in an emailed statement to The Epoch Times that the flight in question, which was scheduled to depart for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, was delayed after experiencing an “issue” with the engine, “which our local ground crew and emergency responders immediately addressed.” “The plane was towed to the gate, passengers deplaned normally and no injuries were reported. We are working to make alternative travel arrangements for customers,” the spokesperson added. The United Airlines spokesperson said that 148 passengers and five crew members were on board the aircraft when the incident occurred. “The fire department and medical personnel met the aircraft out of an abundance of caution,” the spokesperson said. “Recent safety events with United Airlines—such as flight diversions that can be traced to mechanical problems—serve to remind us that FAA oversight of maintenance programs is paramount,” the watchdog’s memo reads. United Airlines has experienced about a dozen incidents over the past few months, according to a review by The Epoch Times. These include a chunk of the outer aluminum skin falling off the belly of a Boeing 737-800, a United flight being forced to return to Houston after an engine caught fire, and a tire falling off a United Boeing 777 during takeoff in San Francisco. Part of the audit will take place at the FAA’s headquarters in Washington and several regional offices. It will also include visits to United maintenance hubs in Chicago, Houston, and San Francisco. Because of recent safety events, the FAA has increased oversight of United Airlines to ensure compliance with safety regulations, identification of hazards and risk mitigation, and effective safety management, The Epoch Times has learned. An FAA spokesperson told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement that it welcomes outside scrutiny and will “cooperate fully with the audit.” A United Airlines spokesperson said the company had nothing to share on the development as the audit is focused on the FAA’s oversight.",

        "content": "Former Attorney General Sobusa Gula-Ndebele’’s son, Eleph Khumbula Gula-Ndebele, has been granted bail after he was arrested over the weekend for allegations of drug possession after he was caught with cocaine in his car. Gula-Ndebele, who is also a lawyer, was implicated in dealing dangerous drugs by a victim of drug abuse, Tsitsi Vundla, who was arrested in March 2024. Law enforcement officers raided his residence, suspecting the presence of illegal drugs. Upon arrival, the police identified themselves and proceeded to search both Gula-Ndebele and his property. Discovery of Suspected Cocaine On The Premises During the search, detectives discovered a sachet of a substance believed to be cocaine concealed within the door panel of Gula-Ndebele’s black Volkswagen Polo. The confiscated material was taken for testing. Subsequent field tests confirmed that the substance was indeed cocaine, weighing approximately 1 gram. The estimated street value of the cocaine was pegged at ZIG$390.

Ministers have bought “anti-barricade door jacks” capable of smashing through metal-reinforced cell doors in less than 60 seconds. The purchase was revealed in contract documents uncovered by Labour . The Ministry of Justice called it an “essential piece of equipment” in “today’s challenging custodial environments”. There were nearly 1,400 barricading incidents in prisons last year, more than three times the number recorded in 2010, official figures show. Shadow Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said: “This is a last-ditch attempt [by the Tories] to deal with the summer of violent unrest and riots.” A Prison Service spokesman said: “We make no apologies for taking every necessary step in keeping our staff and prisoners safe.” A crack prison riot squad, the National Tactical Response Group, was deployed more in 2023 than 2022. The prison officers’ union may take the Government to court if the overcrowding crisis worsens.",

        "content": "Trevor Larnach hit a three-run home run, Jose Miranda added a two-run shot and the Minnesota Twins escaped with a 6-5 win over the Kansas City Royals on Monday afternoon in Minneapolis. Alex Kirilloff also drove in a run for Minnesota, which earned its fifth win in the past six games. The teams will meet again Tuesday night in the second contest of a four-game series. Royals hitters Vinnie Pasquantino, Hunter Renfroe, Dairon Blanco and Maikel Garcia each had an RBI. Kansas City has lost back-to-back games after winning the previous eight in a row. Twins right-hander Joe Ryan (4-3) allowed one run on four hits in seven innings. He walked none and struck out nine, which marked his second-most strikeouts of the season. Royals right-hander Alec Marsh (4-2) allowed five runs on five hits in seven innings. He struck out seven with two walks. Twins closer Jhoan Duran collected his seventh save despite a rough ninth inning. He entered the game with two outs in the ninth and Minnesota leading 6-2. Duran promptly hit MJ Melendez with a pitch to load the bases. He then gave up back-to-back RBI infield singles to Blanco and Garcia, and a throwing error by Twins third baseman Willi Castro allowed another run to score as the Royals pulled within 6-5. Duran then got Bobby Witt Jr. to ground out with runners on second and third to end the game. The Twins grabbed a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the third. Edouard Julien hit a one-out single to left, and Miranda followed in the next at-bat with a 437-foot shot to center. In the fifth, Larnach belted a three-run shot to make it 5-0. His 441-foot homer to center also scored Castro and Julien, both of whom reached on walks. Kansas City got on the scoreboard with Pasquantino's RBI single in the sixth. Kirilloff responded for the Twins with an RBI single in the eighth to make it 6-1. The Royals cut the deficit to 6-2 in the top of the ninth. Renfroe pulled a curveball to left for an RBI double that scored Salvador Perez, before Duran replaced fellow reliever Cole Sands to finish the game. --Field Level Media",

The court heard that the man committed the offence in 2021. The Lautoka High Court judge stated that the man breached the trust as he was well known to the complainant and her family. The judge said that there was a large disparity in age between him and the complainant, and at the time of the offence, the man was 76 years of age while the complainant was less than nine years old. Justice Riyaz Hamza said that he took advantage of the complainant’s vulnerability, helplessness, and naivety. The man has been remanded for about seven and a half months, and he will now have to serve 13 years and four months of imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years and four months.",

PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH Dunedin police were warned a rising tide of violence among the city’s teenagers could end in a death only an hour before a fatal stabbing at the bus hub.",
        "content": "Police are ensuring they are more visible at the Dunedin bus hub following the death of Enere Mclaren-Taana last Thursday. PHOTO: PETER MCINTOSH It comes as Dunedin Mayor Jules Radich yesterday announced the formation of a multi-agency working group dedicated to changing the culture at the central city hub. The father of a Dunedin teenager, whose son was assaulted at secondary school about a month ago, told the Otago Daily Times his wife called police at 2pm on Thursday last week to check on the status of the investigation into their son’s assault. The police responded by saying they had been too busy to investigate her son’s assault and she replied by saying \"someone is going to die if you guys don’t start taking this stuff seriously\". A little over an hour later Trinity Catholic College pupil Enere Mclaren-Taana, 16, was stabbed to death. The teenager’s father said police had now carried out an interview with the boy who they believe assaulted their son. \"But it took a death before they actually got around to doing anything. \"That’s what’s annoying me, they’re saying they got there within a minute, but they’ve had so many warnings.\" He said the teenager who assaulted their son led a crew of followers, who he called his \"soldiers\", who had been intimidating other teenagers around the city, including at the bus hub. They had complained about their son’s assault, including providing a voice recording of another teenager threatening to slit his throat, to police about a month ago and had got nowhere. Their son was scared to go back to school and has not been back to the bus hub since. \"He’s been wanting to carry a knife and I said ‘no, you can’t do that’.\" When he found out Enere had died, he felt terrible. \"It was almost like we were almost responsible for it. \"We were just trying to warn them because it was getting out of hand.\" The father said another parent who had stopped a fight in the bus hub and was trying to make a complaint had also been \"brushed aside\" by police in the past. \"I think they thought it’s just normal teenage stuff.\" The father felt security at the bus hub was ineffective and called for police presence between 3pm and 5pm on weekdays. A police spokesman said there would be more of a police presence from 3pm to 5pm at the bus hub. He said the safety of the community was not solely a police issue, and they worked closely with different agencies to ensure everyone in the community was safe. \"That important work continues.\" Trinity Catholic College year 12 pupil Enere Mclaren-Taana’s school ID photo from this year. PHOTO: SUPPLIED Logan Park High School principal Peter Hills said pupils, parents and the wider community had all expressed concern about the bus hub as a gathering point. \"There is a desire from all the groups I have mentioned for students to be picked up from schools and taken home rather than a central location, but we can’t control the funding or the bus schedule. \"I imagine that will be a subject of conversation for all schools, and the regional council and the city council, and all the people interested in it.\" In a statement yesterday, Mr Radich said he and representatives from the Dunedin City Council, Otago Regional Council and police met yesterday morning and agreed on a new group. \"While our focus as a city needs to remain on supporting Enere’s whānau as they prepare to farewell their loved one, we also need to do what we can to ensure this sort of tragedy isn’t repeated,\" Mr Radich said. The terms of reference were being drafted and would seek to ensure schools, bus users, and the wider community were all represented. The group would aim to develop short-, medium- and long-term options that could be implemented to improve the culture at the bus hub, and it would meet regularly. \"Last week’s terrible tragedy has sent shockwaves through our community, and we all need to come together to address the issues.\" Otago Regional Council chairwoman Gretchen Robertson said public safety at the hub was a priority for all parties. \"This new group is exactly what we need to be doing — working together to tackle the safety issues there.\" In the meantime there would be an increased security presence at the bus hub alongside a beefed-up police presence, and Bus Stop B would remain closed as a mark of respect. \"We are aware of issues at the hub and are working hard to support people with added security and presence.\" Police Otago Coastal Area Commander Inspector Marty Gray said police wanted to work with all parties to improve safety. \"We’re looking forward to having an active role in the group and helping ensure everyone can use the bus hub with confidence.\" Meanwhile, Ministry of Education Te Tai Runanga (south) leader Nancy Bell said it was in contact with 12 schools last week, as the impact of a traumatic event such as this could be far-reaching. The ministry’s traumatic incidents teams could work alongside schools to support them in managing the incident safely — which included understanding the emotional and psychological impacts and the effects on how people behaved. The ministry was providing some resources to Trinity Catholic College to increase pastoral support for pupils this week.",

The company had asked for approval to give shareholders the millions it had raised for a partnership with Subway in the United States, which had not eventuated. The plan was opposed by brand founder and minority shareholder Chris Mason through his family trust. Mason had claimed shareholders had not received enough information from Burger Fuel about the proposal, that the capital return wasn’t in the business or shareholders’ best interests, and that it may not have been fair and equitable. Burger Fuel and its majority shareholder and chief executive Josef Roberts had maintained that because the money had been raised for a specific purpose that had not gone ahead, the money should go back to shareholders.

        "content": "Photo: Jeremy Hainsworth. New deputies announced in February will fill positions in Oliver, Kamloops, Prince George, Victoria and the Lower Mainland. Murder and a murder conspiracy cases were delayed in B.C. Supreme Court May 27 due to a shortage of sheriffs that continues in B.C. despite the attorney general’s assurances it is being dealt with. Justice Kathleen Ker came into court to hear the two cases but had to leave as there was no sheriff. Sheriffs are required in courtrooms to provide security for proceedings. They also move prisoners around courthouses and transport them to court. About a dozen lawyers, including four publicly paid Crown prosecutors, were left milling around outside the courtroom at the Vancouver Law Courts on Monday. One case involved an appearance by Pascal Jean Claude Bouthillete. He and Sandy Jack Parisian were accused in the death of 78-year-old Usha Singh. Singh, who lived alone, was found badly beaten in her house on Jan. 31, 2021. Vancouver police said two men gained entry to Singh’s Little Mountain home around 6 a.m. by posing as police officers. Singh succumbed to her injuries in hospital two days later. Parisian and Bouthillete were arrested on Feb. 3, 2021. The conspiracy to commit murder case involves multiple accused. Two men are facing the court together while a third is facing the charges separately. Due to a series of publication bans in the case and the separate trials, Glacier Media has chosen not to publish details at this time. Court delays in B.C.’s justice system due to sheriff shortages have become more common in recent years. Thirty-one courtrooms were closed in Abbotsford, North Vancouver, Port Coquitlam and Surrey between Aug. 14 and Sept. 13, 2023. Earlier in 2023, sources told Glacier Media courtroom closures included those in Vancouver, Abbotsford, Port Coquitlam, Surrey, Victoria, Chilliwack and Kamloops. Concerns have already been expressed before judges and by judges that delays could begin to hamper people's right to a trial within a reasonable time period. This comes before the courts as lawyers begin mentioning the application of the so-called Jordan principles whereby that right is upheld. The Jordan principles stem from a case that wound up in the Supreme Court of Canada. Stays of proceedings are possible if a case hits a ceiling of 18 months for those tried in the provincial court and 30 months for cases in superior courts. On the May 27 Vancouver Provincial Court list alone, there were 32 cases listed in excess of 300 days (or nearly 10 months). “Delay attributable to or waived by the defence does not count towards the presumptive ceiling,” the high court said. Attorney General Nikki Sharma has acknowledged the problems created by the shortage and stressed the provincial government is working on recruiting new sheriffs. In February, Sharma announced the addition of 13 new deputies . \"Everyone who uses the court system expects it to run safely and smoothly,\" Sharma said in a statement at the time. \"Sheriffs provide critical protective and enforcement services for the judiciary, Crown, defence, court staff and the public. That's why it's so encouraging that more people than ever are applying to join the BC Sheriff Service.\" The new deputies will fill positions in Oliver, Kamloops, Prince George, Victoria and the Lower Mainland, Sharma said. Getting those recruits to courtrooms, however, does take time as they need to undergo training at the Justice Institute of BC. Glacier Media has reached out to the Ministry of Attorney General for comment on the May 27 proceedings.",

        "content": "Tatjana Stefanski went to the police detachments in both Lumby and Vernon, B.C., months before she was killed to report that her safety had been threatened. B.C.’s police watchdog is now looking into the complaint Stefanski brought forward Dec. 18, 2023. The Independent Investigations Office said last week that its investigation “will now seek to determine what, if any role police action or inaction may have played in the woman’s death.” Whatever they uncover comes too late to help Stefanski. Whether it makes a difference to women facing violence in years to come also remains to be seen, Angela Marie MacDougall, the executive director of Battered Women’s Support Services in Vancouver, said. For years, she said, policies have been in place to protect women in vulnerable positions but it’s not making an impact. Story continues below advertisement “What we see is that (police) are not following their own policies,” MacDougall said. “(Police) are not taking the violence seriously. They’re not believing victims when they share their concerns and their fears and every once in a while we see ... that there are lethal consequences.” BC Prosecution has not laid charges and the RCMP has not named a suspect in Stefanski’s death. On April 13 RCMP issued an alert for the community to keep an eye out for Stefanski, saying she was last seen with her ex-husband. 2:22 Daughter of Lumby homicide victim Tatjana Stefanski speaks out on her devastating loss. A day later, her body was found in a wooded area, a short drive from the Lumby home she shared with her partner Jason Gaudreault and her two children. Police said an unnamed man was arrested near the scene and subsequently released. The investigation is ongoing. Story continues below advertisement MacDougall sees Stefanski’s plight as an example of the RCMPs “lackadaisical approach to dealing with domestic violence.” The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. “Maybe this is the first time in a death that we’re seeing that the IIO is involved in checking what they did or didn’t do, but it’s beyond comprehension that we could even think that the police are even remotely a remedy or even remotely an agent for public safety when we’re talking about women who are dealing with abusive (people) who will kill them,” she said. It was Gaudreault who prompted Stefanski to make a complaint to police in December 2023 after a man she knew sent a threat to her well-being to her parents in Germany.

Hard to tell, police say Ontario couple who fled to Europe found guilty in murder of business partner Truck driver in Humboldt Broncos bus crash ordered to be deported “I don’t know the law,” Gaudreault said. “Do I feel this should have been taken more seriously? Yes, absolutely, it should have been to the most extreme seriousness.” Gaudreault is desperately hoping his loss prompts change. “I hope that this investigation that the IIO is doing really is an eye-opener for all of legislation or law-makers ... like how can we change this to make it better,” he said. In recent weeks Gaudreault has been more focused on his concerns that the person who was originally arrested remains at large. He said they have come near his home, and he in turn has been moving the children home to home to stay safe. Trending Now Thousands of NÜTRL tumblers recalled after dozens report illness 369 stolen vehicles from Ontario worth $33M recovered, many at Port of Montreal Story continues below advertisement He’s continually put out a public plea for “catch and release” policies to be put to bed and arrests be made when a suspect is known to police. MacDougall said he’s not alone in his concerns. It’s likely that the charges aren’t coming forward due to R . v. Jordan, a court decision that put a ceiling for reasonable trial times, she said. 2:22 Daughter of Lumby homicide victim Tatjana Stefanski speaks out on her devastating loss. “At the heart of this new framework is a presumptive ceiling beyond which delay — from the charge to the actual or anticipated end of trial — is presumed to be unreasonable, unless exceptional circumstances justify it,” reads the court decision that limits the amount of time a trial can drag on. “The presumptive ceiling is 18 months for cases tried in the provincial court, and 30 months for cases in the superior court (or cases tried in the provincial court after a preliminary inquiry). Delay attributable to or waived by the defence does not count towards the presumptive ceiling.” Story continues below advertisement MacDougall said there have been a number of cases that have been thrown out because the clock runs out before the ceiling is reached. “We noticed that police aren’t in lots of domestic violence cases right now,” she said. “You know, they’re not doing charges if they don’t think they have enough evidence, because they in the past they would arrest and then do the investigation and gather the evidence ... and put together the package. But now they’ll need to have the full package prepared in advance for the Crown to approve the charges because if they don’t and ... time runs out, then the charges are stale and it’s useless.”",

        "content": "Article content A Mill Woods business was left in ashes after an overnight fire in the early hours of Monday morning. Shortly after 2:40 a.m. on Monday, Edmonton Fire Rescue Services (EFRS) responded to a call at a strip mall located at 1079 Knottwood Rd. East in Mill Woods. A fire had broken out in the corner of a row of businesses in the strip mall, causing damage to two shops and leaving a third destroyed. EFRS said that no injuries were reported in the fire and that an investigation is underway. A slow stream of people visited the strip mall on Monday morning with the parking lot still wet from the EFRS efforts to put out the blaze earlier in the morning. Some people were headed to the businesses that remained open while others had come to take a look at the burned-out storefront. Wedged between Blasters Ice Cream and a Medicine Shoppe pharmacy, Hamud Halal Meat and Grocery store had a burned-out front, allowing viewers a look into the charred innards of the shop. The owner of the pharmacy, who asked not to be named, stood nervously in front of a neighbouring daycare with his leg jittering as the fire inspectors entered the burned-out building. The pharmacist hadn’t entered his shop yet and wasn’t sure what the state of it was. As he waited uneasily to see how his business had fared from the nearby flames, he said his main concern is for his customers, who had prescriptions that they were counting on receiving. The owner of the nearby Menisa Mart, Avi Bachu, only learned of the fire when she got to work Monday morning. She said she hadn’t heard many details about the blaze, except that a morning customer who lives in the area said that they’d heard a loud bang through the night around when the fire started. Others said they also heard loud noises. A resident of the area, Larry Jamieson, said that he’d heard loud popping that woke up him and his wife up shortly before the fire trucks arrived on scene. The pops, he said, were consecutive and remembered hearing roughly 30 of them around 2:15 a.m. Looking out the window of his home, Jamieson said he saw significant white smoke rising as high as four trees stacked on top of each other. Across the mall, Caleb Hesse from JT’s Bar and Grill said a few of his customers mentioned hearing similar sounds. “They said they could hear it going off for quite a while because there were explosions. It almost was so loud that it sounded like it was gunshots going off,” Hesse said. The EFRS public information office said the call had come in at 2:40 a.m., with fire crews arriving on scene just four minutes later. Jamieson said the popping noises stopped once EFRS was on scene as flashing lights from emergency vehicles including police vehicles swirled in the night sky. EFRS said 10 fire crews were on site, amounting to 40 firefighters working on the blaze starting at 2:40 a.m. Crews had the fire under control just after 3 a.m. and it was declared extinguished at 5:03 a.m. Edmonton police spokesperson, Cheryl Voordenhout said in an email that police responded to multiple reports of an explosion and fire at a grocery store on Knottwood Road East around 2:30 a.m. and that it is being investigated as a suspicious fire. With 10 different stores, the mall is a hub for the local community and Hesse said the area is often fairly busy. The grocer, ice cream store and pharmacy are the only stores with visible damage. zdelaney@postmedia.com Twitter/X: @ZacharyDelaney",

Wawrinka handed Andy Murray a 6-4 6-4 6-2 first-round defeat under the lights, prematurely ending what is likely the Briton's last appearance at the claycourt Grand Slam. Andy Murray accepts he may not get the fairytale ending his incredible career deserves The Swiss came into the clash having won two of the duo's three clashes at the major, including a draining five-setter in the 2017 semi-finals from which Murray's creaking hip never recovered and eventually forced him to have surgeries. Having sent Murray packing in straight sets in the opening round four years ago, the 39-year-old Wawrinka shot out of the blocks again in the duo's 23rd career meeting by grabbing a break in the first game. The 2015 champion wrapped up the opening set on the back of a couple of booming serves and pounced in the third game of the second set with a string of heavy single-handed backhands from the baseline to heap the pressure on Murray. Stan Wawrinka handed Murray a 6-4 6-4 6-2 first-round defeat under the lights Murray, who at 37 has stated that he is unlikely to play beyond the summer, rode a wave of support at Philippe Chatrier court and battled on but was unable to prevent fellow three-times Grand Slam champion Wawrinka from going two sets up. A medical timeout for Wawrinka's left calf issue delayed the start of the third set, but 2016 runner-up Murray's movement was also compromised due to an apparent leg issue that allowed his opponent to run away with the contest.

        "description": "More than $3 million in pandemic-related penalties remain unpaid well after most restrictions were lifted and the state's borders reopened.",
        "content": "Queensland authorities are pursuing more than $3 million in outstanding COVID 19-related penalties years after the state's borders reopened and most restrictions were lifted. Throughout the course of the pandemic, thousands of fines worth millions of dollars have referred to the State Penalties Enforcement Registry (SPER) to ensure rule breakers pay what they owe. As of May this year, there are about $3.6 million in debts related to 2,186 pandemic fines that remain unpaid. The unpaid debts include fees that have been added by SPER, and also include the outstanding amounts of fines that have already been partially paid. Off the $3.6 million that is yet to be paid, about 47 per cent is subject to active enforcement from SPER and roughly 37 per cent is being managed under a payment plan. A SPER spokesperson said where individuals or organisations failed to deal with their debt, the agency would take enforcement action to collect the unpaid penalty. \"SPER debts don't go away, so if you've got a SPER debt the best thing you can do is pay it now,\" the spokesperson said. \"Anyone having trouble paying their SPER debts should contact SPER on 1300 365 635 to discuss their payment options and avoid enforcement action.\" The outstanding fines are linked to breaches of public health directions and border directions that were made during the pandemic. Nearly half a million written off Since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, more than $7.5 million in fines had been referred to SPER, which included additional fees added by the collection agency. More than half of the outstanding debt had been paid or was on a payment plan, while 5 per cent had been withdrawn by authorities. SPER had also written off 219 COVID 19-related fines worth about $400,000 but did not provide specific reasons for the written off debts. The agency can wipe debts from its books in circumstances such as when the debtor has died, the debtor cannot be located, or reasonable actions to recover the debt have been exhausted. SPER's enforcement powers allow them to suspend driver's licences or even seize somebody's property to sell at auction. Queensland's borders reopened in December 2021, with all remaining domestic border restrictions lifted in January 2022. In March 2022, the state government also eased many restrictions, such as most mask-wearing requirements and density limits at venues. As of April this year, the total amount of debt sitting on SPER's books was worth more than $1.3 billion.",

        "description": "The alleged mastermind behind the \"Culiacanazo\" is now in U.S. custody, where he might remain for the rest of his life.The post ‘El Nini,’ alleged security chief for Sinaloa Cartel, extradited to US appeared first on Mexico News Daily",
        "content": "Néstor Isidro Pérez Salas, the alleged security chief for the “Los Chapitos” faction of the Sinaloa Cartel known as “El Nini,” was extradited to the United States on Saturday, U.S. authorities said. U.S. President Joe Biden and Attorney General Merrick B. Garland both issued statements to announce the extradition of Pérez, just six months after his arrest in Culiacán, Sinaloa, last November . Biden noted that the suspect known as “El Nini” faces charges in the United States “for his role in illicit fentanyl trafficking and for murdering, torturing, and kidnapping numerous rivals, witnesses, and others.” “This is a good day for justice,” he said before thanking President Andrés Manuel López Obrador “for his decision to extradite this dangerous criminal.” Garland said that U.S. authorities “allege El Nini was one of the Sinaloa Cartel’s lead sicarios , or assassins, and was responsible for the murder, torture, and kidnapping of rivals and witnesses who threatened the cartel’s criminal drug trafficking enterprise.” “... I am grateful to our Mexican government counterparts for their extraordinary efforts in apprehending and extraditing El Nini. With this enforcement action, El Nini joins the growing list of cartel leaders and associates indicted in, and extradited to, the United States,” added the attorney general. Pérez faces organized crime, weapon possession, fentanyl trafficking and money laundering charges in the state of New York. He also faces a range of charges in the District of Columbia. Prior to his arrest, U.S. authorities were offering a US $3 million reward for information leading to his capture. Pérez is allegedly responsible for the Sinaloa Cartel’s response to the 2019 arrest of Ovidio Guzmán, a son of convicted drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán . Federal authorities released Ovidio after the cartel unleashed a wave of attacks in Culiacán . The so-called battle of Culiacán on Oct. 17, 2019, is colloquially known as the Culiacanazo. Mexican authorities recaptured Ovidio Guzmán in early 2023, triggering a wave of violence in Culiacán that left 30 people dead including 10 soldiers. He was extradited to the United States last September . Guzmán’s extradition and that of El Nini are among the highest-profile extraditions during the presidency of López Obrador, who took office in late 2018. Pérez is allegedly the leader of “Los Ninis,” the security apparatus of Los Chapitos, led by sons of El Chapo, including Ovidio until his arrest. El Nini allegedly spearheaded Los Chapitos’ war against rival criminal group Los Rusos — another faction of the Sinaloa Cartel led by Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada García — for control of Mexico’s northwest border region. His nickname is a derogatory term for a person who neither works nor studies. After his arrest in late 2023, security expert David Saucedo said that Pérez’s capture was a clear sign that U.S. and Mexican forces were still taking a hard line against Los Chapitos, despite the group’s claim that it had banned the production and sale of fentanyl in Sinaloa . Biden said Saturday that the U.S. and Mexican governments “will continue to work together to attack the fentanyl and synthetic drug epidemic that is killing so many people in our homelands and globally, and to bring to justice the criminals and organizations producing, smuggling, and selling these lethal poisons in both of our countries.” With reports from Aristegui Noticias",

        "content": "Warsaw: Poland will introduce restrictions on the movement of Russian diplomats on its territory due to Moscow’s involvement in a hybrid war against the European Union, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on Monday. Relations between Poland and Russia have deteriorated sharply since Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into neighbouring Ukraine in February 2022. Poland’s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski. Credit: Bloomberg Warsaw has also accused Moscow of spying activity and taking part in acts of sabotage on its territory. “These are national decisions, but we have evidence that the Russian state is involved in authorising sabotage in our country as well. We hope that the Russian Federation will treat this as a very serious warning,” Radoslaw Sikorski told journalists in Brussels. The Russian embassy in Warsaw did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Sikorski added that the embassy would receive a note on the matter soon and that the restriction would apply to all embassy and consulates’ personnel except for the ambassador. They will be allowed to travel only within the province where they are assigned. Polish armed forces’ Chief of Staff General Wieslaw Kukula, right, and Deputy Defence Minister Cezary Tomczyk, left, speak about a program of strengthening the defence of NATO’S eastern flank. Credit: AP Plans to restrict Russian diplomats’ movements come as Polish defence officials presented a plan to strengthen anti-drone surveillance and on-ground military defence through a system of fortifications and barriers along about 700 kilometres of its eastern border with Russia and Russian ally Belarus. The government says Poland is being targeted by hostile actions from Russia and Belarus. They include cyberattacks, attempted arson and migrants being pushed illegally across the border, which officials describe as intended to destabilise the European Union, of which Poland is a member.",

Russia said it has taken two more villages as part of its assault in eastern Ukraine and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged allies to rethink their restrictions on using Western weapons to strike inside Russia, a key demand of the Ukrainian president. \"We need to intensify our joint work with our partners to achieve more. Security and tangible coercion of Russia to peace by all means,\" Zelensky told a joint press conference with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. On the back foot, Ukraine has been pressing its backers -- especially the United States -- to allow it to use longer-range weapons they supply to hit targets inside Russia. Washington and other allies have been reluctant to permit Kyiv to strike over the border out of fear that it could drag them closer to direct conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia. Zelensky pressed home the point in Madrid. \"We need to work together and put pressure not only on Russia, but also on our partners to give us the opportunity to defend ourselves against Russia,\" Zelensky said. \"Even those partners who are afraid to give this or that advice should understand that air defence is defence, not attack,\" reiterating his call for aerial defence systems capable of intercepting the 3,000 aerial bombs hitting Ukraine each month. Zelensky was to arrive in Brussels on Tuesday to sign a bilateral security accord with Belgium and was also expected in Portugal. And there are signs of a Western rethink on his demands. Stoltenberg told NATO lawmakers in Sofia that the time had come to reconsider lifting those restrictions. \"If (Ukraine) cannot attack military targets on Russian territory then it ties one hand of the Ukrainians on their back and makes it very hard for them to conduct defence.\" On Sunday, however, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposed giving Ukraine greater flexibility on Russian targets. \"I think we have to be very careful,\" she told Italian television. Earlier this month, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv that Ukraine had every right to use British-donated missiles to strike inside Russian territory. Questioned on Monday, Sanchez was evasive, saying he \"had no such desire\". \"We will be at Ukraine's side for as long as it takes,\" Sanchez said, announcing a military aid package as part of a security pact \"to enable Ukraine to strengthen its defence capabilities.\" Ukraine is calling for US Patriot air defence systems to counter Russian bombardments, arguing that it has only a quarter of the resources it needs. In Madrid, Zelensky said he needed \"seven additional Patriot systems,\" including \"at least two for Kharkiv,\" which is close to the Russian border and is being regularly shelled. Sanchez said Spain had already sent Patriot missiles to Kyiv, and is \"working with various allied countries to see exactly\" how many more launchers can be sent. Ukraine's army chief Oleksandr Syrsky said on social media that French military instructors would soon arrive in the war-battered country and that he had \"signed the documents\" so they could start visiting training bases. Officially no NATO country has instructors in Ukraine and the country's defence ministry later issued a statement saying that it was still \"in discussions\" with France and other countries on the issue. France's defence ministry said the request was being studied \"to understand their exact needs\". French President Emmanuel Macron has not ruled out sending troops to Ukraine if the conflict worsens. Russia on Monday claimed to have captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, where a strike on a hypermarket in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, killed 17 people on Saturday, according to a new toll. A new strike on an industrial zone in the city killed a woman on Monday, authorities said. A separate Russian attack on the village of Snigurivka in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv left three dead, including two teenagers, and wounded six more, the regional governor said. © Copyright AFP 2024.

        "description": "Criminals are stealing and intimidating customers, city centre business owners say.",
        "content": "By Felix Walton of RNZ Criminals in Auckland’s city centre are harassing staff, stealing and scaring customers away , business owners say. One restaurateur is making his staff walk to their cars in groups over safety concerns , while another is calling for more police patrols. Michael Dearth owns two restaurants in Auckland’s city centre: The Grove in St Patrick’s Square and Baduzzi in Wynyard Quarter. He said both had seen a spike in crime in recent months. “We have had some of our staff, as they walk to their car, their purse was taken from them and the person just ran off. “I’ve had people try to break in, smash the doors and do a lot of damage ... grab some things and take off again.” Dearth said the situation had got out of hand. “I have 65 to 70 staff. I’m concerned at many levels. I’m concerned about my employees, my customers coming into the city, and as a father, I’m concerned about my kids. “I don’t know what the answer is but I do know that it’s getting worse.” He said staff walked in groups to avoid being targeted. “If we have one of our female managers and they’re closing up we make sure they go to their car in groups. “We’re really conscious when we’re closing up the restaurant, we have our security protocols that we follow. For our city to grow we need to do something about this crime.” On Fort St, Ima Cuisine owner Yael Shochat worried that her once-bustling restaurant would not survive. “I’m concerned about our survival and crime and safety is just one of the reasons our businesses are dying,” she said. “Parking, the cones... it’s all just piling up.” Shochat said there was little reason for people to visit Auckland’s CBD. “People never liked coming into the city even when times were good. “Now times are bad. The parking is expensive, the city isn’t safe, there’s cones everywhere, there’s less happening in the city and people aren’t working in the city as much.” For the year ending June, business association Heart of the City spent $1.3 million on security patrols throughout the CBD. Heart of the City chief executive Viv Beck said it deterred criminals and gave business owners peace of mind. “Having people walking around, patrolling, engaging with businesses ... that does make a difference. “They escalate to police when necessary and they work alongside others like the council’s CityWatch service which we part-fund.” Police v security guards But Shochat said the patrols were a double-edged sword. “I had a guy sitting in my restaurant disturbing the customers ... he was vaping and he was off his face and wouldn’t leave. “The guards were there, and normally the police would come but because they knew the guards were there they didn’t come. Police are busy and they think ‘Oh it’s okay, the guards are there,’ but the guards couldn’t get rid of him because they’re not police.” Dearth hoped Budget 2024 would include funding for more police officers in the CBD. “I’d like to see more of a presence of police officers [in] these spots that we know are trouble, as a deterrent,” he said. Beck agreed. “We definitely want to see a commitment to more police, and we’d like to see a commitment for a downtown police station,” she said. “There needs to be a specialist approach to mental health and addiction. [The Government has] already indicated that they’re keen to see that, but we would certainly like to see what is going to happen and when.” She said businesses in central Auckland would be watching closely when the Government unveiled its budget on Thursday. - RNZ Share this article",

        "content": "RESCUERS are hunting for a suspected 2,000 victims buried beneath a landslide in Papua New Guinea. The government figure is roughly three times the UN estimate of 670 killed in the island’s mountainous interior. Only six bodies had been found by last night after Friday’s disaster at Yambali village in the South Pacific island’s Enga province. Officials said assessing the scale of the catastrophe was difficult as tribal warfare meant relief workers required military escorts. The landslide also buried a 650ft stretch of the province’s main highway under 20 to 26ft of debris. Survivors — 4,000 have been displaced — are digging by hand to try to find the dead under rubble up to 32ft deep. Officials said they are split on whether heavy machinery should be used. Traumatized villagers are divided over whether heavy machinery should be allowed to dig up and potentially further damage the bodies of their buried relatives. In a letter to the UN seeking help, the island’s National Disaster Center said: “The situation remains unstable due to the shifting ground, posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors.” Heavy rain caused the landslip, which hit “like a bomb in a split second”. Earth-moving equipment used by Papua New Guinea’s military was being transported to the disaster scene 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the east coast city of Lae. Insiders said the landslide would have a major economic impact on the entire country.",

        "content": "RESCUERS are hunting for a suspected 2,000 victims buried beneath a landslide in Papua New Guinea. The government figure is roughly three times the UN estimate of 670 killed in the island’s mountainous interior. Only six bodies had been found by last night after Friday’s disaster at Yambali village in the South Pacific island’s Enga province. Officials said assessing the scale of the catastrophe was difficult as tribal warfare meant relief workers required military escorts. The landslide also buried a 650ft stretch of the province’s main highway under 20 to 26ft of debris. Survivors — 4,000 have been displaced — are digging by hand to try to find the dead under rubble up to 32ft deep. Officials said they are split on whether heavy machinery should be used. Traumatized villagers are divided over whether heavy machinery should be allowed to dig up and potentially further damage the bodies of their buried relatives. In a letter to the UN seeking help, the island’s National Disaster Center said: “The situation remains unstable due to the shifting ground, posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors.” Heavy rain caused the landslip, which hit “like a bomb in a split second”. Earth-moving equipment used by Papua New Guinea’s military was being transported to the disaster scene 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the east coast city of Lae.

        "content": "The Britain’s Got Talent live semi-final returned to see opera singer Innocent Masuku and taekwondo group Ssaulabi Performance Troupe win a place in Sunday’s final. The ITV talent show kicked off on Monday with the first live semi-final featuring judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli, alongside presenters Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. A public vote saw singer Masuku automatically through to the final, while the judges voted for Ssaulabi Performance Troupe over dog act The Trickstars to continue to compete for the £250,000 prize and a spot at the Royal Variety Performance. They're going to need a big broom after that 🧹🔥 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/bVlRvy5bG5 — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 The South Korean taekwondo group, who were McPartlin and Donnelly’s golden buzzer act, said they practise five hours a day and received all four votes from the judges to make the final after their “cinematic blockbuster” live performance. “If that was a movie, that would have taken about a week to shoot literally, it would,” Cowell said of their performance. “And the fact that you did the whole thing live in about two-and-a-half minutes, says everything about you. “I forget how many years we’ve been doing this now actually, but this is actually one of the best live show performances I’ve ever seen on this show.” Meanwhile, South African opera singer Masuku, who wowed the judges in his January audition before getting married, said “this is my year” after winning a spot on the bill for the final. Innocent Masuku's voice holds so much power. Goosebumps!✨ #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/t3qTyljVqM — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 Dixon described him as “the one to beat”, while Tonioli said his act was “flawless”. Cowell said: “How snobby classical music is, I mean it really is, it is just awful and you deserve this opportunity because you are incredibly talented, you performed like a lead, you have that presence about you and your control over the song, everything about it for me was immaculate.” The first live semi-final of this year saw Lucy Heath and her five dogs perform as The Trickstars to the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory themed dance. The dog trainer made the final of the talent show eight years ago, but missed a spot in the final line-up following the judges’ unanimous vote. “I genuinely think your act has got better over the years,” Cowell said, adding he “loved it, loved it, loved it”. Now *this* is a Wonka Experience! 🍫🐾 #BGT pic.twitter.com/tmoYC5XWNA — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 Tonioli described the act as “charming” while Holden said “you really are the golden ticket”, referencing the Roald Dahl classic book and film. Comedian Bikoon! was up next but saw Dixon, Tonioli and Holden press their red buzzer as his “magic” bag failed several times to perform a simple trick. Cowell was visibly upset at the end of the performance when the magic bag opened to reveal a man inside, to which McPartlin joked the pair were a “Japanese Ant & Dec”. Imagine explaining that at customs... 🧳 #BGT pic.twitter.com/riOM9USLjt — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 “I’m really upset, I think the bag should have remained a mystery,” Cowell said. Holden and Dixon also pressed their red buzzer for air guitar act Sven Smith. “Call me old-fashioned but I prefer a guitar and a microphone,” Dixon said, while Holden questioned his place in the semi-final. Tonioli’s golden buzzer recipient Taryn Charles received a much warmer response from the judges, after the singer performed a rendition of Lose Control by Teddy Swims. Cowell described it as a “genius choice of song”, adding: “I genuinely don’t think you could have done any more”, as well as calling it “beautifully raw”. We can't help but Lose Control whenever we hear Taryn's vocals 😱🤩 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/Y3h0mOzSxu — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 However, the judge was less impressed with his own golden buzzer act, rollerskating couple Duo Stardust from Ukraine. “It wasn’t as good as the audition, I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight which is a real shame – we lost the focus of you,” he said. The pair finished their performance picking Tonioli from the panel and spinning him high into the air, which he described as “scary”. Meanwhile, Cowell said he preferred the first half of 11-year-old dancer Trey Braine’s performance, but also revealed he recently used the schoolboy to exemplify “someone I believe has star potential – when you’ve got it, you’ve got it”. “You’re naturally cool, naturally stylish, I really believe great things are going to happen in your life and your career,” he said. The cast of Disney’s The Lion King also performed on the show, to celebrate 30 years since the release of the film. Britain’s Got Talent live semi-finals will air each day until Friday at 8pm, with Sunday’s final at 7.30pm on ITV1 and ITVX.",

Tim Scott (R-SC) recently slammed an ad from President Joe Biden's campaign, defining the said ad as \"insulting\" towards Black voters while saying good things about the work that former President Donald Trump did for the Black community. In CNN 's \"State of the Union,\" Scott was asked about his reaction to the ad and he said that what he can say is that they were allegedly better off with Trump. Scott said that the two things that were basically attracting Black voters once more towards Trump were jobs and justice. He then made refernce towards wages and fairness. \"Number one, under Donald Trump , our wages were going up. Right now, fairness is going down,\" he said. The ad that Scott was talking about was comprised of a number of attacks towards Trump. The narrator in the said ad could be heard saying that Trump disrespecting the Black community was nothing new. The ad also alleged that Trump stood with \"violent white supremacists,\" and that it warned of a bloodbath in the event that he would lose. Scott then took the opportunity and turned the tables around by recalling some statements that were mentioned by the President. One example is an old 1977 statement of Biden where he mentioned that \"orderly\" racial integration policies would result in his children growing up in a racial jungle, The Hill reported. \"Let's not forget the fact that Joe Biden is the president who said, 'If you don't vote for me, you can't be Black.' ... An old white dude telling me I can't be Black if I don't vote for him? This is the president who said ... the Republican Party wants to put you back in chains,\" Scott added. Aside from this, Scott also accused Biden of supporting educational segregation, although he did not provide evidence that would support his claims about the President. \"The only person I have seen restraining Black folks economically is the Joe Biden economy. So, I find it quite insulting to suggest that Joe Biden does not have serious concerns, when his own vice president, Kamala Harris, said he supported segregation,\" he added. Dana Bash, the CNN anchor, pressed the senator if the President supporting segregation a bit \"too far.\" Scott then said that the President \"halted the growth of charter schools that provides greater diversity and opportunities.\" According to reports, recent polls have shows that Biden is slowly losing Black voters. This vote may be crucial to him being reelected comes November. Joe biden Donald trump © Copyright IBTimes 2024. All rights reserved.

        "content": "We are saved. Forget people shooting up Jewish schools and the feds shelling out some $50 billion annually on debt exceeding $1.2 trillion. The Bank of Canada will make a rate announcement on June 5. Having read the tea leaves, split the shoulder blades, and perused the thesaurus for “vague yet reassuring,” they will fine-tune the economy as always. Outside the séance, the trouble with central banks is they think they run the economy. Long ago, their job was to keep the currency sound, which was boring and caused conflict with politicians who kept proposing silly policies that would detonate it. But it had one remarkable virtue: it was possible. Then came John Maynard Keynes, who chucked neoclassical economics out the window along with the presumption that non-intellectuals were rational, and proclaimed a trade-off between inflation and unemployment. So instead of fighting inflation as another independent dopey way governments could ruin things, central bankers started thinking that in hard times, including for politicians facing re-election, they should turn inflation up slightly, and once everyone had a job, nudge it down again. The prestige. The excitement. Plus, “fine-tuning” the economy to give everybody everything let bankers work with politicians, not fight them, as bureaucrats with Ph.D.s and elected officials with handout-hungry constituents were also meant to run deficits in slumps and then surpluses in booms. Sorry if you laughed coffee out your nose, but it was the plan. Free cash for life. Wheeeee! The downside is it didn’t work. As soon as it was seriously attempted, in the United States in the mid-1960s with Canada independently following suit soon after, it turned out there was no “Phillips Curve” along which inflation and unemployment slid in inverse tandem. Instead, we quickly got “stagflation,” and the Gods of the Copybook headings quoted Friedrich Hayek’s “to aim at the maximum of employment which can be achieved in the short run by means of monetary policy is essentially the policy of the desperado.” Never mind. The smart set had laughed Milton Friedman to scorn in 1963 for “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon,” and naturally if the facts don’t fit the theory, “evidence-based decision-making” types chuck the evidence. No crude printing-press prattle. Inflation results from “excess” growth, not excess money creation. The economy “overheated” and boffins must “cool” it down. A.k.a. you lose your job, but they don’t despite not seeing inflation coming. Instead, it should announce on June 5 that it’s cutting rates slightly to see what happens. If inflation holds steady, so will rates. If it gets worse, they’ll rise. If it slacks off, they’ll fall. Don’t talk to us about GDP. We only do price stability, through empirical improvisation. Booooring. Unglamorous. But practical, vital, and long overdue.",

        "content": "Mr Gayus Jonah Saraki, a teacher, tells TEMITOPE ADETUNJI how his sister, Beauty Joshua, died in a mining pit that collapsed in the Gudum Sayawa suburb of Bauchi metropolis, Bauchi State Can you share with us what happened to your sister? My name is Gayus Jonah Saraki. I am the elder brother of the deceased, Beauty Joshua, from Bogoro, Bauchi State. She was one of the people who lost their lives in Bauchi State when a mining pit collapsed in the Gudum Sayawa suburb of the Bauchi metropolis. People in the villages visit the mining site daily to mine different minerals like precious stones and the rest. It is a major business the villagers engage in for survival. However, on that day, the cave collapsed and claimed the lives of some people, and my sister happened to be one of those people who died. They couldn’t escape the cave site when it collapsed. The incident happened on January 25, 2024, and she was buried on January 27, 2024. She was buried at the Christian cemetery in Bigi, Bauchi State. What did she do for a living before she started working at the mine site? After her secondary school education, we were considering if she could further her education. But in the interim, she wanted to live with our sister, who is a fashion designer, so that she could learn from her. So our plan was for her to start staying with our sister so she could learn fashion design from her. Unfortunately, she couldn’t make it because the mining incident took her life. She was staying in the family house where my parents were staying. She wasn’t doing anything that’s probably why she decided to also join those who go to the site for work. We were living together in the family house before I got my apartment and moved into it with my family (wife and kids). How old was she? She was 21 years old. How long has she been in the mining business? It hasn’t been long at all. She started working there a week before the incident. Can you narrate how the incident happened and how you were informed? I gathered that when she left home the day the incident happened, she had said that once she returned that day, she would not visit the mine again for work because her heart was not in that business. She said she wanted to learn fashion design. So it was quite unfortunate when I received a call when I got home about the accident. We were planning one of our brother’s burials when they called to inform me that our sister just had an accident. On receiving the call, I left my colleagues and the priest to check up on her. My thought was that I would go and take care of her, thinking maybe she just sustained an injury. But when I got there, I was shocked to see people just crying and wailing. They were telling me ‘See your sister’ and pointing in a direction. Then I turned and saw her lying on the floor and words failed me. My body was shaking. Some women she was working with were still inside the collapsed mine. People there were trying to look for a way to bring them out. Then I left my sister where she was lying to try to rescue the remaining women under the ground. We took my sister’s body and the other corpses to the hospital, and after that, we started making arrangements for how they would be buried. The incident was so devastating. What position was your sister in the family? She’s the number eight child in the family. I’m the firstborn. What do you do for a living? I’m a teacher. I’m 39 years old. I’m married with kids, and I live in Bauchi. How do they pay them in the mining industry? They pay according to what you get, and they pay by kilogrammes. When did she finish Secondary School? She finished secondary school last year. How are your parents and other family members coping with your sister’s death? Coping with the loss has been tough for all of us, including my parents. We’ve been trying to support each other through this difficult time, reminding ourselves of our faith and the belief that there’s something beyond this life. We’ve been telling our parents not to blame themselves or feel too down because we believe in something greater. She is in a better place. We’ve been finding comfort in our faith, reassuring ourselves that our loved one is in a better place and that there’s a reason for everything, even though it’s hard to understand sometimes. We believe that, in the end, there’s judgment and that those who have faith will have eternal life. These thoughts have been our source of strength and encouragement in this challenging period. As for my parents, they’ve been handling the situation as best as they can. They’re trying to stay strong and lean on their faith for support. We’ve been there for each other, talking and sharing memories of our loved ones. This has helped us feel a little bit better despite the sadness. It’s not easy, and there are moments when the pain feels overwhelming, but we’re taking it one day at a time and holding onto the hope and belief that we’ll be reunited one day. Can you describe the kind of personality your sister had? My sister was truly one-of-a-kind. She was a great character in so many ways. One thing that always stood out about her was how she handled corrections. She had this amazing ability to take feedback in her stride, never getting upset when corrected. Rather, she was always ready to embrace corrections and accept them as an opportunity to learn and grow. It’s something I’ve always admired about her because it showed just how mature and self-aware she was. Another thing about my sister was her aversion to idleness. She was never one to sit still for long. She always had a project to work on or a goal to pursue. Her work ethic was truly inspiring. Whether it was her studies or other endeavors, she approached everything with a determination and drive that was unmatched. She also had a kindness and compassion that touched everyone she met. She was always willing to lend a helping hand or a listening ear. Thinking about my sister, I’m reminded of just how lucky I am to have had her in my life. She wasn’t just a sister; she was a friend, a confidante, and a source of endless inspiration. She was truly unforgettable, and I’m grateful for every moment I got to spend with her. Have you received any communication from the mining company or the government officials after the incident? My father said the Ministry of Humanitarian called them and gave them cash of N40,000, but we haven’t heard anything from the mining company because my sister was not a full staff. What were your sister’s dreams before she died? She wanted to be a fashion designer. What are your thoughts on the need for safety in the mining industry? Ensuring safety in the mining industry requires proper regulation of the industry. Good supervision is essential, but it’s not enough on its own. We need to go further by implementing and enforcing thorough safety standards that address every aspect of mining operations. This means having clear guidelines in place for things like equipment maintenance, ventilation systems, and emergency response procedures. It’s not just about having these standards written down, they need to be actively enforced to ensure compliance. Regular inspections are crucial to make sure that mining companies are following these safety standards. Inspectors need to be well-trained and have the authority to take action if they find any violations. Training is also important. Miners need to know how to use equipment safely, how to recognise dangers, and what to do in case of an emergency. This training should be ongoing to keep everyone up to date on the latest safety procedures. And it’s not just about keeping miners safe. We also need to consider the environmental impact of mining operations. Regulations should be in place to minimise pollution and protect natural habitats. Overall, safety regulation and oversight in the mining industry need to be comprehensive and proactive. By implementing and enforcing strict safety standards, we can help prevent accidents and protect both workers and the environment. What are the things you would remember your sister for? I would remember her for her reliability in handling household matters during my travels. She was quite dependable on household matters. Knowing that she can be counted on to manage things smoothly in my absence undoubtedly brings a sense of reassurance and gives me peace of mind. Additionally, her willingness to take on responsibilities without complaint demonstrates her level of selflessness and maturity. Not everyone can handle tasks without protest, but her ability to do so reflects her understanding of the importance of cooperation within the family. I would also remember her visits to my home, particularly when she came to spend time with my wife and children. She was good at nurturing family relationships. These moments with her are cherished memories for all of us in the family. I would also remember her for her ability to understand and accept constructive corrections without arguments. This quality fosters healthy communication and strengthens the bonds of trust and respect between siblings. While not seeing her anymore may still feel surreal, the impact she has made on my life through her actions and presence is undoubtedly profound. From her support during travels to her emotional support and connection with my family, she leaves an indelible mark that transcends physical distance. It’s these qualities and memories that will continue to resonate and shape my thoughts about her, even though she is no more. What advice would you give to people dealing with the same loss or tragedy? My advice is that they should see the loss as God’s written plan for that person. They should accept that the person is being called to glory as there’s nothing they can do about it. Dealing with losing someone or facing a big problem can be hard. Everybody feels sad in their own way, and that’s okay. It’s alright to be upset, angry, or confused. It’s important to talk about how you feel with people you trust, like family or friends. Sometimes believing in something bigger can help. Some people find comfort in believing that there’s a plan for everything, even if it’s hard to understand. It is better to think that the person who passed away is now in a better place.",

        "description": "Justin Stein's trial continues in the NSW Supreme Court today with Kallista Mutten returning for a second day of testimony.",
        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail Kallista Mutten could face claims that she shot her own daughter Charlise as she continues giving evidence in the murder trial of her former partner. Justin Stein's trial continues in the NSW Supreme Court today with Mutten returning for a second day of testimony. Stein, 33, has pleaded not guilty to murdering nine-year-old Charlise, claiming he witnessed Mutten shoot her own daughter.

(NSW Police) Charlise's body was found by police in a barrel by the Blue Mountains' Colo River on January 18, 2022 with gunshot wounds to her face and back. Following a full day of evidence on Monday, Mutten will now face cross-examination by Stein's lawyer, Carolyn Davenport SC. The court heard last week that following his arrest, Stein told a corrections officer he was traumatised after seeing Mutten shoot the girl. \"I heard a shot and then I heard her screaming out for me. Then I ran back and she shot her again,\" Stein said, according to the officer.

(Dion Georgopoulos) Davenport told the jury during her opening address that it would become apparent Mutten, not Stein, had motive to kill the girl. At the time of her death, Charlise had been visiting her mother and Stein over the Christmas holidays from Tweed Heads, where she lived full-time with her grandparents. During the visit, the group spent their time between a Mount Wilson property owned by Stein's mother, and a caravan at the Riviera Ski Park about a 90-minute drive away. The trial heard earlier from neighbours of the Mount Wilson property who said they heard conversations regarding Charlise's parental custody which hinted at plans not to send her back to Queensland. READ MORE: Police appeal after woman 'gave birth' near Sydney river ﻿ Justin Stein has been charged with Charlise's murder. (Supplied) One neighbour had previously attended a dinner with his wife and mother-in-law where Stein, his mother, Charlise and her mother were also present. \"(Stein) said that if anything happened and the child didn't go back to Queensland that he would end up in prison again,\" the neighbour said. During her evidence on Monday, Mutten told the trial she saw her daughter for the last time on January 11, when the nine-year-old travelled alone to spend the night with Stein at Mount Wilson while she remained at the caravan park. She said the following day Stein told her he left Charlise in the care of an auctioneer who was working at the Blue Mountains property where they were staying. Stein claimed Charlise had been vomiting and was too unwell to travel, and that she was in good hands because the woman was a mother of three and \"practically a nurse\", the court was told. Stein later said he believed the woman was not who she said she was and that Charlise may have taken by former associates from his criminal past. \"I said, 'we should go to police',\" Mutten told the court through tears. \"He said, 'no, because if you ring the police they will kill her'.\" On January 13, while phone data tracked Stein allegedly travelling to three boat ramps across Sydney and eventually the exact location where Charlise's body was found, Mutten believed he was \"going to war\" to find her daughter, the court heard. \"Justin said he's gonna go to war and go to places that he might think that she might be and go look for her and get her,\" Mutten said. Later, she said, \"Justin had called me and said that he 'badly hurt' the man that was in the house (where) he thought Charlise was ... and stabbed him\". When he returned in the early hours of the next day, Mutten says Stein told her, \"It's not them, you can call the police in the morning\". Mutten called police to report her daughter missing shortly after 8am the next morning.

        "description": "\"Ha’amini Yom Yavo,\" a musical at Habima National Theater, celebrates Yafa Yarkoni's life and legacy, exploring her rise to fame and enduring impact on Israeli culture.",
        "content": "The life of the graceful woman with a beautiful voice who embodied the spirit of a nation at war, is now explored at the Habima National Theater in the form of a musical. Written by Guy Maroz and directed by Eldar Groisman, Ha’amini Yom Yavo (Believe the Day Will Come) includes some of the best-known stars of the Hebrew stage. Elay Almani plays the role of Yarkoni as a young newlywed who rapidly became a sensational star in what was known at the time as “salon tunes.” Einat Sarouf shines in the role of the established Yarkoni, marking a time in her life when, thanks to lyrics written by Haim Gouri, Raphael Klatchkin, Naomi Shemer, and others, she attained a special place in the nation’s heart and international recognition. in the role of a mature artist faced with the fickle memory of her public, won longstanding ovations after this premiere. The musical begins with a hospital bed, where a medical doctor (Tal Mosseri) gently explains to Yarkoni’s daughter Rina (Lilian Barreto) that her mother (Almagor) suffers from Alzheimer’s disease. The stunned daughter must defend her mother’s reputation, face a crisis in her own marriage, and support a demanding older parent. Meanwhile, the audience is invited to take a trip down memory lane with Yarkoni as she looks back at a life that some would call a phenomenal success story. A clue to this narrative device can be appreciated when Almani sings a few lines from Habibi. Almagor is there watching her, tapping her finger on the glass as if she is creating the rhythm in her own mind, watching her younger self perform. For this musical, music director Lior Ronen crafted two impressive mini-shows, one sung by Almani and the other by Sarouf. Both performances are necessary and excellent pastiches – a condensed selection of Yarkoni’s most iconic songs, trimmed down to a few key lyrics, performed with heart and gusto during spectacular dance routines created by Tut Mullor. Set designer Adam Keller deserves praise for his precise, imaginative sets that take us from Tel Aviv’s bars to the Negev desert, with its warm tunes of reddish-yellow in the background, and then to the clinically cold hospital scenes with their unforgiving light. This works wonderfully well, partly due to the audience’s deep familiarity with Yarkoni’s music. The clear-cut thematic division seen on stage between an alleged Rebetiko-like period, when Yarkoni was a people’s diva, and a second period, when she was an Israeli Marlene Dietrich singing “Lili Marlene” to the boys at the front, should be taken with a grain of salt. On stage, a pipe-smoking Haim Gouri (Tal Kallai) hands her the lyrics to “Bab El Wad,” a song written to remember the fierce fighting at Sha’ar HaGai during the War of Independence. Yarkoni sings it and is rapidly transformed to the status of the nation’s “songstress of the war,” despite noting that “wars are terrible; only the songs are pretty.” Gouri, Yoram Kaniuk, and others served in the Palmach. They fought for a new country that they were also able to culturally shape at a level that today would seem impossible. A poet takes a drink, composes a poem, and then passes it on to a singer, who turns it into a timeless musical masterpiece that continues to play on the radio seven decades later. “There were times when we defended the outpost,” Hefer wrote in There Were Such Times, which is included in the musical. “Now on the outpost, a city was built.” When Yarkoni died, Kaniuk shared how she had come to perform for his Palmach battalion. Yarkoni sang “War is a Dream,” a tango written by Tolly Reviv. Then-Palmach Education Officer Benny Marshak had a fit. The tango, Rebetiko, and pop music were all salon tunes – “false Idols” to the ideologically driven older men who, like him, left Europe to create a Jewish homeland. Back then, female singers became the voice of a nation at war. Fairouz wrote and sang “Al Quds Al Atiqa” (Old Jerusalem) and Umm Kalthoum sang “I Now Have a Rifle” (written by Nizar Qabbani,) both of them Arab songs about the conflict. In a similar way, Yarkoni and Shoshana Damari reside in the collective Israeli soul. Klatchkin, who wrote the poem from which the title of this musical is taken, says that Israel’s wars are fought so that the day will come when we may “breathe and live.” The choice to have Almagor, known for her pro-peace views, play the role of Yarkoni, who was rebuked by the public over a possibly misunderstood radio interview in which she spoke out against the ongoing military control of the Gaza Strip, is an inspired one. In a pivotal scene, hecklers interrupt Yarkoni (Almagor) during her singing, questioning her loyalty to the state. This is a troubling but very sharp reminder of how fragile free speech is in a democracy still facing unyielding hostility.",

        "content": "ESPN updated its Monday programming to honor the late NBA great, Bill Walton. The two-time NBA champion and 1978 MVP died at the age of 71 after a battle with cancer. Walton worked at ESPN for 22 years. He joined the network as an NBA analyst in 2002 before starting calling college basketball games in 2012. The broadcaster paid tribute to the former No. 1 overall pick with special programming on Monday afternoon. It celebrated Walton's memory on SportsCenter and NBA Today between 3-5 pm ET. ESPN also announced it would air the 30 for 30 documentary about the NBA legend's career and life – titled The Luckiest Guy in the World – on ESPN2 at 5 pm and 10:30 pm. \"Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,\" the network said in a statement . \"Bill often described himself as 'the luckiest guy in the world,' but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. \"He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. \"Bill's one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster. \"We at ESPN extend our deepest condolences to Bill's loved ones, including the entire Walton family.\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver confirmed Walton's death early Monday afternoon. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. \"His unique skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships, and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams. \"Bill then translated his infectious enthusiasm and love for the game to broadcasting, where he delivered insightful and colorful commentary which entertained generations of basketball fans. \"As a cherished member of the NBA family for 50 years, Bill will be deeply missed by all those who came to know and love him.\" Walton spent 10 years in the NBA, playing for the Portland Trail Blazers , LA Clippers , and Boston Celtics . He helped the Blazers win their only NBA championship in 1977. The 6-foot-11 center won his second ring in 1986 to cap off his first season with the Celtics. Walton ventured into sports media in 1990, serving as a color commentator for CBS, NBC, and the local Clippers broadcast before joining ESPN.",

The uncertainly whether a measure would pass lies on the small House GOP majority, which means that Republicans could only pass bills with just one or two defections from Democrats, assuming that the latter remains united in their votes. There is already a strong push from top GOP leaders for the Garland vote to be carried this week since there are already members who are saying that their colleagues are still not yet voting for the measure. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said that they will not be calling for a vote unless they know that they can pass it. He also noted that there is more than one GOP who have reservations on the measure. Another Republican, Dan Bishop, described the stance of other GOP members as being \"squishy\" on the issue. Johnson, on the other hand, referred to the non-passing of the vote during the previous week as a \"calendar issue.\" Although delays are not necessarily uncommon, votes on such matters are often scheduled while lawmakers still have their momentum from their committees. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, said that the oversight meeting on May 15 was complicated and ended in chaos due to mentions of \"fake eyelashes\" used by Rep. Jasmine Crockette (D-TX). \"I mean, the whole country was looking at Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about fake eyelashes, but nobody was focused at all on their outlandish claim that the Attorney General of the United States is in contempt of Congress,\" said Raskin. The GOP lawmakers wanted to cite Johnson in contempt after his refusal to turn over the audio recording of the interview of special counsel Robert Hur with President Joe Biden. The President has claimed executive privilege over the said audio recordings. However, lawmakers have already their transcript of the interview.

        "content": "Analysts have identified technology adoption as one of the drivers of the growth in the contribution of the financial services sector to the country’s Gross Domestic Product. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, financial services were instrumental to the country’s economic growth in the first quarter of 2024. The NBS, in the Nigerian Gross Domestic Product Report Q1, 2024 released on Friday, said that Nigeria’s gross domestic product grew by 2.98 per cent (year-on-year) in real terms in the first quarter of 2024. According to the bureau, the growth rate is higher than the 2.31 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2023 and lower than the growth rate of 3.46 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023. The performance of the GDP in the first quarter of 2024 was driven mainly by the services sector, which recorded a growth of 4.32 per cent and contributed 58.04 per cent to the aggregate GDP. A further breakdown of the GDP report indicated that the non-oil sector grew by 2.80 per cent in real terms during Q1 2024, driven mainly by financial and insurance, information and communication (telecommunications); agriculture (crop production); trade; and manufacturing (food, beverage, and tobacco). Highlighting the contribution of the financial institutions to the GDP, the report said, “The finance and insurance sector consists of the two subsectors, financial and insurance institutions, in which the former accounted for 93.19 per cent and the latter 6.81 per cent of the sector, respectively, in real terms in Q1 2024. As a whole, the sector grew at 42.18 per cent in nominal terms (year-on-year), with the growth rate of Financial Institutions at 44.41 per cent and 17.37 per cent growth rate recorded at 17.37 per cent. “The overall rate was higher than Q1 2023 by 19.81 per cent points, and higher by 9.89 per cent points than the preceding quarter. The quarter-on-quarter growth was 20.97 per cent. The sector’s contribution to the nominal GDP was 5.09 per cent in Q1 2024, higher than the 4.11 per cent it represented a year previous, and higher than the contribution of 3.76 per cent it made in the preceding quarter.” The Managing Director/Chief Economist at ADSR, Dr Afolabi Olowookere, told The PRIMANEWS, “The sector is growing, hence its contribution to the GDP will also grow. After COVID-19, the financial sector and ICT have been growing because people do a lot of transactions online. “Majorly, the financial sector benefited a lot from the depreciation of the currency. They contributed to the growth of the stock exchange. What they declared even in the last quarter in profitability is much. They did well and that spurs growth. So, when you grow more, your contribution would also grow because others are not growing as much.” According to an economist with the School of Management and Social Sciences, Pan-Atlantic University, Professor Bright Eregha, post-Covid, a lot of the sectors were not doing well except for ICT and the banking sector. “The reason is that these sectors are already integrated into the digital space for their businesses and if you check the contribution of ICT is increasing by the day. “One of the sectors that is making use of ICT is the banking and financial sector. For that reason, even when other sectors are not doing well because they are impacted by other things, the banking sector continues to grow,” he noted. Eregha, however, questioned the growth of the sector when the real sector in the country was struggling. “The second point I want to make which may seem contradictory is, that if the real sector is not doing well, one would have expected the financial sector not to do well because the assignment of the banking sector is financial intermediation. So, if the real sector is struggling conditioned on all the macroeconomic conditions that are affecting them; energy, subsidy removal, exchange rates and interest rate hikes, the real sector is impaired and not doing well, so what is the role of the banks and what is driving their growth? “If you check through 2020 till now, the real sector has not been doing well but the banking sector, which serves as an intermediation, is to get funds to where they are needed to spur the real sector. So, if they are making a profit but the real sector is not booming, then there is a question mark. If what is driving their growth is more of the non-interest-based assets against interest-based assets. If you look at the profits that they are declaring, you know that it is not tied to the real intermediation work that they should do,” he said. In a recent report titled ‘Digital Opportunities in African Businesses,’ the International Finance Corporation indicated that African firms could better leverage digital technologies to help their businesses become more productive and profitable. “Digitalisation presents investment opportunities for African firms and those who conduct business with them. Digital technologies are being adopted at a faster pace than previous waves of technological innovation. People and firms in Africa have embraced this transformation. “By making fuller use of digitalisation, African firms across all economic activities can become more productive, profitable, and integrated into global, regional, and local value chains,” it stated. According to the report, people can benefit from the lower costs and learning that digital technologies can facilitate. “Existing or new businesses can serve this rapidly expanding market—for example, by building digital infrastructure or providing appropriate software solutions,” part of the report read. Meanwhile, Afrinvest has maintained its 3.0 per cent GDP growth projection for Nigeria in 2024, saying, “This cautious stance is informed by the lingering impacts of ongoing reforms on growth potentials, challenging business environment, protracted security concerns, exchange rate volatility, dwindling agric sector growth (the minuscule growth in Q1 is the lowest since the negative print of 0.9 per cent in Q1:2023), and mounting risk in the external environment.” The International Monetary Fund projected Nigeria’s economy would grow at 3.3 per cent in 2024, as both oil and agriculture outputs are expected to improve with better security. NBS said that the contribution of finance and insurance to real GDP totalled 6.81 per cent, higher than the contribution of 5.35 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2023 by 1.47 per cent, and higher than 4.95 per cent recorded in Q4 2023 by 1.86 per cent.",

        "content": "As excited as we are about all of the great new movies , we’re sad to report that there are quite a few gems leaving the streaming service as well. With fewer licensed movies on the service in recent years, the list of departures has dwindled each month, but some months are worse than others, as is the case for June 2024. Several movies that have seemingly been on the streamer forever are finally getting removed in June, including , which is one of the most fun action movies of the past few years and features a great Brad Pitt performance. Speaking of action, we’re also losing , , and both of Tarantino’s masterful movies from Netflix. Best Netflix movies leaving in June 2024 Over the past decade, David Leitch has established himself as one of the best action directors in the industry. He followed up his 2021 Bob Odenkirk action thriller with , which stars Brad Pitt as an anxious former assassin tasked with retrieving a briefcase full of cash from a bullet train in Japan. Once aboard, he finds himself at odds with a host of other dangerous criminals. It’s a riot and a perfect lazy weekday movie. Years before Christopher Nolan turned a biopic into a near-billion-dollar box office behemoth, director Morten Tyldum and screenwriter Graham Moore adapted Andrew Hodges’s biography into a movie starring Benedict Cumberbatch. The movie explores how Turnig decrypted German intelligence messages for the British government during World War II, but it was dinged by critics for some historical inaccuracies. Sign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there. By signing up, I agree to the and have reviewed the I could share choice quotes from the reviews of here, but do you really need to know anything other than that Jonas Taylor (Jason Statham) once again runs away from and occasionally battles giant sharks? I didn’t think so. Spike Lee’s legendary 2006 crime thriller follows Denzel Washington as Detective Keith Frazier, the NYPD hostage negotiator, attempts to defuse a hostage situation on Wall Street. Clive Owen plays the ringleader of the bank heist, Dalton Russell, Jodie Foster plays Manhattan power broker Madeleine White, and they’re joined by Christopher Plummer, Willem Dafoe, and Chiwetel Ejiofor. To this day, it’s Lee’s most successful theatrical release. I’m among the fans who believe Quentin Tarantino still hasn’t topped the duology twenty years later. These beloved movies are such a perfect mix of sweet, silly, and serious, with Uma Thurman keeping an otherwise unbelievable story of bloody revenge grounded so as not to let us forget that the Bride’s life is constantly in danger. Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Sacha Baron Cohen, Gary Cole, Michael Clarke Duncan, Leslie Bibb, Jane Lynch, and Amy Adams in one of the most ridiculous sports comedies you’ll ever see. Not all of Ferrell’s sports movies have worked, but some of us are . Because if you ain’t first, you’re last.",

        "description": "Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis - who also owns the Las Vegas Aces - could be preparing to welcome a child after reported girlfriend Hayden Hopkins revealed her pregnancy",
        "content": "The alleged girlfriend of Las Vegas Raiders owner Mark Davis is pregnant - . Last month, Hayden Hopkins - who has been linked romantically with Davis for some time - took to social media to announce her pregnancy. On Instagram, Hopkins posted a black-and-white photo of herself on a beach with the caption ‘baby’ as she showcased her bump. While Hopkins' announcement did not disclose the identity of the father, the timing of the post led to speculation regarding her reported relationship with Davis. Hopkins and Davis went viral in 2022 when she was spotted with the owner in his suite at Allegiant Stadium. Hopkins certainly did not play down speculation of their relationship, sharing a photo from her premium seats along with the caption ‘Fun game’. When a fan asked about her experience in the owner’s box, Hopkins replied: \"Haha MD [Mark Davis] is a legend! He’s my neighbor/friend.\" Even amid the four-decade age gap between them, rumors have persisted regarding their alleged romance. Hopkins established herself as a leading dancer in Las Vegas, captivating audiences while claiming various awards and performing alongside premier artists like Jason Derulo. Hopkins’ career took her from Seattle to the bright lights of Las Vegas, journeying from winning dance titles as a teenager and gracing the covers of leading dance magazines. Her talent has been clear throughout her rise, while she recently starred as \"La Belle\" in Cirque du Soleil's \"Mystere\" show in Sin City. Hopkins is also an Instagram model amassing more than 216k followers as she often posts photos by the beach where she showcases her remarkable physique. Before her Vegas residency, the 26-year-old traveled across the United States, Canada, and Australia to teach, choreograph, and perform various routines. Davis has not directly addressed the relationship nor the pregnancy rumors himself publicly. Since assuming control of the Raiders franchise after his father Al passed away in 2011, the 69-year-old has kept his personal life out of the public eye. If the rumors are accurate, it seems another member will be added to the Raiders family. Davis, who engineered the Raiders' sensational move from Oakland to Las Vegas as the franchise chases a first Super Bowl title since the days of head coach Tom Flores, is also the owner of the back-to-back champion .",

        "content": "A source told The Sun newspaper's Bizarre column: \"Madonna has barely seen Josh for months because her schedule was so hectic. Things just fizzled out. \"There is genuinely no bad blood - they're still fond of each other. \"At the moment their relationship doesn't feel feasible and they've cooled things off, but they are staying friends.\" Last year, Madonna celebrated turning 65 at a glitzy party in Portugal and used the bash to introduce Josh to her eldest son Rocco Richie, 30. The pop superstar bounced back from a health scare and threw a lavish event in Lisbon to mark her milestone birthday which brought Rocco together with Josh for the first time. She's believed to have started dating Josh last year after he started training her son David. He was also believed to have been supporting her since her health battle last June after developing a serious bacterial infection. She was treated in an intensive care unit and was forced to postpone the start of her upcoming tour. Madonna was eventually released from hospital and able to continue her recovery at home. An insider previously told UsWeekly: \"Although Madonna is looking forward to getting back to work as soon as possible, she's also taking her recovery seriously and isn't going to rush anything because she is focused on her health above all else.\"",

        "content": "Byron Keith Hall is accused of killing a woman in a Kingwood home and firing shots at responding officers on Sunday, according to police. The 29-year-old is charged in Taylor Jewell Ben's murder after the Houston Police Department found her body in a home and two children were hiding in a closet. Hall surrendered himself outside the home at 3702 Babbling Creek Drive. \"It appeared that (Hall) was waiting outside in an ambush-style, waiting for the officers to arrive to shoot at them,\" HPD Asst. Chief Jessica Anderson said. \"The officer's vehicle sustained approximately seven shots. The officers reported it was of multiple calibers. We found pistols and short-barreled rifles on the scene.\" No officers were hurt, and according to HPD, none returned fire. Evidence from the gunfire marred the side of the two-story home on Monday, which neighbors say was rented just two months ago. Dean Camino is a neighbor who heard the gunfire Sunday afternoon. He has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years. He told Eyewitness News that he heard two rounds of gunfire, noting that the second round sounded as if it were with a semi-automatic rifle. \"I heard some gunshots. I didn't know if it was somebody shooting firecrackers or what,\" Camino said. \"(It's) Pretty crazy because nothing ever happens like this here.\" Hall has yet to appear before a judge, but already prosecutors have asked for bond conditions that would keep him away from the victim's family, a witness to the crime, and the house on Babbling Creek Drive. Christian Jorgensen lived around the corner and heard the gunfire. He later realized it happened at a home his family rented for four years. \"Next thing you know, a couple of gunshots go off, and then ten gunshots go off, and I was like, 'That's got to be something pretty serious.'\" Jorgensen said. \"That was pretty shocking. I actually figured out this morning it was a house we used to live in by my parents right here. It was pretty sad, you know.\" Court records reveal Hall got deferred adjudication for assaulting a public servant in 2017 and was charged with indecent exposure last year. Now, he faces charges of murder, aggravated assault of a family member, and aggravated assault of a public servant. He's in jail and scheduled to be in court on Wednesday, May 29.",

        "description": "Report says Iran has 142.1 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 60% at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%",
        "content": "Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report on Monday by the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the latest in Tehran’s attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community. Iran is seeking to have economic sanctions imposed over the country’s controversial nuclear program lifted in exchange for slowing the program down. The program — as all matters of state in Iran — is under the guidance of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and that likely won’t change in the wake of last week’s helicopter crash that killed Iran’s president and foreign minister. 3 IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi Photo: AP The report, seen by The Associated Press, said that as of May 11, Iran has 142.1 kilograms (313.2 pounds) of uranium enriched up to 60% — an increase of 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) since the last report by the U.N. watchdog in February. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. By IAEA’s definition, around 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% is the amount at which creating one atomic weapon is theoretically possible — if the material is enriched further, to 90%. Also as of May 11, the report says Iran’s overall stockpile of enriched uranium stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (1,3671.5 pounds), which represents an increase of 675.8 kilograms (1,489.8 pounds) since the IAEA’s previous report. IAEA chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, has previously warned that Tehran has enough uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels to make “several” nuclear bombs if it chose to do so. He has acknowledged the U.N. agency cannot guarantee that none of Iran’s centrifuges may have been peeled away for clandestine enrichment. Tensions have grown between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment. 3 Iranian nuclear facility Photo: AP Under the original nuclear deal, struck in 2015, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to 3.67% purity, maintain a stockpile of about 300 kilograms and use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes. The 2015 deal saw Tehran agree to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program. Monday’s report also said that Tehran has not reconsidered its September 2023 decision to bar IAEA inspectors from further monitoring its nuclear program and added that it expects Iran “to do so in the context of the ongoing consultations between the (IAEA) agency and Iran.” According to the report, Grossi “deeply regrets” Iran’s decision to bar inspectors — and a reversal of that decision “remains essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.” The deaths of Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian have triggered a pause in the IAEA’s talks with Tehran over improving cooperation, the report acknowledged. 3 Photo: AFP, EPA Before the May 19 helicopter crash, Iran had agreed to hold technical negotiations with IAEA on May 20, following a visit by Grossi earlier in the month. But those meetings fell apart due to the crash. Iran then sent a letter on May 21, saying its nuclear team wants to continue discussions in Tehran “on an appropriate date that will be mutually agreed upon,” the report said. The report also said Iran has still not provided answers to the IAEA’s years-long investigation about the origin and current location of manmade uranium particles found at two locations that Tehran has failed to declare as potential nuclear sites, Varamin and Turquzabad. It said the IAEA’s request need to be resolved, otherwise the the agency “will not be able to confirm the correctness an completeness of Iran’s declarations” under a safeguards agreement between Tehran and the nuclear watchdog. The report also said there was no progress so far in reinstalling more monitoring equipment, including cameras, removed in June 2022. Since then, the only recorded data is that of IAEA cameras installed at a centrifuge workshop in the city of Isfahan in May 2023 — although Iran has not provided the IAEA with access to this data. The IAEA said that on May 21, IAEA inspectors after a delay in April “successfully serviced the cameras at the workshops in Isfahan and the data they had collected since late December 2023 were placed under separate Agency seals and Iranians seals at the locations.” >",

        "content": "made a rather cheeky comment about husband Joe Swash, not long after . The mum-of-five, 34, shared some photos and clips of Joe taking part in a Sellebrity Soccer match. The first video clip saw their daughter Rose watching her dad take part in the football match, to which Stacey added the text: \"Daddy's biggest fans [white heart emoji].\" She followed this with a clip of the match itself, zooming in on Joe. Over this she cheekily wrote: \"NGL quite fancied Joe in his football kit [laughing emoji].\" Stacey followed this with a snap of herself posing alongside Joe, and their son Rex. Alongside this, she wrote: \"We are all Arsenal. Generations of Arsenal. So play at the Emirates was an actual dream come true for Joe & he got to do it to raise money & awareness for @thematildafoundation @griefencounter\" It comes after Stacey shared that she plans to wind down her work commitments in order to spend more time as a stay-at-home mum. While appearing on the , she explained: \"I definitely feel like I'm at a pivotal moment in my life where Zach is about to leave school and become an adult. \"I think I'm at a point in my life where I recognise that I've been really busy for his life, and his life is at a really important point, and my second son will get to that point before I know it. And then I've got these three babies. I don't want to miss what I potentially feel like I missed with my older children. \"And I want to be there for my older children, who I think need me now more than ever. I've been battling with that in my head.\" The TV star went on to say that when she was asked by her team what her five-year plan was, she replied: \"I want to be a stay at home mum.\" Stacey explained: \"That is like my dream, my ultimate dream. I just want to be with my kids.\" Prior to Stacey sharing this, her co-star appeared to . Speaking to , Linda said: \"She's not going to be a regular anymore? I don't think so, but you never know. \"I would love her to come back, she's a really good Loose Woman - she's really honest. But I think she's got too much on. She's got her own series and She's still really welcome but she's just so busy.\"",

        "content": "Ariana Grande ‘s “The Boy Is Mine” is getting a music video, and a release date has been set. The Eternal Sunshine singer posted an incredibly brief but intriguing preview of the video on Instagram on Monday (May 27). “meow,” Grande captioned the clip, which reveals that the video for “The Boy Is Mine” will be unveiled on Friday, June 7. The music video preview shows an unidentified actor placing a drink down, then filling a bathroom sink with a bucket of ice that he dunks his face into. Meanwhile, a hand wearing a claw-like glove creeps around the nearby doorframe. Before the viewer can see who or what is behind that door, the video’s title and release date flashes on the screen. A little over a week ago, Grande uploaded a couple photos to Instagram that fans speculated were from the set of an upcoming music video. She wears a cat-ear headband in the pictures and has “TRUE LOVE” and “BE MINE” hearts affixed on her wall next to a painted portrait, showing the portrait’s subject only from his bottom lip down to his shoulders. No caption was provided for the pics. Director Christian Breslauer, who worked on the visuals for both “Yes, And?” and “We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)” from Grande’s Eternal Sunshine album, commented on her Monday teaser and shared the sneak peek on his own Instagram account. “Get your popcorn, take your seats,” Breslauer wrote on the pop star’s post; “ACT III... soon,” he teased over on his page. While Grande’s ready to drop “The Boy Is Mine,” current single “We Can’t Be Friends” sits at No. 1 on Billboard ’s Pop Airplay chart (dated May 25). The Pop Airplay chart, which began in October 1992, ranks songs by weekly plays on over 150 mainstream top 40 radio stations monitored by Mediabase, with data provided to Billboard by Luminate. “We Can’t Be Friends” previously hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart dated March 23, the same week that Eternal Sunshine soared in at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Watch the teaser for the much-anticipated “The Boy Is Mine” video below. A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande)",

        "content": "BALTIMORE — Cedric Mullins sprinted hard out of the box and turned on the jets just before hitting second base. He dove headfirst into third, letting out a scream before smacking his hands together. If not for the cheers from Baltimore fans at Camden Yards, it appeared that Mullins expressed the emotion out of frustration. Perhaps he did. The center fielder has been engrossed in a brutal slump — a .148 batting average in May entering Monday’s Memorial Day matinee against the Boston Red Sox — and he let out his anger with a two-run triple in the fourth inning and his celebration while kneeling on third base. Mullins’ extra-base hit was one of seven the Orioles smacked en route to an 11-3 rout of the Red Sox for Baltimore’s season-high fifth straight win after sweeping the White Sox in Chicago over the weekend. “That was one of our more complete offensive games of the year,” manager Brandon Hyde said. “Using the whole field, hitting with runners in scoring position, the way we ran the bases was fantastic, moving ’em over, getting ’em in. It was really good situational baseball. That was really nice to see our offense play a complete game today.” It was Mullins’ first triple since he hit for the cycle last May. Since his walk-off home run against the Minnesota Twins in mid-April, Mullins hit .152 with an abysmal .392 OPS before his triple Monday. The 29-year-old barreled up the ball in his next two at-bats, and while both unluckily resulted in outs, it’s likely the first time Mullins has recorded three straight quality plate appearances in over a month. “That was awesome,” Hyde said. “He swung the bat much better today, that was great to see.” Before Mullins’ triple broke the game open in the Orioles’ five-run fourth, Kyle Stowers hit an opposite-field double to drive home two. It was the first of three hits Stowers would tally to mark the best game of his young career. Stowers debuted with the Orioles in 2022 and made the club’s opening day roster last year, but he was later sent to the minors and his 2023 campaign was marred by a shoulder injury and a fractured nose from a hit by pitch. The 26-year-old outfielder waited patiently this spring at Triple-A Norfolk and rejoined the Orioles earlier this month. His three hits Monday tie his career-high set in September 2022 — also versus the Red Sox — while his four RBIs are the most he’s tallied across the first 57 games of his career. “It was really fun for me to have a big day, really fun for the team to get a win,” Stowers said. “Long road for me to get back here from last year, so just cool to have a big moment today and, most importantly, happy to get the win and keep going.” Mullins, Stowers and the rest of Baltimore’s bats backed Cole Irvin to earn the left-hander his fifth win of the season, tying him with Grayson Rodriguez for the team lead. Irvin pitched five scoreless innings to prove once again he’s been one of the Orioles’ best starting pitchers this year. It was the southpaw’s first start back in the rotation after he was temporarily sent to the bullpen. He has a 2.84 ERA and has allowed only two runs in his past 31 1/3 innings as a starting pitcher. “Cole gave us everything he had,” Hyde said. Jordan Westburg, Adley Rutschman, Jorge Mateo and Ryan Mountcastle also clobbered extra-base hits and drove in runs for the Orioles, who scored one in the second and third before the fourth-inning outburst and four more in the seventh. The 11 runs are tied for the second most Baltimore has scored this season. The Orioles’ bullpen was sharp behind Irvin except for newcomer Thyago Vieira , who walked three batters and allowed a bases-clearing triple to Romy Gonzalez for Boston’s lone offense of the afternoon. The eight-run victory in the series opener is the largest margin the Orioles have won by since May 5 against the Cincinnati Reds. Baltimore is 34-18 and 1 1/2 games behind the American League East-leading New York Yankees, who did not play Monday. The Orioles are 4-0 against the Red Sox (27-27) — the first time to begin a season since 1967 — and 8-2 versus AL East foes. If they win Tuesday or Wednesday, it will extend the Orioles’ franchise-record streak without losing a divisional series to 18. Just a few years ago, Boston fans would’ve been a noticeable presence at Camden Yards when playing the then-lowly Orioles. Now, with the Red Sox a middling team and the Orioles one of MLB’s best, the majority of the red in the stands were on the backs of Baltimore fans donning Ketchup T-shirts as part of the hot dog race-themed giveaway. Monday’s announced attendance of 40,951 was the largest for a non-opening day game at Oriole Park this season. Through 28 home games, the average attendance at Camden Yards is 25,971 — up from 20,453 (or 26.9%) from the same point last year. The Orioles are on pace to eclipse 2 million in attendance for the first time since 2017. “I think really the second half of last year we saw that big-time switch,” Hyde said of the fan atmosphere. “When we play, especially some of the AL East teams, how much more Orioles fans are in the seats, and you can hear them and they were loud today. They enjoyed the condiment race and the giveaway. There was a lot of energy in the ballpark today. It was great.” ©2024 The Baltimore Sun. Visit at baltimoresun.com .

        "description": "DALLAS – Even at the lowest point of the Timberwolves season, Anthony Edwards was remaining upbeat.",
        "content": "DALLAS – Even at the lowest point of the Timberwolves season, Anthony Edwards was remaining upbeat. A season ago, when the Wolves fell behind the Denver Nuggets 3-0 in a playoff series, Edwards sat at his locker, head in his hands and didn't say a word. He left without speaking to the media. Now, a year later, his team faces another 3-0 deficit. But Edwards was trying to radiate positivity in a moment some teammates could have been sulking following a 116-107 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night in the Western Conference finals series. To the slumping Nickeil Alexander-Walker, two lockers over from Edwards, Edwards said: \"One shot at a time, 'Kiel, it'll fall. Just trust it.\" This came after Alexander-Walker, who can be hard on himself, had his head in his hands à la Edwards a season ago. Alexander-Walker, after a 1-for-4 shooting night, was rocking back and forth in his chair when media first entered the locker room. Then Edwards was holding court with Mike Conley and Kyle Anderson, saying all the Wolves need is one game where everyone is clicking and they will be right back on track. \"We're here now fellas, what are we gonna do?\" Edwards said. Then Edwards spotted the struggling Karl-Anthony Towns on the other side of the room. He wanted to hear a positive response out of Towns, who had another off night in this series with 14 points on 5-for-18 shooting, including 0-for-8 on three-pointers. \"We here now, Karl. What are we gonna do?\" Edwards said. \"Make history,\" Towns responded. That they will have to do, as no NBA team has ever come back from a 3-0 hole the Wolves are in after another awful stretch of late-game offense did them in against Dallas. NBA teams trailing 3-0 are 0-154 at winning series. \"We ain't got nothing else to do. We can't do nothing but be positive at this point,\" Edwards said in his postgame news conference. \"We can't be negative. Just try to get it one win at a time.\" The Wolves had a 104-102 lead after Anderson hit a shot-clock beating jumper with five minutes to play, but the Wolves didn't have another field goal until Edwards hit a meaningless layup with 15.3 seconds left. The Mavericks outscored them 14-3 as Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic again dominated a Wolves defense that has had no answer for the Dallas duo. Doncic and Irving both scored 33 points. Double-team them and make them give it up? Dallas' supporting cast like Derrick Jones Jr. (11 points) and P.J. Washington (16 points) were hitting shots early as the Mavericks shot 50% from three-point range compared to the Wolves' 30%. Don't double them and guard them straight up? Then they were hitting shots, as when Doncic hit a shot over Jaden McDaniels as he was falling down in the fourth quarter and Irving made a contested layup late in the shot clock against Edwards as part of Dallas' closing push. The Mavericks backcourt stars were a combined 22-for-40. \"It's been tough for us to try to navigate that,\" coach Chris Finch said. \"We've been picking our poison here a little bit.\" The problem for the Wolves is that each poison they pick has been lethal. Edwards had 26 points on 11-for-24 shooting, and he came through with a 10-point third quarter that brought the Wolves back from an eight-point halftime deficit. He found room to attack the rim after Mavericks rookie Dereck Lively II exited because of a strained neck when his head inadvertently met Towns' knee after he fell going for a rebound in the second quarter. But the Wolves didn't attack as much late, and Edwards and Towns were a combined 16-for-42. \"You play into their hands when you hold the ball and you dribble out the clock and are fighting against the shot clock,\" said point guard Conley, who had 16 points. \"That was the issue we had a little bit tonight, where we were looking down 10, 11 seconds left on the shot clock and at that point you have to force it instead of being in an action early, playing a little bit more.\" Edwards was playing that way in the third quarter after Lively's injury freed up space at the rim. Edwards took off for a thunderous dunk as part of a stretch when he scored six consecutive points, and the Wolves pulled ahead for the first time at 79-77 since they were ahead 5-3. But the Wolves could never build and maintain a lead, as Irving and Doncic seemed to respond each time the Wolves got ahead. A backbreaking moment came when Washington hit a wide-open corner three to put Dallas ahead 107-104 with 3:38 left when the Wolves had what Finch called a \"mental breakdown\" on defense. \"We have belief against anyone. But we are our worst enemy, every time,\" said center Rudy Gobert, who had nine points and six rebounds. \"And it's a great thing, but it can also be a thing that's not great when we beat ourselves.\" The memo for the Wolves to Towns was to play more under control on Sunday after he struggled the first two games. But nothing he did worked. His reliable three-point shot has been non-existent. \"I feel every shot's good,\" Towns said. \"I've shot a lot of basketballs in my life. I'm the first one in the gym. I definitely am working. I'm shooting. Every time I'm shooting, it feels good. I'm just having these very unfortunate bounces all the time. It's annoying.\" Also annoying to the Wolves was the officiating, especially in the third quarter, when Dallas shot 17 free throws. That was as many as the Wolves shot in the game. (Dallas finished with 31.) The Wolves felt the Mavericks were committing the same fouls to them that they were to Dallas. \"It's about consistency on both ends,\" Conley said. \"That's all we ask for at the end of the day.\" That's also what the Wolves are asking of themselves. About the only constant, win or lose, is the positivity emanating from Edwards, who is convinced the Wolves still have a great game in them against a Dallas team that has so far figured them out. Edwards was asked how he can keep from having a sky-is-falling attitude. It's who he has always been, he said. \"I never seen the sky falling,\" Edwards said. \"I don't know, I'm always positive, always happy. I've been through the worst, so the sky is never falling for me.\" ©2024 StarTribune. Visit at startribune.com . Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",

        "content": "A Fortnite leak points to the potential introduction of a new Sniper Rifle that will deal tons of damage to vehicles. Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3 has received mixed reception from its player base, thus far. Many complaints have , which load cars with machine gun turrets, bulletproof tires, cow catchers, and more. The consensus is that it’s nearly impossible to survive a battle royale match without driving around in a souped-up ride. And while other Season 3 items like the , players still think Epic needs to either nerf cars or add more weapons that better balance the experience. Leaks making the rounds via and RyanDoesLeaks suggest another counter to vehicles may arrive in the form of new Sniper Rifles. As pointed out by , the potential damage-dealing power of the gun means it could do up to 3x damage on vehicles. Stats are subject to change but these are the most likely, only going over the legendary stats here. Damage: 138 Headshot Multiplier: 2.5x (345 damage) Structure Damage: 193 Firing Rate: 0.64 Reload Time: 2.7s Ammo: 1 Projectile Speed/Gravity is the same as the Reaper Sniper The weapon’s alleged ability to only hold one shot at a time could prove a problem, of course. And, according to subsequent posts from , Fortnite’s new Sniper Rifle will not allow players to upgrade it with a drum mag attachment. If this weapon is coming to Chapter 5 Season 3, there is currently no word on when players can expect it to arrive in-game. Season 3: Wrecked launched on Friday, May 24, introducing several new locales to the lower part of the map, on top of the . Fallout’s Nuka-Cola and T-60 Power Armor also entered the fray at the start of this season. Epic Games could have even more up its sleeve in the weeks and months ahead. For instance, previous leaks point to Season 3 also adding , including treasure maps, flintlock pistols, and pirate cannons.",

        "content": "Thirty-six years ago, in Providence, Rhode Island, I met Tito, a scrawny Italian with a scraggly beard and a resolute spirit. Working together in an automobile battery factory, Tito taught me the power of cooperative collaboration. He shared an Italian saying: “The world is so hard, a man must have two fathers to look after him, and that’s why they have godfathers.” What Tito said was true. A man’s gifts and talents may not see the light of day until he begins to ride on other peoples’ shoulders. These people become mentors and facilitators of good tidings. Great mentors will sow into your life without an expectation of returns. The mean godfathers I call ‘pharaoh’ only need you to make bricks for them and without straws under hard labour. A man who finds himself leaning on the shrill shoulders of mean men will have his life roil up in turbid turmoil. But the shoulders of merciful men are swathed up with honey that brings about good treasures. In this week’s treatise, I delve into the trending political squabble and turmoil in Rivers State between two powerful figures: current Governor Siminalayi Fubara and Federal Capital Territory minister, Nyesom Wike. While I have no stake in Rivers politics, it’s clear that godfatherism is a significant theme in Nigerian politics. It is the tone and tune of the murky terrain. I am not certain how the paths of both men crossed. But we know that Fubara was once a Director of Finance and Accounts at the State Government House. Then he rose to the position of Permanent Secretary before becoming the Accountant General of Rivers State in 2020. For about a decade Fubara carried the bag of cash for Wike as the former governor’s money man. He was also his ‘yes’ man. The broad shoulders of godfather Wike later carried the young man into the governor’s mansion in Port Harcourt as a successor. During the godfathering season, Fubara didn’t have to question why Wike wanted him to jump. He asked how high. Jumping jack Fubara is now tired of jumping. He wants to be his own man without any recourse to the political lightning rod godfather, and a man now accused of breathing down bigly and boisterously down the neck of a man in charge of one of the richest oil states in Nigeria. Wike obviously does not know that what men can do at any point in time is better determined when you give them money and power. As of today, his son, Fubara, has both. Wike’s ‘‘sim” card played during the election is out of network. The choice of Sim as a successor was a subtle way of perpetuating the minister’s chokehold on Rivers’ bubbly cash base. His plan was to order and command the governor around at will like a male servant; telling him what to do, and how to disburse funds to cronies. That is what Nigerian political leaders do. They have no constitutional opportunity for a third term in office. Their prepackaged successors become their anthropomorphic extended stay in the purlieu of power. If this is not a perfect definition of upgraded greed, I wonder what it is. But Wike has denied any attempt to remotely control the governor or his administration. Too many tales spewed out there on social media and you don’t know what to believe. In one of his many interviews and chats all around, Wike said that his grouse is the furtive dismantling of his political structures he bequeathed to his son. But this structure helps him maintain his political grip on Rivers. I think the Ikwere lion needs to be reminded that the boy he made a man also has his eyes on the future and wants to have his own place in history. Fubara is judged a quiet fella. But watch out for quiet people. Many consider them very crafty; some say they are dangerous. In my opinion, they are people who always have their eyes on the ball. Quiet and ever-smiling personalities I’ve met know what they want, and they’ll do anything to have it. Wike is verbose, Fubara is taciturn. But this governor is not a fool. If Wike thought that the governor is a docile ‘sim’ card he could plug in and out of any network to do his bidding, the Abuja minister has another thing coming. That is what is playing out between father and son in Rivers today. The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last election, Atiku Abubakar, and the party’s top apparatchiks are so excited right now that Fubara is not laying down and playing dead for Wike or anyone. I am certain that the governor gets his energy boost from them and from many bigwigs in the All Progressives Congress who detest the minister. Where do Rivers people stand in this duel? I have a decent knowledge about how they think. Rivers people are natural born PDP members. They have no shred of love for the ruling party. The abracadabra outcome of the last presidential election still angers them. They hate the idea that Wike is lying in the same political bed with Tinubu. Their desire is to get the state fully back home where they belong. And the PDP is home for them. In the daddy/son scuffle between Wike and Fubara, the sitting governor has the upper hand. He is loyal to the PDP, he has the cash tranche, and he who has the money has the men. What must be going on in the head of President Bola Tinubu now? It is nothing but how a peaceful resolution can be facilitated. A friend suggested that the president would grant Wike the free will to platoon up the state, make it ungovernable for Fubara, declare a state of emergency, and then derail and dethrone Fubara as governor. If you think that is the response you will get from this president, you don’t know Tinubu. Mr President will tread carefully. If he decides to run for re-election in 2027, we’ve got to wait until then. But for now, this president is thinking calmness and serenity in his domain and weighing his own political options too. For every politician, it’s always about the next election and how to win it. This president is not exempted from that school of thought. If Rivers State boils in violence and pandemonium, it may engulf the whole region. Who wants that? Twelveth-century French Neo-Platonist philosopher Bernard Chartres said: “...we see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature.”All men need other men to become great men. No godfather holds sway and stranglehold on a people forever. There will come a time when either the people he lords over wise up and push back hard, or the godfather who thinks he is ‘god of men’ is rendered a mere man by the God of heaven who created him. Godfathers’ reigning tenures have an expiration date that even godfathers may have no clue about. Are the godfathering days of Nyesom Wike coming to a humiliating and humbling close, or a heroic and high-flying draw-down? I don’t know. From the rooftop we watch.",

        "content": "Talks between Israel and Qatari and Egyptian mediators in the negotiations to secure the release of hostages are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, initially to be held remotely. Israeli officials involved in the talks said the offensive in Rafah may put further negotiations into question after Hamas demanded that IDF troops pull out of Rafah before the talks could resume. But others claimed that the Hamas demand remains to end the war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes an end to the fighting, which could impact any chance for an agreement. \"There are discussions with the mediators in Egypt and Qatar and they are supposed to relay Israel's answers to Hamas,\" an official said. 2 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Knesset Photo; Shalev Shalom Netanyahu said earlier on Monday, that the release of the hostages is his goal as he rejected reports that he had limited the authority of Israel's negotiating team. \"We all watch with pain the shocking video clip of the abduction of the female soldiers and our hearts were ripped,\" he said speaking from the Knesset podium. \"The hostages are always top of mind and I reject with contempt any claim that I prevent the negotiating team the mandate they have requested or turn down any of their requests. I was asked for a broader scope, five times, by the negotiators and agreed to their requests all of those times,\" he said. The prime minister said only Sinwar was the obstacle to any deal and the pressure should be on him and not the Israeli government. \"Sinwar is sitting nicely in his bunker, happy that others are doing the work for him: lawmakers, citizens. Hamas must be put under pressure and we are doing that as we fight in Gaza. I will keep on fighting until we win.\" 2 Family members call for the immediate release of hostages during the prime minister's speech at the Knesset Photo: Ahmad Gharabli / AFP During his speech members of the families of hostages held up posters with their loved ones' photographs and called out demands for their immediate release, interrupting the prime minister. >",

        "description": "The Harley-Davidson Shovelhead engine may be infamous in its own right, but how did it earn its iconic name and what ultimately happened to it.",
        "content": "Although Harley-Davidson is synonymous with high-quality motorcycles, the company doesn't get enough credit for its creative engine names. In fact, the manufacturer had an entire line of head-themed engines, including the Knucklehead, Panhead, and Shovelhead, with some featuring in the rarest Harley-Davidson motorcycles ever built . For better or worse, the Shovelhead stands apart in terms of popularity, even Elvis Presley had one, but how did it get its name? Harley-Davidson's Shovelhead engine debuted in the mid-1960s after demand skyrocketed for a more powerful engine capable of moving modern, heavier motorcycles. Naturally, as the successor to the Panhead (which itself came after the Knucklehead), it was pretty obvious that Harley-Davidson needed to continue the naming system trend, and so the Shovelhead was born. Following in suit of its predecessors, the Shovelhead engine got its name from the shape of its rocker covers, also known as valve covers. At the time, the newly-designed engine parts drew similarities to the blade of a coal shovel. Unsurprisingly, the Knucklehead and Panhead also got their naming inspiration from the shape of the engines' rocker covers. Although today, the Shovelhead's valve covers resemble a V or U, its shovel-like shape gave Harley-Davidson an apt name to continue its head-themed engine line. Shovelhead isn't Harley-Davidson's most powerful motorcycle engine , but it had a successful run from 1966 to 1982. Unfortunately, time more or less ended the Shovelhead engine's reign. However, it wasn't the same situation as the Panhead, which ultimately wasn't strong enough for modern motorcycles. Instead, geopolitics marked the end of the Shovelhead. In 1974, the ramifications of the ongoing oil crisis began to take effect, resulting in fuel scarcity. What gasoline was available had a lower octane number which made it less stable and consistent, bringing a slew of problems to engines worldwide. With the Shovelhead, the low-quality fuel resulted in engine knocking which then caused overheating. As the engine got hotter, the aluminum expanded and oil leaks quickly became a problem. Unfortunately, American Machine and Foundry, the owners of Harley-Davidson at the time, decided to continue production without addressing the engine's issues. It didn't take long for oil leakage to become a serious problem for the Shovelhead. In fact, it was so bad that it overshadowed everything Harley-Davidson had accomplished with the engine, earning it a notorious reputation. It was eventually replaced by the Evolution engine. Today, the oil leak problems are arguably the most well-known aspect of the Shovelhead.",

        "content": "BENGALURU: Thousands of women rushed to Bengaluru General Post Office (GPO) on Monday after a rumour that some political parties would transfer Rs 8,000 in their post-office accounts. GPO officials had to deploy additional personnel to facilitate opening of new accounts and sought police help to regulate the crowd, which started assembling from 3 am. The talk was that the postal department was depositing the money in every single account opened under the India Post Payment Bank . The rumours were afloat on WhatsApp over the last week and went viral in RWA groups. Believing that Monday was the last date for registration, hundreds of women reached GPO. Sources in the postal department told TOI that people believed that opening of the account was the beginning of the process to get cash incentive . Others believed the programme was already under way, and the postal department had started crediting Rs 8,000 into everyone's account. HM Manjesh, chief postmaster at the GPO, said: \" We even put up posters at entry gates saying there was no such cash incentive programme or initiative announced by the postal department ...\" On Monday alone, over 2,000 women had reached GPO by the afternoon. \"We used to open an average 100 to 200 accounts daily. But over the last one week, we've been opening 700 to 800 accounts everyday at GPO alone,\" said an official.",

The reposted an advert from the USA Memorabilia Fortitude collection, which showcased a pair of necklaces available for purchase on its website. The necklaces are offered in two styles - the Bravery and Liberty versions. The Bravery necklace is available in stainless steel and gold, featuring an engraved soldier and the US flag. Priced at $125 (£98) for the stainless steel option and $175 (£137) for the gold-plated version, the Liberty necklace also mirrors these prices and materials. \"The Fortitude Collection celebrates our service members, our Nation, and our freedom,\" reads a statement on the USA Memorabilia website. The site also mentions that the designs can be \"engrafted with names, initials, significant dates, and symbols to create a one-of-a-kind piece of jewelry.\" However, Melania's Instagram post drew sharp criticism, with one user commenting: \"Zero Trumps have served in the US military, grifter.\" Another critic on X remarked: \"Very cheap items sold at very high prices to people who need to choose between food, medicine, or baubles sold by a billionaire who will never look at them under any other circumstances! \". has largely remained out of the public spotlight during her husband's high-profile criminal trial. However, insiders have reportedly disclosed her perceptions of the former president's court proceedings. She allegedly reacted with fury when there were initial allegations that had silenced adult actress with a payment to suppress claims of an affair, something he continues to refute. When these accusations first emerged, Melania distanced herself, jetting off to Palm Beach and leaving Donald alone in Washington DC. On her return, she significantly traveled in a separate car to Donald J. Trump's first State of the Union address. As a criminal trial against Mr Trump unfolds in Manhattan, accusing the property tycoon of falsifying his company records to cover up a hefty payout of $130,000 (£102,342) to silence adult entertainer Stormy Daniels, Melania has remained conspicuously quiet. It's understood that Melania has privately labeled the criminal trial against her spouse as \"a disgrace\", as reported by The New York Times. She purportedly views the legal battle as akin to election meddling, as revealed by someone privy to her comments, while claiming that she sees the trial as solely \"his problem\".",

US-based content creator David Long shared the most reliable vehicles in a three-part TikTok series with his more than 40,000 followers. The car enthusiast explained that his top picks were the 2000-2005 Buick Lesabre, the 1999-2006 Chevy Silverado or the GMC Sierra, the 2004-2009 Lexus RX 350, the 1998-2012 Ford Crown Victoria, the 1996-2000 Lexus LS 400, and the 2001-2007 Toyota Highlander. David said the six cars were 'no brainer buys,' which to him meant that ' as long as it's been up-kept, good service, it has not been wrecked, or it's not a flood car, then these cars are cars you can buy with confidence.' The mechanic started off his video by talking through his first choice: the 2000-2005 Buick Lesabre. US-based content creator David Long has shared the six most reliable used cars in a three-part TikTok series with his more than 40,000 followers The car's perks include a 3.8 V6 in automatic transmission, and it goes up to 30 miles per gallon on the highway. He mentioned that it was less likely to break, and if it did, its parts could be bought for cheap and were easily accessible. David noted that if the original plastic coolant elbows under the alternator started to leak, they could be easily replaced with metal. The car lasts 300,000 to 400,000 miles in its lifetime, and costs from $2,000 to $5,000. The second car on the list was the 1999 to 2006 Chevy Silverado, or the GMC Sierra. He explained why he didn't go past the year 2006 when it came to the model, stating: 'We start to get into the garbage active fuel management, and we all know those are trash, and when they fail, it grenades the engine or it can grenade the engine.' The car is 'the 4.8 or the 5.3 LS-based V8,' and 'they're called the Vortec 5.3 or 4.8,' and it has six liters. He added: 'You could get them in special edition trucks or in three quarter tons, but we're just talking about the budget half-ton truck. David shared that some of his top picks are the 2000-2005 Buick Lesabre, the 1999-2006 Chevy Silverado or the GMC Sierra, and the 2004-2009 Lexus RX 350 Mechanic's top six 'no brainer buys' list 2000-2005 Buick Lesabre 1999 -2006 Chevy Silverado or the GMC Sierra 2004 -2009 Lexus RX 350 1998-2012 Ford Crown Victoria 1996-2000 Lexus LS 400 2001-2007 Toyota Highlander Advertisement 'These can have a manual transmission, or you can get them in automatic, and four-by-four [or] a two-wheel drive - those are up to you [and] what you're looking for.' The car can also tow a small camper or trailer, and its price ranges from $5,000 to $10,000. The third car on his list was the 2004 to 2009 Lexus RX 350, which was a mid-size SUV. It comes in 3.3 V6 or a 3.5 V6, and can easily do 30 miles per gallon on the highway. The car's older models prior to 2009 go for $5,000 to $10,000. The fourth car that made the cut was the 1998 to 2012 Ford Crown Victoria, which cops used as their car-of-choice - however, the popular car stopped being produced in 2012. David wrote: 'These cars are the epitome of bulletproof. They are dead reliable. 'Ford really hit the nail on the head. They really hit the bull's eye here when they built a car that was reliable, comfortable, and easy to maintain.' The car has a '4.6 V8 and has an automatic transmission,' however, David noted that 'they're not fuel efficient.' It can go up to 25 miles per gallon on the highway, and it has a lifetime mileage of 300,000 to 400,000 miles. @car.wizard.us1 The top 6 most reliable vehicles under 10K!

P2 #Help for you ♬ original sound - lovetik.us23 - lovetik.us23 If any parts needed to be repaired, they were 'very plentiful and very cheap,' he also pointed out. David added: 'This is called the Panther Platform - its also the Lincoln Town Car, [or the] Mercury Grand Marquis. 'There's several vehicles that use this platform, but it is one of the best, if not, the best platform that Ford Motor Company has ever made in the history of their company. It's definitely a no-brainer buy.' The fifth car on the list was the 1996 to 2000 Lexus LS 400. David explained: 'These are getting old - they're [24] years old now, but for a 2000, they are reliable. 'There's so many still on the road. They are literally tanks. They are built beyond extremely reliable. They have a world-renowned level of reliability.' The car has a four-liter V8 and an automatic transmission. If you need to replace any parts, they can be a 'little bit more expensive because its a Toyota.' The car can go between 25 and 27 miles per gallon on the highway. @car.wizard.us1 The top 6 most reliable vehicles under 10K! P3 #Help for you ♬ original sound - lovetik.us23 - lovetik.us23 The three-part video series got more than 500,000 views - and many people took to the comment section to share their thoughts The 1996-2000 year range means the car is an OBD2, which according to David means: 'If you have a check engine light, your local parts store can still read the code for free, and you might be able to fix the car yourself if its fairy cheap.' The car's price ranges from $5,000 to $10,000, and most are on the higher end. David noted: 'They knocked it out of the park with the LS 400. You can't go wrong with that one.' The final and sixth car on his list was the 2001 to 2007 Toyota Highlander, which is a mix between a small and medium-SUV. David shared his personal connection to the car, explaining: 'My own father owns one. 'He asked me years ago what kind of car he should buy - he [was] looking for a little SUV. I said, \"Go get a Highlander, you will thank me later,\" and he did. 'Years later, he thanked me. He said, \"I'm getting to the stage in life - I'm getting older. I don't have time to constantly be finagling under the hood, [and] trying to fix stuff.\"' He said his father added: 'This car has served me so well. It always starts, it always runs and its not leaking a drop nowhere.' The car features a 2.44 cylinder, has three liters, and is a 3.3 V6 that goes between 25 to 30 miles per gallon on the highway. David added that the car was 'very fuel efficient,' offered third-row seating, had a lifetime mileage of 300,000 miles, and the price ranged between $5,000 to $10,000. In conclusion, David shared: 'Yes, you should go buy one of those six. Please, go out and buy one of those. You won't regret it, but make sure to check the interior out. 'Make sure it's been taken care of - it's not been shredded, not had kids tear it up, or literally pets urinating in it or something like that. Make sure that's clean as well.' The three-part video series got more than 500,000 views - and many people took to the comment section to share their thoughts. One person wrote, 'Anything Toyota. The end,' while a second person commented, 'Nothing is more reliable than a Toyota.' A third person agreed: 'Toyotas are the bomb. Picked up an 05 Sequoia sr5 2wd and it's been a rockstar.' 'Toyota, Toyota, Toyota.... period,' a fourth person wrote. A fifth commented: 'Any Ford with the 4.6 will go forever.' A different user added: 'I always wondered why car companies retired ridiculously successful engine platforms, and never made sense to me.' Another person said: 'New Toyotas have turbos and failed engines.'

        "content": "DALLAS -- Rookie center is listed as doubtful for Tuesday's Game 4 because of his sprained neck, but the could have another key reserve big man return as they attempt to complete a sweep of the in the Western Conference finals. Power forward/center , who has been sidelined since suffering a separation of the AC joint in his right shoulder during Dallas' first-round closeout win over the , has been upgraded to questionable. Superstar guard is listed as questionable because of his right knee sprain and left ankle soreness. He has been listed as questionable multiple times during the Mavs' playoff run, but he has not missed any games. Lively suffered the neck sprain when Timberwolves power forward inadvertently kneed him in the back of the head when Lively was falling to the floor early in the third quarter of Sunday's Game 3. He has not entered the NBA's concussion protocol. Lively, a second-team All-Rookie selection, has averaged 8.5 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.1 blocks while shooting 65.3% from the floor during the playoffs. The Mavs have outscored playoff opponents by a total of 109 points with Lively on the floor, the West's second-best postseason plus-minus this year, behind only Minnesota center . \"We have to have next-man-up mentality,\" Doncic said after Sunday's win. \"Obviously, he's an amazing player. He's helped us so, so much in these playoffs and in the regular season. So obviously we're going to miss him if he can't play. But we got to have next-man-up mentality.\" Kleber was a key role player during the Mavs' run to the West finals two years ago and a major contributor during Dallas' six-game victory over the Clippers in the first round, when he made 10 of 18 3-point attempts and played outstanding defense. His presence provides lineup versatility to coach Jason Kidd, as Kleber is capable of playing center in small lineups that employ a five-out offensive style, and power forward in big lineups.",

        "content": "Pope Francis allegedly used an offensive slur during a discussion with bishops over admitting homosexual men into seminaries, several Italian newspapers have reported. The pontiff, 87, is alleged to have made the remark during a closed-door meeting with bishops in Rome last week, where they were reportedly discussing whether out gay men should be admitted to Catholic seminaries, where priests are trained, a topic that the Italian bishops conference (CIE) is said to have been pondering for some time. During the discussion, when one of the bishops asked Francis what he should do, the pope reportedly reiterated his objection in admitting gay men, saying that while it was important to embrace everyone, it was likely that a gay person could risk leading a double life. He is then alleged to have added that there was already too much “frociaggine”, a vulgar Italian word that roughly translates at “faggotness”, in some seminaries. The story was first reported by the political gossip website Dagospia, before being covered by the Italian dailies La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, and the news agency Adnkronos. La Repubblica, Corriere and Adnkronos quoted unnamed bishops, who said that the pontiff meant the derogatory term as a “joke”, and that those around him were surprised and perplexed by the alleged slur. One bishop told Corriere della Sera that the pontiff might not have been aware that the term was offensive. La Repubblica and Corriere reported that there was a meeting among bishops in November during which it was decided that homosexual men could be admitted to seminaries, so long as they did not practise their sexuality, but that the move was ultimately stopped by the pope. Since he was elected pope in 2013, Francis has sought to adopt a more inclusive tone towards the LGBTQ+ community in his public statements, much to the disdain of conservative cardinals. Soon after becoming pope, he famously said in response to a question about gay priests: “Who am I to judge?” He approved a ruling in December allowing priests to bless unmarried and same-sex couples in what was a significant change of position for the Catholic church. However, he has been clear about not allowing gay people to join the clergy. In an interview in 2018 he said he was “concerned” about what he describes as the “serious issue” of homosexuality and that being gay is a “fashion” to which the clergy is susceptible. “In our societies it even seems that homosexuality is fashionable, and that mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the church,” he said at the time. The Roman Catholic church’s position is that homosexual acts are sinful. A decree on training for priests in 2016 stressed the obligation of sexual abstinence, as well as barring gay men and those who support “gay culture” from holy orders.",

HPD posted on platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that Clear Lake officers responded to a small lake in the 9700 block of Windwater Drive sometime in the afternoon. According to Lt. Crowson of HPD, someone walking along the shore discovered one of the bodies and notified the police. The Houston Fire Department then responded to the body of water, which HPD described as a man-made lake, and found the second body. Police described the victims as two Hispanic men. Their ages are unknown. Officials said they believed the men may have been in the water since Sunday evening or Saturday. HPD is determining if the men lived at the apartment complex near the lake.

Australian golfer Adam Scott talks to Forbes Australia about co-owning the Gold Coast Glory Major League Pickleball team.The post It’s America’s fastest growing sport. Now this Aussie superstar wants to invest appeared first on Forbes Australia.",
        "content": "From glory on the golf course, to ownership on the pickleball court. Australian golfer Adam Scott talks to Forbes Australia about co-owning the Gold Coast Glory Major League Pickleball team. LeBron James, Tom Brady, and Patrick Mahomes are doing it. Now, homegrown golfing hero Adam Scott is getting in on the pickleball action. Queensland-raised Scott has signed on as an owner of the Gold Coast Glory pickleball team, joining Australian olympian Natalie Cook in the venture. The Glory won the Major League Pickleball Australia event held in Brisbane earlier this month. “I’m proud to be a part of this organisation and look forward to celebrating more team championships in the future,” Scott said. “Congratulations to the Gold Coast Glory on their recent win at the Brisbane Championships. I’d also like to congratulate the Glory’s own Roman Estereja for taking home MVP honours,” says Scott. A post shared by Gold Coast Glory (@goldcoastglory.pb) What is Pickleball? The sport was invented in Seattle, Washington in 1965. It is described as a combination of tennis, badminton, and ping pong. Like tennis, pickleball can be played as a singles competition or doubles and takes place on a court. Rather than a racquet, players use a paddle similar, though larger, than what is used in table tennis. The global pickleball market is projected to more than double to $3.5 billion within seven years, according to a US report. Some 48 million adult Americans played pickleball in 2023, according to a report from the Association of Pickleball Players – almost double Australia’s population. It is the fastest-growing sport in the US for the third year in a row, and is gaining traction in Australia too. “With participation now surpassing tennis, the sport is long past a fad for Australia,” says Anthony Liveris, the President and co-founder of Pacific Pickleball. “It’s just a matter of how big. Australia is one of the fastest-growing markets outside of North America, and the only one with an active professional league that competes on the global stage,” says Liveris. He and co-founder Adam Thompson launched the Major League Pickleball Australia competition in November last year. There are currently four professional teams: Sydney Smash , Melbourne Mavericks , Brisbane Breakers , and Gold Coast Glory. The founders say the game is exploding in popularity and aim to reach 1 million players across APAC by 2032. Major League Pickleball is offering $700,000 in prize money this year, distributed between six competitions in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. A post shared by Gold Coast Glory (@goldcoastglory.pb) “The explosive popularity of the sport in Australia has created a strong need for professional events. Participation in the sport currently exceeds 25,000 and membership has doubled in the last 12 months,” says Brendan Lee, the CEO of the Pickleball Australia Association. Pickleball in Australia The average age of players in Australia is 58, according to Pickleball Australia. The largest club is in the Gold Coast, and Queensland is the most popular state for the sport. More women (56%) than men (44%) play in Australia, a reverse trend to that seen in the U.S. Pickleball Australia has more than 500 courts across the country, 200 qualified referees, 150 affiliated clubs, and 10,000 members. “With the rapid growth in broadcasting, equipment sales, event hires, and stadium attendance, the total pickleball market in Australia is projected to be worth tens of millions by 2032. The existing Australian racquet sports equipment market is already worth A$75 million alone,” says Liveris. Gold Coast Glory is not the only team owned by Australian sporting legends. Cricketer Steve Smith is at the helm of Sydney Smash, and basketballer Patty Mills has a stake in the Brisbane Breakers.

        "description": "Despite sunny skies in some areas, a severe thunderstorm watch was still active throughout much of central Pa. until 9 p.m. tonight.",
        "content": "Did rain wash out your Memorial Day plans, only for sun to persist throughout the holiday? Residents in several municipalities woke up to disappointment to see their annual town parades canceled because of predicted thunderstorms and bad weather. Initial forecasts showed problematic weather beginning as soon as 5 a.m., leading to some of the cancelations. Then projections were pushed back to the afternoon. But by Monday evening, no severe weather had been reported. Why not? Morning rain showers across central Pennsylvania kept forecasted storms from being severe, according to an official from the National Weather Service (NWS). The potential for severe weather still persists, however , according to Michael Colbert, a meteorologist with the NWS. Temperature instability is one of the factors that can play into a severe weather event, like thunderstorms, Colbert said. The showers that dotted central Pa. around noon helped stabilize the temperature and reduce the likelihood of severe weather. “So its a good thing morning rain showers came, that limited the afternoon threat,” Colbert said. There are still pockets of showers occurring around central Pa., Colbert said. And a severe thunderstorm watch is still in effect for the region until 9 p.m. That region includes Adams, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lycoming, Montour, Northumberland, Perry, Snyder, Sullivan, Union and York counties. A severe thunderstorm watch is different than a severe thunderstorm warning. Under a watch, severe storms are possible: Weather conditions favor thunderstorms capable of producing large hail or damaging wind. But under a warning, severe storms are expected, and residents should seek shelter because large hail or damaging wind is actively occurring or will occur shortly.

        "content": "A bodybuilder, who plummeted three stone in five weeks and lost the ability to speak, has shared what saved him from a terrifying disease. Dad-of-three, Jared Maynard was diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe inflammatory syndrome, at the beginning of 2023 after a short bout of illness. He quickly declined, suffering delirium and organ failure, and doctors began to believe they had no choice but to administer palliative, or end-of-life care. Kardashians spot alarming weight loss discovery in Scott Disick's fridge Paranoid Putin has four doctors and 100 guards on alert at palace - leaked docs But, after five weeks on life support and a \"miracle\" turnaround, Jared did recover. \"During those weeks on life support, I was too ill to receive much nutrition through the feeding tube that was inserted,\" he told Need To Know. \"That meant that my body had to rely on the muscle I already had to sustain me. \"I was admitted to the hospital weighing 193 pounds (87.5kg) and woke up in the ICU weighing about 150 pounds (68kg). \"My doctors told me that without me being as fit and strong as I was going in, I likely wouldn't have made it through.\" Jared, his wife, Ashley, 32, and their three daughters, Elizabeth, 6, Mary-Claire, 6, and Cecilia, 3, all came down with a cold last January. After a week, Jared's family began to recover. But he was only getting worse. Mom says mold in her house is so bad it's left her fearing for her son's life Cruise ship food to never eat and the eight rules to follow to avoid being sick 'Eating 10,000 hot dogs has forced me to give up my job' After his lymph nodes swelled to the point where they felt like \"mountain ranges\" under his skin, Jared went to see his doctor, who initially thought he had mononucleosis, a viral infection. Then his skin turned yellow and his liver began to fail. Within six days, Jared was on life support. He'd been diagnosed with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a severe inflammatory syndrome that occurs after a strong activation of the immune system. In Jared's case, it was a response to the mononucleosis infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. Jared, a physiotherapist, strength coach and entrepreneur from Ontario, Canada, said: \"My liver and kidneys were failing, along with other organs. I had to be sedated, ventilated and put on dialysis. \"I don't have much memory from when I was diagnosed because of the delirium I was experiencing and the sedative drugs that I was placed on.\" Jared’s health rapidly declined. He said: \"The treatment for HLH is a protocol involving chemotherapy among other things, but I was too sick to receive the full dose. \"I began to recover after that last treatment, much to the surprise of the doctors and nurses in the ICU. It was enough to earn me the nickname 'Miracle Man,' in fact.\" Jared was on life support for a total of five weeks. His doctors credit his survival to the fitness and muscle mass he had developed through years of weight training. Jared's recovery has been long and difficult. He had to learn how to breathe, speak, and swallow on his own again. He also had to learn how to sit, walk and stand. After almost four months in the hospital, he was finally allowed to return home in May 2023. He said: \"I was in constant pain for months during and after my hospital stay. I have nerve damage in my feet, presumably from the chemotherapy. I've also lost my sense of smell for the same reason. \"I was bed-bound for a month after leaving the hospital and was no longer the strong, capable man I knew myself to be before this.\" Despite everything, Jared was determined to get his strength back for his wife and girls. He said: \"I'll never forget how happy I was to find out I'd built enough strength to pick up the lightest of my three daughters. “I picked up the next lightest a few days later. Finally, I could pick up all of my daughters. It felt like a piece of my heart was restored. \"I feel strong again now. I've grieved my losses with the help of a mental health professional, which has allowed me to devote my energy to walking this new recovery path. \"I'm currently free from HLH and am monitored by my doctors. I will also be returning to powerlifting competitions in a few weeks. \"I feel like me again, even though I have some new scars and mementoes to remind me of where I've been. \"I'm still facing some aftermath from the HLH, like breathing issues and lasting kidney damage. \"I also have to be cautious about exposure to germs and overworking myself, because I can get sick more easily and to a greater extent than before. But I'm reclaiming my identity of being strong and resilient.\" Jared shares his journey on his Instagram page (@‌jared.rebuild_stronger), in hopes of inspiring others. He added: \"I've faced death down and lived to tell the tale. It's certainly given me more perspective on what matters and what doesn't in life. \"I wish people knew that building muscle, strength, and physical resilience is the best life insurance policy you'll ever take out. \"It's too easy to put yourself last on your list of priorities between work, school, kids and other obligations. We all think we have time to get our act together until we don't. I found that out the hard way. \"That means we need to care for our bodies and live intentionally.\"",

        "description": "As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske.",
        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. Roger Penske and Josef Newgarden pose with the Borg-Warner Trophy during the traditional winners photo session at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Monday in Indianapolis. Newgarden won the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function. Penske then suspended four crew members, including team president Tim Cindric, the best strategist in IndyCar who calls Newgarden's races. “It’s been a very illuminating experience to me, more from the outside world. I know what I take from that personally. I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen. I’ve never had it better than this month.” Pato O'Ward reacts after finishing second in the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sunday in Indianapolis. As Newgarden repeated last year's victory celebration by climbing through a hole in a fence to join fans in the grandstands, a devastated O'Ward sobbed inside his race car. He was trying to become the first Mexican winner in 108 runnings of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” and instead wound up with his second runner-up finish in three years. In 2022, he was accused of not being aggressive enough to beat Marcus Ericsson, and last year he was too aggressive and wrecked while racing Ericsson for the win. O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old. It was an odd scene for O'Ward, who admittedly wears his emotions on his sleeve but typically is the most upbeat driver in the paddock. Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far. I know it will be so special the day my name is written among the stars and I get to experience the magic everyone talks about.\" His face was tear-stained and his eyes swollen in the postrace news conference, but O'Ward was stoic. He said he didn't need to watch a replay of the final lap to see what he could have done differently to hold off Newgarden. “I think in a way I’ve cracked a code and I know how to position myself to win this race. I know I can win this race, and I know that I know how to also protect a good result when maybe the win isn’t in the cards for me,” he said. He was praised by six-time series champion Scott Dixon, a one-time Indy 500 winner, as well as Newgarden. When IndyCar stripped Newgarden of his St. Pete victory, it went to O'Ward, the initial runner-up, in his only win through five races so far this season. “He drove me excellently. I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. \"Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” It's called the \"greatest spectacle in racing,\" but fantastic auto racing isn't what makes the Indianapolis 500 one of the most iconic auto races of the year—the race traditions do. Stacker compiled five of the race's quirky traditions, sourcing information from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and other news outlets. Although the race takes place on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, festivities around it encompass May. Festivals, a minimarathon, and an annual parade attract hundreds of thousands of people to downtown Indianapolis. College-aged women vie to become one of 33 (equaling the number of drivers in the field) 500 Festival Princesses, who serve as ambassadors for the many race-related events. In Speedway, Indiana, the town surrounding the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, decorated homes welcome race fans to the world's largest stadium, which seats 235,000 people, though it was known to host up to 400,000 people in 1990. Drivers also have traditional events as they try to become one of the 33 to make the final starting field. In mid-May, they have three days of practice on the track before \"Fast Friday,\" when cars get turbocharge boosts to achieve top speed. Then it's on to two days of qualification, where drivers race solo for four laps of the track, pushing their car to its limits. If more than 33 drivers are vying to make the field, the second day is also known as Bump Day, for those who get bumped from the final starting lineup. Carb Day—shortened from Carburetion Day, since the cars no longer have carburetors—is the last day of practice for drivers and crews. A fan-focused event, it includes a pit stop challenge and rock concert. Despite the month's high-octane festivities, they are no match for what happens on race day, where more traditions help set this race apart from all others. The storied tradition of drinking milk began as most favorite traditions do: by accident. When Louis Meyer, the first driver to win three Indy 500s, was caught on camera sipping buttermilk straight from the bottle while he sat in Victory Lane after his third win in 1936, dairy industry executives saw that as a prime marketing opportunity. Milk vied with water as the victor's drink of choice for many years, but in 1956, the dairy industry offered prize money to the driver and chief mechanic for swigging milk after the win. Since then—except in 1993, when Emerson Fittipaldi drank orange juice first in honor of his 500,000-acre orange plantation—the sip of milk has become a time-honored tradition. Today, all drivers choose their preferred milk—fat-free, 2%, or whole milk—before the race so the dairy association can have it ready to go for the winner. The \"greatest spectacle in racing\" made a four-year pit stop between 1942 and 1945 due to World War II. When the race returned in 1946, organizers asked New York Metropolitan Opera singer James Melton to sing this ballad to welcome back drivers and fans. People loved it so much that the song became part of the prerace festivities, and Melton returned to sing it many times. Throughout the years, other famous celebrities, including Mel Tormé, Vic Damone, and Dinah Shore—the only woman to ever perform it—all participated in this tradition, but no one did it more often than Jim Nabors, an actor known for playing Gomer Pyle on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" Nabors fell into the gig in 1972, when Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman found him sitting in the grandstands and asked him to sing. Although Nabors had no idea what he was going to perform, he was a big hit with the fans and ended up coming back another 36 times before retiring in 2014. Since then, race organizers have asked singers who have ties to the state to perform the song, and in 2017, they hit the jackpot with Indiana University alum Jim Cornelison, who has sung it annually ever since. The cue to start up the Indy cars is one of the most anticipated moments of the prerace festivities, but it hasn't always been part of Indy 500 traditions. In the early days of the race, aerial bomb explosions gave the signal, but after the race returned after a World War II hiatus, public address announcer John \"Irish\" Horan thought the moment needed a little more oomph. The first record of him saying something close to, \"Gentlemen, start your engines,\" came in 1951; by 1953, the tradition took hold. The phrase changed in 1977, when Janet Guthrie became the first woman to ever qualify for the Indy 500, causing track owner Tony Hulman to announce, \"In company with the first lady ever to qualify at Indianapolis, gentlemen, start your engines!\" As more women made the starting field, the phrase became, \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines,\" which has evolved to today's, \"Drivers, start your engines!\" Postvictory, winners and their teams kneel in front of the 1-yard span of bricks—one of the track's earliest surfaces—at the finish line and ceremoniously kiss them. A newer Indy 500 tradition, it began at the Brickyard 400, Indianapolis Motor Speedway's NASCAR race. In 1996, Dale Jarrett won the third edition of the Brickyard 400, and he and his crew commemorated the victory by kissing the bricks. Subsequent winners continued to do so, but it took a few years for the tradition to jump to the Indy 500 race. It's unclear who was the first Indy 500 winner to kiss the bricks—the Indianapolis Motor Speedway believes 2005 winner Dan Wheldon may have been the first. Still, the Indianapolis Star cites 2003 winner Gil de Ferran as the original Indy 500 brick kisser. All winners are immortalized on the Borg-Warner Trophy, named for the automotive equipment manufacturer that commissioned it. Debuted at the 1936 race, the art deco-style sterling silver cup is ringed with sterling sculptures of the winning drivers' faces. The original cup ran out of room after 70 winners, so today's trophy includes a large base to accommodate winners through 2033. The extra base makes today's trophy one of the largest in sports, clocking in at over 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighing about 110 pounds. In 2022, Refinitiv Metals Research estimated its melt-down value at $40,537. Drivers may race to win the Borg-Warner Trophy, but they never get to take it home. Instead, Borg-Warner gives winning drivers a miniature replica of the cup—called a \"Baby Borg\"—that includes an identical sterling silver sculpture of their face. Story editing by Carren Jao.

        "content": "(Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday proposed tax cuts for millions of pensioners in his latest campaign pledge, highlighting the importance of older voters in the upcoming July election. Sunak's Conservative Party said it would introduce a new age-related allowance and deliver a tax cut of around 100 pounds ($128) for each of 8 million pensioners in 2025, rising to almost 300 pounds a year by the end of the next parliament. \"This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history,\" Sunak, who last week called a general election for July 4, said in the statement. The number of pensioners in Britain rose by 140,000 to 12.6 million in the year to February 2023. Close to 50 million Britons will be eligible to vote in the election, which opinion polls predict is likely to end 14 years of Conservative rule in the country. The Conservative Party said the proposal comes alongside the its commitment to the so-called triple lock, which guarantees increases to publicly funded pensions by the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is highest. Labour has also committed to retain the policy, which was introduced by a Conservative government in 2011 to prevent pensioners from falling into poverty. However, costs associated with it have come under increased scrutiny in recent years after British inflation soared, pushing up the government bill for state pensions by an additional 11 billion pounds last year. The new proposal, which the party termed \"triple lock plus,\" will cost 2.4 billion pounds a year by 2029/30 and be funded through the government's previously announced plan to raise an extra 6 billion pounds a year by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion, the party said. “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility,\" Labour shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said in a statement on the plans. The paymaster general falls under the Treasury and acts as a banker for most government departments. ($1 = 0.7831 pound) (Reporting by Muvija M; Editing by Elizabeth Piper and Jonathan Oatis)",

O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old. It was an odd scene for O'Ward, who admittedly wears his emotions on his sleeve but typically is the most upbeat driver in the paddock. Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far. I know it will be so special the day my name is written among the stars and I get to experience the magic everyone talks about.\" His face was tear-stained and his eyes swollen in the postrace news conference, but O'Ward was stoic. He said he didn't need to watch a replay of the final lap to see what he could have done differently to hold off Newgarden. “I think in a way I’ve cracked a code and I know how to position myself to win this race. I know I can win this race, and I know that I know how to also protect a good result when maybe the win isn’t in the cards for me,” he said. He was praised by six-time series champion Scott Dixon, a one-time Indy 500 winner, as well as Newgarden. When IndyCar stripped Newgarden of his St. Pete victory, it went to O'Ward, the initial runner-up, in his only win through five races so far this season. “He drove me excellently. I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. \"Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.”",

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. Roger Penske and Josef Newgarden pose with the Borg-Warner Trophy during the traditional winners photo session at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Monday in Indianapolis. Newgarden won the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function. Penske then suspended four crew members, including team president Tim Cindric, the best strategist in IndyCar who calls Newgarden's races. “It’s been a very illuminating experience to me, more from the outside world. I know what I take from that personally. I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen. I’ve never had it better than this month.” Pato O'Ward reacts after finishing second in the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sunday in Indianapolis. As Newgarden repeated last year's victory celebration by climbing through a hole in a fence to join fans in the grandstands, a devastated O'Ward sobbed inside his race car. He was trying to become the first Mexican winner in 108 runnings of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” and instead wound up with his second runner-up finish in three years. In 2022, he was accused of not being aggressive enough to beat Marcus Ericsson, and last year he was too aggressive and wrecked while racing Ericsson for the win. O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old.

Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far.

Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” It's called the \"greatest spectacle in racing,\" but fantastic auto racing isn't what makes the Indianapolis 500 one of the most iconic auto races of the year—the race traditions do. Stacker compiled five of the race's quirky traditions, sourcing information from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and other news outlets. Although the race takes place on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, festivities around it encompass May. Festivals, a minimarathon, and an annual parade attract hundreds of thousands of people to downtown Indianapolis. College-aged women vie to become one of 33 (equaling the number of drivers in the field) 500 Festival Princesses, who serve as ambassadors for the many race-related events. In Speedway, Indiana, the town surrounding the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, decorated homes welcome race fans to the world's largest stadium, which seats 235,000 people, though it was known to host up to 400,000 people in 1990. Drivers also have traditional events as they try to become one of the 33 to make the final starting field. In mid-May, they have three days of practice on the track before \"Fast Friday,\" when cars get turbocharge boosts to achieve top speed. Then it's on to two days of qualification, where drivers race solo for four laps of the track, pushing their car to its limits. If more than 33 drivers are vying to make the field, the second day is also known as Bump Day, for those who get bumped from the final starting lineup. Carb Day—shortened from Carburetion Day, since the cars no longer have carburetors—is the last day of practice for drivers and crews. A fan-focused event, it includes a pit stop challenge and rock concert. Despite the month's high-octane festivities, they are no match for what happens on race day, where more traditions help set this race apart from all others. The storied tradition of drinking milk began as most favorite traditions do: by accident. When Louis Meyer, the first driver to win three Indy 500s, was caught on camera sipping buttermilk straight from the bottle while he sat in Victory Lane after his third win in 1936, dairy industry executives saw that as a prime marketing opportunity. Milk vied with water as the victor's drink of choice for many years, but in 1956, the dairy industry offered prize money to the driver and chief mechanic for swigging milk after the win. Since then—except in 1993, when Emerson Fittipaldi drank orange juice first in honor of his 500,000-acre orange plantation—the sip of milk has become a time-honored tradition. Today, all drivers choose their preferred milk—fat-free, 2%, or whole milk—before the race so the dairy association can have it ready to go for the winner. The \"greatest spectacle in racing\" made a four-year pit stop between 1942 and 1945 due to World War II. When the race returned in 1946, organizers asked New York Metropolitan Opera singer James Melton to sing this ballad to welcome back drivers and fans. People loved it so much that the song became part of the prerace festivities, and Melton returned to sing it many times. Throughout the years, other famous celebrities, including Mel Tormé, Vic Damone, and Dinah Shore—the only woman to ever perform it—all participated in this tradition, but no one did it more often than Jim Nabors, an actor known for playing Gomer Pyle on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" Nabors fell into the gig in 1972, when Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman found him sitting in the grandstands and asked him to sing. Although Nabors had no idea what he was going to perform, he was a big hit with the fans and ended up coming back another 36 times before retiring in 2014. Since then, race organizers have asked singers who have ties to the state to perform the song, and in 2017, they hit the jackpot with Indiana University alum Jim Cornelison, who has sung it annually ever since. The cue to start up the Indy cars is one of the most anticipated moments of the prerace festivities, but it hasn't always been part of Indy 500 traditions. In the early days of the race, aerial bomb explosions gave the signal, but after the race returned after a World War II hiatus, public address announcer John \"Irish\" Horan thought the moment needed a little more oomph. The first record of him saying something close to, \"Gentlemen, start your engines,\" came in 1951; by 1953, the tradition took hold. The phrase changed in 1977, when Janet Guthrie became the first woman to ever qualify for the Indy 500, causing track owner Tony Hulman to announce, \"In company with the first lady ever to qualify at Indianapolis, gentlemen, start your engines!\" As more women made the starting field, the phrase became, \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines,\" which has evolved to today's, \"Drivers, start your engines!\" Postvictory, winners and their teams kneel in front of the 1-yard span of bricks—one of the track's earliest surfaces—at the finish line and ceremoniously kiss them. A newer Indy 500 tradition, it began at the Brickyard 400, Indianapolis Motor Speedway's NASCAR race. In 1996, Dale Jarrett won the third edition of the Brickyard 400, and he and his crew commemorated the victory by kissing the bricks. Subsequent winners continued to do so, but it took a few years for the tradition to jump to the Indy 500 race. It's unclear who was the first Indy 500 winner to kiss the bricks—the Indianapolis Motor Speedway believes 2005 winner Dan Wheldon may have been the first. Still, the Indianapolis Star cites 2003 winner Gil de Ferran as the original Indy 500 brick kisser. All winners are immortalized on the Borg-Warner Trophy, named for the automotive equipment manufacturer that commissioned it. Debuted at the 1936 race, the art deco-style sterling silver cup is ringed with sterling sculptures of the winning drivers' faces. The original cup ran out of room after 70 winners, so today's trophy includes a large base to accommodate winners through 2033. The extra base makes today's trophy one of the largest in sports, clocking in at over 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighing about 110 pounds. In 2022, Refinitiv Metals Research estimated its melt-down value at $40,537. Drivers may race to win the Borg-Warner Trophy, but they never get to take it home. Instead, Borg-Warner gives winning drivers a miniature replica of the cup—called a \"Baby Borg\"—that includes an identical sterling silver sculpture of their face. Story editing by Carren Jao.

I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen. I’ve never had it better than this month.” Pato O'Ward reacts after finishing second in the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sunday in Indianapolis. As Newgarden repeated last year's victory celebration by climbing through a hole in a fence to join fans in the grandstands, a devastated O'Ward sobbed inside his race car. He was trying to become the first Mexican winner in 108 runnings of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” and instead wound up with his second runner-up finish in three years. In 2022, he was accused of not being aggressive enough to beat Marcus Ericsson, and last year he was too aggressive and wrecked while racing Ericsson for the win. O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old. It was an odd scene for O'Ward, who admittedly wears his emotions on his sleeve but typically is the most upbeat driver in the paddock. Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far. I know it will be so special the day my name is written among the stars and I get to experience the magic everyone talks about.\" His face was tear-stained and his eyes swollen in the postrace news conference, but O'Ward was stoic. He said he didn't need to watch a replay of the final lap to see what he could have done differently to hold off Newgarden. “I think in a way I’ve cracked a code and I know how to position myself to win this race. I know I can win this race, and I know that I know how to also protect a good result when maybe the win isn’t in the cards for me,” he said. He was praised by six-time series champion Scott Dixon, a one-time Indy 500 winner, as well as Newgarden. When IndyCar stripped Newgarden of his St. Pete victory, it went to O'Ward, the initial runner-up, in his only win through five races so far this season. “He drove me excellently. I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. \"Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” The cue to start up the Indy cars is one of the most anticipated moments of the prerace festivities, but it hasn't always been part of Indy 500 traditions. In the early days of the race, aerial bomb explosions gave the signal, but after the race returned after a World War II hiatus, public address announcer John \"Irish\" Horan thought the moment needed a little more oomph. The first record of him saying something close to, \"Gentlemen, start your engines,\" came in 1951; by 1953, the tradition took hold. The phrase changed in 1977, when Janet Guthrie became the first woman to ever qualify for the Indy 500, causing track owner Tony Hulman to announce, \"In company with the first lady ever to qualify at Indianapolis, gentlemen, start your engines!\" As more women made the starting field, the phrase became, \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines,\" which has evolved to today's, \"Drivers, start your engines!\" Postvictory, winners and their teams kneel in front of the 1-yard span of bricks—one of the track's earliest surfaces—at the finish line and ceremoniously kiss them. A newer Indy 500 tradition, it began at the Brickyard 400, Indianapolis Motor Speedway's NASCAR race. In 1996, Dale Jarrett won the third edition of the Brickyard 400, and he and his crew commemorated the victory by kissing the bricks. Subsequent winners continued to do so, but it took a few years for the tradition to jump to the Indy 500 race. It's unclear who was the first Indy 500 winner to kiss the bricks—the Indianapolis Motor Speedway believes 2005 winner Dan Wheldon may have been the first. Still, the Indianapolis Star cites 2003 winner Gil de Ferran as the original Indy 500 brick kisser. All winners are immortalized on the Borg-Warner Trophy, named for the automotive equipment manufacturer that commissioned it. Debuted at the 1936 race, the art deco-style sterling silver cup is ringed with sterling sculptures of the winning drivers' faces. The original cup ran out of room after 70 winners, so today's trophy includes a large base to accommodate winners through 2033. The extra base makes today's trophy one of the largest in sports, clocking in at over 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighing about 110 pounds. In 2022, Refinitiv Metals Research estimated its melt-down value at $40,537. Drivers may race to win the Borg-Warner Trophy, but they never get to take it home. Instead, Borg-Warner gives winning drivers a miniature replica of the cup—called a \"Baby Borg\"—that includes an identical sterling silver sculpture of their face. Story editing by Carren Jao. Copy editing by Paris Close. It's called the \"greatest spectacle in racing,\" but fantastic auto racing isn't what makes the Indianapolis 500 one of the most iconic auto races of the year—the race traditions do. Stacker compiled five of the race's quirky traditions, sourcing information from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and other news outlets. Although the race takes place on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, festivities around it encompass May. Festivals, a minimarathon, and an annual parade attract hundreds of thousands of people to downtown Indianapolis. College-aged women vie to become one of 33 (equaling the number of drivers in the field) 500 Festival Princesses, who serve as ambassadors for the many race-related events. In Speedway, Indiana, the town surrounding the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, decorated homes welcome race fans to the world's largest stadium, which seats 235,000 people, though it was known to host up to 400,000 people in 1990. Drivers also have traditional events as they try to become one of the 33 to make the final starting field. In mid-May, they have three days of practice on the track before \"Fast Friday,\" when cars get turbocharge boosts to achieve top speed. Then it's on to two days of qualification, where drivers race solo for four laps of the track, pushing their car to its limits. If more than 33 drivers are vying to make the field, the second day is also known as Bump Day, for those who get bumped from the final starting lineup. Carb Day—shortened from Carburetion Day, since the cars no longer have carburetors—is the last day of practice for drivers and crews. A fan-focused event, it includes a pit stop challenge and rock concert. Despite the month's high-octane festivities, they are no match for what happens on race day, where more traditions help set this race apart from all others. The storied tradition of drinking milk began as most favorite traditions do: by accident. When Louis Meyer, the first driver to win three Indy 500s, was caught on camera sipping buttermilk straight from the bottle while he sat in Victory Lane after his third win in 1936, dairy industry executives saw that as a prime marketing opportunity. Milk vied with water as the victor's drink of choice for many years, but in 1956, the dairy industry offered prize money to the driver and chief mechanic for swigging milk after the win. Since then—except in 1993, when Emerson Fittipaldi drank orange juice first in honor of his 500,000-acre orange plantation—the sip of milk has become a time-honored tradition. Today, all drivers choose their preferred milk—fat-free, 2%, or whole milk—before the race so the dairy association can have it ready to go for the winner. The \"greatest spectacle in racing\" made a four-year pit stop between 1942 and 1945 due to World War II. When the race returned in 1946, organizers asked New York Metropolitan Opera singer James Melton to sing this ballad to welcome back drivers and fans. People loved it so much that the song became part of the prerace festivities, and Melton returned to sing it many times. Throughout the years, other famous celebrities, including Mel Tormé, Vic Damone, and Dinah Shore—the only woman to ever perform it—all participated in this tradition, but no one did it more often than Jim Nabors, an actor known for playing Gomer Pyle on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" Nabors fell into the gig in 1972, when Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman found him sitting in the grandstands and asked him to sing. Although Nabors had no idea what he was going to perform, he was a big hit with the fans and ended up coming back another 36 times before retiring in 2014. Since then, race organizers have asked singers who have ties to the state to perform the song, and in 2017, they hit the jackpot with Indiana University alum Jim Cornelison, who has sung it annually ever since.

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function.

The first record of him saying something close to, \"Gentlemen, start your engines,\" came in 1951; by 1953, the tradition took hold. The phrase changed in 1977, when Janet Guthrie became the first woman to ever qualify for the Indy 500, causing track owner Tony Hulman to announce, \"In company with the first lady ever to qualify at Indianapolis, gentlemen, start your engines!\" As more women made the starting field, the phrase became, \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines,\" which has evolved to today's, \"Drivers, start your engines!\" Postvictory, winners and their teams kneel in front of the 1-yard span of bricks—one of the track's earliest surfaces—at the finish line and ceremoniously kiss them. A newer Indy 500 tradition, it began at the Brickyard 400, Indianapolis Motor Speedway's NASCAR race. In 1996, Dale Jarrett won the third edition of the Brickyard 400, and he and his crew commemorated the victory by kissing the bricks. Subsequent winners continued to do so, but it took a few years for the tradition to jump to the Indy 500 race.

The original cup ran out of room after 70 winners, so today's trophy includes a large base to accommodate winners through 2033. The extra base makes today's trophy one of the largest in sports, clocking in at over 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighing about 110 pounds. In 2022, Refinitiv Metals Research estimated its melt-down value at $40,537. Drivers may race to win the Borg-Warner Trophy, but they never get to take it home. Instead, Borg-Warner gives winning drivers a miniature replica of the cup—called a \"Baby Borg\"—that includes an identical sterling silver sculpture of their face. Story editing by Carren Jao.

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. Roger Penske and Josef Newgarden pose with the Borg-Warner Trophy during the traditional winners photo session at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Monday in Indianapolis. Newgarden won the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function. Penske then suspended four crew members, including team president Tim Cindric, the best strategist in IndyCar who calls Newgarden's races. “It’s been a very illuminating experience to me, more from the outside world. I know what I take from that personally. I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen. I’ve never had it better than this month.” Pato O'Ward reacts after finishing second in the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sunday in Indianapolis. As Newgarden repeated last year's victory celebration by climbing through a hole in a fence to join fans in the grandstands, a devastated O'Ward sobbed inside his race car. He was trying to become the first Mexican winner in 108 runnings of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” and instead wound up with his second runner-up finish in three years. In 2022, he was accused of not being aggressive enough to beat Marcus Ericsson, and last year he was too aggressive and wrecked while racing Ericsson for the win. O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old. It was an odd scene for O'Ward, who admittedly wears his emotions on his sleeve but typically is the most upbeat driver in the paddock. Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far. I know it will be so special the day my name is written among the stars and I get to experience the magic everyone talks about.\" His face was tear-stained and his eyes swollen in the postrace news conference, but O'Ward was stoic. He said he didn't need to watch a replay of the final lap to see what he could have done differently to hold off Newgarden. “I think in a way I’ve cracked a code and I know how to position myself to win this race. I know I can win this race, and I know that I know how to also protect a good result when maybe the win isn’t in the cards for me,” he said. He was praised by six-time series champion Scott Dixon, a one-time Indy 500 winner, as well as Newgarden. When IndyCar stripped Newgarden of his St. Pete victory, it went to O'Ward, the initial runner-up, in his only win through five races so far this season. “He drove me excellently. I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. \"Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” It's called the \"greatest spectacle in racing,\" but fantastic auto racing isn't what makes the Indianapolis 500 one of the most iconic auto races of the year—the race traditions do. Stacker compiled five of the race's quirky traditions, sourcing information from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and other news outlets. Although the race takes place on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, festivities around it encompass May. Festivals, a minimarathon, and an annual parade attract hundreds of thousands of people to downtown Indianapolis. College-aged women vie to become one of 33 (equaling the number of drivers in the field) 500 Festival Princesses, who serve as ambassadors for the many race-related events. In Speedway, Indiana, the town surrounding the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, decorated homes welcome race fans to the world's largest stadium, which seats 235,000 people, though it was known to host up to 400,000 people in 1990. Drivers also have traditional events as they try to become one of the 33 to make the final starting field. In mid-May, they have three days of practice on the track before \"Fast Friday,\" when cars get turbocharge boosts to achieve top speed. Then it's on to two days of qualification, where drivers race solo for four laps of the track, pushing their car to its limits. If more than 33 drivers are vying to make the field, the second day is also known as Bump Day, for those who get bumped from the final starting lineup. Carb Day—shortened from Carburetion Day, since the cars no longer have carburetors—is the last day of practice for drivers and crews. A fan-focused event, it includes a pit stop challenge and rock concert. Despite the month's high-octane festivities, they are no match for what happens on race day, where more traditions help set this race apart from all others. The storied tradition of drinking milk began as most favorite traditions do: by accident. When Louis Meyer, the first driver to win three Indy 500s, was caught on camera sipping buttermilk straight from the bottle while he sat in Victory Lane after his third win in 1936, dairy industry executives saw that as a prime marketing opportunity. Milk vied with water as the victor's drink of choice for many years, but in 1956, the dairy industry offered prize money to the driver and chief mechanic for swigging milk after the win. Since then—except in 1993, when Emerson Fittipaldi drank orange juice first in honor of his 500,000-acre orange plantation—the sip of milk has become a time-honored tradition. Today, all drivers choose their preferred milk—fat-free, 2%, or whole milk—before the race so the dairy association can have it ready to go for the winner. The \"greatest spectacle in racing\" made a four-year pit stop between 1942 and 1945 due to World War II. When the race returned in 1946, organizers asked New York Metropolitan Opera singer James Melton to sing this ballad to welcome back drivers and fans. People loved it so much that the song became part of the prerace festivities, and Melton returned to sing it many times. Throughout the years, other famous celebrities, including Mel Tormé, Vic Damone, and Dinah Shore—the only woman to ever perform it—all participated in this tradition, but no one did it more often than Jim Nabors, an actor known for playing Gomer Pyle on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" Nabors fell into the gig in 1972, when Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman found him sitting in the grandstands and asked him to sing. Although Nabors had no idea what he was going to perform, he was a big hit with the fans and ended up coming back another 36 times before retiring in 2014. Since then, race organizers have asked singers who have ties to the state to perform the song, and in 2017, they hit the jackpot with Indiana University alum Jim Cornelison, who has sung it annually ever since. The cue to start up the Indy cars is one of the most anticipated moments of the prerace festivities, but it hasn't always been part of Indy 500 traditions. In the early days of the race, aerial bomb explosions gave the signal, but after the race returned after a World War II hiatus, public address announcer John \"Irish\" Horan thought the moment needed a little more oomph. The first record of him saying something close to, \"Gentlemen, start your engines,\" came in 1951; by 1953, the tradition took hold. The phrase changed in 1977, when Janet Guthrie became the first woman to ever qualify for the Indy 500, causing track owner Tony Hulman to announce, \"In company with the first lady ever to qualify at Indianapolis, gentlemen, start your engines!\" As more women made the starting field, the phrase became, \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines,\" which has evolved to today's, \"Drivers, start your engines!\" Postvictory, winners and their teams kneel in front of the 1-yard span of bricks—one of the track's earliest surfaces—at the finish line and ceremoniously kiss them. A newer Indy 500 tradition, it began at the Brickyard 400, Indianapolis Motor Speedway's NASCAR race. In 1996, Dale Jarrett won the third edition of the Brickyard 400, and he and his crew commemorated the victory by kissing the bricks. Subsequent winners continued to do so, but it took a few years for the tradition to jump to the Indy 500 race. It's unclear who was the first Indy 500 winner to kiss the bricks—the Indianapolis Motor Speedway believes 2005 winner Dan Wheldon may have been the first. Still, the Indianapolis Star cites 2003 winner Gil de Ferran as the original Indy 500 brick kisser. All winners are immortalized on the Borg-Warner Trophy, named for the automotive equipment manufacturer that commissioned it. Debuted at the 1936 race, the art deco-style sterling silver cup is ringed with sterling sculptures of the winning drivers' faces. The original cup ran out of room after 70 winners, so today's trophy includes a large base to accommodate winners through 2033.

        "content": "INDIANAPOLIS — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. He had too much else to worry about, Newgarden insisted, and helping his boss understand how Newgarden illegally used extra boosts of horsepower to win the March opening race was a bigger priority. Penske, for his part, said he stood behind the 33-year-old from Tennessee and was working on a contract extension for Newgarden beyond this eighth season with the organization. One way to ensure a new deal is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O'Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001-02. As he contemplated his accomplishment — he now has 30 career wins and is a two-time IndyCar season champion — Newgarden went so far as to say “I’m grateful for the experience” regarding the Penske cheating scandal. Some six weeks after Newgarden's victory in St. Petersburg, Florida, IndyCar discovered the three Penske cars had an illegal version of the push-to-pass software installed that allowed their drivers to use the horsepower boost when no others in the field had access to the advantage. Roger Penske and Josef Newgarden pose with the Borg-Warner Trophy during the traditional winners photo session at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Monday in Indianapolis. Newgarden won the 108th running of the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. IndyCar stripped Newgarden and Scott McLaughlin of their first- and third-place finishes and fined all three Penske drivers, even though Will Power never illegally used the function. Penske then suspended four crew members, including team president Tim Cindric, the best strategist in IndyCar who calls Newgarden's races. “It’s been a very illuminating experience to me, more from the outside world. I know what I take from that personally. I know what it showed me, which I’m thankful for,” Newgarden said. \"I think it’s an experience that it’s got to either break you or toughen you up. “We’ve been moving forward. We’ve never worked together more as a group than this weekend, and I thought that was difficult to do. This is the most tight-knit team I’ve ever seen. I’ve never had it better than this month.” Pato O'Ward reacts after finishing second in the Indianapolis 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Sunday in Indianapolis. As Newgarden repeated last year's victory celebration by climbing through a hole in a fence to join fans in the grandstands, a devastated O'Ward sobbed inside his race car. He was trying to become the first Mexican winner in 108 runnings of “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing” and instead wound up with his second runner-up finish in three years. In 2022, he was accused of not being aggressive enough to beat Marcus Ericsson, and last year he was too aggressive and wrecked while racing Ericsson for the win. O'Ward finished sixth in his Indy 500 debut and fourth the next year. So five tries and five near-misses left him inconsolable as his Arrow McLaren Racing team tried to comfort the 25-year-old. It was an odd scene for O'Ward, who admittedly wears his emotions on his sleeve but typically is the most upbeat driver in the paddock. Come Monday, he announced on social media that he was feeling much better. “I woke up with a big smile on my face today, feeling very loved by all of you,” he wrote on a carousel of photos showing his postrace dejection. “Wouldn't change a thing about my journey so far. I know it will be so special the day my name is written among the stars and I get to experience the magic everyone talks about.\" His face was tear-stained and his eyes swollen in the postrace news conference, but O'Ward was stoic. He said he didn't need to watch a replay of the final lap to see what he could have done differently to hold off Newgarden. “I think in a way I’ve cracked a code and I know how to position myself to win this race. I know I can win this race, and I know that I know how to also protect a good result when maybe the win isn’t in the cards for me,” he said. He was praised by six-time series champion Scott Dixon, a one-time Indy 500 winner, as well as Newgarden. When IndyCar stripped Newgarden of his St. Pete victory, it went to O'Ward, the initial runner-up, in his only win through five races so far this season. “He drove me excellently. I’m very thankful for him and the way that he drove. He’s a champion. He’s one of the best competitors we have in this field. He’s a really nice guy,” Newgarden said. \"Every time I talk to Pato we have great conversations, and I think we have a lot of respect for each other. “I’m appreciative for the way that he drives. He drove like a champion in this race and he’s just as deserving of a winner in my opinion. He definitely could have won this race. It’s tough to not win it. I can’t say anything to ease that for him. When you don’t win, it hurts. I’ve left here 11 times prior with a broken heart, so I know the feeling. Whether you’re close or you’re far, it’s a broken heart. I can’t ease that.” It's called the \"greatest spectacle in racing,\" but fantastic auto racing isn't what makes the Indianapolis 500 one of the most iconic auto races of the year—the race traditions do. Stacker compiled five of the race's quirky traditions, sourcing information from the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and other news outlets. Although the race takes place on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, festivities around it encompass May. Festivals, a minimarathon, and an annual parade attract hundreds of thousands of people to downtown Indianapolis. College-aged women vie to become one of 33 (equaling the number of drivers in the field) 500 Festival Princesses, who serve as ambassadors for the many race-related events. In Speedway, Indiana, the town surrounding the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, decorated homes welcome race fans to the world's largest stadium, which seats 235,000 people, though it was known to host up to 400,000 people in 1990. Drivers also have traditional events as they try to become one of the 33 to make the final starting field. In mid-May, they have three days of practice on the track before \"Fast Friday,\" when cars get turbocharge boosts to achieve top speed. Then it's on to two days of qualification, where drivers race solo for four laps of the track, pushing their car to its limits. If more than 33 drivers are vying to make the field, the second day is also known as Bump Day, for those who get bumped from the final starting lineup. Carb Day—shortened from Carburetion Day, since the cars no longer have carburetors—is the last day of practice for drivers and crews. A fan-focused event, it includes a pit stop challenge and rock concert. Despite the month's high-octane festivities, they are no match for what happens on race day, where more traditions help set this race apart from all others. The \"greatest spectacle in racing\" made a four-year pit stop between 1942 and 1945 due to World War II. When the race returned in 1946, organizers asked New York Metropolitan Opera singer James Melton to sing this ballad to welcome back drivers and fans. People loved it so much that the song became part of the prerace festivities, and Melton returned to sing it many times. Throughout the years, other famous celebrities, including Mel Tormé, Vic Damone, and Dinah Shore—the only woman to ever perform it—all participated in this tradition, but no one did it more often than Jim Nabors, an actor known for playing Gomer Pyle on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\" Nabors fell into the gig in 1972, when Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman found him sitting in the grandstands and asked him to sing. Although Nabors had no idea what he was going to perform, he was a big hit with the fans and ended up coming back another 36 times before retiring in 2014. Since then, race organizers have asked singers who have ties to the state to perform the song, and in 2017, they hit the jackpot with Indiana University alum Jim Cornelison, who has sung it annually ever since. The cue to start up the Indy cars is one of the most anticipated moments of the prerace festivities, but it hasn't always been part of Indy 500 traditions. In the early days of the race, aerial bomb explosions gave the signal, but after the race returned after a World War II hiatus, public address announcer John \"Irish\" Horan thought the moment needed a little more oomph. The first record of him saying something close to, \"Gentlemen, start your engines,\" came in 1951; by 1953, the tradition took hold. The phrase changed in 1977, when Janet Guthrie became the first woman to ever qualify for the Indy 500, causing track owner Tony Hulman to announce, \"In company with the first lady ever to qualify at Indianapolis, gentlemen, start your engines!\" As more women made the starting field, the phrase became, \"Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines,\" which has evolved to today's, \"Drivers, start your engines!\" Postvictory, winners and their teams kneel in front of the 1-yard span of bricks—one of the track's earliest surfaces—at the finish line and ceremoniously kiss them. A newer Indy 500 tradition, it began at the Brickyard 400, Indianapolis Motor Speedway's NASCAR race. In 1996, Dale Jarrett won the third edition of the Brickyard 400, and he and his crew commemorated the victory by kissing the bricks. Subsequent winners continued to do so, but it took a few years for the tradition to jump to the Indy 500 race. It's unclear who was the first Indy 500 winner to kiss the bricks—the Indianapolis Motor Speedway believes 2005 winner Dan Wheldon may have been the first. Still, the Indianapolis Star cites 2003 winner Gil de Ferran as the original Indy 500 brick kisser. The storied tradition of drinking milk began as most favorite traditions do: by accident. When Louis Meyer, the first driver to win three Indy 500s, was caught on camera sipping buttermilk straight from the bottle while he sat in Victory Lane after his third win in 1936, dairy industry executives saw that as a prime marketing opportunity. Milk vied with water as the victor's drink of choice for many years, but in 1956, the dairy industry offered prize money to the driver and chief mechanic for swigging milk after the win. Since then—except in 1993, when Emerson Fittipaldi drank orange juice first in honor of his 500,000-acre orange plantation—the sip of milk has become a time-honored tradition. Today, all drivers choose their preferred milk—fat-free, 2%, or whole milk—before the race so the dairy association can have it ready to go for the winner. All winners are immortalized on the Borg-Warner Trophy, named for the automotive equipment manufacturer that commissioned it. Debuted at the 1936 race, the art deco-style sterling silver cup is ringed with sterling sculptures of the winning drivers' faces. The original cup ran out of room after 70 winners, so today's trophy includes a large base to accommodate winners through 2033. The extra base makes today's trophy one of the largest in sports, clocking in at over 5 feet, 4 inches tall and weighing about 110 pounds. In 2022, Refinitiv Metals Research estimated its melt-down value at $40,537. Drivers may race to win the Borg-Warner Trophy, but they never get to take it home. Instead, Borg-Warner gives winning drivers a miniature replica of the cup—called a \"Baby Borg\"—that includes an identical sterling silver sculpture of their face. Story editing by Carren Jao.

        "content": "When Festival of Hope volunteer Amber Trenkle reflects on the annual event and organization, she thinks about a quote that she has come to know, “Hope is like the sun, which as we journey toward it, casts a shadow of burden behind it.” The quote resonates with her, she said, because of the mission of Festival of Hope, lessening the burden for people who are undergoing cancer treatment. Festival of Hope will return for its 22nd year on Saturday, June 15 at the Scotts Bluff County Event Center in Mitchell. Retired Regional West oncologist Vince Bjorling and his wife, Vicki, were among those who spearheaded the community foundation of the same name. The Festival of Hope is the non-profit organization’s main fundraiser, though other fundraisers, big and small, help the organization meet its goal of helping cancer patients with non-medical expenses. Through the end of 2023, Festival of Hope has distributed over $4 million to 2,800 patients and their families. The organization has also donated $230,000 to research and education activities. Trenkle is among those who have been involved in the Festival of Hope for several years. She became involved after being encouraged by Carol Diffendafer, a former social worker at Regional West Medical Center’s Cancer Treatment Center, who she came to know as the mother-in-law of her brother. Trenkle was involved in another organization that raised money for cancer patients when Diffendafer encouraged her to volunteer in an upcoming Festival of Hope celebration. “I went to my first Festival of Hope ... and I fell in love with it,” she said, saying she volunteered first in the kitchen and is now involved as a board member and a co-organizer. It’s now been 18 years that she has been involved in the organization. Everything from utility bills to travel costs, can be covered by the organization with the goal of easing the worries of patients undergoing treatment for their cancer. A former employee of a Wyoming electric company, Trenkle said she would often see the checks come through to help pay the electric costs of patients. “The last thing that they (cancer patients) need is to be focused on the financial burden,” she said. “They need to be focused on getting better ... Anything you can do to take off their shoulders and help them focus on themselves is what they need.” The symbolism of the event has inspired many, from volunteers to patients. “I think it’s beautiful,” Trenkle said of the event. “...It’s a celebration of life, of health and of remembrance. So many people are there just celebrating their loved ones that they have lost or friends they have lost, or ones who are fighting cancer, and those who have won their battle and are still with us.” Like many, she said, she finds a ceremony at the event in which the names of loved ones who are featured on the Wall of Hope and the release of butterflies to be one of the most touching parts of the event. The butterfly release is inspired by an American legend that touts that if anyone desires a wish to come true, they must first capture a butterfly and whisper their wish before releasing it. The butterfly takes the wish to the Great Spirit, who always grants the wish in gratitude for the butterfly’s freedom. At times the event can be emotional, such as seeing the names of people who have lost their cancer battles on the wall or visiting with cancer survivors, who sport their own colored shirts. Oftentimes, people who are in the midst of their own cancer battles are also at the event, hoping to find encouragement and hope, Trenkle said. Once a full day of activities, Festival of Hope is now a morning event, held from about 6:30 a.m. to about 11:30 a.m. A 5K Walk/Run and Children’s Fun Run begin the day with registration beginning at 6:30 a.m. The Knights of Columbus will once again host its pancake feed. A silent auction and vendor booths will also contribute to the event. Trenkle noted that there are lots of activities for children to enjoy, with a penny carnival planned, and people can also enjoy entertainment provided by local artists featured on stage. The reading of names and butterfly release are planned for about 11 a.m., after the conclusion of a life auction. Fundraisers, from student councils raising monies to the annual Save-A-Rack fundraiser at Backaracks, help Festival of Hope with its mission. The community support is strong for the organization, and its volunteers continue to be thankful for the support. “As more and more people are fighting cancer, with advancements made in medicine, they’re living longer,” Trenkle said. “Our need right now is greater than ever. The more money that we raise, the more people we can help and for a longer duration.” For information about Festival of Hope, including how to purchase a spot for your loved ne on the Wall of Hope, visit festivalofhope.net . Spots can also be purchased the morning of the event. Applications for assistance from Festival of Hope are also available on the website.

        "content": "Senate President Francis Escudero speaks during the Kapihan sa Senado forum on Thursday, May 23, 2024. —Noy Morcoso/INQUIRER.net MANILA, Philippines — Exactly a week after ousting Sen. Juan Miguel Zubiri from his post, Senate President Francis Escudero expressed optimism on Monday that they would be able to put the matter behind them in time for the return of the 19th Congress in July. “We’re not enemies,” Escudero said of Zubiri and his allies in the so-called “Solid 7.” “I don’t see any reason why our relationship will not improve despite the differences in our views,” he told reporters after visiting several Senate offices. READ: Zubiri out as Escudero takes Senate leadership Besides, according to Escudero, installing a new leadership in the legislative body is just “part of the process.” “I believe that we will be able to overcome this as an institution,” he said. “There’s a time for sadness, a time for happiness and a time to face challenges. There’s also a time when everything is OK. Maybe this is a time for [sadness],” he added. Escudero, who is serving a fresh six-year term in the Senate after his stint as Sorsogon governor from 2019 to 2022, stressed that he was looking forward to working with Zubiri’s group in pushing for the President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s legislative agenda. READ: Escudero: Senate not to waste time on bills that will not become a law “I’m not avoiding them. If I miss them or they miss me, it’s easy to send a text message,” he said. At the same time, Escudero set the record straight, saying that each of the 14 senators who backed him had their own reasons for replacing Zubiri. He further said that it was “unfair” to blame the change in the Senate leadership on Sen. Ronald dela Rosa’s insistence to investigate President Marcos’ supposed link to illegal drugs. Escudero also clarified that there was no truth to Dela Rosa’s claim that Zubiri lost the Senate presidency because he refused Sen. Ramon Revilla Jr.’s request to attend their plenary sessions online while recuperating from a foot injury. “Just look at those who supported the change in leadership. There’s no common denominator [among them],” the new Senate leader said as he noted: “That means it’s not the one and only reason why it happened.” Zubiri, who headed the 24-member chamber for 22 months, had surmised that his defense of the Senate’s independence “ruffled some feathers” and “upset the powers that be,” eventually costing him his job.

        "content": "BARGAIN HUNTING The Greenhills Shopping Center in San Juan City is a popular destination for bargain hunters. The mall’s management says it has discussed with the government a transition plan to end its reputation as a hub for counterfeit and pirated items. —Niño Jesus Orbeta MANILA, Philippines — The Greenhills Shopping Center may yet get rid of its tag as a hotbed of counterfeit and pirated items. This as the management of the popular shopping center met early this month with the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) and discussed plans to stop the sale of counterfeit items inside its premises by 2027. The 16-hectare shopping complex in the city of San Juan in Metro Manila, one of the country’s oldest shopping centers, is the lone Philippine entry on the US piracy and counterfeit watch list, joining other markets such as China’s Chenghai District and the Heera Panna in Mumbai, India, that are notorious for selling counterfeit and pirated goods. READ: Work plan eyed to address Greenhills inclusion in US piracy watch list Among these fake products are electronics, perfumes, watches, shoes, accessories and fashion items that have long been patronized as they are cheaper than the original branded goods. The US Trade Representative (USTR) had said that the counterfeit market not only undermines brand owners but also poses health and safety risks to consumers, who may be unaware that they are purchasing a fake product that does not meet quality and safety standards. The USTR, in its report released early this year on counterfeiting and piracy, said that while there had been moves to enforce protection of intellectual property, “the targets of enforcement often evade such efforts by moving the location of their stalls.” READ: NBI seizes P63-M fake Louis Vuitton goods in Greenhills Shopping Center James Candelaria, the shopping mall’s vice president and trade fairs and exhibits head, told the IPOPHL of plans to wean all of its merchants away from selling products that infringe on intellectual property and protected by law over the next three years. “What we have done so far is really to educate our traders along the way, to tell them that it’s time to change and that there are other products to profit from,” Candelaria said during the meeting, as quoted by the IPOPHL on Monday. The IPOPHL said that some of the mall management’s notable and recent education initiatives include a learning event with the Department of Trade and Industry, which was attended by over 400 merchants. The event showcased local products that traders could consider selling instead of the counterfeit items, said the IPOPHL. This is in line with the memorandum of understanding earlier signed by the IPOPHL and the Philippine Retailers Association, of which Greenhills is a member, that called for a “zero-tolerance approach” to counterfeit products. Aside from the education campaign, the mall management said that it also reduced the number of stalls to 1,412 from 1,771. As of October 2023, Candelaria said that 80 percent of traders have gone through the transition program and are now selling local products, including halal items, jewelry, antiques, furniture pieces and artworks. The IPOPHL also said that the shopping center managed by Ortigas Land had already suspended some 299 stores selling counterfeit items. IPOPHL Director General Rowel Barba said the government would help stall owners transition to selling legitimate goods. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

According to the IPOPHL’s records, at least P23.03 billion worth of pirated goods nationwide were seized by authorities from January to September 2023, more than a twofold increase in the value of seized goods from the same nine-month period the previous year.",

But her ring rust after three years out of competition saw her struggle early as she was dropped in the first by a massive right hand. VanZant managed to come back into proceedings and win the later rounds as she used her extensive fighting background to take control of the ring. Now, the pair are expected to fight again in August on the undercard of a big pay-per-view event Paige VanZant draws boxing debut after being dropped by Elle Brooke After an awkward build-up in which VanZant refused to bite on her rival’s trash talk, the pair finally stepped into the ring on Saturday night. And while the American had a clear foothold on movement, it was Brooke who was the more aggressive in the early stages. Certainly when it came to power it appeared that the Brit was landing the bigger shots, as the pair collided a couple of times before a right hook saw Brooke put down . She immediately got back up and continued, but struggled to find her footing through the end of the first and start of the second. But eventually the American showed her experience a bit more and managed to take hold of proceedings, winning the final three. Both women seemed shocked by the result as it was read a draw, although the body language of Brooke showed more of a confidence before the decision was made. Paige VanZant slams judges and demands rematch after boxing debut ends in a draw After a relatively bland interview in the ring after the fight in which she claimed there was definitely a rematch happening, VanZant opened up a bit more in an Instagram video on Saturday night. The American shared a post to her 3.2million followers with the caption: “Went home with a DRAW. Feels like a loss. It is what it is. let’s make it happen again ASAP!!!! Draws are BULLS***!” In the video, VanZant said: “Obviously we didn’t get the results we predicted. I really thought that we did enough at the end. My whole team thought we did enough, I think a lot of people did.” And it was after that when she finally got a bit more aggressive for the first time, adding: “The judging? A little bit nuts, but it looks like it sets up a perfect rematch. I just have to go on her turf and take her belt there. So I’ll see all of you guys in London.” Bloody Elbow sources have indicated that the bout is being targeted for The O2 Arena on the undercard of a pay-per-view fight towards the end of August.",

Pro-Palestinian protest camps have appeared at several universities across Australia in recent months, with hundreds of students calling on administrators to cut ties with companies associated with weapons manufacturing and Israel. Jewish groups and politicians have raised fears for the safety of Jewish students amid claims of antisemitic behaviour and the use of divisive chanting on campuses. Opposition home affairs spokesman James Paterson said if elected next year the Coalition would use section 116 of the Migration Act to cancel the visas of student protestors “found to be involved in spreading anti-Semitism or supporting terrorism” Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. “Since October 7 we have seen multiple instances of anti-Semitic rhetoric and sympathy expressed for listed terrorist organisations including Hamas on campus,” he said., “And yet there is no evidence the Minister for Home Affairs Clare O’Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles have cancelled a single student visa under the significant powers available under the Migration Act. Rising divisions over the war in Gaza come amid international outcry after an Israeli airstrike on a makeshift tent camp killed at least 45 people on Sunday night. Speaking at a Jewish high school in east Melbourne on Monday, deputy prime minister Richard Marles said the amount of extreme hate speech he had observed was higher “than any that I’ve seen during my lifetime.” The Greens will this week will call for a lower house vote on recognising Palestinian statehood, with leader Adam Bandt challenging Labor on Monday to support the measure.",

Naija News can confirm that the 2024-2025 Premier League season will kick off on the weekend of August 17 and 18, 2024. The forthcoming season will feature one Bank Holiday matchweek, 33 weekends of Premier League games, and four midweek rounds of league games. In the forthcoming season, the Premier League plans to arrange the games in such a way that no club plays within 60 hours of another match. This is expected to prevent the “congested schedule across Christmas and New Year”. Unlike last season, there won’t be games on the eve of Christmas (December 24) during the 2024-2025 Premier League season.

By Baba Martins The National Chairman of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Dr Ralphs Okey Nwosu, has said it will take six years for Nigerians to get over the impact of subsidy removal. Speaking at the leadership retreat Organised by the ADC in Abuja on Monday, Nwosu said one of the reasons the first year anniversary of the present administration has been so dramatic and full of flip – flops is because the president failed to listen to the people and “started the wrong way”. The ADC Chairman who stated that leadership is not about the elite, but about what the people want, said “the President is not doing too well. And you know why? you can’t see hungry people. And the first policy you would bring even before you step into the office was to tell them your fuel price has gone up by 400 percent. “It will take them more than six years or more than four years to address the problem that the singular decision they took brings. You are leading people, before you step into your vision, you tell them, you know, your prices to pay for your rent, to pay for your houses and so on has gone up by 400 percent. You more or less kill the morale of the people that will help you to reflect the economy.” Meanwhile, in a communique issued after the retreat, the party encouraged political parties not to wait until election year before planning on how to win elections. “That’s why the party is organizing leadership retreats to develop the capacities of her party leaders. The party believes in continuous learning.” “ADC wants change in the electoral process to start with the voters. We will intensify our voter education programmes. The voters are critical to democracy and nation building. ADC asserted that it’s liaison with the electorates must continue in good spirit. The retreat also resolves, that “ADC honed its transformation leadership ideology. And says that the entire Nigerian system is rotten and needs overhaul. Political parties must take systematic actions towards transforming the rottenness in the polity. “Members agreed to emulate Senegal youths and to use its young members to shore up mobilisation and bring about change in all election including LGA, state and national.” LEARN AFFILIATE MARKETING: Learn How to Make Money with Expertnaire Affiliate Marketing Using the Simple 3-Step Method Explained to earn $500-$1000 Per Month.

        "content": "Just 10km as the crow flies: within that area are three remarkable institutions celebrating contemporary art, enlivening history and heritage, and supporting creativity and local community participation. You may be surprised to know that this is all in east Auckland – not the CBD – and all a 25-minute ride on the 72. Te Tuhi, situated in Pakuranga, Howick Historical Village nestled in Lloyd Elsmore Park, and Uxbridge Arts and Culture centrally located in Howick all provide access to world-class arts, culture, and heritage. Outside the CBD, these three key cultural stakeholders situate east Auckland as one of the most unique areas in the motu. Now, we are thrilled to present an arts/cultural/heritage column in the new Times Online! We will share stories, thoughts, and feedback on arts and culture. In the middle of each month will be a What’s On section for the next month, highlighting all things creative in the east Auckland area. Should you wish to share an activity or event, please email it to: EastAucklandArtKete@gmail.com by 11.59pm on the first day of each month. Your blurb must be 60 words or less, and must include your organisation’s name, address, and hours of operation. Something like: XYZ Gallery presents Thinking Through Paint, an exhibition of extraordinary new work by contemporary artist John Smith. The show runs November 2 – December 13. Opening reception is Friday, November 2, 5-7 pm, with an Artist Talk at 6 pm. Hours: Monday-Thursday, 9 am-1 pm. Location: XYZ Gallery, Ti Rakau Drive, Pakuranga. Please also include a high-res image, although it may not be chosen for publication. Based on the arts-positive feedback Howick Local Board received last year during the “AK Have your Say” campaign, we are so grateful to know how much our community values our work. We thank you for your support.",

        "content": "It’s bear season and Central Okanagan residents are being reminded to get their attractants, including household garbage, under wraps to reduce conflicts with wildlife. “Bears are known for their keen sense of smell and can easily become food-conditioned,” Cynthia Coates, RDCO Solid Waste Services Supervisor, said in a press release. “We ask that residents take steps to not attract bears or any wildlife to their garbage. If bears do get into garbage carts, they can pose an unnecessary danger to residents.” For the third year in a row, the Regional District is partnering with WildSafeBC to help provide bear awareness across the entire Central Okanagan with a dedicated WildSafe Coordinator. The program helps reduce wildlife conflicts by providing education across the region, monitoring carts set out the night before pickup and monitoring bear and wildlife activity in general. 4:31 Bear activity sparks safety reminder from wildlife experts WildSafeBC tips for residents to keep wildlife wild and communities safe include: Story continues below advertisement • Only place garbage out for collection on the morning of pickup, never the night before. • Encourage neighbours to do the same and offer to help if they are unable to put garbage out at appropriate times. • Secure garbage on non-collection days; store it securely in a garage or garden shed or chain it to a secure structure. • Do not store garbage or other organic waste in vehicles. • Consider freezing kitchen scraps until the morning of collection day. • Make sure recyclables have been cleaned. • Keep barbeques clean and covered, and empty grease traps. • Pick ripe or fallen fruit immediately; if composting, or putting in yard waste cart, ensure the units are secured from wildlife access. • Make sure composters are well managed. • Use bird baths and houses to attract birds rather than bird feeders. • Avoid feeding birds when bears are most active (April to November) and ensure birdfeeders are always inaccessible to non-target species, such as bears, deer, squirrels and raccoons. Do not let seeds accumulate, which may attract rats and other rodents. • Do not leave pet food outdoors; feed pets indoors and keep pets inside at night.

        "content": "As the week comes to a close, PRIMANEWS Online presents a recap of the top news stories that dominated the headlines. The House of Representatives came under fire after a bill to revert to the old national anthem passed the second reading, even as the Minister of Women Affairs, Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye, controversially backs the mass wedding of orphans in Niger State less than a week after she criticised the move. Meanwhile, Kano is agog as Sanusi Lamido Sanusi has been reinstated as the 16th Emir of Kano. These and more are presented in this week’s news roundoff. The House of Representatives passed a bill to revert to Nigeria’s pre-1978 national anthem, “Nigeria, we hail thee,” stirring significant debate and criticism online. Many Nigerians on social media questioned the relevance of this change, highlighting the country’s pressing economic challenges. Critics argue that focusing on the national anthem is a misplaced priority during times of hardship. Proponents like House Leader Julius Ihonvbere claim the old anthem encapsulates values that could inspire national unity and progress. Opponents, including Minority Leader Kingsley Chinda, contend that the old anthem’s colonial ties undermine its appropriateness. The old national anthem was written by Lilian James Williams and composed by Frances Berder, both of whom are Britons. Minister supports mass wedding Initially opposing a mass wedding of 100 orphaned girls in Niger State, saying it was a violation of the Child Rights Act, Minister of Women Affairs, Uju Kennedy-Ohanenye, announced scholarships and distributed gifts to orphans ahead of the ceremony. The widely criticised mass wedding was sponsored by the Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Abdulmalik Sarkindaji. Kennedy-Ohanenye had petitioned the Inspector General of Police and sought a legal injunction to halt the event. The Speaker, supported by the Niger State Council of Imams and the Muslim Rights Concern, criticised the minister for not understanding the cultural and religious context. However, despite her initial opposition, the minister provided scholarships, Point-of-Sale machines, wrappers and rice, with additional support from the Emir of Kontagora, who donated sewing machines. Both the minister and the Speaker emphasised their commitment to the well-being and consent of the girls, who are confirmed to be of marriageable age. This week, Kano State Governor Abba Yusuf reinstated Lamido Sanusi as the Emir of Kano, four years after his deposition by former Governor Umar Ganduje. Yusuf also deposed five emirs appointed by Ganduje, giving them 48 hours to vacate their residences. This came after the Kano House of Assembly repealed the law that created these emirates, consolidating the Kano Emirate under a single ruler. Sanusi, previously the Central Bank Governor, was dethroned after clashing with Ganduje over allegations of corruption. His removal sparked controversy and legal battles, culminating in a 2023 Federal High Court ruling declaring his deposition unconstitutional. Sanusi’s reinstatement has received mixed reactions, with supporters celebrating his return and critics, including Ganduje’s allies, accusing Yusuf of political motives. Organised Labour in Nigeria is demanding a minimum wage of at least N100,000 as negotiations with the Federal Government and the Organised Private Sector intensify. Labour groups, including the Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress, rejected the government’s recent offer of N54,000, deeming it insufficient. The unions have reduced their initial demand from N615,000 to N497,000 but insist that any proposal below N100,000 will not be acceptable. Meanwhile, some states like Kogi and Sokoto claim they are already paying the current minimum wage of N30,000, while others like Anambra struggle due to financial constraints. Tinubu reviews ministers’ performance To mark his first year in office, President Bola Tinubu has directed his 47 ministers to present their performance reports to the public. President Tinubu has made it clear that his ministers’ job security hinges on their performance, which will be regularly assessed every quarter. The Central Delivery Coordination Unit, headed by Hadiza Bala-Usman, is responsible for overseeing this evaluation process, which began this week and incorporates citizen feedback through the Citizens Delivery Tracker app. Meanwhile, in a recent assessment conducted via the Federal Government’s Citizens’ Delivery Tracker App, several Nigerian ministers, including the ministers for Power, Defence, Education, and Agriculture, were rated poorly by the public. The app, introduced to gather feedback on the performance of government officials, revealed that these ministers received low marks from respondents, reflecting dissatisfaction with their performance. Conversely, ministers overseeing Finance, the Federal Capital Territory, and Works received average ratings.",

        "content": "Portuguese star, Cristiano Ronaldo has continued to prove that age is just a number as he has set another record which might take a special player like him to break. Earlier today, Cristiano Ronaldo broke the record for goals scored in one single season in the Saudi Pro League. In the 2023-2024 Saudi Pro League season which ended tonight, the 39-year-old Al Nassr striker scored 35 goals in 31 matches. His last two goals for the campaign came against Al-Ittihad in Al Nassr’s 4-2 win. During the game, Ronaldo who is scheduled to lead Portugal to the Euro 2024 in Germany from June 14 to July 14, scored the match opener in injury time of the first half. In the 79th minute, the Portuguese legendary striker became the first player in the history of the Saudi Pro League to score 35 goals in a single league season. Apart from goals, Ronaldo proved that he is not just about scoring as he recorded 11 assists in 31 league games. Before the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo in the Saudi Pro League, Abderrazak Hamdallah was the first player to score 34 goals in a single season. He achieved the now-broken record during the 2018-2019 season. Meanwhile, despite Ronaldo’s prolific goalscoring form, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner failed to win the league title with Al Nassr this season. They finished the campaign in the second position, 14 points behind the league winners Al-Hilal.",

        "content": "VIRGIN Media star Brian Dowling has shared a heartfelt tribute to his co-star Katja Mia after they hit a major milestone on air. The Six O'Clock Show hosts revealed that they were celebrating six months on the hit series today. The popular duo have been a huge hit with viewers since taking over from Karen Koster and Greg O'Shea back in November 2023. And Brian took to Instagram today to wish his fellow co-presenter a happy anniversary. The 45-year-old posted a series of cute snaps of the pair having fun on set in the Virgin Media studios. Brian looked delighted as he beamed at the camera and leaned into Katja . The Big Brother star looked super handsome as he donned a navy blazer, light blue t-shirt and some skinny denim jeans. Katja also gave a toothy smile and tilted her head towards Brian. The stunning star wore a gorgeous cream cardigan with unique gold buttons and some black tailored trousers. In a separate picture, Brian looked over at Katja in fits of laughter as she giggled at the camera. The dad-of-one couldn't help but gush over his pal and co-host as he wrote in his caption: \"Happy Six-month anniversary, @katja_miaa. The time has flown since November & we joined the @sixoclockshow family. \"Some days, it feels like we have been doing this for years & others feel so new. Thanks for always making me HOWL.\" An emotional Katja then reposted the sweet tribute to her Instagram story and wrote: \"Six months of the @sixoclockshow. In one way it feels like we only started yesterday and in another it feels like I've been working with @bprdowling for YEARS. \"So lucky to have a fabulous team, show and co-host where we have so much fun.\" And the dynamic pair had a blast together over the weekend after Brian threw a housewarming party . The radio host and his celebrity judge hubby Arthur Gourounlian recently moved into a new home in Co Dublin . The famous pair announced in April that they would be moving house as they needed a bigger space to suit their growing family . And with the happy couple finally moving into their fantastic new pad in Dublin - Brian took to Instagram to share some fun pictures of their house warming party. The 45-year-old shared a clip of their incredible back garden which had been decorated for the event. The spacious area was filled with a long wooden table and some stylish garden chairs on either side. The table was then dressed with a beautiful floral tablecloth with lots of candles dotted around - making for a totally gorgeous atmosphere. There was also 5 plates lined up with cheese, biscuits, grapes, dips and treats. The Big Brother star captioned the photo: \"LET'S GO.\" Brian's Six O'Clock Show co-host Katja Mia also appeared at the house warming. The Virgin Media star posted a cute snap of Brian holding up a cocktail in the garden, as they both clinked their glasses together. Katja kindly wrote: \"Happy new home!\"",

For grocery prices are set to soar due to the stormy spring weather. Crops have been devastated and livestock unable to graze after downpours this month flooded swathes of farmland. Now food supply analysts Lynx Purchasing estimate that the knock-on effects will include a surge in the prices of summer essentials. The cost of wheat – which is used to make bread, pasta and pastry – could rise by eight per cent while barley – needed to brew ales and lagers – could soar by seven per cent.

The prices of lamb and beef are tipped to go up by six per cent and four per cent respectively. The estimates are based on what pubs, restaurants and other retailers are expected to face at a wholesale level, with experts saying the increase will be passed on to consumers. A spokesman for Lynx Purchasing said: 'The estimates are based on the lower crop yields expected due to extended wet weather and the higher costs of relying on imported produce for longer. 'High rainfall levels over winter took their toll on winter crops in all parts of the UK, with condition sharply lower, year on year. 'The wet weather has also affected livestock, with an impact on feed costs, as well as lower yield due to lack of pasture feeding.'

A Defra spokesman added: 'The new eligibility criteria opens up the scheme to thousands more farmers who have suffered significant damage to their land... and will help support UK food security.'

        "description": "How do you balance Demko's competitive drive while maintaining rest and recovery regimen? It should be easier with Arturs Silovs' rise",
        "content": "Goaltenders will sustain injuries. It’s not just a rite of passage in a position that places a tremendous strain on knees, hips and groins. It’s how the NHL game has evolved to a degree where puck tracking, post-to-post movements and rebound reactions must be accomplished in a split second. And there is also the physical toll of players crashing the crease or jamming the posts that invite ailments, even though goalies are leaner and stronger. Which brings us to Thatcher Demko and his multi-layered challenge for next season. The Vancouver Canucks starter is a Vezina Trophy finalist because his body of work in 51 regular-season games was superb. Demko posted a career-defining 2.45 goals-against average and five shutouts. He also established a personal best saves percentage of .918 that was only bettered by Vezina favourite Connor Hellebuyck. However, Demko, 28, suffered two injuries to start debate about how he should be managed next season with rookie Arturs Silovs, 23, serving as his back-up, while Casey DeSmith, 32, is a departing unrestricted free agent. And when Demko was sidelined in the playoff opener, it brought rest and recover and load management back into focus because the driven Demko isn’t good at being a spectator. Especially in the postseason and trying to have mind and body in sync to be a Game 7 consideration against the Edmonton Oilers. “It’s probably the hardest thing I’ve had to go through as a player — not being able to play,” Demko said in his year-end address. “We’ve been through some tough years here and it was tough watching. I was close to coming back and looking at being ready for the next series.” Demko logged a career-high 64 games in 2021-22, and logic would dictate that less of the net would be more prudent to guard against fatigue and injury. The Canucks also had a practice goalie in Roman Basran this season to encourage rest days, but keeping Demko from the cage is a hard sell. “That’s really not up to me,” said Demko. “I’ll sit down with (goalie coach Ian Clark) and the rest of the coaching staff and evaluate the best way of moving forward with that kind of thing.” Rest and recovery are imperative. The Canucks jammed seven road games into 13 days in January and five into seven in February. Demko responded by winning eight-straight games to start 2024. Then came the knee injury March 5 that sidelined him for 14 games, and the other ailment in the opener of the Nashville Predators series that ended his season. Both were suffered on impact. “Maybe I can tweak a couple of things, systems wise,” said Demko. “But I’m not going re-invent my game or anything. I put a lot of work in during the summer and the season, maintenance wise. “And that’s part of the frustration when something like that (injury) happens when you know you put in the work so it doesn’t happen. It’s a physical sport and anyone can get hurt, but obviously goalies have different injuries, and it’s something you have to deal with.” There was Game 1 video evidence of pinching Predators defenceman Jeremy Lauzon being checked from behind by Canucks grinder Phil Di Giuseppe and launching himself into Demko, which drove the stopper into the back of the net. However, it was being jammed on the post that did the season-ending damage. Former Canucks goalie Kirk McLean had cartilage procedures on both knees during his well-travelled, 873-game career with five NHL teams. He marvels at how goalies have grown and what they are asked to do in today’s game. And it even transcends to younger prospects. “With the height that goalies are now, they’re like basketball players, and they’re not meant to be doing what they’re doing,” said McLean. “A 6-foot-7 or 6-foot-8 goalie in the butterfly moving laterally, back and forth and in and out, and pushing off with the hips, it’s pretty tough. “And they’re doing this at young ages. I don’t know if they’re allowing their muscles to develop. I hear stories of 16-years-olds that are getting hip operations, whether they’ve been injured or preventive.” Meanwhile, regardless of Demko’s setbacks, the crease is in good shape. Silovs put up strong AHL numbers and was ready for “The Show”, and that will allow Nikita Tolopilo, 24, to carry the load in Abbotsford. Silovs posted his first NHL postseason shutout in Game 6 against the Predators and went 5-5 in the playoffs with a 2.91 GAA and .898 saves percentage. He was also 3-0-1 in the regular season with a 2.47 GAA and .881 percentage. “It was a great opportunity for me,” said Silovs, a restricted free agent. “It was phenomenal to get all the experience and there are always things to improve, but for a goalie it’s more of a mental game. “It’s being calm and composed. It makes your game a lot easier.” bkuzma@postmedia.com Bookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the news you need to know — add VancouverSun.com and TheProvince.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here .

        "description": "Home minister Amit Shah cautioned voters about the opposition's intention to lift the ban on outfits like PFI, engage with terrorists, and impose a 'Babri lock' on the Ayodhya shrine, in addition to restoring Article 370 and legalizing triple talaq.",
        "content": "LUCKNOW: Home minister Amit Shah on Monday billed this as one between \"the people who killed kar sevaks and those who constructed the Ram temple \", warning voters that if elected, the opposition would first restore Article 370 and then triple talaq, lift the ban on proscribed outfits like PFI, engage with terrorists, and put a \"Babri lock\" on the Ayodhya shrine. \"Should such people be allowed to form a government?\" Shah asked the gathering at a rally in UP's Kushinagar. The home minister said that unlike the erstwhile SP ministry in UP, which \"ordered firing\" on kar sevaks in Ayodhya in 1990, PM Narendra Modi leads a government at the Centre that shows due respect to the country's religious traditions while focusing on development. He declared BJP 's victory in the seven-phase elections a certainty, also predicting that Congress MP Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is an AICC general secretary, would never accept responsibility for their defeat and instead pin the blame on party president Mallikarjun Kharge . \"Kharge sahab, aapki naukri jaane wali hai (You are going to lose your job),\" Shah said, adding that soon after the results are declared on June 4, Rahul would convene a presser and also \"blame the EVMs\". In Salempur, Shah said BJP would cross the target of 400 seats, while Congress would be restricted to 40. SP might not get even four seats, he said. The home minister countered INDIA bloc's allegation that the Modi govt sought to end quotas for SCs/STs and OBCs by saying that safeguarding reservations for backward communities was \"Modi's guarantee\". On the contrary, it is the opposition that intends to \"steal OBC reservation and give it to Muslims\", he alleged. \"I do not intend to scare you. I only want to tell you the truth about the opposition's conspiracy to implement a Muslim quota, if voted to office. They have already done so in Karnataka and Telangana. The same was done in West Bengal, too, but Calcutta HC quashed allocation of OBC reservation to several Muslim classes.\"",

        "description": "Over $2.2 million in safety improvement work on five parts of Highways 23, 71 and 212 will be getting underway in District 8.",
        "content": "WILLMAR — Travelers should allow extra travel time as district wide safety enhancement projects get underway June 3 in southwest Minnesota, according to the Minnesota Department of Transportation. The safety enhancements include a combination of refurbished and new intersection signing and pavement markings, centerline rumble strips, and reflective striping. The project is expected to take 25 working days. Centerline rumble strips Crews will install new centerline rumble strips and reflective striping along the following state highways. Starting June 3 – Highway 212 from Olivia to west of Hector (east working west) Starting June 8 – Highway 71 from Blomkest to Hwy 212 west of Olivia (north working south) Starting June 15 – Highway 212 from Danube to Renville (east working west) Starting June 18 – Highway 23 from Clara City to east of Granite Falls (north working south) Starting June 26 – Highway 212 from east of Highway 23 to Granite Falls city limits (east working west) Traffic Impact — Travelers will be directed through the work zone by flaggers and a pilot car. Expect delays; allow extra travel time. Intersection signing Crews will install or refurbish stop bars and pavement markings at 60 locations throughout all twelve counties of the district: Chippewa, Kandiyohi, Lac qui Parle, Lincoln, Lyon, McLeod, Meeker, Murray, Pipestone, Redwood, Renville, and Yellow Medicine. Stop bars are 24-inch-wide, solid white lines that extend across all lanes in one direction to indicate where to stop. They provide drivers with an additional visual reminder to stop before entering or crossing traffic at an intersection. Traffic Impact — Drivers may encounter temporary shoulder and lane closures with flagging operations, as well as equipment entering and exiting the roadway. MnDOT encourages travelers to always drive with caution and to slow down in project areas for their safety and the safety of workers. Project benefits Benefits of the project include enhanced safety as rumble strips and pavement markings communicate to drivers where to position their vehicles and warn about upcoming conditions. The new pavement markings will be more visible to drivers. Surface Prep Tech is the contractor, and the project cost is $2,223,684.

        "description": "The WA government says it will consider making its proposed new firearm laws even tougher after two Perth women were murdered in their home, an incident motivated by domestic violence. But could the legislation have stopped their killer?",
        "content": "It's not often Western Australia is confronted with something as tragic as what unfolded in Floreat on Friday evening. Jennifer Petelczyc and her 18-year-old daughter Gretl were gunned down in their own home by Mark Bombara, the ex-partner of a friend they were trying to help, before he turned the gun on himself. The immense grief over the murders has been amplified by the fact they remind us of stubbornly-high rates of family and domestic violence across the nation. The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows WA Police respond to one family and domestic violence incident every 20 minutes. But what officers responded to on Friday has had a much wider impact than most others. Now, the search for answers begins. How could this happen? What could have been done to prevent it? The government has proposed a simple solution – beefing up the gun laws passing through state parliament which it has already described as the toughest in the nation. What would the new laws have changed? The government says two elements of its reforms could have applied here. Firstly, Bombara held 11 firearms on a recreational licence and the two handguns he brought with him to the Berkeley Crescent home on a collector's licence. The reforms do away with recreational licences, and Police Minister Paul Papalia said a collector's licence would be much harder to get. Bombara could have applied for a hunting licence but would have needed to prove why he needed it to obtain one. Secondly, he would have been subject to a health check, including a mental health component, within five years of the laws passing and every five years after that. If any issues came up during that test he would have lost his gun licence and his firearms, even if he had a reason for a hunting licence. When should guns be removed? On top of that, the proposed reforms will automatically take people's firearms away in a few situations, mostly when they are convicted of serious offences (with a sentence of five or more years) or when they become subject to a family violence or violence restraining order. The gunman who shot and killed a mother and her teenage daughter in Perth's affluent western suburbs did so because he thought his ex-partner was at the property. Under current laws, restraining orders automatically remove guns and licences from people, but the reforms will put that \"well beyond\" any kind of legal challenge. That's because of the 415 licences revoked or suspended because of restraining orders between October 2022 and 2023, at least seven had them reinstated on review. What the police minister outlined yesterday was going one step further, and potentially giving police the discretion to remove firearms from people earlier. \"I think we'll be acting earlier to remove firearms from premises where there's potential for harm to be done,\" Papalia said. \"Erring on the side of caution and reflecting the new law's premise that public safety is the primary consideration would result in the earlier seizure of firearms.\" He's hoping those reforms can be drafted and added to the bill before the Upper House passes them. It's not yet clear what the Nationals (who oppose the legislation entirely) and the Liberals (who want to see amendments) would think of changes along those lines. There are also legal concerns to consider, like where the bar is set for an officer to be able to remove firearms. But to the government, it makes perfect sense because of the thinking that underpins every aspect of their proposed legislation. \"Less guns in the community means less gun-related incidents and less gun-related crime,\" as the premier described it. But is it that simple? Curtin University Professor Donna Chung has spent decades researching family and domestic violence and agrees the reforms would likely help women feel \"slightly safer\", especially where their partner or ex-partner has access to a firearm. But she said it could not end there. \"We need a really proactive approach that once people raise issues about being in fear that we can act very much proactively and assertively, rather than always needing to wait until an offence is known to have occurred,\" Professor Chung said. In this case, Bombara's ex-wife had asked police to be there when she moved out of their shared property. But because she didn't make a formal report to police about any previous acts of domestic violence, their involvement ended there. Keeping track of offenders Part of fixing that goes beyond firearms laws into the way the entire family and domestic violence system operates. A common issue identified by the sector is that the risk of perpetrators harming women is not well-tracked or shared between agencies. Family and domestic violence support services: It's something the government has promised to fix as part of sweeping reforms to the system, \"If they're not going to cause harm then there's no problem, but if they are going to cause harm we can get to that situation much more quickly,\" Professor Chung said. Easy to promise. Much harder to deliver. Where to from here? It's this part of the equation the government's rapid firearms reforms can't fix. Neither can the wedge politics of telling the opposition to pass the legislation \"because if they don't, they're condoning similar events potentially taking place in the future\". A bill that is 265 pages long can't be reduced to something as simple as that. The solution is much more complex. Broad-scale FDV reforms like the government has committed have been in progress for about eight years in Victoria, cost billions of dollars, and still aren't done. Changing firearms laws might be another tool in the toolkit – and an important one if it can prevent even one tragedy like what happened in Floreat from happening again. But it will come at a cost. An e-petition calling for the government to rethink the reforms already being proposed has broken all records by attracting 32,234 signatures. Many who have signed it are concerned the existing reforms are an overreach into the lives of law-abiding gun owners at a time when there's not enough of a focus on unlicensed firearms and those who use them. A similar-sized petition came before the downfall of WA's Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act. As hard as that backflip was, an about-face on any reforms related to domestic violence would be even harder to justify. But it doesn't mean the government can pass whatever reforms it likes, no matter how noble it feels they are, without risking unintended consequences. Want more local WA news?

In the lead up to their split, the TV couple confessed that lockdown had taken its toll on them, with the clip now doing the rounds on social media which follows their announcement that they will divorce. During a TalkTV conversation amidst the Covid-19 period, the footage showed the ex-This Morning presenters confessing that they hardly spent any time together. At the time, this didn't raise any suspicion or alarm bells but now fans are reading between the lines. In a joint chat with host Kevin O'Sullivan, Eamonn confessed that the only time they really interacted was when they were on duty together. He revealed at the time: \"Although we live together, we're not really together, we don't watch the same TV, Ruth likes her own space, when we do This Morning it's a rare time we actually interrelate.\" \"That's why we've been together 24 years because we aren't actually together a lot,\" added Ruth. Another clip from 2018 resurfaced when the duo were still hosting This Morning, where Eamonn and Ruth had contrasting views on remaining friends with an ex. The hosts debated if they could stay friends with a past flame in a discussion segment on the popular ITV show. Eamonn expressed his view on the topic: 'It is easier to stay friends.\" However, Ruth held a completely different opinion, confessing: \"Why would you need to stay friends, you aren't with them anymore, you don't need to be friends. My thing is you weren't just friends, you were married or had a relationship.\" Friends have revealed that the couple had quietly parted ways a year ago. It has since been reported by The Sun that Ruth and Eamonn have been leading separate lives for two years. The GB News star has faced a number of setbacks over the last few years, with Eamonn suffering from chronic pain, his mother's death, his and Ruth's job on This Morning, and also now his relationship breaking down and moving out of his home. According to The Sun, a close source told the publication he'd been through so much that it would \"break most people\" but he has \"kept on going and kept on working the best he can\".",

        "description": "Only six outs from state, the Serena Huskers’ run through the postseason came to an end Memorial Day afternoon with an eight-inning loss to Villa Grove.",
        "content": "BLOOMINGTON – Only six outs from state, the ’ run through the postseason came to an end Memorial Day afternoon. Villa Grove scored two times in the sixth inning to erase Serena’s two-run lead, then three times in the top of the eighth to take control of the Blue Devils’ eventual 5-2, extra-inning win over the Huskers in the Class 1A Illinois Wesleyan Supersectional on Inspiration Field at Carol Willis Park. “Like I told the girls,” Serena coach Kelly Baker said, “it just wasn’t our day. We did a lot of things right, but it wasn’t meant to be. “We didn’t look nervous. We didn’t have those jitters. I was so proud of the way they came out ... but things just didn’t go our way today.” Early on, they did. After getting a double from Paisley Twait in the bottom of the first inning but stranding the senior at first, Serena (22-8) came through in the third. No. 9 hitter Brynley Glade started things off with a one-out, Texas-league double to shallow center field. RayElle Brennan traded places with her immediately, cranking a double halfway up the fence in left to make it 1-0 Huskers. Brennan, who took third on the throw home trying to cut down Brynley Glade, scored herself on Jenna Setchell’s RBI groundout, making it 2-0 after three innings. “[This season] was just amazing,” Brennan said. “My team fought to get here. We battled every game, even this game. I’m so proud of my team. It was great. “I feel like it all started in the dugout. Our dugout built up, and we definitely had a very positive atmosphere there, and it showed on the field.” And there it stayed for a bit, as Huskers junior ace Maddie Glade started the day with a 1-2-3 top of the first and – after shutting out both Dwight and Newark in the 1A Woodland Sectional – ran her consecutive scoreless postseason inning streak to 25 by keeping the Blue Devils (25-13-1) off the scoreboard the opening five innings despite runners reaching in the second and fifth. The streak ended in the sixth, however. A leadoff walk to Villa Grove No. 9 hitter Chloe Reardon and a bloop single off the bat of Kayln Cordes came back to haunt Maddie Glade when her counterpart, Blue Devils pitcher Alexandria Brown, slugged a two-run double to right-center, scoring both Reardon and Cordes to tie the game 2-2. A strike from center fielder Cali Edwards to Twait at third cut down Brown trying to advance and helped the Huskers escape with the tie still intact. “I’ll tell you, [Serena] made some unbelievable plays,” Villa Grove coach Jeana Block said. “I said, ‘Just keep putting it in play, eventually it falls, that’s just how it works.’ And once we started putting the ball in play a little bit more, things fell our way. “And I knew once we tied it, we’ve got this.” Block’s words proved prophetic. While Serena went down quickly in the home half of the sixth and seventh innings, the Blue Devils continued to put pressure on Maddie Glade (8 IP, 4 ER, 9 H, 2 BB, 4 K) and what up to that point had been a phenomenal Huskers defensive effort – especially from Twait at third, Setchell at shortstop and Brynley Glade in right field. That pressure came to a head in the first extra inning. After a Cordes single and the second foul out of the game run down by Brynley Glade along the right-field fence line, Villa Grove No. 3 hitter Piper Kiser stepped in and stayed alive after hitting a pop foul of her own in the on-deck nook between the backstop and the Blue Devils’ dugout. Serena’s players and on-deck hitter Alison Pangburn got in each other’s way, but after Baker asked the umpires to meet and discuss a potential interference call, Kiser was allowed to step back into the batter’s box. Two pitches later, Kiser blasted a two-run, line-drive homer well over the fence in right field to give Villa Grove its first lead. The Blue Devils added another run thanks to two errors and a single. Brynley Glade doubled with two outs in the bottom of the eighth for her second hit of the day but was left stranded there when Brennan’s well-struck fly ball was run down just in front of the warning track in left to send the Blue Devils to next Friday’s state semifinals and the Huskers – co-Little Ten Conference champs, regional champs and sectional champs – home. “Once we got Brynley on second, I thought, ‘Maybe this is where we’re going to do it,’ ” Baker said. “But I’m so proud of them. “The seniors, they left our program in a better place.”",

        "content": "The Rivers State leadership of the All Progressives Congress has said it wants the Minister of Federal Capital Territory, Nyesom Wike, to join its fold to help the party win the presidential election for Bola Tinubu in 2027. The State APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, Tony Okocha, stated this during a one-million- man solidarity March for Tinubu’s Renewed Hope Agenda’ in Port Harcourt on Thursday. Okocha, describes Wike, as a political strategist who cannot be ignored in Rivers State politics, adding that the immediate past governor has a midas touch. He further said if the FCT Minister joins the party it will be easier for him to win elections for Tinubu in Rivers State, as the President will seek reelection after completing his first term in office. “Wike is the leader of the ‘Renewed Hope Agenda’ in Rivers State. Wike was responsible for the victory of the Tinubu election in Rivers State. Wike is a reformer and he is our leader Rivers in State.” Explaining why Wike’s picture is on the banner of the party, alongside President Tinubu, Okocha said, “This is not an APC event. This is Renewed Hope, Mr. President’s family in Rivers State. “Wike is the game changer he has a Midas torch and you remember that we have been wooing him to come over to to help us. This is again one of those attempts to woo him to come over to APC and help us so that we will continue to win the elections for Mr President, particularly when elections come for 2027. “A time came in Rivers State when we could not campaign for our presidential candidate using the party platform upon which he emerged because we were threatened by the entire leadership of APC in Rivers State.” He added, “They told us that the man we were supporting Bola Tinubu, was too old and that he had become senile. How can we support a man who will die any moment soon, that he was at the departure lounge? “They said to us that we were supporting a man who is medically unfit and was using all the social media platforms to paint him as someone who defecates on himself. I want to state here that President Tinubu is the best thing that happened to Nigeria “Rome was not built in a day. Nigeria suffered setbacks- political, economic, socio-cultural and we have a leader who just came on the throne for nearly one year. “Can he possibly upturn the mistakes of 30 or 50 years in one year? So it’s a process and the process began the same day he took the oath of office. The President was very clear when he said that he wanted to fix Nigeria and he said that fuel subsidies were gone. “Today states, federal, and local government areas are packing money in billions for the development of the State. I am aware that the first and biggest project that will transverse the length and breadth of Nigeria is being carried out under Bola Ahmed Tinubu.” He said that the role Wike played in the victory of Tinubu in the 2023 election in Rivers State cannot be ignored stressing that the party needed him to play the same role for Tinubu in 2027.",

        "content": "An oil and gas lobby group says the federal government’s proposed emissions cap on the sector combined with its stringent targets for methane reduction could reduce Canada’s non-oilsands fossil fuel production by one million barrels per day by 2030. The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers says it commissioned a study by S&P Global Commodity Insights to see what the economic impact of various proposed emissions-reducing policies would be on Canada’s conventional, or non-oilsands, oil and gas producers. The study says in the event that oil and gas drillers could be required to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030, the industry could see $75 billion less in capital investment over the course of the next nine years compared with current policy conditions. CAPP says that would translate to one million barrels of oil equivalent lower production per day in 2030 compared with current forecasts, and 51,000 fewer jobs by 2030 than under existing government policies. Under the federal government’s draft framework for its promised cap on emissions from oil and gas production, the sector would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 38 percent from 2019 levels by 2030. The sector would also have the option to buy offset credits or contribute to a decarbonization fund that would lower that requirement to cutting just 20 to 23 percent. But CAPP says its sponsored study also added in the projected impact of the federal government’s draft methane regulations, which would require at least a 75 percent reduction of oil and gas methane emissions below 2012 levels by 2030.",

        "content": "CINCINNATI — As Taste of Cincinnati wraps up, some vendors are sharing the impact the event has on their business. Kris Best and her husband own Indigenous Chef. This is their second year at Taste, but their business really began when their love story did. “I was a nutrition fanatic and he was a chef fanatic,\" Best said. “On the first date, he said, ‘You know, I know how to cook?’ and I said, ‘Good, because I know how to eat.’” Then, they combined their heritages to create the menu for Indigenous Chef: Native American food from the Iroquois Confederacy and Native Mexican food. Just like many other restaurants, they have had to adjust to rising food prices to stay in business. The latest Consumer Price Index data shows food prices have increased 2.2% over the last year and overall, food prices stayed steady from March to April. Raising prices is the only strategy the owners are using to combat rising prices. “Just kind of look at where are we getting our food — are we getting it at the best place that we’re comfortable with as far as social impact and then also price?\" Best said. Other businesses, like Twisted Greek, have been able to absorb food price increases without raising menu prices. “Right now we’re just kind of making sure we’re not throwing away extra food and making sure our portions are consistent for everybody,\" owner Stephen Spyrou said. “It’s nothing drastic that we’re stressed over yet, but you never know what the future will bring.” As they tackle these decisions, they're also trying to grow their business. It's a goal events like Taste of Cincinnati help them to achieve. “We’re able to meet new people, introduce them to what we do, how we’re unique from all the other food trucks and all the other Greek restaurants in town,\" Spyrou said. At Indigenous Chef, Best loves sharing their dishes with new people and running into those new customers at other events. “There are so many people that come after Taste of Cincinnati that say, ‘We saw you at Taste, we had your Three Sisters at Taste, we had your beignets at Taste, we had your lobster cakes at Taste, do you have that now?’” Best said.",

        "content": "The Social Democratic Party ( SDP ) candidate for the Kogi State governorship election, Murtala Ajaka, has revealed that he will appeal the verdict of the Kogi Election tribunal that upheld the election of Usman Ododo as governor. Naija News reports that Ajaka articulated his determination in a statement issued shortly after the tribunal’s decision was announced on Monday. The Tribunal, led by Justice Ado Birnin-Kudu, dismissed the SDP’s petition, which had claimed electoral discrepancies, stating that the election complied substantially with the Electoral Act. Despite the tribunal’s findings, Ajaka voiced strong disagreement and expressed confidence that higher courts would eventually vindicate his position. Ajaka’s statement read, “This is not the end of our journey but merely a chapter in our fight for justice and democracy. We acknowledge the tribunal’s decision but remain optimistic about our prospects in the appellate courts.” He praised his legal team for their robust representation, particularly their handling of evidence related to overvoting, a point the tribunal acknowledged before dismissing the petition. “Our lawyers have showcased utmost professionalism and dedication. Their efforts underline our commitment to reclaiming what we believe is a stolen mandate,” he said. Reiterating his commitment to pursuing legal avenues to contest the election results, Ajaka emphasized, “ This battle is far from over. We will take this fight to the very end, where I believe justice will prevail.” Ajaka called on his supporters to remain steadfast and resilient, highlighting the broader implications of his campaign beyond just electoral victory. “This is about correcting a flawed system and ensuring that our electoral processes reflect the true will of the people,” he added.",

        "content": "Antonio Conte considers Napoli captain Giovanni Di Lorenzo to be “non-transferable” despite links to Inter Milan and Juventus. Italian broadcaster Sky Sport Italia, via FCInterNews , report that the incoming Napoli coach wants Di Lorenzo to be a cornerstone of his project – despite his desire to leave the club. Napoli captain Di Lorenzo wants to leave the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. That is not only speculation or a rumour. The player’s agent has confirmed as much. The reason for the rift between Di Lorenzo and Napoli appears to be the player having the sense that his club do not have faith in him. Even though the 30-year-old has been captain of the Partenopei for the past two years, the club President Aurelio De Laurentiis would be willing to sell him. Therefore, the Napoli captain appears to have made up his mind. He wants to move on to a different club. And there would be no lack of interest in Di Lorenzo’s signature this summer. Reportedly, Inter see the 30-year-old as a prospective target if Denzel Dumfries leaves. And then both of Juventus and Roma are also linked with a move for Di Lorenzo now that he looks to be available. Antonio Conte Wants To Keep Giovanni Di Lorenzo At Napoli Despite Inter & Juventus Links But in the background of the situation concerning Di Lorenzo at Napoli, there is another high-profile situation. The Campanian club look to be appointing a new coach. Antonio Conte looks to be ready to sign his contract to become the Partenopei’s new coach. The 54-year-old has won league titles with the likes of Juventus, Chelsea, and Inter. He has also taken Italy to a EURO semifinal. And now, Conte looks set to take over as Napoli coach. As part of the negotiations, the former Nerazzurri coach is making his demands regarding the squad that he will have at his disposal. And one of these demands, reports Sky, is that Di Lorenzo stay. Naturally, the player’s decision will also play a role. But for Conte, keeping Di Lorenzo in the squad is a priority. He sees the Italian international as a leader and a player he can build his new team around. Therefore, the 54-year-old is pushing to not sell Di Lorenzo this summer.",

        "content": "Nicki Minaj announces a new date for her show at Manchester's cursed Co-op Live after her planned performance was cancelled following drug arrest in Amsterdam By Hannah Mcdonald Published: 17:33 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:40 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Nicki Minaj has announced a new date for her show at cursed music venue Co-op Live after her planned performance was cancelled following her drug arrest. The rapper and singer, 41, had to be reschedule the Manchester gig after she was arrested on suspicion of possessing soft drugs in the Netherlands on Saturday. Fans were let into the venue for despite the star's arrest, with the venue later telling ticketholders the show had been postponed at 9.40pm - over three hours after its original planned start time. However Nicki has now reassured fans that the May 25 gig has been rescheduled for Monday June 3. Sharing the news on X, formerly Twitter , Nicki said: 'OK guys, I was JUST RE-ADVISED that we actually CAN NOT do any other date for the make up #gagcityMANCHESTER date besides JUNE 3rd. Nicki Minaj has announced a new date for her show at cursed music venue Co-op Live after her planned performance was cancelled following her drug arrest (Pictured on March 30) The rapper and singer, 41, had to be reschedule the Manchester gig after she was arrested on suspicion of possessing soft drugs in the Netherlands on Saturday 'So JUNE 3rd is the new official date for all ticket holders who originally had tickets to the MAY 25th #Manchester show. 'I apologise for all the inconvenience this has caused. I really hope you can make the #JUNE3rd show. It'll be really special. Ticketmaster will contact you to advise officially. Love you.' Nicki said she spent around six hours in custody at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Saturday before being able to fly to the UK . The American singer, known for the songs Starships, Super Bass and Anaconda, had been due to take to the stage at 6.30pm, but this was initially pushed back to 7pm. Thousands of fans were let into the newly-opened Manchester venue at around that time on Saturday for her show. However this was despite the star being detained on suspicion of possessing soft drugs at Schiphol Airport. She was released from custody a few hours later. Nicki , who live-streamed her arrest on social media, was fined and eventually allowed to go free by police shortly before 9pm - hours after her show was due to begin. Footage emerged of supporters queuing up in the hours before the scheduled gig, chanting 'Free Nicki Minaj' as they held onto hope that the star would be allowed to fly to the UK in time to perform . However Nicki has now reassured fans that the May 25 gig has been rescheduled for Monday June 3 Nicki said she spent around six hours in custody at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Saturday before being able to fly to the UK (Pictured on March 1) Disappointed fans are seen leaving the arena after being told that tonight's show was called off Promoter Live Nation then announced at around 9.40pm that the show was not to go ahead. 'Nicki Minaj's scheduled performance at Manchester's Co-op Live on Saturday 25th May has been postponed,' a statement online said. 'Tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled performance which will be announced ASAP. 'Despite Nicki's best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight's show happen, the events of today have made it impossible.' It added: 'We are deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused. More information will be available at your point of purchase.' Footage from inside Co-op Live, which is the UK's biggest indoor arena with a capacity of 23,500, showed fans waiting patiently for the star to arrive - despite seemingly receiving no updates on her whereabouts. When the announcement was finally made, fans were heard booing and shouting in disbelief, with organisers saying they were 'deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused'. Dutch police said a woman aged 41 was arrested on Saturday after allegedly trying to take what it described as 'soft drugs' from Schiphol Airport to another country. When the announcement was finally made, fans were heard booing and shouting in disbelief, with organisers saying they were 'deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused' Hundreds of fans queuing outside Manchester's Co-op Live arena ahead of the scheduled show were filmed this evening chanting 'Free Nicki Minaj' A later update from the force said it had released the 'suspect and she can now move on' after paying a fine. Nicki had praised fans for being a 'class act' during the last minute postponement. It is the latest complication to hit the problem-plagued Co-Op Live Arena, which suffered a string of cancellations when it was due to open last month. Headaches for Co-op Arena emerged after capacity for a test event was reduced with just hours' notice. Rick Astley did perform at the arena, however, and there were reports on social media that the event was a success. Yet more issues came when comedian Peter Kay's performances were postponed with less than 48 hours' notice. General manager Gary Roden resigned days after this announcement on April 25. Peter Kay and The Black Keys both had to reschedule dates because of the venue not being 'ready'. Peter's original dates were shifted to April 29 and 30, with the comedian writing on social media that he was 'truly gutted' for his fans. However the gigs were then moved to May 23 and May 24, which he said was 'very disappointing but your safety is important, and I won't compromise that' on X, formerly Twitter. Nicki had praised fans for being a 'class act' during the last minute postponement of her show (Pictured on March 30) Manchester's Co-Op Live Arena has been plagued by issues from its testing to eventual opening earlier this month The new date for the US rock band The Black Keys became May 15 and in a statement, Co-op Live also said that there was 'reassurance' for fans that dates for US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, real name Julius Dubose, on May 1, and American singer Olivia Rodrigo's performances on May 3 and 4 would be going ahead. Sadly both A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and Olivia Rodrigo dates were then postponed. This was just over an hour before A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie was set to perform, with the venue saying that there was a problem during the soundcheck. A component of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system used to direct air had separated from the ductwork, and the installer, contractor and third-party inspector would now have to test each nozzle to confirm they are free from the defect, the Oak View Group said. Two hours after cancelling A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, the venue then said that Rodrigo's gigs would not go ahead on May 3 and 4. Take That said they would be moving their May shows from the Co-op Live to the AO Arena because of 'ongoing technical issues' and earlier that day another band, Keane, announced their May 5 gig at the venue had been postponed thanks to issues that were 'entirely beyond our control'. The venue said it would be taking 'a short pause to events at Co-op Live to fully ensure the safety and security of fans and artists visiting the venue'. However, the UK's biggest arena had live music on May 14, when British rock band Elbow took to the stage - only for the venue to then be hit with the news of Nicki's arrest days later.

        "content": "DÜSSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Bochum clinched Bundesliga survival by coming from three goals down and winning a penalty shootout 6-5 to thwart Fortuna Düsseldorf’s promotion bid on Monday. Second division club Düsseldorf was 3-0 up from the first leg of their playoff on Thursday, but Philipp Hofmann scored twice and Kevin Stöger converted a penalty for Bochum to win the second leg 3-0. Hofmann scored an own goal in the first leg. It left the teams level at 3-3 on aggregate. Düsseldorf came closest to scoring in extra time and Bochum held on thanks to a number of goal-line clearances. Veteran goalkeeper Andreas Luthe saved Andre Hoffmann’s first effort for Düsseldorf in the shootout, and counterpart Florian Kastenmeier also made a save for the home team. It left the pressure on Düsseldorf’s Takashi Uchino. The young Japanese defender sent his spot kick high over the goal along with his team’s hopes. Düsseldorf coach Daniel Thioune tried consoling the inconsolable player. Bochum finished third from bottom in the Bundesliga, while Düsseldorf was third in the second division. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

Second division club Düsseldorf was 3-0 up from the first leg of their playoff on Thursday, but Philipp Hofmann scored twice and Kevin Stöger converted a penalty for Bochum to win the second leg 3-0. Hofmann scored an own goal in the first leg. It left the teams level at 3-3 on aggregate. Düsseldorf came closest to scoring in extra time and Bochum held on thanks to a number of goal-line clearances. Veteran goalkeeper Andreas Luthe saved Andre Hoffmann’s first effort for Düsseldorf in the shootout, and counterpart Florian Kastenmeier also made a save for the home team. It left the pressure on Düsseldorf’s Takashi Uchino. The young Japanese defender sent his spot kick high over the goal along with his team’s hopes. Düsseldorf coach Daniel Thioune tried consoling the inconsolable player. Bochum finished third from bottom in the Bundesliga, while Düsseldorf was third in the second division.

        "content": "The Calgary Composting Facility in the Shepard Waste Management Facility in southeast Calgary is already one of the largest of its kind in Canada but it will soon be much larger. The original space has been processing at its 100,000-tonnes-a-year capacity almost since it opened in 2017. It will be dealing with 160,000 tonnes a year of table scraps and yard waste when it becomes operational by the end of 2025. The city says it will cost $38 million more than the $50-million budget because of post-pandemic inflation and labour costs. But Taneen Rudyk, past president of the Canadian Federation of Municipalities, says Calgary will get $23 million out of its green fund. “This will not only extend the life of the city’s landfill but will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 64,000 tonnes per year.” Story continues below advertisement 1:48 Calgary home to biggest-of-its-kind composting facility in Canada For years, residents living near the facility have complained about the smell. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. Roxanne Taylor says it’s been so awful that she and her husband are considering moving. “Horrible. It’s this putrid kind of swampy smell. We have young kids. You can’t go in the backyard. You can’t exercise. You can’t take the dog for a walk. It’s every unpleasant.” Craig More, with the city’s waste and recycling department, says it’s hoped this expansion might prevent bad smells from being passed on because of new anaerobic consumption technology. “The expansion certainly will not make any further odors or make any odors worse from this facility,” he said. “The new process is going to be totally enclosed so all that air is going to be captured and treated and it will be turned into renewable natural gas.” Story continues below advertisement 2:36 Expansion to Calgary’s composting facility sees costs balloon 75% As for going well over budget, Ward 12 Coun. Evan Spencer says it’s a new reality for capital projects. “We are trying to deliver with 2015 money to 2024 transportation project in the Green Line. That’s going to be a difficult conversation, we already know that.” But Spencer says this is one investment that will pay off for Calgarians. “It’s obviously a big hit but when you make these kinds of investments, you have to think long-term about the benefit to Calgarians and what they will get back in the other direction. This facility is adding an awful lot to the quality of life for Calgarians.” Related News Expansion to Calgary’s composting facility sees costs balloon 75% Calgary composting: green cart delivery begins in city’s southwest",

        "content": "This week is an important – and busy – one for Wellspring Stratford. The local cancer support centre, part of a nationwide network of charities offering programs and services, at no charge and without referral, to anyone with the disease, hopes to raise around $30,000 through two auctions and a golf tournament. That would cover nearly one-third of Wellspring Stratford’s annual operating budget of $100,000, which is crucial given it doesn’t receive government money. “More than ever, there’s so many people in need of support,” Wellspring Stratford manager Lisa Stacey said. “Mental-health support in general (is important), but especially getting diagnosed with cancer and people are reaching out to find ways to cope, and that’s what Wellspring is about – helping people find different programs to help this journey they’re on.” Wellspring’s annual golf tournament is sold out, with 92 participants set to hit the links May 30. Wellspring’s online silent auction will close that day at 5 p.m., and more than half of the $10,000 goal is already met. A sampling of items up for grabs include gift certificates for local businesses, new and vintage jewelry, tickets to the Canadian Open golf championship’s final round, and one night at Hotel Julie, a boutique hotel in Stratford. “It’s a really nice variety,” Stacey said. It’s the second year Wellspring Stratford has run an online silent auction. Around $2,500 was raised in 2023, and Nancy Davidson, a local woman and Wellspring supporter with experience running online auctions, offered to help take it to another level by rounding up 140 different items on which to bid. “We usually have an outpouring of donors every year who give items for the golf tournament,” Stacey said, “but there’s so many more new people who have sponsored or donated something, and it’s another recognition of them knowing who Wellspring is, which is great.” Money raised helps fund the facility and programs it offers to members in Huron-Perth, like peer support, therapeutic touch, reiki, aquafit classes through the local YMCA, poetry workshops, art therapy and a youth program in September for kids whose parents or grandparents are going through cancer. There’s a live auction at the River Valley Golf Club after Thursday’s tournament from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Stacey is the only full-time employee at the centre, which relies on 20 volunteers. “It’s not a huge budget,” she said, “but when you don’t get funding, it’s a lot of work.” To participate in the online auction, visit and click on ‘ways to give’ and ‘events and fundraisers’ and ‘Stratford golf tournament.’",

(See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” elsewhere) Sheldon Inwentash, Chairman and CEO of ThreeD, stated “During this past quarter, the Company continued to realize gains on its investment and digital assets, while continuing to maintain strategic investments within its portfolio. The Company is in a strong position to capitalize on opportunities and trends in key industries including disruptive technology and digital asset sectors. We are excited about our current and prospective investments and believe ThreeD’s investment strategy will continue to advance our investees, strengthen our investment portfolio, and will ultimately result in significant benefits to the Company’s shareholders.” This press release contains references to “net asset value per share” (“NAV”) which is a non-GAAP financial measure. NAV is calculated as the value of total assets less the value of total liabilities divided by the total number of common shares outstanding as at a specific date. The term NAV does not have any standardized meaning according to GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. There is no comparable GAAP financial measure presented in ThreeD’s consolidated financial statements and thus no applicable quantitative reconciliation for such non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that the measure provides information useful to its shareholders in understanding our performance, and may assist in the evaluation of the Company’s business relative to that of its peers. ThreeD is a publicly-traded Canadian-based venture capital firm focused on opportunistic investments in companies in the junior resources and disruptive technologies sectors. ThreeD’s investment strategy is to invest in multiple private and public companies across a variety of sectors globally. ThreeD seeks to invest in early stage, promising companies where it may be the lead investor and can additionally provide investees with advisory services and access to the Company’s ecosystem.

        "description": "A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held Monday at the Dartmouth General Hospital to thank those who donated $2 million to help the facility get its first MRI, bringing the number of the machines in the province to 11.",
        "content": "The first patients won't get to use it for another three weeks, but the Dartmouth General Hospital's first MRI machine was officially unveiled Monday. Sharon Hartling, the diagnostic imaging manager at the Dartmouth General said the plan was to operate the machine up to 16 hours a day, seven days a week. \"Expecting to scan 400 patients a month, 5,000 patients a year, and that's a conservative estimate,\" said Hartling. \"Those numbers are based on our current MRI scanners in the central zone, and this new scanner will be faster, so we're hoping to exceed those targets.\" Sharon Hartling is the diagnostic imaging manager at the Dartmouth General Hospital. (Paul Poirier/CBC) Premier Tim Houston used oversized scissors to cut a blue ribbon stretched across the imaging equipment, whose 12,000-kilogram magnet was delivered just before Christmas and lowered from the roof into a specially reinforced and isolated section of the hospital. Dartmouth General takes delivery of massive magnet for its first MRI suite Houston stood shoulder to shoulder with some of the people who donated $2 million to pay for the MRI through the Dartmouth General Hospital Foundation. Premier Tim Houston was on hand for the official unveiling Monday. (Paul Poirier/CBC) The province's share, $11.9 million, covered the cost of installing the machine, as well as staff salaries for the technicians who will operate it. Houston said it is one of four new MRIs being installed in the Halifax region this year. Two will replace aging equipment at the Halifax Infirmary. The fourth, a mobile MRI, being purchased by the QEII Foundation, will be located at the Bayers Lake Community Outpatient Centre by the end of July. Dr. Graham Joy, the head of radiology at the Dartmouth General Hospital, said having its own MRI will eliminate the need for inpatients to be transported to Halifax to undergo a scan, potentially speeding up diagnoses and ulimately saving money. Dr. Graham Joy, the head of radiology at the Dartmouth General Hospital. (Paul Poirier/CBC) \"EHS [Emergency Health Services] has to be contacted for a transfer, which is a very strained service, so that can lead to some time delays just because of their difficulty in finding time for everything that they're demanded to do,\" said Joy. \"And costs accrue there as well because it's not an inexpensive undertaking to pay for an ambulance back and forth.\" Technicians are being trained to use the new unit. The hospital has started booking appointments for the MRI, starting June 17.

        "content": "The family of a man struck by a vehicle and killed just a minute’s walk from his Co Louth home have appealed for information that might solve the decade-old hit-and-run. Keith Byrne (35) was returning from his local pub along the L1140 road linking Carnalogue and Louth Village in the early hours of Sunday, May 11th, 2014. His remains were discovered by a passing taxi driver and he was later pronounced dead. “He’d come home [from work], he was in great form. And then he had said that he was going to go to a wake in the area and then he was going to go for a few drinks,” his sister Niamh told RTÉ’s Crimecall programme on Monday night.

But a bit boring if I am honest’ Mr Byrne later texted his brother David for a lift home but was not ready in time to take the lift and so decided he would make his own way back along the rural road. “I was lying in the bed trying to get back to sleep. And then I could just hear my mother starting to cry so I jumped out of the bed,” David said. He walked around the nearby corner and immediately recognised the boots his brother was wearing. “You know you’re always asking yourself, if I had of waited another five minutes would he have got into the car? Maybe I should have waited. You’re always saying that to yourself, ten years on.” Mr Byrne was killed about 300 yards from his home, where a memorial has since been erected in his memory. “I think that’s the hardest part about it,” David said. “Another minute [and] he would have been at the house.” Niamh said that information that could answer the questions about what happened on the night would give them peace of mind after ten years. “We were just so shell-shocked – how your life and your family can change in one second is just frightening,” she said. Gardaí, and the Byrne family, who believe somebody has information on his death, have directed their appeal to the driver to come forward or for anyone who the driver may have confided in over the last ten years to make contact.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said prima facie BJP 's newspaper advertisements targeting TMC early this month were disparaging and refused to entertain BJP's appeal against a Calcutta high court order stopping publication of such pamphlets in media against TMC. A vacation bench of Justices J K Maheshwari and K V Viswanathan also questioned the EC for not acting promptly on TMC's May 15 complaint against BJP's advertisements. The EC had issued notice to BJP three days later on May 18. The HC on May 20 had stopped BJP from publishing such advertisements. \"Why did the EC not do anything even after the HC passed the order? Even after this order from HC, did EC do something? It is a question of the independence of EC. We are not inclined to interfere with this order. We have seen the advertisements. Do not precipitate the issue,\" the bench told senior advocate P S Patwalia, who appeared for BJP. Repeatedly suggesting to Patwalia not to precipitate the issue, the bench told BJP: \"Political rivals are not enemies. That is the way forward.\" SC's disinclination forced BJP to withdraw its appeal to approach EC. Patwalia argued that a single judge bench of Calcutta high court passed the order without giving an opportunity to BJP to respond to TMC's plea. It also did not allow the EC, which had on May 18 issued notice to BJP on TMC's complaint, to take the issue to its logical conclusion, he said.",

        "content": "A BRIT hero today told how he raced to help after two Russian glide bombs hit a Ukrainian DIY store. Tony Ferret arrived moments after the weapons struck — killing at least 18 people. The landscaper, 34, a volunteer in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion, was having a coffee nearby when he heard the explosion at Epicentr — Ukraine’s equivalent of B&Q. He got into his military ambulance and pushed cars out of the way for trucks to reach the blaze in Kharkiv on Saturday. Tony, of Rye, East Sussex, said: “I heard the strike, saw the smoke and got in the vehicle. “We tailed over here as fast as we could and saw mass panic. People running everywhere. “I used my 4×4 to push vehicles out of the way. I just wanted to help where I could. “I don’t have a specific role here. I’m a humanitarian. I basically get involved where I can. “I wanted to come and do something good. I couldn’t eat or sleep in England. The people of this country need our help.” President Volodymyr Zelensky said as many as 200 people were in the shop when it was hit. At least 45 people were wounded. Tonight, Russia’s bombardment of Kharkiv continued with a glide bomb attack on a residential building which killed one and injured 11. Tony was among the first on the scene.",

        "content": "Leinster need Munster and the Bulls to slip up against Ulster and Challenge Cup winners Sharks to have any chance of topping the table and retaining home advantage to the final. This seems unlikely, as the Sharks have nothing to play for and Munster are in top form. Given their exertions against Toulouse, a win against Connacht can’t even be taken for granted. Leinster will be overtaken by Glasgow if they fail to win with a bonus point as Glasgow have the pleasure of entertaining Zebre for the second time in recent weeks – the joys of being in a much weaker conference. Benetton are playing Edinburgh and the winner could knock the other out of contention as both are currently on 49 points, level with the Lions, and four points ahead and behind Connacht and Ulster, respectively. The Lions are playing the Stormers away who have little to play for as they cannot finish higher than 5 th . and thus, can only qualify for an away quarterfinal – probably against Leinster if Leinster don’t beat Connacht with a bonus point. Connacht could also be overtaken by Ospreys if the latter beat Cardiff in the last match of the week-end, which also affords them the advantage of knowing exactly what they have to do to qualify. If Ulster get nothing from their game against Munster, they could therefore be squeezed out of the top seven qualification places for the Champions Cup by bonus point wins for the Lions and whoever wins the Benetton Edinburgh clash. Even a bonus point win for Connacht against Leinster doesn’t guarantee them a pay-off place unless the Lions lose. A Champion’s Cup place is beyond them however – that ship sailed when they couldn’t beat Stormers at home and the Sharks won qualification by winning the Challenge cup. Leinster vs. Connacht: Friday 7.35 TG4 and Premier Sports My forebodings about the Leinster Toulouse match came to pass with Ross Byrne’s lack of pace and running threat blunting the Leinster attack and Frawley’s inexperience at 10 not helping his drop goal attempts. It’s asking an awful lot of a utility player who has barely played 10 all season and rarely takes place kicks to close out a game of this magnitude. And yet he nailed his place kicks and only barely missed his drop goal attempts, either of which would have been the winning of the game. Such are the fine margins at this level. Leinster rarely seemed to catch a break, with Lowe’s try being disallowed because of a knock-on that wasn’t, Lowe’s yellow being a harsh call, and the scoring pass to Lebel was not checked for a forward pass. Every marginal call seemed to go against Leinster, while many Toulouse offences at the breakdown went unchecked. But that does not take away from the quality of Toulouse’s performance, and particularly that of their talisman and Captain Antoine Dupont. Surely that was the greatest ever performance by possibly the best rugby player ever? But neither should it disguise the weaknesses in Leinster’s squad. Porter playing almost 100 minutes at loose head told you all you need to know about Leinster’s lack of back up resources at loosehead, and Leinster’s early scrum dominance vanished when Furlong was replaced. Osborne is another promising young utility player, but he is no Aki or McCloskey at 12, or at least not yet. Ringrose at his best was sorely missed. Hopefully he will be fit for the play-offs. But let us also not overlook the positives for Leinster. McCarthy came of age with a towering 100 minute display. Baird called the line-outs well, Doris was tireless, and Van Der Flier did what he could to turn things around. If Gibson Park came out second best against Dupont, it is hardly a criticism. He, too, justified his rating as perhaps the second best 9 around. Leo Cullen will have some job restoring morale amongst shattered dreams and bodies with just a 6 day turnaround to the match against Connacht – a team with nothing to lose and with a play-off place to gain. All going well Leinster could then have three knock-out matches, three weeks in a row, against top teams, and the semi-final and final look likely to be away. Cullen will have to husband his resources carefully. But it is also make your mind up time. Having rebuffed Connacht’s advances for a Prendergast loan deal, the time has surely come to give the young man his head. The Byrne brothers have had enough chances and have come up short. With Keenan off to play in the Olympic 7’s tournament either Frawley or Jimmy O’Brien or both will be required at full back. Jacques Nienaber should be dispatched to focus on signing up a test class scrummaging tight head as a replacement for Ala’alatoa for next season. Furlong is unlikely to start in more than 10 matches for Leinster, so another serious scrummager is required to start the other 20. It’s also time Jack Boyle was given more of a chance to prove he is the replacement for Cian Healy after next season. Porter can’t play 80 minutes every match. After that, it’s all hands on deck as to who is fit and raring to go 6 days after a horrendously physical 100 minutes against Toulouse and the psychological devastation afterwards. No doubt Cullen will again be criticised for fielding a weak team, but players can’t be expected to play at that level week in, week out. Cullen has no choice but to fall back on the rest of his squad. With only the top 7 teams qualifying for next season’s Champion’s Cup, this is last chance saloon for a Connacht squad which has been showing signs of improvement despite their narrow loss to the Stormers. They will undoubtedly seek to exploit any weaknesses in Leinster’s physical and psychological resilience and Cullen really needs his squad players to step up. Otherwise, they could be playing a semi-final in South Africa, if they get that far. Peter Wilkins is reputed to be a nice guy who perhaps lacks a ruthless edge. He belied that image by culling 11 players from his squad for next season, including long time regulars Jarrad Butler, Tom Daly and Gavin Thornbury. He is going to have to start being equally ruthless in his team selections, if the inconsistency which has dogged them this season is to be eradicated. JJ Hanrahan being out for much of next season won’t help them, and they badly need to recruit another specialist placekicking 10. Perhaps one of the Byrne brothers may become available? Connacht, on song, have beaten Leinster before, and look quite likely to do so again given the devastation in the Leinster camp. Professional rugby can be a tough game. Munster vs. Ulster: Saturday 5.15; RTE and Premier Sports Munster have been showing real championship form in the last few weeks and have a near full strength squad available. With Snyman and Carbery leaving and Zebo retiring, they will never get a better chance of retaining their crown. Win this match, and they are guaranteed a home run all the way to the final, in stark contrast to last season, when they had to do it the hard way. Thomond Park could really find its mojo again and Munster’s finances could receive a welcome boost. With Kilcoyne injured and getting on in years, Munster could really do with recruiting a top class loose head to provide cover for Loughman. Ulster have lived a charmed existence since Richie Murphy took over and have come out on the right side of some tight encounters. However, playing a resurgent Munster in Thomond Park is another level entirely and they will have to up their game considerably to come away with anything. They have plenty of incentive, however, as a win could guarantee them Champion’s Cup rugby next season and help their troubled finances. A try bonus or losing bonus point could also be sufficient, so I expect this match to be a real belter. Ulster have recruited Aidan Morgan (22), a New Zealand-born, Irish qualified out half from the Hurricanes for next season as a replacement for Billy Burns who is replacing Carbery at Munster. Let’s hope he is not another addition to the non-tackling school of rugby 10s. Billy Burns, Jake Flannery, and Nathan Doak have not exactly set the world on fire at 10 this season, although Billy Burns has had his moments, and presumably it is financial constraints that have forced his departure. Richie Murphy may have to make bricks without much straw next season, but perhaps it is time Ulster took the long view and spent time and resources nurturing more indigenous talent to come to the fore. That, after all, has been Richie Murphy’s great strength with the Irish u. 20s.",

Rodriguez, who is attempting to buy the team with business partner Marc Lore, was in the stands as the T-Wolves lost 116-107 to the Dallas Mavericks and fell into an 0-3 hole in the Western Conference Finals. But the former Yankees star was given a heartwarming surprise during the game as his daughter Natasha surprised him at the Target Center - with the help of her sister Ella. In a clip posted to Rodriguez's Instagram, he could be seen sitting with Ella, 16, as his younger daughter distracted him by pointing at the jumbotron. With the hopeful Timberwolves owner looking the other way, Natasha then snuck up beside her father courtside - before the pair shared an emotional hug. Alex Rodriguez was left shocked as his daughter Natasha surprised him on Monday night Rodriguez and his eldest daugher shared an emotional hug at the Target Center Rodriguez was visibly stunned by the surprise, with his mouth agape for several seconds. He then gave Natasha a sweet kiss on the forehead before she appeared to give her sister Ella a hug as well. He wrote on Instagram, 'I could not believe it! Ella and @thenatasharodriguez you two got me so good. Rodriguez shares Ella and Natasha with his ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. Rodriguez is seen with his daughters at a Minnesota Twins game last summer Rodriguez had been distracted by his daughter Ella before as she pointed at the jumbotron The ex-slugger has been a fixture at Timberwolves games this postseason as he and Lore look to finalize their deal for the team. They announced plans to buy the team from Glen Taylor in 2021, but Taylor recently exercised his right to pull out of the last part of the structured deal, saying the prospective buyers failed to make the deadline for the final $600million payment (of $1.5billion total). Rodriguez and Lore denied missing the final payment, saying in a joint statement that they have 'fulfilled our obligations, have all necessary funding' and called Taylor's move an 'unfortunate case of seller's remorse.' Lore and Rodriguez have since claimed that they're waiting for NBA approval on a 90-day extension.

NAV is calculated as the value of total assets less the value of total liabilities divided by the total number of common shares outstanding as at a specific date. The term NAV does not have any standardized meaning according to GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.

        "content": "The Longmont community paid respects to departed U.S. military veterans at Memorial Day services on Monday. Ceremonies were held Monday morning throughout the Longmont area at Stephen Day Park, Foothills Gardens of Memory and Mountain View Cemetery. At each location, members of the American Legion Post 32, the Longs Peak VFW Post 2601 and other local organizations hung wreaths in honor of the soldiers who gave their lives in military service. Roughly 200 people attended the Mountain View ceremony. Guests gathered in front of a half-staff American flag in the middle of the cemetery, many dressed in red, white, and blue colors for the holiday. “We appreciate you taking the time to be here on what is traditionally the kickoff of summer,” Post 32 commander Ralph Bozella told the crowd. “Instead of being somewhere else, you know the value of this day. You know the value of your freedom.” Opening and closing prayers at the ceremonies were led by Post 32 chaplain Ron Wunsch. “We gather here at Mountain View Cemetery in Longmont because we love this land,” Wunsch said. “We remember those who have died to secure our right to freedom, and the gifts of liberty and justice for all.” The Mountain View ceremony included remarks from guest speaker Jim Gates, a U.S. Air Force veteran and assistant chaplain for Post 32. Gates spoke on the history of Memorial Day, explaining that the day emerged after the Civil War as a solemn time to mourn the loss of Union and Confederate soldiers alike. “It was a gesture of healing and reconciliation in a land ripped apart by conflict,” Gates said. Eight wreaths were presented by representatives of both posts, as well as by members of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Longmont Elks and Moose lodges. “As long as there are veterans, the benevolent and protective order of Elks will never forget them,” said Allen Lenort with the Longmont Elks Lodge. Longmont Moose Lodge member John Carter, who hung the final wreath on Monday, said he was deeply honored to represent the Lodge. “Looking out here at all the veterans, I personally would like to say thank you for your sacrifices,” Carter told the crowd. After a rifle salute, Bozella invited the attendees to visit Post 32 and raise the flag to full-staff — the culmination of the day’s memorial activities. “For you, our patriotic community, we thank you for your service,” Bozella told guests. “You care, and you’re here.”",

The makeup mogul posted two carousels to her Instagram of the shoot, one captioned: “catch us if you can @drinksprinter,” and the second included triple tags of the drink brand’s account handle.

She went with a natural makeup look for the shoot, with her hair kept straight as it blew in the wind. View this post on Instagram A post shared by SPRINTER (@drinksprinter) Jenner did not get the reaction she had hoped, as her fans are sharing that they’re ‘sad’ after seeing these new flicks. After getting a look at the new shots, fans were convinced there was something different about Jenner. Jenner's famous family has been getting backlash backlash for years, as many people criticize the Kardashian family for now owning up to their cosmetic surgeries. Her followers stormed to a Reddit thread to share the photos and discuss the possible alterations made to Jenner.

As at March 31, 2024, the Company had cash, investments and digital assets of $49.7 million. As at March 31, 2024, net asset value per share was $0.89 as compared to $0.79 as at June 30, 2023. (See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” elsewhere) Financial Highlights for the three and nine months ending March 31, 2024 with comparatives: Sheldon Inwentash, Chairman and CEO of ThreeD, stated “During this past quarter, the Company continued to realize gains on its investment and digital assets, while continuing to maintain strategic investments within its portfolio. The Company is in a strong position to capitalize on opportunities and trends in key industries including disruptive technology and digital asset sectors. We are excited about our current and prospective investments and believe ThreeD’s investment strategy will continue to advance our investees, strengthen our investment portfolio, and will ultimately result in significant benefits to the Company’s shareholders.” Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures: This press release contains references to “net asset value per share” (“NAV”) which is a non-GAAP financial measure. NAV is calculated as the value of total assets less the value of total liabilities divided by the total number of common shares outstanding as at a specific date. The term NAV does not have any standardized meaning according to GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. There is no comparable GAAP financial measure presented in ThreeD’s consolidated financial statements and thus no applicable quantitative reconciliation for such non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that the measure provides information useful to its shareholders in understanding our performance, and may assist in the evaluation of the Company’s business relative to that of its peers.

ThreeD is a publicly-traded Canadian-based venture capital firm focused on opportunistic investments in companies in the junior resources and disruptive technologies sectors. ThreeD’s investment strategy is to invest in multiple private and public companies across a variety of sectors globally.

        "description": "Western Investment Company Reports Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2024",
        "content": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Western Investment Company of Canada Limited (TSXV: WI) (“ Western ” or the “ Corporation ”) today reported its financial and operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The interim financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis have been filed on SEDAR+. Unless otherwise indicated, financial figures are expressed in Canadian dollars and comparisons are to the prior period ended March 31, 2023. The first quarter is generally slow for Western’s associate companies (“ Associates ”) that are seasonal, often leading to an equity loss which is completely in-line with expectations. Last year was an unusual exception in large part due to Western’s share of the $1.1 million one-time gain recognized on the sale of the Foothills Creamery warehouse in Kelowna. As income (loss) from equity investments returned to normal levels, total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased $588,072 compared with the same period in 2023 which benefited from the one-time gain and lower interest expenses. Removing one-time items would have resulted in equity earnings that were comparable between both periods. All Associates performed in-line with their budgets for the first quarter. “Our Associates are primed and well positioned as we head into our busy spring and summer season to deliver what we believe will be a solid year for Western,” said Scott Tannas, President and Chief Executive Officer of Western. “We deliberately built-up inventory levels through the first quarter at both GlassMasters and Foothills to ensure we have product on hand to meet customer demand. GlassMasters will also benefit from the four new locations it has added over the last year and the ICBC accreditation it received in the first quarter that will allow it to serve BC customers with insurance claims. We have also made significant progress on our proposed transaction with Paul Rivett to transform Western into a property and casualty insurance and investment holding company, We expect to provide an update in the coming days on the status of this transaction.” 2023 Portfolio Company Report Fortress Insurance Company (“Fortress”) Fortress’ strong growth trajectory continues to be driven by increased capacity across all of its products, and the recent addition of liability and transportation insurance to its product lineup. Despite management’s expectation of a softening insurance market, continued growth in written premiums is expected throughout the year with a focus on diversification of both product lines, geography, and a focus on growing business in Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. New programs in Ontario and Alberta with established partners were also added during the first quarter. Key Highlights: Gross written premiums grew 40% to $5.2 million compared with $3.7 million in the prior year. Q1 2024 includes two new programs, which didn’t exist in Q1 2023. Such programs add geographic diversity and class of insurance to the portfolio. Q1 2024 saw growth of 127% in its in-house offer and acceptance offerings. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, Western recognized equity income of $16,630 from Fortress compared to $26,879 in equity income for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. 1 Supplementary financial measure – total gross insurance premiums written during the year. 2 Prior year numbers have been restated to conform with the new standard, IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, which was adopted by Fortress on January 1, 2023, with retrospective application. GlassMasters Autoglass (“GlassMasters”) Stronger sales than expected in the quarter resulted in a slight reduction in margins due to lower inventory levels (creating the need to obtain glass at higher prices) and staff training that needed to occur sooner than budgeted. As a result, net income for the quarter came in just slightly below their budgeted loss of $510,000. Being a seasonal business a loss is expected for the first quarter. Key Highlights : Revenue hit new record on a 14.5% increase to $7.6 million compared with $6.6 million in the prior year. The addition of one warehouse, two stores, and an investment in an existing full-service glass shop in 2023 positions GlassMasters for a strong year. GlassMasters' newest location in Kelowna is up and running, and Winnipeg is poised to open in the third quarter of 2024. Foothills Creamery (“Foothills”) Foothills reported a net loss and EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 of $89,170 and $570,997 respectively. For the prior three months ended March 31, 2023, EBITDA and net income was inflated by a large one-time gain realized on the sale of real estate. Foothills sold their Kelowna warehouse in the first quarter of 2023 and is leasing the space back. Removing this $1.1 million gain from 2023 provides for an adjusted net loss of $404,101, and adjusted EBITDA of $401,450. Key highlights: Gross Profit grew 15% to $1.75 million in Q1 2024 compared with $1.52 million in Q1 2023 as a result of a focus on higher margin products. If the gain on sale of real estate recognized in 2023 is removed, EBITDA grew 42% to $570,997 in Q1 2024 compared with $401,450 (adjusted) in Q1 2023. As at March 31, 2024, Foothills had $2.1 million more inventory on hand compared to March 31, 2023 and is well positioned for the spring and summer season. Golden Health Care (“Golden”) For the period ended March 31, 2024 Western recognized equity income from Golden of $54,902 compared with a $14,532 loss for the period ended March 31, 2023. Key Highlights : Revenue grew 10.4% to $2.4 million in Q1 2024 compared with $2.2 million in Q1 2023 as a result of efforts to improve occupancy at underutilized homes. Net income grew to $181,803 in Q1 2024 compared with a net loss of $49,105 in Q1 2023. EBITDA grew 109% to $483,793 in Q1 2024 compared with $230,971 in Q1 2023. Outlook The tremendous growth in gross written premiums at Fortress is expected to moderate somewhat as it navigates its entry into the Ontario marketplace. Fortress continues to work on adding new product offerings to its lineup. GlassMasters is expected to continue its trend of revenue growth. The cool spring, has tempered Foothills forecasts for 2024 somewhat affecting the demand for ice cream, which will be highly dependent on a return to more seasonal warmer temperatures.

        "description": "Double whammy strikes business specialising in popular logistics, warehouse sector.",
        "content": "Listed landlord Goodman Property Trust recorded a massive $564.9 million net after tax loss due to $478.4 million property devaluations and a $290m internalisation deal. But it said property income or revenue was up 14 per cent and the trust’s internalisation had positioned it for the next phase of growth. Goodman’s results for the year to March 31, 2024 showed last year’s $237.7m devaluations shot up to $478.4m in the latest year. That sliced into the bottom-line figure, showing how hard even this sector has been hit by the recession and its effects on property. The trust owns and leases around $4.5b of real estate, mainly in Auckland in the popular logistics and warehouse sector where vacancies are extremely low. It owns Highbrook Business Park and has developed the ex-Foodstuffs North Island headquarters on Roma Rd in Mt Roskill into a four-building logistics hub in a project worth around $250m. The company said it had strong balance sheet capacity with a loan-to-value ratio at only 31.45 per cent and $760m available. But even with relatively low debt-to-asset ratios, interest costs shot from $29.5m last year to $46.7m this year. The business also finished four fully leased development projects adding an extra 79,452sq m of warehouse and logistics space and has a further $209.7m work under way. Unit-holders will get a 6.20 cents per unit distribution, up 5 per cent on last year and representing 83 per cent of underlying cash earnings. Goodman is forecasting 6.5 cents per cent per unit payout in the 2025 year, up nearly 5 per cent on 2024. “We have achieved our leasing targets over the last 12 months and have continued to refine the portfolio, progressing development projects and investing in new building technologies to meet customer demand for greater efficiency, supply chain resilience and more sustainable property solutions,” chief executive James Spence said. Customer demand was moderating but the positive leasing dynamic created by a highly constrained industrial market supported strong revenue growth, he said. On devaluations, he said the fall in the last 12 months reflected the impact of higher interest rates on investment yields. “We take a longer-term view on value creation and note that a net $670m of fair value gains from property valuations have been recognised in Goodman’s statutory results over the last five years,” Spence said. Market rents for prime industrial space had increased and the potential reversion to market within the portfolio remains substantial at around 23 per cent. Net property income had grown to more than $200m, with rent reviews and new leasing contributing to growth of 6.5 per cent, Spence said. “The significant under-renting within the portfolio is also expected to drive future earnings growth, as rents are reviewed to market levels and new leases are secured at these higher rates,” he said. The company said Greenfield sites within the portfolio provide future opportunities. “These sites are expected to support the development of almost 400,000sq m of urban logistics space over the next 10 to 15 years,” Spence said. One of those sites is the ex-Villa Maria vineyard near Auckland Airport where Goodman plans a $500m warehouses and storage building project. Goodman is a managed investment scheme with a market capitalisation of around $3.4 billion, ranking it in the top 20 of all listed investment vehicles. The trust said it re-weighted its investments towards Auckland and out of other areas in the last few years. Tenants, who it calls customers, include Mainfreight, NZ Post, Cotton On and lighting company Signify. Units have been trading around $2.20, up just over 1 per cent annually.

        "content": "Benjamin Netanyahu admits 'tragic mistake' after Israeli strike in Rafah kills 'at least 45 people' including displaced people burned alive in tents The Prime Minister said Israel was investigating Sunday night's strike By Miriam Kuepper and Perkin Amalaraj Published: 20:05, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:39, 27 May 2024 e-mail 253 View comments Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted 'tragic mistake' after an Israeli strike in Rafah has allegedly killed 45 people including displaced people who burned alive in tents. The Israeli Prime Minister said Jerusalem was investigating Sunday night's strike in which the IDF targeted a 'terrorist compound', killing senior Hamas officials Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. Hamas claims the strike killed 45 people at a refugee centre by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees near Rafah, branding it a 'horrific massacre'. The IDF said earlier today that it was 'aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.' The strike came two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to end its military offensive in Rafah, where more than half of Gaza 's population had sought shelter before Israel's recent incursion. Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted 'tragic mistake' after an Israeli strike in Rafah has allegedly killed 45 people including displaced people who burned alive in tents Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah, Gaza Strip, Monday, May 27, 2024 Fire rages following an Israeli strike on an area designated for displaced Palestinians Palestinians view the destruction after Israel bombs their tents and shelters in Rafah, Gaza on May 27, 2024 Palestinians observe the destruction caused by the attacks of Israeli army on tents of displaced Palestinians Palestinians search for food among burnt debris in the aftermath of an Israeli strike The Palestinian Red Crescent said its ambulance crews transported 'a large number' of people killed and injured in the strikes. The Palestinian Authority presidency in the West Bank called it a 'heinous massacre', accusing Israeli forces of 'deliberately targeting' the tents of displaced people. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war's deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. 'We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,' said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the north-western neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan. Read More Israel is accused of 'collectively punishing' Palestinians in Gaza by chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court 'We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.' The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. The Israeli military's top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur 'in a war of such scope and intensity'. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers' conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of 'violence, property crimes and looting' were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. Palestinians gather at the site of an Israeli strike on a camp for internally displaced people in Rafah on May 27, 2024 The attack, caught on tape by refugees on the ground, resulted in heavy destruction and flames last night Palestinians look at the destruction after an Israeli strike where displaced people were staying in Rafah The attack, caught on tape by refugees on the ground, resulted in heavy destruction and flames last night. It left civilians reeling this morning, with photos showing Palestinians searching through burned out tents and makeshift camps for food. Israel's allies further condemned its methods of warfare in the region, with France saying it was 'outraged' by the violence. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,' French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel.

I would have preferred another decision,' he told SKY TG24. Qatar , a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could 'complicate' talks. Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas's demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a 'new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law'. Jordan's Foreign Ministry called it a 'war crime '. The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said this morning as EU ministers met their Arab counterparts that a ruling made by a UN court for Israel to stop its invasion of Gaza immediately must be implemented. Borrell said today: 'We have to express not only respect, but to ask for the implementation of the decision of the court. This is really a dilemma how the international community can... force implementation of the decision.' He added that EU ministers were also set to discuss relaunching a mission suspended back in 2007 to monitor the crossing after calls for it to do so from regional players including Israel. Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 35 people in the area Israel's army confirmed Sunday's strike and claimed it hit a Hamas installation and killed two senior Hamas militants The EU's top diplomat said he expected to get a preliminary mandate from ministers to press ahead with planning for the mission. 'But it's not only us who have to decide - the Egyptians, Palestinian Israelis,' he said. 'We need to increase the number of staff and we need to have an agreement with everybody involved.' Washington has also taken a tougher line with its close ally as outrage over the war and US support for Israel has become a major issue for President Joe Biden, seeking re-election in a battle against Donald Trump. Read More Dave Chappelle accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza in blistering stand-up at Abu Dhabi Comedy Week - and reveals the only reason he believes Jewish people support the war The United Nations has warned of looming famine in besieged Gaza, where most hospitals are no longer functioning. Last Monday, the prosecutor at the ICC said he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence minister as well as for three top Hamas figures. And on Friday, the UN's International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt any operation in Rafah that could bring about 'the physical destruction' of the Palestinians. Hamas's armed wing said Sunday that it targeted Tel Aviv 'with a large rocket barrage in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians'. 'Hamas launched these rockets from near two mosques in Rafah,' Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said. The salvo sent people scrambling for shelter but there were no reports of injuries. Israel's army said Sunday at least eight rockets were fired towards central areas of the country from Rafah, with strikes targeting the commercial hub of Tel Aviv for the first time in months. Fighting has recently centred on Rafah, where Israel's military launched a ground operation in early May despite widespread opposition over concerns for civilians sheltering there. Netanyahu vowed to pursue Israel's offensive ahead of a war cabinet meeting amid intense diplomacy to forge a truce and a hostage-release deal. The October 7 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people Palestinians inspect the damage after an Israeli army raid on a camp at an area designated for displaced people in Rafah Hamas militants took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead, from Israel He has long rejected Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the conflict triggered by the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack. A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the war cabinet would 'discuss a hostage release deal' on Sunday. Before the meeting, Netanyahu's office said Hamas's chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, 'continues to demand the end of the war, the withdrawal of the IDF from the Gaza Strip and leaving Hamas in place, so that it will be able to carry out the atrocities of October 7 again and again'. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu strongly opposes this,' a statement said. EU members Ireland and Spain, and also Norway, have said they will recognise a Palestinian state from Tuesday, drawing furious Israeli condemnation. 'In order to make peace, we need a strong Palestinian Authority, not a weaker one,' said the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who met in Brussels with Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa. Palestinians gather at the site of an Israeli strike on a camp area housing internally displaced people in Rafah Around 80 per cent of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes As the war grinds on, the families of hostages still held by militants have piled pressure on Netanyahu to secure a deal to free them Mustafa, whose government is based in the occupied West Bank, said the 'first priority' was to support the people in Gaza, especially through a ceasefire, and then 'rebuilding the institutions of the Palestinian Authority' in the territory after Hamas seized it from the PA in 2007. The Israeli official had said Saturday that 'there is an intention to renew these talks this week' after negotiations involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators stalled in early May. Read More Israel pummels Gaza including Rafah just a DAY after top UN court ordered IDF to halt its invasion of the southern city Around 80 per cent of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. Hamas triggered the war with its October 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,984 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. As the war grinds on, the families of hostages still held by militants have piled pressure on Netanyahu to secure a deal to free them. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel must take over Rafah to eliminate Hamas' remaining battalions and achieve 'total victory' over the militants, who recently regrouped in other parts of Gaza where the military has operated.

        "content": "Water access at all San Clemente beaches was closed Monday due to “aggressive shark behavior,” according to city officials. The Memorial Day edict came after a shark knocked a surfer off their board Sunday evening. The ocean will remain closed until 8 p.m. Monday night, pending no additional shark sightings, according to the city. Beaches in the Orange County city are still open, but visitors will not be able to wade into the waves or swim. A San Clemente lifeguard first received a report of a shark encounter at the popular surfing destination T-Street Beach just before 8 p.m., according to San Clemente Marine Safety Lt. Sean Staudenbaur. “The surfer and one other surfer were sitting on their boards waiting for a wave when they saw a dark gray object approach and knock one of the surfers off their surfboard,” Staudenbaur said. The surfers then came to the shore and reported the incident, at which point officials made the decision to close water access for 24 hours. Staudenbaur said it was “unusual” for a shark to get that close to a surfer, noting that “the majority of our shark sightings are just sightings where there’s no signs of aggressive behavior.” A photo taken by San Clemente lifeguards and shared with The Times showed damage to the surfboard, with two indentations near the tip of the board where the shark was thought to have knocked it. “We have pretty-good-sized crowds on the beach, obviously not in the water today, but it is typically one of our busier weekends of the year,” Staudenbaur said of San Clemente beaches Monday.",

        "description": "Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the Chicago Cubs hired him away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos.",
        "content": "MILWAUKEE (AP) — Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos. A brief pregame video showcased some highlights from Counsell’s tenure as Milwaukee’s manager before displaying him wearing a Brewers cap alongside the message, “Thank You No. 30.” Brewers fans booed throughout the video, and then booed again when he was introduced as the Cubs’ manager. “Look, cheer, boo, whatever, man,” Counsell said before the game when asked about what kind of reception he expected. “Just have a good time at the game. That’s what fans get to do. Just have a good time. It’s Memorial Day. You don’t have to work today Let’s all have a good time.” Counsell did receive a little applause from the substantial portion of Cubs fans in attendance — Cubs-Brewers games in Milwaukee generally have a pretty even split of supporters for both teams — but the cheers were drowned out by the boos. Counsell managed the Brewers to five playoff appearances and set franchise records in wins and games managed before the Cubs lured him away with a five-year deal worth more than $40 million. This wasn’t the first time Counsell had managed against his former team — the Cubs won two of three against the Brewers at Wrigley Field from May 3-5 — but it was his first time in Milwaukee. Ryan Hoffman, a Brewers fan from Burlington, Wisconsin, said he planned to “boo a little bit” and said he made sure to get tickets for this game because it marked Counsell’s return. “We wanted to be here for this, make sure we let our opinion be heard a little bit,” Hoffman said. Counsell had managed the Brewers since May 2015 and led the franchise on its greatest run of sustained success while posting a 707-625 record. who managed Counsell during his college career at Notre Dame and later served as his longtime bench coach in Milwaukee, replaced him as the Brewers’ manager. “Twenty years from now, we’ll all look back at this and Craig will be recognized as a big part of the Brewers,” Murphy said. “What he feels today, he’ll go through a lot of emotions, but he’s getting his ballclub ready to compete.” Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich downplayed the hoopla surrounding the manager’s return to Milwaukee. This four-game series also pits the NL Central’s top teams against each other; the Brewers entered Monday leading the Cubs by 31⁄2 games. “Obviously a lot of good memories here with Couns,” the 2018 NL MVP said. “In our minds, it’s no different than a player leaving in free agency. He earned the right to do what he wanted to do, go to the highest bidder. I’m happy for him. I’ve still got a great relationship with him.” Plenty of Brewers fans weren’t nearly as forgiving. “People feel betrayed,” Jake Starck, of East Troy, Wisconsin, said while wearing a Brewers Jackson Chourio jersey. “I get it. Go get your money. Go do what you want to do. But there’s a whole rivalry. He grew up here. I just feel it’s going to be this way for a while.” Counsell’s ties to Milwaukee preceded his managerial tenure. He grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, as the son of former Brewers director of community affairs John Counsell. The former second baseman played for the Brewers in 2004 and again from 2007-11. Counsell was asked Monday if he had ever envisioned making this kind of move before he actually left the Brewers for Chicago. “Life takes different turns, man,” Counsell said. “I don’t want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. I don’t make plans like that. You’ve got to take the ride of life, man, and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you’ve got to jump on the ride and go.” Counsell's background made it for Brewers fans when he left for a division rival just 90 miles away. Counsell said he understands why some fans might have been angry. “It’s not my job to tell people how to feel about something,” he said. “Figure it out, let people feel how they want to feel, and I’m good with it. I think it doesn’t have to be all positive. \"We’re in a public job. We’re in a job with fans. Fans are allowed to feel however they want to feel. ... It bothers you initially, of course. Some things that happen bother you, for sure. But as it goes on, some of it’s, you’re a fan and you get to feel how you want to feel. You’re entitled to that as a fan. I’m good with that, I think that’s part of it and it’s part of what makes sports fun.”",

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press Fort Nelson, B.C. evacuees gather at the North Peace Arena in Fort St. John , B.C., on Monday, May 13, 2024. Residents in Fort Nelson are able to go home today after being evacuated for more than two weeks due to wildfires. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jesse Boily The Parker Lake wildfire near Fort Nelson, B.C., is now classified as \"being held\" as residents start returning home, more than two weeks after the fire forced thousands to evacuate the community. The BC Wildfire Service says rain on Sunday and the efforts of firefighters mean the 123-square-kilometre fire in the northeast corner of the province is not expected to grow. But the blaze hasn't been extinguished and the service says it expects parts of it to continue burning into the fall. The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation jointly rescinded evacuation orders at 8 a.m., lifting roadblocks and clearing the way for people to go home, 17 days after they were ordered to flee. A statement from the municipality says the community has been deemed safe to re-enter but there are still active fires in the area. An evacuation alert, requiring people to be ready to leave at short notice, is now in place. About 4,700 residents were forced to leave their homes in Fort Nelson on May 10, when strong winds pushed the Parker Lake wildfire within a few kilometres of the town. The fire destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties in the area. The municipality said several properties are not safe for the general public. An order is in place limiting access to those properties to only property owners, their designates or other permitted personnel. The municipality said residents arriving home would have access to free cleaning kits provided by the Red Cross. A statement from Northern Health said emergency services at Fort Nelson General Hospital are resuming. \"The hospital’s emergency department is reopening Monday morning with limited laboratory and medical imaging supports. Other departments will resume services in the weeks ahead,\" the statement said. The health authority said people requiring in-patient care will continue to be transferred to other facilities in the northeast. Wildfire crews are also fighting the Patry Creek fire about 25 kilometres north of town, which is a holdover fire that was initially ignited by lightning in July 2023. The regional municipality's mayor, Rob Fraser, has asked residents to be patient as they navigate what's expected to be heavy traffic on the highway between Fort Nelson and Fort St. John, 380 kilometres to the south, where many of the evacuees have been staying. The latest data provided by BC Wildfire Service lists 113 active wildfires in the province, 102 of which are in the northeast. In a video update posted online Sunday, Hugh Murdoch, an incident commander working out of Fort Nelson, said there is a \"tremendous amount of fire\" in the region, with about 2,500 square kilometres burning in the Northern Peace complex. Murdoch said 130 firefighters are working on the Parker Lake and Patry Creek fires, along with 11 pieces of heavy equipment and 19 helicopters. \"The summer is going to be a long one, I think. It's had an early start again and there seems to be just so much fire on the landscape so early,\" he said. \"And it's not just lightning that's going to give us our starts, but these holdover fires from the previous year (are) another source that's giving us a lot of challenges.\"",

        "content": "Max Purcell: Aussie star calls tennis a 's**t sport' after incredible brain explosion sees him lose at French Open despite having SIX match points Max Purcell lost five-setter to Germany's Henri Squire Aussie launched comeback before making shock move By Ian Chadband For Australian Associated Press Published: 22:38, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:38, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Australia's tale of Roland Garros woe has plumbed new depths with Max Purcell missing out on six match points before finally losing his first-round match in bewildering fashion following a stirring comeback. But the shattered Purcell, who defended how he delivered an underarm serve on one of his failed match points against qualifier Henri Squire, was adamant after his five-set reverse that he had 'no regrets', even while reflecting on what a 's**t' sport tennis can be. The Sydneysider 's agonising exit to the German grand slam newcomer on Monday left the green-and-gold contingent at 0-6 - five defeats and an injury withdrawal - after two days with the women's challenge already over following Daria Saville's earlier 6-3 6-4 loss to Jasmine Paolini on Monday. Max Purcell said he had no regrets about taking the bizarre decision to hit an underarm serve on his fifth match point - only to eventually lose in five sets to Henri Squires in Paris 'That's tennis, it's a s**t sport, you don't always win when you're winning,' Purcell said after dropping his first-round French Open match It will be the first time since 1997 there'll be no Australian woman in the second round of the Paris slam following Ajla Tomljanovic's exit on Sunday. Yet Purcell looked as if would finally break the men's drought when rallying from two sets down against big-hitting Squire and twice served for the match on the verge of his first five-set win. He'd be forgiven if what happened next haunted him for the rest of his tennis days. He failed to convert four match points when serving at 5-4 but then, having broken Squire again to serve at 6-5, earned a fifth match point, only to take the fateful decision to serve underarm. 'I do it a lot in practice, it's worth going for it - absolutely,' Purcell said. 'No regrets - hindsight's a s**t thing, isn't it? No just take the positives, learn from them - I hate living in the past.' A tired backhand into the net from Purcell saw him go down in a gruelling encounter that lasted three hours and 21 minutes Squire caught on to the underarm ruse quickly and won the point, leaving the 25-year-old Purcell's head understandably scrambled as he then served a double fault and screwed a backhand wide, taking the contest into a super tiebreaker In a nail-biter, Purcell fought back once more from 9-7 to rescue two match points and earned a sixth himself which the German saved, but, eventually, a tired backhand into the net enabled Squire to prevail after three hours and 21 minutes. Asked how he'd get over it, Purcell just shrugged: 'I'll go practice tomorrow, then doubles the next day. The game keeps going, it's fine. 'I'm proud of the way that I fought, I should have walked off with the spoils, but that's tennis, it's a s*** sport, you don't always win when you're winning.' That was something positive for Purcell to take from a match, interrupted by two rain breaks, in which qualifier Squire was 'playing lights out' for two sets. 'I wished he'd just open his eyes,' smiled Purcell ruefully. Germany's Henri Squires (pictured) is ranked 221 in the world won through at his first appearance at a Grand Slam Earlier, Saville fought valiantly against rising star Paolini, but her second-set fightback from 5-1 to the verge of 5-4 fell agonisingly short, after it was interrupted by an hour's rain delay that halted her momentum. But the 30-year-old Australian No.1 didn't complain, bemoaning only that she served so poorly, holding her delivery just once in eight attempts while also gifting nine double faults. 'I felt like the whole match was actually a lot closer than maybe the scoreline suggested,' said Saville, 'but I struggled with the serve, and it cost me, especially in the first set.' 'But at 5-4 on that return game, I made four unforced forehand errors, trying to dictate but missing. I'm okay with that, though, because I think I took a chance, but it just didn't work out.'

        "content": "Simon Cowell's Britain's Got Talent Golden Buzzer act Duo Stardust given axe as he savages them after their live semi-final performance despite previously leaving him impressed By Owen Tonks For Mailonline Published: 22:25, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:38, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Simon Cowell 's Britain's Got Talent Golden Buzzer act were given the boot during the first live semi-final of the show on Monday after he savagely turned on them. Viewers were stunned as he told Ukranian stunt roller skaters Duo Stardust he was disappointed in their performance, prompting series fans to ask if the seemingly mellowed talent show judge's acid tongue had returned. Married couple Vlada and Yevhenii were voted by Simon as his second Golden Buzzer act during Sunday's episode but they were kicked out of the competition by the viewing public after they failed to get enough votes on Monday. Their first audition in front of the judges - Simon, Amanda Holden , Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli - involved Yevhenii spinning Vlada around by her ankles while circling on his skates, before they were hoisted into the air on a high-wire as fireworks on the back of Vlada's skates lit up the theatre. During Monday's live semi-final, viewers took to social media to say the pair were their winners but Simon held a different opinion, saying he felt let down despite them flinging panellist Bruno into the air as part of their act. Simon Cowell's Britain's Got Talent Golden Buzzer act were given the boot during the first live semi-final of the show on Monday after he savagely turned on them Viewers were stunned as he told Ukranian skaters Duo Stardust he was disappointed in their performance, prompting fans to ask if the seemingly mellowed judge's acid tongue was back Simon said: 'This was great. It wasn't as good as the audition though.' As the audience booed him, Simon continued: 'I'm disappointed and I'll tell you why. I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight which is a real shame.' Taking to social media, viewers asked if Simon would be bringing back the frequent harsh comments he made on BGT and other talent shows, while others were stunned that Duo Stardust had exited the contest. One person wrote on Twitter: 'Simon saying that about his OWN golden buzzer act. Is the old Simon coming back??' While someone else posted: 'Never seen Simon turn on his golden buzzer act like that before.' Another shocked viewer wrote: 'Simon slagging off his golden buzzer act.' While someone else commented: 'I actually agree with Simon it wasn’t as good as audition.' Someone else shared: 'Yeah Simon is right duo stardust his golden buzzer it wasn’t as good as the first time round due to the stage production. I felt the same, but both do have talent.' Married couple Vlada and Yevhenii were voted by Simon as his second Golden Buzzer act during Sunday's episode They were kicked out of the competition by the viewing public after they failed to get enough votes on Monday The pair brought show judge Bruno Tonioli on stage and flung him into the air as part of their semi-final act but they did not win enough votes from viewers to continue in the competition However, someone else remarked: 'Na not having that... #DuoStardust should of been in top 3. #BGT #BritainsGotTalent.' 'I'm amazed DuoStardust are going home,' declared another show fan. 'Such a shame for Duo Stardust - things didn't go well for them tonight. Their audition was great as well,' wrote someone else. After six weeks of Britain's Got Talent auditions, the live semi-finals kicked off on Monday as eight acts competed with one another in the hope of landing themselves a valuable place in Sunday’s grand finale. A further eight entrants will feature each night of the week before the final, with two acts from each evening making it through – one decided from a public vote and the second decided by the judges. The winner will get a life-changing £250,000 cash prize and a spot on the bill of the Royal Variety Performance. The eight acts who performed on Monday night were Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, Stardust and Innocent Massuki. Also performing on Monday night’s show was the West End cast of Disney’s award-winning musical The Lion King. During Monday's live semi-final, viewers took to social media to say the pair were their winners but Simon held a different opinion It comes after Simon and Amanda's children pushed the golden buzzer on Britain's Got Talent as the auditions for the series came to an end on Sunday. During the episode, Japanese skipping dancers Haribow, who somersaulted across the stage doing various tricks, left the judges almost speechless. They received a standing ovation from the audience and numerous pleas for a golden buzzer, which would put them straight through to the semi-finals and are generally used only by the judges and hosts, from the BGT fans. Alesha said she had 'none left' regarding the buzzers along with Bruno, while Simo said that he 'did not know what to say'. 'My son is literally going crazy right now,' Simon added. Simon Cowell let his son Eric and Amanda Holden's daughter Hollie gatecrash the Britain's Got Talent auditions on Sunday as they both smashed the Golden Buzzer Simon said he had 'never heard a reaction like that before' before gesturing to his son Eric, 10, to push the button after Japanese skipping dancers Haribow auditioned The audience went wild after Japanese skipping act Haribow took to the stage Haribow, a group of performers from Japan, all aged between 22 and 24, performed street dance while skipping on jump ropes His son Eric, who he shares with wife Lauren Silverman, then went over and pushed the buzzer along with Amanda's daughter Hollie, who she shares with record producer husband Chris Hughes. 'They pressed it for the audience,' Amanda said before calling the dancers 'unbelievable'. Congratulating the dance troupe, host Dec told them: 'That's never happened before.'

        "content": "The ITV talent show kicked off on Monday with the first live semi-final featuring judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli, alongside presenters Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. A public vote saw singer Masuku automatically through to the final, while the judges voted for Ssaulabi Performance Troupe over dog act The Trickstars to continue to compete for the £250,000 prize and a spot at the Royal Variety Performance. They're going to need a big broom after that 🧹🔥 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/bVlRvy5bG5 — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 The South Korean taekwondo group, who were McPartlin and Donnelly’s golden buzzer act, said they practise five hours a day and received all four votes from the judges to make the final after their “cinematic blockbuster” live performance. “If that was a movie, that would have taken about a week to shoot literally, it would,” Cowell said of their performance. “And the fact that you did the whole thing live in about two-and-a-half minutes, says everything about you. “I forget how many years we’ve been doing this now actually, but this is actually one of the best live show performances I’ve ever seen on this show.” Meanwhile, South African opera singer Masuku, who wowed the judges in his January audition before getting married, said “this is my year” after winning a spot on the bill for the final. Innocent Masuku's voice holds so much power. Goosebumps!✨ #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/t3qTyljVqM — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 Dixon described him as “the one to beat”, while Tonioli said his act was “flawless”. Cowell said: “How snobby classical music is, I mean it really is, it is just awful and you deserve this opportunity because you are incredibly talented, you performed like a lead, you have that presence about you and your control over the song, everything about it for me was immaculate.” The first live semi-final of this year saw Lucy Heath and her five dogs perform as The Trickstars to the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory themed dance. The dog trainer made the final of the talent show eight years ago, but missed a spot in the final line-up following the judges’ unanimous vote. “I genuinely think your act has got better over the years,” Cowell said, adding he “loved it, loved it, loved it”. Now *this* is a Wonka Experience! 🍫🐾 #BGT pic.twitter.com/tmoYC5XWNA — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 Tonioli described the act as “charming” while Holden said “you really are the golden ticket”, referencing the Roald Dahl classic book and film. Comedian Bikoon! was up next but saw Dixon, Tonioli and Holden press their red buzzer as his “magic” bag failed several times to perform a simple trick. Cowell was visibly upset at the end of the performance when the magic bag opened to reveal a man inside, to which McPartlin joked the pair were a “Japanese Ant & Dec”. Imagine explaining that at customs... 🧳 #BGT pic.twitter.com/riOM9USLjt — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 “I’m really upset, I think the bag should have remained a mystery,” Cowell said. Holden and Dixon also pressed their red buzzer for air guitar act Sven Smith. “Call me old-fashioned but I prefer a guitar and a microphone,” Dixon said, while Holden questioned his place in the semi-final. Tonioli’s golden buzzer recipient Taryn Charles received a much warmer response from the judges, after the singer performed a rendition of Lose Control by Teddy Swims. Cowell described it as a “genius choice of song”, adding: “I genuinely don’t think you could have done any more”, as well as calling it “beautifully raw”. We can't help but Lose Control whenever we hear Taryn's vocals 😱🤩 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/Y3h0mOzSxu — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 However, the judge was less impressed with his own golden buzzer act, rollerskating couple Duo Stardust from Ukraine. “It wasn’t as good as the audition, I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight which is a real shame – we lost the focus of you,” he said. The pair finished their performance picking Tonioli from the panel and spinning him high into the air, which he described as “scary”. Meanwhile, Cowell said he preferred the first half of 11-year-old dancer Trey Braine’s performance, but also revealed he recently used the schoolboy to exemplify “someone I believe has star potential – when you’ve got it, you’ve got it”. “You’re naturally cool, naturally stylish, I really believe great things are going to happen in your life and your career,” he said. The cast of Disney’s The Lion King also performed on the show, to celebrate 30 years since the release of the film.",

They're going to need a big broom after that 🧹🔥 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/bVlRvy5bG5 — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 The South Korean taekwondo group, who were McPartlin and Donnelly’s golden buzzer act, said they practise five hours a day and received all four votes from the judges to make the final after their “cinematic blockbuster” live performance. “If that was a movie, that would have taken about a week to shoot literally, it would,” Cowell said of their performance. “And the fact that you did the whole thing live in about two-and-a-half minutes, says everything about you. “I forget how many years we’ve been doing this now actually, but this is actually one of the best live show performances I’ve ever seen on this show.” Meanwhile, South African opera singer Masuku, who wowed the judges in his January audition before getting married, said “this is my year” after winning a spot on the bill for the final. Innocent Masuku's voice holds so much power. Goosebumps!✨ #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/t3qTyljVqM — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 Dixon described him as “the one to beat”, while Tonioli said his act was “flawless”. Cowell said: “How snobby classical music is, I mean it really is, it is just awful and you deserve this opportunity because you are incredibly talented, you performed like a lead, you have that presence about you and your control over the song, everything about it for me was immaculate.” The first live semi-final of this year saw Lucy Heath and her five dogs perform as The Trickstars to the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory themed dance. The dog trainer made the final of the talent show eight years ago, but missed a spot in the final line-up following the judges’ unanimous vote. “I genuinely think your act has got better over the years,” Cowell said, adding he “loved it, loved it, loved it”. Now *this* is a Wonka Experience! 🍫🐾 #BGT pic.twitter.com/tmoYC5XWNA — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 Tonioli described the act as “charming” while Holden said “you really are the golden ticket”, referencing the Roald Dahl classic book and film. Comedian Bikoon! was up next but saw Dixon, Tonioli and Holden press their red buzzer as his “magic” bag failed several times to perform a simple trick. Cowell was visibly upset at the end of the performance when the magic bag opened to reveal a man inside, to which McPartlin joked the pair were a “Japanese Ant & Dec”. Imagine explaining that at customs... 🧳 #BGT pic.twitter.com/riOM9USLjt — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 “I’m really upset, I think the bag should have remained a mystery,” Cowell said. Holden and Dixon also pressed their red buzzer for air guitar act Sven Smith. “Call me old-fashioned but I prefer a guitar and a microphone,” Dixon said, while Holden questioned his place in the semi-final. Tonioli’s golden buzzer recipient Taryn Charles received a much warmer response from the judges, after the singer performed a rendition of Lose Control by Teddy Swims. Cowell described it as a “genius choice of song”, adding: “I genuinely don’t think you could have done any more”, as well as calling it “beautifully raw”. We can't help but Lose Control whenever we hear Taryn's vocals 😱🤩 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent pic.twitter.com/Y3h0mOzSxu — BGT (@BGT) May 27, 2024 However, the judge was less impressed with his own golden buzzer act, rollerskating couple Duo Stardust from Ukraine. “It wasn’t as good as the audition, I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight which is a real shame – we lost the focus of you,” he said. The pair finished their performance picking Tonioli from the panel and spinning him high into the air, which he described as “scary”. Meanwhile, Cowell said he preferred the first half of 11-year-old dancer Trey Braine’s performance, but also revealed he recently used the schoolboy to exemplify “someone I believe has star potential – when you’ve got it, you’ve got it”. “You’re naturally cool, naturally stylish, I really believe great things are going to happen in your life and your career,” he said. The cast of Disney’s The Lion King also performed on the show, to celebrate 30 years since the release of the film. Britain’s Got Talent live semi-finals will air each day until Friday at 8pm, with Sunday’s final at 7.30pm on ITV1 and ITVX.",

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Sticking to its April forecast, India Meteorological Department Monday predicted 'above normal' monsoon rainfall across the country in general, and over the monsoon core zone (which depends on rain-fed agriculture) in particular, during the June-Sept rainy season, giving a positive signal to the economy . There is a forecast probability of 61% for the country to get 'above normal' monsoon rainfall. However, most parts of northwest India will not get respite from the scorching heat in June even as there is a brief relief after three days due to western disturbances with IMD expecting a minimum four to six days of heatwave in the region next month. Many other parts of the country too will face normal to above normal maximum and minimum temperatures during the month. It may happen despite the normal onset of monsoon over Kerala as the possibility of its subsequent subdued progress, specifically towards northwest India, cannot be ruled out. The possibility of a rare phenomenon of the monsoon arriving in northeast India first before it hits Kerala is also not ruled out. IMD said conditions are likely to become favourable for monsoon onset over Kerala during next five days - it means monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to happen either on its normal date of arrival (June 1) or a day before.",

        "content": ". N250bn approved for upgrade of health infrastructure inadequate, Finance Minister The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Tajudeen Abbas, revealed on Monday that the 10th Assembly’s inaugural action was to declare a state of emergency on health. This declaration underscores the Assembly’s dedication to significantly enhancing the quality of life for Nigerians nationwide. The Speaker stated this during the public hearing on the establishment of 13 Teaching Hospitals, Federal Medical Centers, and other health institutions, he emphasized the importance of establishing Federal Medical Centre, Ako-Nike in Enugu State, Federal Medical Centre, Fagge in Kano State, and Federal Medical Centre, Ikole-Ekiti State. The Speaker, represented by the Minority Leader, Hon. Kingsley Chinda, emphasized the vital role of stakeholders’ contributions in the legislative process. He highlighted the House’s commitment to utilizing these inputs to enact laws aimed at ensuring good governance for our citizens, as mandated by the 1999 Constitution (as amended). “The House Committee on Health Institutions bears a weighty responsibility under both the House Standing Rules and the Constitution. Its effectiveness hinges greatly on the quality of its leadership and members. “The 10th House of Representatives, since its inception in 2023, has committed to a legislative agenda aimed at significantly enhancing the living standards of our citizens. “The significance of prioritizing health cannot be overstated, leading the House of Representatives to declare a State of Emergency in the Health Sector. “Today’s hearing aligns perfectly with our agenda, and I anticipate meaningful outcomes. Esteemed stakeholders, I encourage you to openly share your perspectives, whether supportive or critical, in a manner that fosters our unity as a nation. Let us remember, we have no other nation to call our own.” He expressed optimism that the Stakeholders’ inputs “will no doubt add to the quality of Legislations the present 10th Assembly will bequeath to our Citizenry at the end of its tenure.” In his remarks, Chairman, House Committee on Health Institutions, Hon. Amos Magaji observed that: “with our growing population, the need for reference hospitals closer to the people, particularly in rural and suburban areas, have grown critical for ensuring success of government initiatives to improve healthcare.” Hon. Magaji reiterated the House resolve to ensure that all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them of sufficient quality to be effective, without financial hardship, in line with World Health Organization’s which defined access to health as universal health coverage. “Tertiary health institutions in Nigeria provide tertiary healthcare services to complement primary and secondary care in the national healthcare system. So far, the government’s role in developing and expanding hospital services in Nigeria has been commendable, with responsibility for one teaching hospital in each state of the federation. “However, in order to develop and expand the country’s training institutions and ensure an equitable distribution of health manpower, the Federal Government must balance the inequality in the distribution of tertiary institutions across the country. This need cannot be overemphasized. “The mass exodus of health workers and professionals to other countries, particularly the United Kingdom, presents a significant challenge to Nigeria’s healthcare sector. More recently, there has been an enormous migration of doctors, purses, pharmacists, and laboratory Scientists in search of ‘greener pastures’ in Other countries, leaving Nigeria’s health sector severely understaffed. To address this challenge, the Federal Government has declared a State of emergency in the health sector, following a call from the House of Representatives. “The need to reposition the healthcare sector to meet numerous emerging Challenges is crucial to its improvement, To succeed in this era, a system that is Well invested on human resources and medical intelligence as the backbone of the health sector is required. The administrative appointment of capable persons based on merit in hospital management also has a role to play.” He explained that the Committee during the oversight functions to healthcare institutions across the country since the inauguration, undeniably witnessed infrastructural deficiencies of health services, lack of equipment resulting largely from inadequate funding of health institutions by the government, and a total lack of maintenance culture for equipment provided. Speaking on the a bill seeking to establish Federal Medical Centre, Ako-Nike, Enugu State, Hon. Paul Nnamchi disclosed that the Community of Ako-Nike has allocated 10 hectares of land for the FMC that will “provide for robust foundation for developing a state-of-the-art medical facility with ample space for future expansion. “Additionally, the Community has existing infrastructure, including reliable electricity and pipe borne water which are essential for the operation of a healthcare facility. The presence of these utilities will significantly reduce the initial setup cost and ensure that the facility can begin operations swiftly.” Also speaking on the intendment of a bill for the establishment of Federal Medical Centre in Ikole-Ekiti, Ekiti State, Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Hon. Akin Rotimi observed that Ikole-Ekiti is strategically located in Ekiti State and serves as the hub of numerous communities. “Despite this importance, it’s underserved in terms of healthcare infrastructure. The proposed FMC in Ikole will bring several transformative benefits, not only to Ikole Ekiti but several other communities around,” the House Spokesman noted While acknowledging that there are several communities in need of health centers amidst daunting financial needs facing the country, he expressed optimism that the Federal Government in consultation with the Legislature will take necessary decision. On her part, Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Professor Ali Pate disclosed that over N250 billion was approved in the 2024 financial year for infrastructure upgrade and equipment in the health sector. He added that each of the Training Institutions in the health sector has been mandated to double its intake of the number of students that they have currently. The Minister who was represented by Permanent Secretary of Federal Ministry of Health, Mrs. Daju Kachallom observed that the policy behind the establishment of FMCs is to be where there’s no Federal Teaching Hospitals. The Minister also disclosed that the Ministry is collaborating with State Governments in its quest to strengthen the General Hospitals and Specialist Hospitals with a view to strengthen the two-way referral system in the health sector. “The Minister, represented by the Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Health, Mrs. Daju Kachallom, highlighted the rationale behind the establishment of Federal Medical Centres (FMCs) – to fill gaps where Federal Teaching Hospitals are absent. Furthermore, the Minister revealed ongoing collaborations between the Ministry and State Governments to enhance both General and Specialist Hospitals. This initiative aims to bolster the two-way referral system within the healthcare sector.” Minister of Finance, Mr. Wale Edun, represented by Mallam Musa Umaru, noted that the proposed establishment of the 13 health institutions coincides with a period of financial constraint for the country. He emphasized that funding and personnel remain critical considerations for the establishment of these institutions.",

        "description": "The new ‘triple lock plus’ would ensure pensioners’ tax free allowance rises in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%.",
        "content": "The Prime Minister will announce on Tuesday that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock, as he continues the Conservatives’ election campaign. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners’ tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the “triple lock plus”, the policy is estimated to cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30, a price tag which mirrors Mr Sunak’s proposed national service duty for all 18-year-olds, billed at £2.5 billion a year. The tax cut will be funded through a previously announced plan to raise £6 billion a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. For individual pensioners, it would be worth around £100 in 2025 according to the Tories, and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension. The policy follows criticism of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance by 2p at the spring budget, after a similar cut in the autumn. State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Mr Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.”",

State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Mr Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.”",

In late April, less than a month before the May 29 national election, Zackie Achmat, who is running to become one of the first-ever independent lawmakers in South Africa's National Assembly, gathered his core staff and organizers at his campaign headquarters in downtown Cape Town to implore them to take some time off. \"Most of you have been here, doing this for more than a year,\" he told the room, a group that ranged from those young enough to be first-time voters to those old enough to have grown up under apartheid. He reminded them that the election was not an end point but—if he won—a moment of transition. They were not just running a campaign; they were building a movement that would need to last through Achmat's five-year term. Mandla Majola, who has been organizing alongside Achmat for more than two decades, spoke up from the back of the conference room: \"This is the failure of many activists. We're good at taking care of others but fail to take care of ourselves.\" His choice of words was revealing. As Achmat broke the team into groups to discuss steps they could take to protect their health, it was no longer obvious whether this was a campaign meeting or a lesson in movement organizing. For Achmat, there was no reason it couldn't be both. One of the most successful activists in South African history, Achmat crusaded against apartheid and, after the country's democratic transition in 1994, to secure LGBTQ+ equality. He drew international attention in the late 1990s when he launched the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a grassroots movement that helped win affordable access to HIV treatment globally.

Today, President Joe Biden will host Kenyan President William Ruto. Ruto is the first African head of state to be honored with an official state visit in 15 years and follows state visits from the leaders of France, South Korea, Australia, India, and Japan—all increasingly important geopolitical partners. President Ruto's visit does not simply represent America's renewed commitment to the African continent, a promise President Biden made almost two years ago at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. Tightening U.S.-Kenya relations is also about building and safeguarding a more resilient global economy led by the United States. Investing in emerging economies like Kenya is an insurance policy against geopolitical shocks, namely from China and Russia. In recent weeks, the focus of the insurance policy has been America's domestic industrial strategy, specifically the Biden administration's latest round of tariffs on selected imports from China. But the strategy is global in nature, and must be understood that way. As Biden's top national security advisor Jake Sullivan put it in his landmark speech at the Brookings Institution last year, \"it isn't feasible or desirable to build everything domestically. Our objective is not autarky—it's resilience and security in our supply chains.\" Building a resilient economy that can withstand geopolitical shocks cannot happen in a vacuum—reliable partners need to be part of that equation. America's industrial policy will increasingly rely on \"friendshoring\" global supply chains, which means financing efforts overseas in \"friendly\" countries to help make strategic supply chains in the U.S. more resilient and less reliant on countries...

Last October, Germany's ambassador to Tunisia, Peter Prügel, sparked controversy while speaking at the opening of a new secondary school in the suburbs of Tunis. After Tunisia's education minister expressed solidarity with Gaza during the event, Prügel described Israelis as victims of \"Palestinian terror,\" a reference to Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel. The education minister angrily objected, asserting that the ambassador's words ran contrary to Tunisia's position on the Israel-Hamas war, and Prügel left the event in a hurry. Online, some Tunisians soon claimed that Prügel had justified Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. The embassy insisted that Prügel had expressed sympathy for all victims, but said that \"we could not ignore that this escalation was caused by Hamas's barbaric terror attack on Israel.\" Days later, demonstrators gathered outside the German Embassy to demand Prügel's resignation. Protests against Israel's war in Gaza had already targeted the U.S. and French embassies in Tunis, but this was the first time they had turned their ire toward Germany. German tabloid Bild described criticism of Prügel as a \"hate attack\" and reminded its readers that the new school, partly funded by Germany's development bank, was only opened thanks to the country's generosity. For decades, Germany has sought to reconcile a perceived historic responsibility to Israel with a cordial relationship toward the Arab world.

'Militaristic Mentality' Beijing launched \"punishment\" drills near Taiwan on Thursday in response to what it called Taipei's \"separatist acts.\" The exercises come just three days after Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te urged Beijing in his inauguration speech to stop threatening the island. Dubbed Joint Sword, the military exercises include the Chinese army, navy, air force, and rocket force, and are set to run for two days, with a possibility of follow-ups. This is the first time that China has simulated a full-scale attack, Taiwanese military experts said, rather than an economic blockade. \"I need to stress that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. \"This is both a fact based on history and the true status quo. This will not change in the future. Taiwan independence is doomed to fail.\" China's military said the mock strikes targeted \"high-value military\" sites of the \"enemy.\" Beijing does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty and has repeatedly denounced Lai for his past pro-independence comments. But Lai has softened his stance in recent years, offering talks with Beijing that China has rejected. \"I hope that China will face the reality of [Taiwan's] existence; respect the choices of the people of Taiwan; and in good faith, choose dialogue over confrontation, exchange over containment, and under the principles of parity and dignity, engage in cooperation with the legal government chosen by Taiwan's people,\" Lai said during his inauguration speech on Monday.

The thunderous applause that followed the vote marked both a celebration of international support for Palestinians and a protest against Israel and the United States. Yet that vote was mostly symbolic. Full membership must first be approved by the U.N. Security Council, where the United States holds veto power. Back in 2011, the mere threat of an American veto sufficed to kill Palestine's application for U.N. membership, but this April the Biden administration was obliged to cast the single vote that blocked Palestinian statehood. America's official position is that Palestinian statehood should be achieved through negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. This stance is particularly ironic considering that the United States was the first government to recognize Israel in 1948, despite President Franklin D. Roosevelt's earlier assurances to Saudi King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud that the United States would not intervene. Today, the Saudis... Omar M. Dajani , Mushon Zer-Aviv",

Our colleague Amy Mackinnon is currently reporting on the ground from Israel, so we've asked her to guest star in SitRep this week to share her insights. Alright, here's what's on tap for the day: The growing risks of an Israel-Hezbollah war, Russia tries to redraw the map of the Baltic Sea, the fallout from the death of Iran's president, and more. Hezbollah Threat Looms Over Northern Israel KFAR VRADIM, Israel—Standing on a hilltop in the small town of Kfar Vradim in Israel's western Galilee region, Sarit Zehavi, a former Israeli military intelligence analyst, gestures across the verdant valley on the horizon some nine kilometers to the north. Just beyond the clusters of villages that dot the mountainous region—home to Jews, Arabs, Christians, and Druze—lies Israel's northern border with Lebanon. On the other side lies one of Israel's most powerful foes: Hezbollah, the most heavily armed non-state actor in the world. Financed, equipped, and trained by Iran, the group has a vast arsenal of rockets and missiles, including anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, as well as advanced cyber-capabilities. Since the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas's ally Hezbollah has launched hundreds of mortar, missile, and rocket attacks into Israel in near-daily clashes with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Israel responded with nearly 4,000 strikes of its own, mostly with artillery and missiles, between October 2023 and March of this year, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. It is an often overlooked front that many fear still has potential to spiral into a catastrophic new war that could quickly engulf the region. \"I truly don't know where this is heading, and your bet is as...

Yet even amid this battle over slogans, the students have achieved something momentous: Their protest movement—to an unprecedented degree—has globalized the cause of protecting Palestinian lives from the onslaught of Israeli bombing and securing statehood for Palestinians. Evidence of this abounds, from the spread of protests to campuses in Europe and elsewhere to the powerful criticism of U.S. weapons aid to Israel that was conveyed in a speech given in President Joe Biden's presence at last weekend's baccalaureate ceremony at Morehouse College, one of the United States' most prestigious historically Black colleges.

        "content": "Today, President Joe Biden will host Kenyan President William Ruto. Ruto is the first African head of state to be honored with an official state visit in 15 years and follows state visits from the leaders of France, South Korea, Australia, India, and Japan—all increasingly important geopolitical partners. Today, President Joe Biden will host Kenyan President William Ruto. Ruto is the first African head of state to be honored with an official state visit in 15 years and follows state visits from the leaders of France, South Korea, Australia, India, and Japan—all increasingly important geopolitical partners. President Ruto's visit does not simply represent America's renewed commitment to the African continent, a promise President Biden made almost two years ago at the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. Tightening U.S.-Kenya relations is also about building and safeguarding a more resilient global economy led by the United States. Investing in emerging economies like Kenya is an insurance policy against geopolitical shocks, namely from China and Russia. In recent weeks, the focus of the insurance policy has been America's domestic industrial strategy, specifically the Biden administration's latest round of tariffs on selected imports from China. But the strategy is global in nature, and must be understood that way. As Biden's top national security advisor Jake Sullivan put it in his landmark speech at the Brookings Institution last year, \"it isn't feasible or desirable to build everything domestically. Our objective is not autarky—it's resilience and security in our supply chains.\" Building a resilient economy that can withstand geopolitical shocks cannot happen in a vacuum—reliable partners need to be part of that equation. America's industrial policy will increasingly rely on \"friendshoring\" global supply chains, which means financing efforts overseas in \"friendly\" countries to help make strategic supply chains in the U.S. more resilient and less reliant on countries...

Last October, Germany's ambassador to Tunisia, Peter Prügel, sparked controversy while speaking at the opening of a new secondary school in the suburbs of Tunis. After Tunisia's education minister expressed solidarity with Gaza during the event, Prügel described Israelis as victims of \"Palestinian terror,\" a reference to Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel. The education minister angrily objected, asserting that the ambassador's words ran contrary to Tunisia's position on the Israel-Hamas war, and Prügel left the event in a hurry. Online, some Tunisians soon claimed that Prügel had justified Israel's killing of civilians in Gaza. The embassy insisted that Prügel had expressed sympathy for all victims, but said that \"we could not ignore that this escalation was caused by Hamas's barbaric terror attack on Israel.\" Days later, demonstrators gathered outside the German Embassy to demand Prügel's resignation. Protests against Israel's war in Gaza had already targeted the U.S. and French embassies in Tunis, but this was the first time they had turned their ire toward Germany. German tabloid Bild described criticism of Prügel as a \"hate attack\" and reminded its readers that the new school, partly funded by Germany's development bank, was only opened thanks to the country's generosity. For decades, Germany has sought to reconcile a perceived historic responsibility to Israel with a cordial relationship toward the Arab world.

For the first time since the end of apartheid in South Africa, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party is poised to lose its governing majority. While corruption and poverty are often cited for the setback the ANC is expected to face in elections later this month, its electoral fate is also closely tied to its performance on land issues. Despite the fact that the country has urbanized and its economy no longer revolves around land, delivering land to Black South Africans remains a yardstick against which ANC performance is measured. Land has deep symbolic meaning as an acute material loss before and during the apartheid era and as hope for a more inclusive and just future. As Nelson Mandela put it in 1995, \"With freedom and democracy, came restoration of the right to land. And with it the opportunity to address the effects of centuries of dispossession and denial.\" When apartheid rule crumbled in 1994, a small white minority held most of the farmland in the country, while 13 million Blacks, most of whose ancestors had suffered forced removals from their land, were packed into rural settlements at the fringes of the economy that the apartheid regime cynically labeled \"homelands.\" That marginalization fueled inequality and deep resentment. Blacks were far removed from the centers of political and economic power, and the lands they were removed to were overcrowded and of poor quality. The incoming ANC vowed to return people to the land that had belonged to them. The ANC initially promised to reallocate 30 percent of the country's agricultural land, amounting to about 60 million acres, to redress racially based... Michael Albertus",

The book cover for Immediacy: Or the Style of too Late Capitalism by Anna Kornbluh Working from within a Marxist intellectual tradition, Kornbluh deconstructs the hegemonic cultural style—our seeming addiction for immediacy, presence, and experience—by probing its formal features and identifying them in particular media practices across five short chapters. But Immediacy is more than diagnosis: It's a call to intellectual arms on behalf of mediation—the marginalized cultural style that expounds, dislodges, mixes, relates, and develops. Everything, in other words, that the dominant cultural style of immediacy attempts to close off as a possibility. The stakes are high—politically, ethically, and historically.

Though it's only May, the best bet for the Northern Hemisphere's summer is Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, the fifth film in Australian auteur George Miller's survey of post-apocalyptic society, with a primary emphasis on explosions, dust storms, frothing madmen with metallic codpieces screaming at one another, and motor vehicles challenging the basic laws of physics. As with the other entries in this franchise, the action sequences in Furiosa operate at the highest level of cinematic craft, and the chaotic production design brims with playfulness and creativity. And there is, thankfully, a smidgen, a soupçon, of intellect to the story, set as it is in a world turned violent during a time of immense scarcity. Put bluntly, if one must watch automobiles smash into one another at preposterous speeds, one should at least do it thoughtfully. On the off chance that you've missed out on Australia's finest export since the eucalyptus cough drop, the good news is that you don't really need to have seen any of the other Mad Max movies to \"get\" this one.

For the first time since the end of apartheid in South Africa, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party is poised to lose its governing majority. While corruption and poverty are often cited for the setback the ANC is expected to face in elections later this month, its electoral fate is also closely tied to its performance on land issues. Despite the fact that the country has urbanized and its economy no longer revolves around land, delivering land to Black South Africans remains a yardstick against which ANC performance is measured. Land has deep symbolic meaning as an acute material loss before and during the apartheid era and as hope for a more inclusive and just future. As Nelson Mandela put it in 1995, \"With freedom and democracy, came restoration of the right to land. And with it the opportunity to address the effects of centuries of dispossession and denial.\" When apartheid rule crumbled in 1994, a small white minority held most of the farmland in the country, while 13 million Blacks, most of whose ancestors had suffered forced removals from their land, were packed into rural settlements at the fringes of the economy that the apartheid regime cynically labeled \"homelands.\" That marginalization fueled inequality and deep resentment. Blacks were far removed from the centers of political and economic power, and the lands they were removed to were overcrowded and of poor quality. The incoming ANC vowed to return people to the land that had belonged to them. The ANC initially promised to reallocate 30 percent of the country's agricultural land, amounting to about 60 million acres, to redress racially based... Michael Albertus",

She also offers a fresh lens through which to consider how our compulsion for immediacy is also fatally distorting our political life. The book cover for Immediacy: Or the Style of too Late Capitalism by Anna Kornbluh Working from within a Marxist intellectual tradition, Kornbluh deconstructs the hegemonic cultural style—our seeming addiction for immediacy, presence, and experience—by probing its formal features and identifying them in particular media practices across five short chapters. But Immediacy is more than diagnosis: It's a call to intellectual arms on behalf of mediation—the marginalized cultural style that expounds, dislodges, mixes, relates, and develops. Everything, in other words, that the dominant cultural style of immediacy attempts to close off as a possibility. The stakes are high—politically, ethically, and historically. Much of what Kornbluh is up to in her book is a mediating of immediacy—an examination of... Gregory Jones-Katz",

The helicopter crash that claimed the lives of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and six others has introduced a new crisis for Iran amid regional turmoil and continued severe U.S. sanctions. This event raises questions about the Islamic Republic's ability to navigate the transition of its presidency at a time of widespread public discontent and a struggling economy. The reaction to Raisi's death within Iran has been deeply polarized, reflecting the country's divisions across social and political ideologies as well as levels of religiosity. Many Iranians do not mourn his passing, viewing him as a symbol of repression due to his long tenure in the judiciary, his involvement in the mass executions of the Mujahedin-e Khalq and leftist political prisoners in 1988, and his harsh crackdown on the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" demonstrations in 2022. Conversely, there are many who genuinely grieve his death, and the funeral processions have seen massive crowds in Tabriz, Qom, Tehran, and Mashhad. Government supporters and conservative newspapers have been quick to interpret the large crowds at Raisi's funeral processions as a testament to the political system's legitimacy and popular support. One conservative analyst emphasized, in this regard, that \"[p]articipation in marches; ceremonies honoring the esteemed martyrs of the system; and political, religious, and social events such as Friday prayers has always been considered one of the prominent indicators of the revolutionaries and the devout people of the country.\" Similarly,...

Though it's only May, the best bet for the Northern Hemisphere's summer is Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, the fifth film in Australian auteur George Miller's survey of post-apocalyptic society, with a primary emphasis on explosions, dust storms, frothing madmen with metallic codpieces screaming at one another, and motor vehicles challenging the basic laws of physics. As with the other entries in this franchise, the action sequences in Furiosa operate at the highest level of cinematic craft, and the chaotic production design brims with playfulness and creativity. And there is, thankfully, a smidgen, a soupçon, of intellect to the story, set as it is in a world turned violent during a time of immense scarcity. Put bluntly, if one must watch automobiles smash into one another at preposterous speeds, one should at least do it thoughtfully. On the off chance that you've missed out on Australia's finest export since the eucalyptus cough drop, the good news is that you don't really need to have seen any of the other Mad Max movies to \"get\" this one.

In late April, less than a month before the May 29 national election, Zackie Achmat, who is running to become one of the first-ever independent lawmakers in South Africa's National Assembly, gathered his core staff and organizers at his campaign headquarters in downtown Cape Town to implore them to take some time off. \"Most of you have been here, doing this for more than a year,\" he told the room, a group that ranged from those young enough to be first-time voters to those old enough to have grown up under apartheid. He reminded them that the election was not an end point but—if he won—a moment of transition. They were not just running a campaign; they were building a movement that would need to last through Achmat's five-year term. Mandla Majola, who has been organizing alongside Achmat for more than two decades, spoke up from the back of the conference room: \"This is the failure of many activists. We're good at taking care of others but fail to take care of ourselves.\" His choice of words was revealing. As Achmat broke the team into groups to discuss steps they could take to protect their health, it was no longer obvious whether this was a campaign meeting or a lesson in movement organizing. For Achmat, there was no reason it couldn't be both. One of the most successful activists in South African history, Achmat crusaded against apartheid and, after the country's democratic transition in 1994, to secure LGBTQ+ equality. He drew international attention in the late 1990s when he launched the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a grassroots movement that helped win affordable access to HIV treatment globally.

'Militaristic Mentality' Beijing launched \"punishment\" drills near Taiwan on Thursday in response to what it called Taipei's \"separatist acts.\" The exercises come just three days after Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te urged Beijing in his inauguration speech to stop threatening the island. Dubbed Joint Sword, the military exercises include the Chinese army, navy, air force, and rocket force, and are set to run for two days, with a possibility of follow-ups. This is the first time that China has simulated a full-scale attack, Taiwanese military experts said, rather than an economic blockade. \"I need to stress that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said. \"This is both a fact based on history and the true status quo. This will not change in the future. Taiwan independence is doomed to fail.\" China's military said the mock strikes targeted \"high-value military\" sites of the \"enemy.\" Beijing does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty and has repeatedly denounced Lai for his past pro-independence comments. But Lai has softened his stance in recent years, offering talks with Beijing that China has rejected. \"I hope that China will face the reality of [Taiwan's] existence; respect the choices of the people of Taiwan; and in good faith, choose dialogue over confrontation, exchange over containment, and under the principles of parity and dignity, engage in cooperation with the legal government chosen by Taiwan's people,\" Lai said during his inauguration speech on Monday.

The thunderous applause that followed the vote marked both a celebration of international support for Palestinians and a protest against Israel and the United States. Yet that vote was mostly symbolic. Full membership must first be approved by the U.N. Security Council, where the United States holds veto power. Back in 2011, the mere threat of an American veto sufficed to kill Palestine's application for U.N. membership, but this April the Biden administration was obliged to cast the single vote that blocked Palestinian statehood. America's official position is that Palestinian statehood should be achieved through negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. This stance is particularly ironic considering that the United States was the first government to recognize Israel in 1948, despite President Franklin D. Roosevelt's earlier assurances to Saudi King Abdul Aziz ibn Saud that the United States would not intervene. Today, the Saudis... Omar M. Dajani , Mushon Zer-Aviv",

Our colleague Amy Mackinnon is currently reporting on the ground from Israel, so we've asked her to guest star in SitRep this week to share her insights. Alright, here's what's on tap for the day: The growing risks of an Israel-Hezbollah war, Russia tries to redraw the map of the Baltic Sea, the fallout from the death of Iran's president, and more. Hezbollah Threat Looms Over Northern Israel KFAR VRADIM, Israel—Standing on a hilltop in the small town of Kfar Vradim in Israel's western Galilee region, Sarit Zehavi, a former Israeli military intelligence analyst, gestures across the verdant valley on the horizon some nine kilometers to the north. Just beyond the clusters of villages that dot the mountainous region—home to Jews, Arabs, Christians, and Druze—lies Israel's northern border with Lebanon. On the other side lies one of Israel's most powerful foes: Hezbollah, the most heavily armed non-state actor in the world. Financed, equipped, and trained by Iran, the group has a vast arsenal of rockets and missiles, including anti-ship cruise missiles and surface-to-air missiles, as well as advanced cyber-capabilities. Since the Hamas attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas's ally Hezbollah has launched hundreds of mortar, missile, and rocket attacks into Israel in near-daily clashes with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Israel responded with nearly 4,000 strikes of its own, mostly with artillery and missiles, between October 2023 and March of this year, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project. It is an often overlooked front that many fear still has potential to spiral into a catastrophic new war that could quickly engulf the region. \"I truly don't know where this is heading, and your bet is as...

The helicopter crash that claimed the lives of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and six others has introduced a new crisis for Iran amid regional turmoil and continued severe U.S. sanctions. This event raises questions about the Islamic Republic's ability to navigate the transition of its presidency at a time of widespread public discontent and a struggling economy. The reaction to Raisi's death within Iran has been deeply polarized, reflecting the country's divisions across social and political ideologies as well as levels of religiosity. Many Iranians do not mourn his passing, viewing him as a symbol of repression due to his long tenure in the judiciary, his involvement in the mass executions of the Mujahedin-e Khalq and leftist political prisoners in 1988, and his harsh crackdown on the \"Women, Life, Freedom\" demonstrations in 2022. Conversely, there are many who genuinely grieve his death, and the funeral processions have seen massive crowds in Tabriz, Qom, Tehran, and Mashhad. Government supporters and conservative newspapers have been quick to interpret the large crowds at Raisi's funeral processions as a testament to the political system's legitimacy and popular support. One conservative analyst emphasized, in this regard, that \"[p]articipation in marches; ceremonies honoring the esteemed martyrs of the system; and political, religious, and social events such as Friday prayers has always been considered one of the prominent indicators of the revolutionaries and the devout people of the country.\" Similarly,...

Yet even amid this battle over slogans, the students have achieved something momentous: Their protest movement—to an unprecedented degree—has globalized the cause of protecting Palestinian lives from the onslaught of Israeli bombing and securing statehood for Palestinians. Evidence of this abounds, from the spread of protests to campuses in Europe and elsewhere to the powerful criticism of U.S. weapons aid to Israel that was conveyed in a speech given in President Joe Biden's presence at last weekend's baccalaureate ceremony at Morehouse College, one of the United States' most prestigious historically Black colleges.

        "description": "Métis Nation-Saskatchewan has developed a treaty to establish self-government for its citizens, who will get their first look at the document this summer as the organization continues negotiations with the federal government.",
        "content": "Métis citizens in Saskatchewan will vote on a new, modern treaty with Ottawa as early as this fall. The Métis Nation-Saskatchewan (MN-S) will take the proposed treaty with the federal government to its citizens across the province this summer. The governing body for Métis citizens says elders gave the treaty its name: \" Kischi mashinahikan ooschi Michi f,\" or \"The Sacred Document of the Michif.\" Years of negotiations led up to the announcement, which included a self-government implementation agreement signed in 2023. MN-S vice-president Michelle LeClair said the struggle for Métis self-determination goes back much further. \"It's 150 years in the making where our communities have fought and died for this very thing that we're doing today. It's historic and it's our time,\" LeClair said at a media event in Saskatoon on Monday. The MN-S is sending teams into communities this summer to to explain the document ahead of an all-member vote this fall. Ratification requires 75 per cent approval from voting members. \"This is so crucial for all our citizens to participate in the decision-making for the best interests of our Métis people here,\" said MN-S president Glen McCallum. \"It gives them the opportunity to be able to say their piece.\" If signed by Ottawa, a treaty would establish the MN-S as an Indigenous government in a nation-to-nation relationship with Canada. \"Then it's a constitutionally protected document,\" LeClair said. \"It doesn't matter what government flows through, goes out, comes in. We are protected as self-governing people through this sacred document.\" The proposed treaty is not public, but will be released in the coming months. If members approve the treaty, the federal government could introduce implementation legislation in early 2025, according to an MN-S news release. A modern treaty with the federal government will establish self-government for Saskatchewan Métis, and specific rights and responsibilities for both sides. With a signed treaty, a Métis government can create its own laws and establish services such as education and childcare, previously under provincial or federal jurisdiction. \"All those battles that we've had as Métis people going throughout the years, it is finally coming to the point where this is putting [Louis] Riel's dream, Gabriel Dumont's dream, Jim Sinclair's dream, Harry Daniels's dream into action,\" LeClair said. \"And so this is our moment to do that and we're really, really excited.\" Feds mull options as Métis self-government bill threatens to collapse What does the duty to consult First Nations, Inuit and Métis mean? The implementation agreement signed in 2023 led to the federal Bill C-53, but in April this year the MN-S withdrew support for the legislation that would create self-government agreements with Métis in Saskatchewan, Alberta and Ontario. The MN-S said the \"one size fits all\" legislation isn't ideal for its citizens. Bill C-53, which would recognize the Métis political associations in Alberta and Ontario as Indigenous governments, passed second reading in Parliament but its future is in question without MN-S support.",

        "description": "Alleged killer Justin Stein told the mother of missing schoolgirl Charlise Mutten not to call the police, before he was charged over her murder, a jury has been told.",
        "content": "The mother of Charlise Mutten has faced the man charged with her daughter’s murder, telling a jury she wanted to go to police but he claimed the schoolgirl’s “kidnappers” would “kill her” if her disappearance was reported. Justin Stein is facing trial after pleading not guilty to murder, but has admitted to disposing of the schoolgirl’s body. The 33-year-old is accused of murdering his former fiance’s daughter at a property owned by his parents before dumping her body, which was concealed in a plastic barrel, near the Colo River. The girl was visiting her mother during the school holidays, and spent her time in NSW split between Mr Stein’s family property at Mount Wilson, where she was allegedly shot and killed, and at the Riviera Ski Gardens caravan park in Lower Portland about 1.5 hours away. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Crown prosecutor Ken McKay SC said Mr Stein was the “last person” to see Charlise and had the opportunity to kill her between 7.16pm on January 11 and 10.06am on January 12. Ms Mutten told the jury on Monday she wanted to go to police once she realised “things weren’t adding up”, but Mr Stein told her not to as his “ex-affiliates would kill her”. Before this, Mr Stein had claimed Charlise had been left with an “auctioneer lady” who had come to the house on January 12 and offered to look after the sick girl. The couple had arrived at the Mount Wilson property about 9pm on January 12 to find the lights off and no one home. The jury heard Ms Mutten had called local hospitals that night to check whether Charlise had been admitted, but couldn’t find her. Ms Mutten said she was “trying to be rational” about where Charlise was, and assumed the auctioneer had taken her daughter home to care for her. Overnight, the jury heard, Ms Mutten looked through her partner’s phone where she found messages which she believed were evidence of him cheating. In the early hours of January 13, Ms Mutten took her partner’s car to a nearby campground where she sent multiple messages to friends saying her daughter was “gone. At this point, Ms Mutten told the jury things “weren’t adding up” and when she returned to the property Mr Stein “grabbed” her, pushed her to the ground and started “kicking” her. Ms Mutten told the jury.“ I remember just yelling just to stop because I want my daughter. “He said ‘you’re going to get in trouble for this’, he said ‘do you think I’ve got anything to do with this for your daughter’,” she said. Ms Mutten told the court Mr Stein then took a phone call from his mother, who told him the “the auctioneer lady is not the auctioneer lady” and he thought his “ex-affiliations had ... kidnapped her”. She said she wanted to call police and Mr Stein had said no. “He said ‘you ring the police and they will kill her’,” Ms Mutten told the court, before taking a moment to wipe her tears. The mother told the court she was still affected by methylamphetamine she injected the previous day. She told the court it “numbs” her from reality. “Maybe if I hadn’t been on drugs I might have put the pieces together,” Ms Mutten said. Ms Mutten will return to the witness stand on Tuesday where she is set to be grilled by Mr Stein’s lawyers. The trial continues.",

        "content": "World Cup winner Christian Karembeu revealed that during the recent wave of violence in the Pacific territory of New Caledonia. Speaking to radio on Monday, Karembeu divulged that his niece and nephew were shot and killed. \"I lost members of my family. That's why I remained silent, because I'm in mourning,\" he said. \"Two people in my family were shot in the head.\" When asked if he believed the killings were assassinations, Karembeu answered: \"I didn’t want to, because the word is strong, but... it’s true that, yes, it’s an assassination and we hope that there will be inquiries and investigations into these murders.\" On Monday, French President Emmanuel Macron lifted the state of emergency put in place earlier this month due to civil unrest. Seven people have reportedly died in New Caledonia from the widespread conflict, which was sparked by the French government’s controversial attempts to amend the constitution and enact voting reforms in the dozens of islands between Australia and Fiji. According to High Commissioner Louis Le Franc - France’s top official in New Caledonia - over 122 police officers and gendarmes have been injured as a result of the violence, with more than 460 people being arrested since May 14. Protests have been led by the Kanak community, which Karembeu is a member of. Voting in the French Pacific territory is currently restricted to indigenous Kanaks, as well as those who’ve arrived to the islands from France prior to 1998. Should the planned changes in voting lists go into effect, more French residents - including those who’ve lived in New Cadelonia for a minimum of 10 years - will be granted the ability to vote. Opponents of the measure worry that the reforms will benefit pro-France politicians in elections, whereas the Kanaks have long fought to be free of France. New Caledonia first became French in 1853 under Emperor Napoleon III, the heir and nephew of Napoleon. In 1957, French citizenship was granted to all Kanaks. Karembeu grew up on the island of Lifou in New Caledonia, eventually moving to mainland France at 17 years old to pursue a career in professional soccer. The former midfielder won two Champions League titles with Real Madrid, additionally playing for Middlesbrough, Nantes, Sampdoria, Olympiakos, Bastia and Servette over a decorated career. While playing for the French national team, Karembeu won 53 caps, including a victory in the 1998 World Cup final - a game in which he started. He was additionally a member of the team that won the 2000 European Championship. The 53-year-old now serves as a strategic advisor and ambassador for the Greek club Olympiakos, which gets set to play Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final in Athens on Wednesday.",

        "content": "With just 17 days to go before the close of nominations for candidates wishing to stand in this summer’s general election, the Conservative Party needs to find almost three tenths of its candidates. Across England, Scotland and Wales, the Conservative Party still has 183 candidates to select. Some 29 of these candidates, just under a fifth, are for vacancies in currently held Conservative seats. In contrast, as of the evening of 27th May, the Labour Party had selected candidates in all but 17 of the 631 seats it intends to fight across England, Wales, and Scotland. As per the list at the bottom of this article, 15 of the 17 missing Labour candidates are for seats currently held by the party. With many of these seats having only recently being vacated by retiring MPs, this increases the ease with which the party leadership may well be able to install its favoured candidates into plum seats at Westminster. Featured BASC responds to general election announcement Featured Jersey votes to legalise assisted dying Party Candidate Selection Totals • The above figures are based on England, Wales and Scotland. It is assumed that the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems will not contest the Speaker’s seat of Chorley as has been their convention. • The above figures exclude the three Consevative candidates currently selected in Northern Ireland. • For these purposes, the above figures have amalgamated the Green candidates from the separate Green Parties that exist in England, Wales and Scotland to provide a nationwide picture of Green candidates. In second place in the candidate selection stakes, the separate Green parties of England, Scotland and Wales have now selected some 567 candidates (90%). This is already substantially ahead of the number of candidates fielded by the different Green Parties in the 2019 general election. Reform UK is currently positioned in third place having selected a total of 514 candidates (81%). Although they are positioned ahead of the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats still have a significant number of vacancies to fill, with 23% of the seats in England, Wales, and Scotland lacking a declared Liberal Democrat candidate. It remains to be seen whether there may be any surprises in who ends up filling the Conservative and Labour vacancies in their existing seats. It had previously been speculated that the former West Midlands Mayor, Andrew Street, might contest the vacant Solihull West seat for the Conservatives. However late last night Mr Street issued a statement saying he would not be standing in the impending contest. In the past there has been talk that both the former Labour foreign secretary, David Miliband, and the former Manchester United football captain Gary Neville might still appear on the list of Labour Parliamentary candidates. After a number of high profile appearances at Labour events in late 2022, Gary Neville subsequently played down the notion that he wanted to morph into a Labour MP. If on the off chance he has had a change of heart, the vacant Greater Manchester seat of Worsley and Eccles seat may just be one to watch. The Conservative list of vacancies will be of particular interest to the current Conservative Party Chairman, Richard Holden MP. Mr Holden currently lacks a seat to contest after boundary changes impacted his current North West Durham constituency. Current Conservative held seats that lack a candidate (29) Ashfield Basildon and Billericay Bexhill and Battle Blackpool South Bognor Regis and Littlehampton Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket Central Suffolk and North Ipswich Chatham and Aylesford Daventry Dover and Deal East Thanet East Worthing and Shoreham Epping Forest Fylde Great Yarmouth Harlow North East Hertfordshire Northampton North Solihull West and Shirley South Northamptonshire Southend East and Rochford Spelthorne Stratford-on-Avon Surrey Heath Tunbridge Wells Warrington South Wellingborough and Rushden Wells and Mendip Hills Wokingham Current Labour held seats that lack a candidate (15) Dewsbury and Batley Ealing Southall Gateshead Central and Whickham Hackney North and Stoke Newington Halifax Leyton and Wansted Makerfield North Durham Queen’s Park and Maida Vale Rochdale Smethwick St Helens North Tipton and Wednesbury West Ham and Beckton Worsley and Eccles Swansea West",

        "description": "Despite his post-roast reservations, Tom Brady's recent reel of vacation antics seem to suggest he's doing just fine in the fallout.",
        "content": "After the event that was Netflix’s The Roast of Tom Brady , the retired quarterback of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers expressed some regrets about this entry on the 2024 TV schedule . As Brady admitted he’d never do a roast again , his reasons were pretty focused on the reaction of, in his words, “the people I love most in the world.” That’s a pretty serious reaction to such a prolific comedy event, but don’t get too hung up on it, as Brady looks to be recuperating nicely. If anything, his social media post celebrating Memorial Day with some footage from a sunny yacht vacation seems to suggest Tommy’s doin’ just fine on the open seas. Feel free to watch the results, shared here: A post shared by Tom Brady (@tombrady) A photo posted by on If I’m being totally honest, it’s hard to be in a bad mood when you’ve got good people out on the water to hang with. I mean, look at how clear that water is?! While I’m not as versed in this relaxation technique as Mr. Brady might be, his seafaring shenanigans do make for a good Memorial Day kickoff. We may only roast the ones we love, but one has to admit that this isn’t exactly Tom Brady’s specialty. So seeing the New England Patriots legend kicking back with good company is definitely a sign that, reservations aside, the man’s already moving past that night of infamy. Though while we're on the subject of roasts, all that's missing are some hot dogs and hamburgers, and this clip would be the epitome of that first summer holiday in the U.S. Let’s face it, it’s hard to fake that Brady smile, and he wears it quite often and quite proudly in the reel above. But at the same time, those roast-based concerns were also very genuine; and for good reason. Just looking at the Tom Brady roast highlights , the comic brutality of the night in question happened to be. Even the most experienced comedy fans know how unhinged and off color an event like The Roast of Tom Brady can get. If anything, conventional wisdom suggests that the deeper the roast cuts, the better the result. Which only makes Nikki Glaser’s commentary on Ben Affleck’s performance of that night all the more fitting. For now, the only roasting Tom Brady has to worry about is how bronze he wants his shirtless self to become. And since it's only the beginning of the American summer season, the man is undoubtedly going to pace himself. With that in mind, if this is the beginning of what some could call \"Hot Brady Summer,\" then how the hell does he even begin to top this in his next video? Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Regrets or not, The Roast of Tom Brady happened, and you can reap all of the benefits. With an active Netflix subscription, the Kevin Hart -hosted celebration is ready to watch at your convenience. And if you’re wondering why people were booing Kim Kardashian , or want to know the story behind Rob Gronkowski’s off-script roast , we've got you covered.",

        "description": "Sierra Leone this year declared a war on the cheap synthetic drug, calling it an epidemic and a national threat",
        "content": "A cheap, synthetic drug is ravaging youth the youth of Sierra Leone . Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio this year declared a war on kush, calling it an epidemic and a national threat. The drug is leaving its users seriously ill, with many dropping out of education and turning to crime. Trash-strewn alleys are lined with boys and young men slumped in addiction. Healthcare services are severely limited. One frustrated community has set up what it calls a treatment center, run by volunteers. But harsh measures can be used. The project in the Bombay suburb of the capital, Freetown, started in the past year when a group of people tried to help a colleague’s younger brother off the drug called kush. After persuasion and threats failed, they locked him in his room for two months. It worked. He has returned to university and thanked them for setting him free. “The only time I left the room was when I went to the bathroom,” Christian Johnson, 21, recalled. He said he was motivated to kick the drug by thoughts of his family, the fear of becoming a dropout and the abandonment by many of his friends. The volunteers then expanded the effort and took over an abandoned building. They seize people at families' request and sometimes chain them to prevent them from escaping — an echo of a practice the West African country's only psychiatric hospital previously used. There's little padding against the concrete floor and walls, and little to do beyond confronting their craving. “We turn parents away for lack of space,” said Suleiman Turay, a local football coach who helped launch the center. “The people in the community cooperate and help in their own individual ways. Some bring food, some bring water, doing whatever they can to help.” A doctor in the community visits from time to time. Police said they were not aware of the project or the practice of chaining people. So far, the Bombay Community has treated 70 to 80 people, volunteers said. One showed the chains used in extreme cases, although no one was chained at the time. The youngest held was a 13-year-old boy sent there by his father. “I was very angry, and I wanted to have nothing to do with him,” said the father, Gibrilla Bangura, a college lecturer. “I am very grateful to these men and women for their role in helping my son.” President Julius Maada Bio has launched a task force on drug and substance abuse, promising to lead a government approach focused on prevention and treatment involving law enforcement and community engagement. “We are witnessing the destructive consequences of kush on our country’s very foundation, our young people,\" Bio said in April. People rarely know what they're getting with kush, a derivative of cannabis mixed with synthetic drugs like fentanyl and tramadol and chemicals like formaldehyde. In some communities, civil society workers say, people have dug up graves to grind bones to cut with the drug, seeking chemicals used in embalming. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s director in Sierra Leone, Daphne Moffett, said one challenge in responding to the crisis is the drug's changing composition. “Before appropriate interventions can be developed, we need to know what materials are in Kush,” she said in an email. The drug leaves people lethargic, desperate and ill. While the government does not publish official figures on kush-related deaths or hospital admissions, Ansu Konneh, the director of mental health at the Ministry of Social Welfare, said there had been a sharp rise in people addicted to kush turning up at Sierra Leone’s only psychiatric hospital since 2022. Konneh heads Sierra Leone’s first public drug rehabilitation enter, which opened in Freetown in February. He said kush has affected Sierra Leone like no other drug. “It’s making young people drop out of college, and it’s having a physical effect on their health. You can see they have swollen feet, they have multiple organ failures, they’re involved in crimes,” he said. “It’s a very serious situation. It’s creating family disintegration, problems in communities, and they’re dying every day.” Prince Bull-Luseni, the director of the West Africa Drug Policy Network, a group that aims to promote policy reforms, said Sierra Leone is the worst-hit country in the region. “Every community in Sierra Leone, not just in Freetown, has been hit by kush and it’s tearing them apart,” he told the AP, adding that with no treatment or rehabilitation for most users, \"there’s no way to address it.” The Social Linkages For Youth Development And Child Link, a nonprofit organization that seeks to fight drug use, relies on former users of the drug to help educate young people about its toll. The organization had lobbied the government for years to allocate more resources to fighting addiction. “Overcoming the addiction wasn’t easy. It was one of the hardest steps of my life,” said Ephraim Macaulay, a peer educator who came across kush in college and soon was paying less than a dollar for a day's supply. “It’s like you trying to get out of water and there’s water all around you.” He motivated himself by comparing himself to friends and family. They were clean. He stank. Gradually, he stopped taking the drug. Now he sometimes feels like crying when talking to peers, reminded of what his life could have been if he hadn’t kicked the addiction. Habib Kamara, the executive director at SLYDCL, said the availability of kush has grown exponentially after suppliers began to manufacture it locally. He said law enforcement needs to do more to target manufacturers at the top of the supply chain instead of chasing buyers and low-level sellers. The government has said it wants to help, not punish, those who use the drug. “This country has fought two pandemics,” he said, listing COVID and West Africa's devastating Ebola outbreak that began a decade ago. Kush has had a similar impact, causing young people to drop out of school, straining the healthcare system and tearing apart families. “If we cannot have an approach that reduces usage, in the future we will not have people to replace us tomorrow in the workforce,\" Kamara said. Some parents are exhausted. Memunatu Kamara, 49, sells smoked fish at a market in Freetown, providing the main income for her family of six. Her husband is an imam. Their son, the oldest, has dropped out of school and stolen the few valuables they owned to buy the drug. “A very intelligent boy has become a dropout,” she said, wiping away tears. “I feel pain seeing him in this condition. I feel shame among my peers. I feel discouraged about his future. I have no idea what else to do about it.” She has put her son on the waiting list for the Bombay Community.",

        "content": "CAPITOLA — Memorial Day is simultaneously the unofficial start of summer and a day to reflect on those who died while serving in the military. Nowhere was that more evident than at Capitola Beach, where Veteran Surf Alliance hosted its sixth annual Memorial Day Paddleout. The community gathered on a misty gray Monday morning for a ceremony that featured speeches, remembrances, music, a raffle and was capped off with a paddleout where surfers formed a circle and tossed flower petals into the sea to commemorate veterans. As always, the event was hosted by Veteran Surf Alliance, a Santa Cruz nonprofit that creates camaraderie among veterans and eases the transition from service to civilian life by connecting them to the world of surfing. Sean Meyer, the nonprofit’s founder and director as well as a former Army sergeant, said the Veteran Surf Alliance was established as a way to help reduce post-traumatic stress disorder among veterans, and one way to do so was through the power of the ocean. “We have found healing through surfing and with our fellow service members, our brothers and sisters in arms,” he said. “Our best way to honor those that have fallen is to come here and to truly celebrate their lives and to enjoy our warm blanket of freedom.” The alliance hosts a paddleout on the final Saturday of each month, either at Capitola or Manresa Beach, except for May where Memorial Day acted in lieu of that. Meyer said such events provide an alternative form of therapy for veterans. “Getting out in nature and surfing is really having a strong impact on the mental well-being of this generation of veterans,” he said. Xavier Bianchi, the nonprofit’s treasurer and a former Army staff sergeant who served in Afghanistan, said the organization’s goal is to help veterans heal and also create a sense of community. “With the power of surfing, it helps us veterans because if they’re here with us and their fellow brothers and sisters that served, then they’re not at home isolating and falling into a dark place where that’s where we start losing people,” he said. “That’s what this is all about: community, camaraderie and fellowship.” In addition to a lunch catered by Pleasure Pizza and a raffle featuring such items as local artwork, a certificate for tattoo artist Ross Grajewski and gear donated by Patagonia and Santa Cruz Skateboards, Monday’s event had several new features, including an Honor Table where people could place photos of loved ones who served in the military or as first responders, an Honor Roll poster with the names of Santa Cruz County residents who died serving in every conflict from the Civil War to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, and a “soldier’s cross” consisting of a helmet on top of a rifle on top of a pair of boots and historically placed at the battle site of a soldier’s death to honor their service and sacrifice. The ceremony featured a color guard performance by Supply Company Combat Logistics Battalion 453 out of San Jose, a performance of the national anthem by teen Bran Francis and a keynote address by Rob Lackey, an Army veteran who runs the alliance’s nighttime Gun Runner surf chapter. Lackey encouraged the audience to not just remember the fallen but to honor their lives. “I want us to honor the memory of those we have lost, those who fell on the battlefield and what they’ve meant to each of us,” he said. “I want you to remember their legacy and the inspiration that they bring forward.” The ceremony also honored Lorraine Kinnamon, founder of the Te Hau Nui School of Hula and Tahitian Dance who died April 2 at the age of 66. Born in Toronto, Kinnamon moved with her family to Hawaii when she was 10 and fell in love with its culture, especially its dances. When she moved to Santa Cruz, she brought that love along with her by teaching hula dancing through Te Hau Nui, which translates to “forever peaceful” in Tahitian. Given the paddleout ceremony having its roots in Hawaiian tradition, Kinnamon has brought hula dancers to perform at the Santa Cruz ceremony for the past few years. “She was a bright light,” her sister Charmaine Moniz said. “She was talented, she was a graceful dancer, a choreographer, funny, kind, gracious, just a bright light, and we’ll miss her terribly.” Moniz and other Te Hau Nuli dancers paid tribute with a dance and performance of the lei chant “Old Lei” in honor of the leis that would later be placed in the ocean to honor those who have passed. Following the ceremony, a circle was formed on the beach with Veteran Surf Alliance President Dan Redmon leading the crowd in stretches and asking them to say a few words about a fallen service member. They then paddled out into the sea, dropped flower petals, leis and tea leaves into the water and held hands and formed a circle there before paddling back after the playing of taps. Drones flew overhead, and a squadron of pelicans apparently organized their own flyover as well. Bianchi said honoring veterans starts with remembering those who have died and supporting those who have come home. “This is what Memorial Day is all about,” he said. “It’s a solemn day of remembrance for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country and nation that should not be forgotten.”",

The $900 suit was purple with the fashion house's name in big letters. Oddly, Miami is the city where the designer Gianni Versace was murdered at age 50 in 1997 . The Real Housewives of Miami star was sitting on the back of the boat as she wore sunglasses with her hair partially pulled back. The looker was toned and tanned in the new photo that was taken in Florida . She was working on her suntan during a break from her reality TV series Real Housewives of Miami . The star has been spending spring in Miami with her children whom she had with her ex Scottie Pippen. This comes after the 49-year-old siren (she turns 50 in July) got back together with her boyfriend, 33-year-old Marcus Jordan, the son of Michael Jordan . Larsa Pippen was seen in a string bikini from Versace in Miami on Monday, which was Memorial Day. The Real Housewives of Miami star was sitting on the back of the boat as she wore sunglasses with her hair partially pulled back Last month the TV star posed on the same yacht but in another two piece Larsa poses in swimsuits so often that she should start her own swimwear line In April she had said she was separating from Michael Jordan's son Marcus, as she believes they are on 'different journeys .'

'You know, I feel like I just finished. I just wrapped up shooting the show, and I spent time away from him and everyone else. I was there for like two weeks, and it just kind of gave me clarity when I was alone,' she said on the podcast. 'And I think when you're alone, you kind of really miss the person or you realize maybe you aren't my guy, and that made me realize, I don't think he's my guy.'

        "description": "Actress Susan Lucci claims she was approached to be the first-ever Golden Bachelorette, before Joan Vassos signed on.",
        "content": "There seems to be some conflicting stories about All My Children star Susan Lucci 's involvement with Golden Bachelorette . Before ABC chose Joan Vassos to helm the first-ever season of the spin-off, Lucci claims the show's producers approached her to be the leading lady. However, according to some insiders close to the show, that's not accurate. Golden Bachelor runner-up Leslie Fhima shares the cosmetic procedure she gets twice a year Golden Bachelor runner-up Leslie Fhima is taking full advantage of new found fame In an interview with People , Lucci said that her assistant turned her on to The Bachelor a few years ago, which led to her watching and becoming obsessed with Golden Bachelor. Lucci then revealed that she once had a chance at finding love on The Golden Bachelorette, but she turned it down . \"I believe that they contacted my publicist and it wasn't for me,\" Lucci, 77, explained. While she didn't feel like the gig would be a good fit for her personality, she did share that she loved watching the first season of Golden Bachelor, which starred Gerry Turner . \"I watched The Golden Bachelor. I really enjoyed watching The Golden Bachelor. This is a new addiction for me,\" Lucci said. Lucci, who portrayed Erica Kane for 41 years on All My Children from 1970 to 2011, also added: \"It wasn't for me, but I do love watching. I'm a fan. I love watching.\" However, a source close to the show told ET that Lucci's claim \"is not true.\" Earlier this month, ABC announced that Vassos would lead the inaugural Golden Bachelorette. Vassos was a contestant who tried winning Gerry's heart on The Golden Bachelor but she self-eliminated from the show when a medical concern with her daughter arose.

I want to have somebody in my life,\" Vassos said on the Bachelor Happy Hour: Golden Hour podcast. \"I feel like life is better when you share it with somebody. I truly believe all of that.\" \"As far as my heart being completely open, I think it's nine-tenths of the way there,\" the Rockland, Maryland native continued. \"So, I think I just need to spend a little more time in like an environment like The Bachelor environment...I so am not...like I really want to find love. I just don't want to go to the work of going on a dating website.\" Vassos has also revealed that she won't be following in Gerry and Theresa Nist 's footsteps. While opening up about the couple's divorce - which they claim is a result of being unwilling to move to be together - Joan revealed to CNN that she is unwilling to move for a man . Gerry and Theresa cited distance as their main issue and the unwillingness to move from their respective states and families — Gerry resides in Indiana while Theresa lives in New Jersey . Once Joan was announced the new Golden Bachelorette, many fans took to social media to voice their concerns about Vassos choosing a suitor who does not live near her. She said: “That was actually the first question that Gerry asked me. We sat down for the first time together and he said, ‘You live in Maryland, I live in Indiana. How do you see something like this working?’ \"My answer to him was — and it still is my answer — I think you almost have to live a dual life. I’ll never leave my family. They are the most important people in the world to me, obviously.” Joan continued: “I would expect that to be the same for the person that I end up with because family is so important to me. That would have to be a key part of their personality. \"You have to be willing to... travel and be with that person and maybe spend a couple of months or a couple of weeks at a time... and then maybe eventually, you figure out a destination that would work for you and your families or have another house where everybody gets together.”",

        "description": "Crews hold Parker Lake wildfire in place. Main highway to the Yukon reopens",
        "content": "The Alaska Highway is now open following weeks of halted traffic due to a large wildfire in the vicinity of Fort Nelson, British Columbia. The highway was closed on May 10 due to the threat posed by the Parker Lake wildfire west of Fort Nelson. Drive BC reports that piloted alternating traffic is in use and that travellers should expect delays. Limited visibility due to smoke is also noted. Highway 77, the route north from Fort Nelson into the Northwest Territories, has also reopened but motorists are warned not to stop on the road. Highway 37, the other route between B.C. and the Yukon, remained open throughout the Alaska Highway closure. As of 8 a.m. on May 27, the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality and the Fort Nelson First Nation lifted their evacuation orders and road blocks were removed allowing evacuees to begin returning home. There are still fires burning in the area and an evacuation alert requiring that people be ready to leave on short notice remains in place. About 4,700 people were evacuated from the area May 10 as the fire spread close to the town. Despite firefighting efforts, the blaze destroyed four homes and damaged six other properties. Based on the most current information from the B.C. Wildfire Service, the Parker Lake fire is burning over 12,348 hectares. It is being worked on by 172 firefighters including a Yukon crew dispatched on May 16. The fire crews are being assisted by aircraft and heavy equipment as well as precipitation and cloud cover that's slowing fire behaviour above ground. However, the wildfire service also notes that persistent drought conditions make it likely that the fire will burn in duff layers under the ground. It is no longer expected to grow beyond its current boundaries.",

        "content": "Photo: The Canadian Press The Competition Bureau says market concentration, prices and a rising tally of customer complaints are fuelling its study into Canada's airline industry. An Air Canada plane taxis towards the gate in poor weather conditions at Halifax Airport, on Wednesday, March 27, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Chris Young Market concentration, higher prices and a mounting tally of customer complaints are fuelling a Competition Bureau study into Canada's airline industry. In a release Monday, the regulator said two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. Domestic fares also appear \"relatively high\" and more and more passengers are filing complaints, it said. The backlog of customer complaints about airlines has hit a record high topping 72,000, according to the Canadian Transportation Agency. The bureau's review, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, looks to pave the way for recommendations to government that would \"make it easier for new businesses to compete and easier for consumers to make informed choices.\" First announced on May 9, the market study is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies. Matthew Boswell, the competition commissioner, stressed the importance of the airline industry to residents and the economy. \"Since the Canadian population is spread out over vast distances, other modes of transportation may not be feasible replacements for air travel. More competition in the industry will mean lower prices, better services, and improved productivity,\" Boswell said in the release. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines. The latter two made up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau. Meanwhile, Air Canada and WestJet have strengthened their grip on the domestic market over the past year, even as rival Porter Airlines rapidly expands in a bid to become the country's third major airline. Canada's two largest carriers commanded 82 per cent of domestic traffic among national carriers last month versus 74 per cent in April 2023, statistics from aviation data firm Cirium show. The diminishing set of operators coincides with a six per cent decrease in domestic flight volume between April 2023 and this month, though that may be due in part to a renewed focus on international trips. While big cities remain amply served, smaller ones have fewer options, which can also result in higher prices and, when things go awry, stranded passengers. Over the past five years, the Competition Bureau has raised concerns about the merger of Canadian North and First Air and the would-be acquisition of Transat by Air Canada, which scrapped the plan in 2021 amid regulatory hurdles in Europe. The latest study is not an investigation into specific allegations of wrongdoing, the Competition Bureau noted Monday. \"However, if the bureau finds evidence that someone may be doing something against the law, we will investigate and take appropriate action,\" the regulator said. John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University, said the review should consider service levels to various parts of the country as well as rules around flight changes by airlines after the ticket was purchased.",

        "description": "Keith Urban's casual comparisons between Ariana Grande and heroin has brought some scrutiny from Nicole Kidman.",
        "content": "Keith Urban is reportedly on his wife’s bad side after some recent flippant remarks brought back some bad memories for the actress. The country music icon has compared Ariana Grande ’s hit We Can’t Be Friends to illegal drugs on mutliple occassions, which has left Nicole Kidman “disappointed” in her beau. Last week, the 56-year-old performed an acoustic cover of the track for a small, intimate show and posted a clip of the gig to social media with the caption noting: “This song is audible heroin.” Who is Nicole Kidman's daughter Sunday Rose? Inside the enigmatic life of mini-me kid Nicole Kidman's hubby Keith Urban appears to 'check out' fellow Met Gala attendee Later, the Australian star doubled down on his claims in an interview with People, saying: “I cannot stop playing it. It's like audible heroin. Literally, I have to have another hit.” Now Nicole reportedly fears that Keith, who has openly spoken about his drug and alcohol addictions in the past, may be sending the wrong message to their teen daughters with his casual remarks. A source told Woman’s Day Magazine that while the 56-year-old wouldn’t ask her husband to take down a post, she is “disappointed” in him. They claimed the comments took her back to a “very dark time” in their relationship when “they almost split”. However, Nicole’s first priority is their daughters, 15-year-old Sunday and 13-year-old Faith, and she doesn’t want them to “start thinking it’s cool or OK or something you can easily ‘fix’,”. Daily Express has contacted Nicole Kidman’s representatives for comment.

Under his acoustic performance and raving review, the 30-year-old declared: “This is so beautiful.” The Hollywood power couple have open spoken about Keith’s addictions, recovery and the impact on their relationship. The musician last checked into rehab at the Betty Ford Center in 2006, after his new bride staged an intervention for him. Speaking to Rolling Stone a decade later, Keith candidly admitted the situation was so desperate he would have completely understood if Nicole chose to leave him during that rehab stint, particularly as they had been married less than a year. During a different interview with Oprah Winfrey, Keith revealed that his wife was working in Rome at the time but valiantly flew back to the States and rounded up his pals to stage his intervention. He recalled: “The love in that room in that moment was just right. To see love in action in that way... I'd never experienced anything like that before.”",

        "description": "Former fireman David Hosier seems to be patiently waiting to die by lethal injection next month over the deaths of Angela and Rodney Gilpin, which he maintains wasn't him",
        "content": "inmate David Hosier said he's had lots of time to think while awaiting his execution scheduled for June 11, showing no plans to confess to a murder he insists wasn't his doing as he On June 11 at 6 pm, Hosier is poised to die from a lethal dose of pentobarbital while strapped to a gurney in front of an audience at a prison in eastern . He seems to have begrudgingly accepted his fate while maintaining that some extenuating circumstances were at play at the time of his alleged double . He stands accused of slaying Angela, 45, and Rodney, 61, Gilpin in the hallway of her Jefferson City apartment building. Angela and Hosier had been a couple before she decided to patch things up with her husband. 15 years after the murder, Hosider still insists he didn't have a role in the couple's death. However, prosecutors painted him as a furious ex who wanted revenge against the couple. The evidence was stacked against him: he was found with 400 rounds of ammunition and 15 firearms; prosecutors brought forth an application for a protective order against Hosier in which Angela said he had been stalking her. In a creepy note found by police, Hosier seemingly wrote to Angela: “If you are going with someone do not lie to them ... Be honest with them and tell them if there is something wrong. If you do not this could happen to YOU!! ... they can go off the deap [sic] end!!” One of the most damning, though, was a neighbor's account, informing police the death row inmate once exclaimed that if he could not have Angela Gilpin, no one could. Although the prosecution failed to place Hosier at the scene of the crime, his story hasn't been corroborated by anyone else. “The sum of the parts that I am and that’s it,\" he said. \"I’m not an angel, I know that. I’m human, I make mistakes, we all make mistakes.” Hosier, who maneuvers in a wheelchair and utilizes a cane, was just released from the hospital last week after enduring apparent heart failure. Speaking to The Kansas City Star, his mood changes rapidly: one moment he's stern-faced and then he gets a little more emotional; sometimes, he beats himself up for his choices and other times it seems he thinks he's the smartest man in the room. The former fireman has stuck to his story to the bitter end, even rejecting a plea deal that would have prevented the death penalty option were he to confess. “You cannot show remorse for something you did not do,” he said. As he awaits his death, Hosier connected with spiritual adviser, Reverand Jeff Hood, who has helped six men face their executions in the last 18 months. Describing their relationship, Hosier said: \"We talk a lot about the Bible and different things. We talk, just trying to get prepared for the state wanting to murder you.\" Hosier's execution date was handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court on Valentine's Day, as prison officials broke the news to him before he packed up the belongings in this cell to move to solitary confinement, where those with an execution date scheduled wait out their days. Hosier recalled: \"They at least let me say goodbye to all the guys in our wing. \"I got to say my farewells. They didn't have to, but they at least let me and that's how I learned about my execution date.\" Now, with just weeks to go until he faces the lethal injection, Hosier waits out his days in a seven by 15-foot cell. He's locked in there 24 hours a day, except for legal and media visits or medical appointments. Hosier's legal team are preparing to submit a clemency application to Governor Mike Parson's office, he said he hopes the governor will look at his case closely, but adds that if Parson decides to proceed \"that's on him\". He said Parson will one day too meet his maker at the gates, and at that point Hosier said: \"I'll shake his hand and I'll still call him brethren.\" Parson has denied clemency in all 10 death penalty cases that have come across his desk.",

        "content": "A serial slingshot shooter has been arrested in California after police say the suspect “victimized” neighbors for nearly a decade. Prince King, aged 81, was taken into custody last Thursday at his home in Azusa, California, on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Deputies with the Azusa Police Department served a search warrant and found ball bearings and a slingshot at the residence. The 81-year-old man ’s actions impacted dozens of residents, according to police, who said that he used the slingshot to break windows and car windshields. Authorities allege that he almost almost hit people with his attacks, which took place over the course of nine to 10 years. It’s not clear what charges Mr King is facing but records show that he has been charged with a felony crime, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office booking information. He is being held without bail at the county’s men’s central jail. Azusa police lieutenant Jake Bushey told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune that the ball bearings were mostly launched from Mr King’s backyard while others were shot from a nearby neighborhood. “It’s been ongoing for many years because we just didn’t identify who the suspect was,” Lt Bushey said. He added that officials are still working to determine a motive for the crimes. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” the police officer said. Mr King’s first court appearance is scheduled for Tuesday.",

The actor, 55, has teamed up with Martin, 59, once again for the fourth instalment of their buddy comedy franchise and looked in good spirits as he took to the red carpet with his co-star. Will opted for an oversized grey suit for the glitzy event, whist Martin went for a more fitted look made up of a smart black suit. The former Fresh Prince of Bell Air star completed his own look with an oversized white T-shirt and styled it all out with a silver chain around his neck. At one point, Will threw a peace sigh to the cameras as he smiled at the opening of his new film.

It was announced that development on the fourth film in the action-comedy franchise was underway just after the release of the third movie. Smith confirmed that both he and Lawrence would return for the new movie in February of 2023, when it was also revealed that El Arbi and Fallah, who directed the third installment in the franchise, would also direct the fourth film. Performers such as Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Rhea Seehorn rounded out the movie's cast. Production on the new film commenced in April of last year, with much of shooting taking place in Atlanta and Miami. Although filming was briefly paused due to the onset of the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, the cast and crew reconvened earlier this year and wrapped in March.

More than two dozen protesters attended the morning rally, some with graphic posters and others using megaphones to spread the word: “Howard Gillman you won’t rest until UCI divests.” The group was there from about 8 to 10 a.m. before voluntarily dispersing. This latest protest comes after law enforcement cleared the UCI Palestine solidarity encampment and arrested several dozen protesters on May 15. Prior to that, protesters occupied the lawn outside the Physical Sciences Lecture Hall for a little over two weeks to demand that UCI disclose any financial ties with Israel and divest from all companies that do business with Israel. Protesters also have called for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.",

        "description": "Dozens gathered at Loveland Burial Park on Monday morning for a solemn tribute to men and women who gave their lives while serving in the U.S. armed forces.",
        "content": "During his four years in the U.S. Navy from 1968 to 1972, Don Cook served overseas, but he admits that he didn’t face much danger, at least not in the line of duty. “It was two and a half years of shore duty in Hawaii, and a year and a half racing motorcycles and playing beach football in Guam,” he said. But Cook knows that he is among the lucky ones serving during that era. On Monday, he came to Loveland Burial Park to pay his respects to those who didn’t make it back home from the Vietnam War. “I’m here to honor everyone who served during that time,” he said. “I can appreciate what they had to give up, because I didn’t.” Cook was one of dozens at the cemetery on Monday morning for the annual Memorial Day ceremony, hosted by the Associated Veterans of Loveland Honor Guard. Beforehand, volunteers gave attendees small poppy pins to wear, a symbol of remembrance since World War I. Tom Parker, Honor Guard commander, opened the ceremony with a reminder to the crowd of what the day is meant to commemorate. “As we stand here, surrounded by the echoes of history, we recognize that freedom comes at a cost,” he said. “It is paid for with the blood, sweat and tears of those who answered the call of duty, from battlefields of Gettysburg to the deserts of Iraq.” Members of the Thompson School District’s Junior ROTC representing Loveland and Mountain View high schools presented the colors, and new Thompson Valley High School graduate and former Jr. ROTC company commander Zienna Kaiser delivered a stirring rendition of the National Anthem, despite a microphone malfunction. The day’s guest speaker was Kip Turain, retired Air Force colonel and former ROTC commander at Colorado State University. He led the crowd through a short lesson on the history of Memorial Day, which was called “Decoration Day” when it began shortly after the Civil War. The colonel also spoke about visiting Normandy and the site of the D-Day landing in 1944, and realizing what American soldiers have been fighting for since the days of the Revolution. “We’re fighting for freedom and for those future generations of all people to experience and celebrate life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” he said. Following Turain’s remarks, Lorri McLaughlin, commander-elect of the VFW Post 41, read the names of the 34 AVOL members who have died in the last year, as quartermaster Dwayne Windisch rang a bell. American Legion Post 15 commander Wayne Schou and current VFW commander Mark Lyons also placed 34 red and white carnations in the memorial wreath. The ceremony closed with a rifle volley from the AVOL Honor Guard, followed by the sounding of Taps and a closing prayer from Honor Guard chaplain Theresa Windisch. “We remember before you our comrades now departed from this life,” she said. “We honor them for their loyalty to God and country, for their good deeds and for their friendship. May they rest in peace.”",

        "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo has finished the Saudi Pro League by setting the season goal-scoring record. Ronaldo scored twice in Riyadh as Al-Nassr defeated Al-Ittihad 4-2 on Monday.",
        "content": "RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) — Cristiano Ronaldo finished the Saudi Pro League by setting the season goal-scoring record on Monday. Ronaldo scored twice in Riyadh as Al-Nassr defeated Al-Ittihad 4-2 and lifted his league tally to 35, one more than the record in 2019 by Abderrazak Hamdallah. In the final seconds of the first half, Ronaldo, who had already had two goals ruled out for offside, chested down a long pass from Mohammed Al-Fatil and opened the scoring with a low shot from the left side of the area. With 21 minutes remaining, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner celebrated wildly after heading home a corner from Marcelo Brozovic. He was substituted off the field five minutes later to a standing ovation from the home fans. It ended an action-packed season for Ronaldo, who scored four hat tricks and collected one red card. He was also suspended for an obscene gesture in February at Al-Shabab fans who had been chanting the name of Lionel Messi, Ronaldo’s longstanding soccer rival. Al-Nassr finished second in the league, 14 points behind local rival Al-Hilal, which won the championship more than two weeks ago and completed the 34-round league unbeaten on Monday. Al-Hilal was too strong even without Neymar, who joined the club in August from Paris Saint-Germain but suffered a season-ending ACL injury in October. Aleksandar Mitrovic stepped in and ended the season with a goal in the final seconds to clinch a 2-1 win over Al-Wehda. The Serbian striker, signed from London club Fulham last summer, reached 27 league goals, second only to Ronaldo. On its way to the title, Al-Hilal went on a 34-game winning streak in all competitions, a new world record for a top tier team. “This season has been truly exceptional for the team, arguably our best ever,” coach Jorge Jesus said. “The credit goes to the immense talent within the squad and the incredible sense of unity that transcends both on and off-field interactions.” Al-Ittihad’s defeat at Al-Nassr ended a disappointing season for the defending champion. Karim Benzema, signed from Real Madrid, struggled with injuries and even with N’Golo Kante and Fabinho in midfield, signed from Chelsea and Liverpool respectively, the team from Jeddah could manage only fifth place. Poor results cost Nuno Santo his job as coach in November, and the Portuguese tactician returned to the English Premier League a month later to take over Nottingham Forest. Al-Ahli, the fourth of the ‘Big Four’ clubs taken over by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund last June, finished third, 17 points behind Al-Nassr. Al-Ahli beat Al-Fayha 1-0 thanks to a late goal — his ninth of the season — from former Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino. Ronaldo took the headlines, however, and the 39-year-old still had one more chance to end the season with a trophy when Al-Nassr meets Al-Hilal in the King’s Cup final on Friday. ___ AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",

He was substituted off the field five minutes later to a standing ovation from the home fans. It ended an action-packed season for Ronaldo, who scored four hat tricks and collected one red card. He was also suspended for an obscene gesture in February at Al-Shabab fans who had been chanting the name of Lionel Messi, Ronaldo’s longstanding soccer rival. Al-Nassr finished second in the league, 14 points behind local rival Al-Hilal, which won the championship more than two weeks ago and completed the 34-round league unbeaten on Monday. Al-Hilal was too strong even without Neymar, who joined the club in August from Paris Saint-Germain but suffered a season-ending ACL injury in October. Aleksandar Mitrovic stepped in and ended the season with a goal in the final seconds to clinch a 2-1 win over Al-Wehda. The Serbian striker, signed from London club Fulham last summer, reached 27 league goals, second only to Ronaldo. On its way to the title, Al-Hilal went on a 34-game winning streak in all competitions, a new world record for a top tier team. “This season has been truly exceptional for the team, arguably our best ever,” coach Jorge Jesus said. “The credit goes to the immense talent within the squad and the incredible sense of unity that transcends both on and off-field interactions.” Al-Ittihad's defeat at Al-Nassr ended a disappointing season for the defending champion. Karim Benzema, signed from Real Madrid, struggled with injuries and even with N'Golo Kante and Fabinho in midfield, signed from Chelsea and Liverpool respectively, the team from Jeddah could manage only fifth place. Poor results cost Nuno Santo his job as coach in November, and the Portuguese tactician returned to the English Premier League a month later to take over Nottingham Forest. Al-Ahli, the fourth of the ‘Big Four’ clubs taken over by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund last June, finished third, 17 points behind Al-Nassr. Al-Ahli beat Al-Fayha 1-0 thanks to a late goal — his ninth of the season — from former Liverpool forward Roberto Firmino. Ronaldo took the headlines, however, and the 39-year-old still had one more chance to end the season with a trophy when Al-Nassr meets Al-Hilal in the King’s Cup final on Friday.

        "content": "Bill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71 Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a prolonged fight with cancer. He was 71. Walton was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of both the NBA’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. 14-time champion Rafael Nadal loses in the French Open's first round to Alexander Zverev PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal lost in the first round of the French Open to Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in what might turn out to be the 14-time Roland Garros champion's last match at his favorite tournament. The nearly 38-year-old Nadal has been dealing with hip and abdominal injuries since January 2023 and played infrequently, so he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time. That's why he ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev. Nadal has said 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but he said Saturday he isn't 100% sure he won't play again at the French Open. He reiterated that Monday. He said after his match, \"If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself.” Newgarden salvages his season with an Indy 500 win on a last-lap defeat of a heartbroken O'Ward INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — As Roger Penske investigated the cheating incident that cost Josef Newgarden his IndyCar season-opening victory, never did Newgarden worry about his job security at Team Penske. One way to ensure a new contract is in your future is by winning the Indianapolis 500, which Newgarden did Sunday after a four-hour rain delay. His pass of Pato O’Ward two corners from the finish line gave Penske a record-extending 20th Indy 500 victory and made Newgarden the first back-to-back winner since Helio Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. O'Ward, meanwhile, was devastated by his near-miss. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Closers Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have Mavs on verge of sweeping Wolves in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have been the closers for the Dallas Mavericks, who have a chance to sweep Minnesota in the Western Conference finals. The Dallas co-stars are coming off another big fourth quarter in a victory that gave the Mavs a 3-0 series lead. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. The Mavs can reach the NBA Finals for the first time since winning their only title 13 years ago. Anthony Edwards, Karl-Anthony Towns and the Timberwolves face some long odds. No team has rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the NBA playoffs. Fifteen of the 20 teams that have lost the first three games while starting the series at home have been swept. Braves' Ronald Acuña is placed on IL after second season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP tore his left ACL, ending his season. Acuña was hurt during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require surgery. Acuña tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was voted the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Counsell's return to Milwaukee includes thank-you message and chorus of boos MILWAUKEE (AP) — Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the Chicago Cubs hired him away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos. A brief pregame video showcased some highlights from Counsell’s tenure as Milwaukee’s manager before displaying him wearing a Brewers cap alongside the message, “Thank You No. 30.” Brewers fans booed throughout the video, and then booed again when he was introduced as the Cubs’ manager. Shohei Ohtani lost sleep after translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from him NEW YORK (AP) — Shohei Ohtani says he lost sleep after his translator was accused of stealing millions of dollars from the two-way baseball star. Ippei Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts. Ohtani began Monday with a major league-leading .336 batting average, 13 homers, 35 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. Trevino wins grant from MLB Players Trust for charity that teaches art to those with special needs HOUSTON (AP) — When Jose Trevino took a teen leadership class taught by Sherri Davis in high school the New York Yankees catcher couldn’t have imagined the long-lasting impact it would have. “It changed my life,” Trevino told The Associated Press. “She taught me a ton of lessons in high school, life lessons that help to this day.” So, when Davis retired after a 47-year teaching career and started a nonprofit in his hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, called “Special Hearts in the Arts” in 2016 to provide arts education to those with special needs, Trevino quickly became one of the organization’s most important benefactors. This week he’ll give the beloved group another gift to continue its work. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter.",

        "description": "Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have been the closers for the Dallas Mavericks, who have a chance to sweep Minnesota in the Western Conference finals. The Dallas co-stars are coming off another big fourth quarter in a victory that gave...",
        "content": "DALLAS (AP) — Kyrie Irving screamed at the crowd, then turned and grabbed Luka Doncic in a bear hug after the play that clinched a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals for Dallas. The co-stars — and fourth-quarter closers — for the Mavericks have been at it all series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, perhaps providing lessons in the first trip deep in the playoffs for Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns. Dallas' 116-107 victory in Game 3 ended with a 14-3 run by the Mavericks, who with a win Tuesday night at home can advance to the NBA Finals for the first time since the franchise won its only championship 13 years ago. “I feel like we’re both born for this, if you ask me,” Irving said after being told Doncic believed his running mate was born for clutch situations. “Down the stretch, that’s where we make our money, man. We’re finishing clutch games. We’re showcasing our skill sets out there.” No team in NBA history has rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the playoffs. Of the 20 teams that lost the first three while opening the series at home, 15 were swept. Three made it past five games. “It stays in the belief department right now,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said at the team hotel Monday. “Mentally, believing, just one game. Get one. Bring it back to Minnesota and give ourselves a chance in this series. Just don’t let go of the rope.” The wide gap in the series score is best reflected in the differences between Doncic-Irving and Edwards-Towns, particularly late. In the fourth quarter Sunday night, Doncic and Irving combined for 21 points, making eight of 10 shots and both 3-pointers (one each). Edwards had the only four points for the Minnesota tandem, with Towns missing all four of his shots while his overall shooting rate for the series stayed at 28%, where it was after two games. “I’ve got to laugh,” Towns said after the game. “I’m putting up to 1,500 shots a day. Shot so well all playoffs, confidence extremely high. To be having these unfortunate bounces and these looks that are just not going in, it’s tough.” Edwards had the look of someone about to get his team back in the series when his soaring one-handed dunk started his run of eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. They went ahead when he assisted on the next bucket. Instead, the two-time All-Star attempted just three shots in the fourth quarter and had the only Minnesota turnover during another fourth-quarter fade when Doncic knocked the ball loose after a steal by Edwards and the Mavs won the resulting jump ball. “Ant’s young. He’s 22. He’s learning a lot about the game, learning a lot of it on the fly,” Conley said. “KAT has been in the league for a while, but still the playoffs are new to him in a way that he’s had to adjust a lot in his game and understanding how to play winning basketball at this stage of the game. “All you can ask is that they continue to work and get better. That’s what they’ve done all playoffs long.” Irving, who takes a personal 14-0 record in closeout games into Game 4, won a championship with LeBron James in Cleveland in 2016, part of three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals. Doncic made his conference finals debut two years ago, with Dallas losing to Golden State in five games. The experience showed up late again, and Dallas has won all three games despite trailing inside the final five minutes. The third victory came after center Dereck Lively II left in the second quarter with a neck injury when Towns accidentally kneed the rookie in the back of the head. Lively is listed as doubtful for Game 4. In Game 2, Dallas was down five with a little more than a minute remaining when Irving hit a 3-pointer to set up Doncic's game-winning 3 in the final seconds. Irving has 31 fourth-quarter points in the series, four more than Doncic, who was listed as questionable before the game as he continues to deal with a sprained right knee and a sore left ankle. “Unbelievable. That’s why some people call him ‘Mr. Fourth Quarter,’ right?” said Doncic, who has scored 33, 32 and 33 points in the three games. “He’s born for the clutch situations, so we just get the ball to him.” Irving's assist set up P.J. Washington Jr. for a corner 3-pointer that put Dallas in front for good. Doncic had one on an alley-oop dunk to Daniel Gafford that prompted Irving's screaming celebration. Derrick Jones Jr. made all three of his 3-pointers as the Mavs finished with a playoff-high 14 on 28 attempts. Through it all, Doncic seems to solve the puzzle no matter the defense the Wolves throw at the 25-year-old Slovenian superstar. “We’re dyin’ a little bit by the poison that we’re pickin’,” Wolves coach Chris Finch said. “That’s what happens when you have great players that have seen a lot of different looks.” AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

(AP Photo/Julio Cortez) DALLAS (AP) — Kyrie Irving screamed at the crowd, then turned and grabbed Luka Doncic in a bear hug after the play that clinched a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals for Dallas. The co-stars — and fourth-quarter closers — for the Mavericks have been at it all series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, perhaps providing lessons in the first trip deep in the playoffs for Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns. Dallas’ 116-107 victory in Game 3 ended with a 14-3 run by the Mavericks, who with a win Tuesday night at home can advance to the NBA Finals for the first time since the franchise won its only championship 13 years ago. “I feel like we’re both born for this, if you ask me,” Irving said after being told Doncic believed his running mate was born for clutch situations. “Down the stretch, that’s where we make our money, man. We’re finishing clutch games. We’re showcasing our skill sets out there.” No team in NBA history has rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the playoffs. Of the 20 teams that lost the first three while opening the series at home, 15 were swept. Three made it past five games. “It stays in the belief department right now,” Wolves guard Mike Conley said at the team hotel Monday. “Mentally, believing, just one game. Get one. Bring it back to Minnesota and give ourselves a chance in this series. Just don’t let go of the rope.” The wide gap in the series score is best reflected in the differences between Doncic-Irving and Edwards-Towns, particularly late. In the fourth quarter Sunday night, Doncic and Irving combined for 21 points, making eight of 10 shots and both 3-pointers (one each). Edwards had the only four points for the Minnesota tandem, with Towns missing all four of his shots while his overall shooting rate for the series stayed at 28%, where it was after two games. “I’ve got to laugh,” Towns said after the game. “I’m putting up to 1,500 shots a day. Shot so well all playoffs, confidence extremely high. To be having these unfortunate bounces and these looks that are just not going in, it’s tough.” Edwards had the look of someone about to get his team back in the series when his soaring one-handed dunk started his run of eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. They went ahead when he assisted on the next bucket. Instead, the two-time All-Star attempted just three shots in the fourth quarter and had the only Minnesota turnover during another fourth-quarter fade when Doncic knocked the ball loose after a steal by Edwards and the Mavs won the resulting jump ball. “Ant’s young. He’s 22. He’s learning a lot about the game, learning a lot of it on the fly,” Conley said. “KAT has been in the league for a while, but still the playoffs are new to him in a way that he’s had to adjust a lot in his game and understanding how to play winning basketball at this stage of the game. “All you can ask is that they continue to work and get better.

        "content": "Sussex have been told they are in a “fantastic” position to end their wait for promotion at the halfway stage of the season. The county are eight points clear at the top of Vitality County Championship division two after a high-scoring but dull draw with closest rivals Middlesex at Lord’s. They have a 17-point buffer over third-placed Leicestershire going into a break in red-ball action. Sussex head coach Paul Farbrace said: “We’ve said for two years we want to be promoted and be in division one. “There’s plenty of good cricket to be played before it’s decided who’s going to go up but we want to be there or thereabouts. “Seven games in, to be in the position we’re in is fantastic. “We’re right up there with three games won out of seven, two others where the weather went against us when we were in a good position and one pretty tough defeat to Glamorgan. “But we’re certainly not getting carried away with ourselves. “We know there are some good teams in division two who will also be looking at it and saying they’re not in a bad position at the turn.” Middlesex ended day four on 613-9 declared in reply to Sussex’s total of 554-9 with a positive result for either side never really looking possible. Jayden Seales and Cheteshwar Pujara have now completed their stints in the Championship this season. Attention now turns to T20 cricket and the Vitality Blast, which gets under way when Gloucestershire visit Hove on Friday (7pm).",

        "content": "North West, daughter of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West recently made her acting debut. During The Lion King 's 30th anniversary concert, North played the role of Young Simba. Kim and Kanye attended the Hollywood Bowl to witness their daughter's performance of I Just Can't Wait To Be King. The performance which received a standing ovation from the audience, also brought North under the spotlight of online trolling. X users expressed their thoughts on North's performance, criticizing the influence of nepotism. One wrote, \"It needs to be said: North West was not good in The Lion King. And her family/production did her no favors in letting her go on anyway. Not all kids are good at all things and they need to be taught that. There were likely dozens of experienced kids that should have been cast.\" \"She’s cute and charming clearly, but it was just cruel to put her in a performance of that standard. People pay a lot of money to go to those shows they are entitled to criticize,\" another added. Despite the criticism, North is no stranger to the stage, having previously collaborated with her father, Kanye West, on various occasions. The father-daughter duo has performed together at album release events for Vultures 1 in Miami and Paris.",

        "content": "( The Hill ) – Severe storms hit parts the U.S. over Memorial Day weekend, leaving at least 18 people dead and injuring hundreds. The storms hit worst in parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas before moving east. There were several deaths reported in Cooke County, Texas, near the Oklahoma border after a tornado swept through a rural area near a mobile home park Saturday, The Associated Press reported. Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas) said there were two children, ages 2 and 5, among the dead. About 100 people were injured and more than 200 homes and structures were destroyed. Wind gusts in the Valley View community reached an estimated 135 mph, according to officials. “The hopes and dreams of Texas families and small businesses have literally been crushed by storm after storm,” Abbott said. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders (R-Ark.) said Sunday evening that eight people died from the storms in Arkansas. Two deaths were attributed to circumstances of the storm but not directly from the weather, since one person suffered a heart attack and another lost oxygen after losing electricity. Other deaths in Arkansas included a 26-year-old woman found inside a destroyed home in Boone County, officials said. One person died in Benton County and two more died in Marion County, per records. In Oklahoma, two people died in Mayes County, officials said. A Louisville, Ky., man was killed when a tree fell on him, Louisville Mayor Craig Greenburg confirmed. Tens of thousands of residents were also without power in the central region of the country, with Kentucky having the most outages. As of Monday morning, more than 100,000 residents were without power in the Blue Grass State, according to poweroutage.us. The National Weather services predicted that thunderstorms, frequent lightning, severe wind gusts, hail and a few tornadoes would hit parts of the midwest. The Associated Press contributed.",

        "description": "Five Labour MPs, including shadow ministers, have announced that they will stand down from parliament at the General Election.",
        "content": "Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party John Cryer joined Kevin Brennan, Barbara Keeley, John Spellar and Virendra Sharma in announcing on Monday that he would not be contesting his seat. Mr Cryer said he wanted to spend more time with his young children and that the next parliament was “likely to be extremely busy”. The MP for Leyton and Wanstead added that the next government would “inherit a very tough situation”. In a letter to his constituents, posted on social media, Mr Cryer said: “This has been an extremely difficult decision, perhaps the most difficult I have ever had to make. “It has been an immense privilege to have served as your MP for the past 14 years. As you may know, I have two young children and I feel I should try to spend more time with them.” Mr Cryer, who was MP for Hornchurch from 1997 to 2005, is married to Labour’s deputy national campaign co-ordinator and MP for Lewisham West and Penge Ellie Reeves. Labour’s shadow minister for victims and sentencing Mr Brennan said he had initially intended to stand again, but decided to step down “after discussing it with my family over the bank holiday weekend”. The Cardiff West MP said in a statement: “The job of a Member of Parliament is immensely rewarding but hugely demanding for the individual and their loved ones. “I have always enjoyed its intensity and challenge, but after surgery for prostate cancer a small seed of doubt was sown as to whether I should continue in such a full-on role. “Standing again would mean making a commitment to perform the demanding duties of an MP close to my 70th birthday. This has led me to conclude that this is the right moment to stand down.” Labour’s shadow minister for music and tourism Ms Keeley said it had “been an honour” to serve as a government whip and deputy leader of the House of Commons during the last Labour government. The MP for Worsley and Eccles South said in a statement posted on social media: “Recently, I have had treatment in hospital in London after which I was meant to have a six-week recovery period. “I was back at work in Parliament within two weeks but then the General Election was called unexpectedly early. “Thinking about the demands of the campaign, including supporting Labour colleagues in battleground seats, has made me realise that now is the time to step aside for a new Labour candidate for the constituency.” Warley MP Mr Spellar said it had been an “honour and pleasure” to represent the people of Smethwick and Oldbury for over 30 years. Mr Spellar served in various ministerial roles during Tony Blair’s government, with his briefs including the armed forces, transport, and Northern Ireland. Outgoing Ealing Southall MP Virendra Sharma said Labour had “gone from our worst result in a century, to the edge of government”. In a letter to his local party, he said: “As a British-Indian and as a Hindu, as a Labour member, councillor and MP I have never struggled to reconcile those different, but complimentary, identities. “Over nearly 50 years I have served the party in one form or another. Now I believe the time has come for another chapter to begin.”",

        "content": "(Reuters) - British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday proposed tax cuts for millions of pensioners in his latest campaign pledge, highlighting the importance of older voters in the upcoming July election. Sunak's Conservative Party said it would introduce a new age-related allowance and deliver a tax cut of around 100 pounds ($128) for each of 8 million pensioners in 2025, rising to almost 300 pounds a year by the end of the next parliament. \"This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history,\" Sunak, who last week called a general election for July 4, said in the statement. The number of pensioners in Britain rose by 140,000 to 12.6 million in the year to February 2023. Close to 50 million Britons will be eligible to vote in the election, which opinion polls predict is likely to end 14 years of Conservative rule in the country. The Conservative Party said the proposal comes alongside the its commitment to the so-called triple lock, which guarantees increases to publicly funded pensions by the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is highest. Labour has also committed to retain the policy, which was introduced by a Conservative government in 2011 to prevent pensioners from falling into poverty. However, costs associated with it have come under increased scrutiny in recent years after British inflation soared, pushing up the government bill for state pensions by an additional 11 billion pounds last year. The new proposal, which the party termed \"triple lock plus,\" will cost 2.4 billion pounds a year by 2029/30 and be funded through the government's previously announced plan to raise an extra 6 billion pounds a year by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion, the party said. “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility,\" Labour shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said in a statement on the plans. The paymaster general falls under the Treasury and acts as a banker for most government departments. ($1 = 0.7831 pound) (Reporting by Muvija M; Editing by Elizabeth Piper and Jonathan Oatis)",

        "description": "Pensioners will be given a tax break worth £2.4 billion a year, Rishi Sunak is expected to promise.",
        "content": "The Prime Minister will announce on Tuesday that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock, as he continues the Conservatives’ election campaign. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners’ tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the “triple lock plus”, the policy is estimated to cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30, a price tag which mirrors Mr Sunak’s proposed national service duty for all 18-year-olds, billed at £2.5 billion a year. The tax cut will be funded through a previously announced plan to raise £6 billion a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. For individual pensioners, it would be worth around £100 in 2025 according to the Tories, and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension. The policy follows criticism of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance by 2p at the spring budget, after a similar cut in the autumn. State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Mr Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.”",

        "content": "SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. — Hall of Fame trainer Todd Pletcher holds a strong hand for the Grade 1, $2 million Belmont Stakes with as many as four possible contenders topped by Fierceness and Antiquarian as well as the undefeated Mindframe, who were all on the work tab Friday morning. Pletcher, who could also be represented in the Belmont Stakes by the talented maiden Protective, has previously won the ‘Test of the Champion’ with Rags to Riches [2007], Palace Malice [2013], Tapwrit [2017] and Mo Donegal [2022]. Repole Stable’s Kentucky homebred Fierceness returned to the work tab for the first time since an off-the-board finish in the Grade 1 Kentucky Derby on May 4, covering a half-mile in company with Mindframe Friday over Saratoga Race Course’s Oklahoma dirt training track. Champion 2-Year-Old Colt Fierceness is targeting a start in the Belmont Stakes on June 8 at Saratoga, while Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable’s Mindframe is possible for either the Belmont or a start at Monmouth Park in the 1 1/16-mile Listed $150,000 Pegasus on June 15, the local prep for the Grade 1, $1 million NYRA Bets Haskell traveling nine furlongs on July 20. “We haven’t decided yet. The Belmont is in play, the Pegasus is in play,” Pletcher said regarding Mindframe. “We’ll just survey how the race is shaping up and talk to the ownership and see what they want to do.” The pair were the first of Pletcher’s set to go out after the first renovation break at 7:30 and jogged up to mid-stretch before turning back to assume the position for their work. The two remained together throughout with Fierceness on the outside as NYRA clockers caught them in splits of 13 2/5 seconds, 25 3/5, and 50 flat for the half-mile before galloping out in 1:02 2/5, 1:14 3/5, and 1:28 2/5 over the fast footing. Pletcher said he liked what he saw from Fierceness and Mindframe, the latter is undefeated through two starts. “I thought it was a very good work from both horses. They seemed to be doing it well in hand coming to the wire,” said Pletcher. “We kind of let Mindframe do a little more in the gallop out than Fierceness – he had a work last week, and he’s more lightly raced. I was very pleased with both horses. It seemed like Fierceness was moving really well and did it easily.” Fierceness, who notched Grade 1 wins in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and Florida Derby, was the post-time favorite for the Kentucky Derby after his 13 1/2-length romp in the latter, but hopped at the start under Hall of Famer John Velazquez and failed to threaten when three-wide into the stretch, finishing well behind the victorious Mystik Dan. “I think if you look at it, the one thing he did – which he has done in the three races he’s lost – is he kind of hopped a little bit at the start and didn’t get away as cleanly,” said Pletcher. “Johnny thought maybe the horse overreacted to him asking him to get into the race, and at that point he thought he got a little keen with him.” Pletcher said he opted to give the City of Light bay an extra week of rest after the Derby considering he does not need to condition for additional ground in this year’s 10-furlong Belmont Stakes. “I thought after the Derby, we shipped back here, and he was a little quiet for a few days,” said Pletcher. “It took him a little while to get back in the feed tub, and I started looking at it and said, ‘You know what, I think two works is good enough.’ He looks super fit and is coming off a mile-and-a-quarter race. Maybe if it was at Belmont and a mile and a half, I might have breezed him last week, but I thought I could give him the extra week and not worry about it.” Pletcher added he is pleased with Fierceness’ energy level as of late. “His gallops have been good and a couple mornings ago, he put in a big buck in the middle of the turn,” said Pletcher. “He’s such a quiet horse, sometimes you’re not 100 percent sure where you are with him because he’s so laid back and cool all the time. He’s such an easy horse to train.” Centennial Farms’ Antiquarian completed his first timed work since a stalk-and-pounce score to capture the Grade 3 Peter Pan by three-quarters of a length on May 11 at Belmont at the Big A. Piloted by Irad Ortiz, Jr. for the breeze, he worked with Candied, who had exercise rider Hector Ramos aboard as she prepared for the Grade 1, $500,000 DK Horse Acorn on June 7 at Saratoga Race Course. NYRA clockers had the pair completing a half-mile in 48.65 seconds over the Belmont Park dirt training track. “It was pretty even the whole way. I got them in 12 and 1, 24 and 3, 48 and 3, galloped out 1:01,” said Pletcher’s New York-based assistant Amelia Green. “It was a strong gallop out, 1:13 and 1. An eased down 1:26 and 4. Honestly, he did it very impressively on this track. “I’d say the track is a little faster today than it has been all week, but the way he did it was the main thing, which was well within himself,” Green added. Antiquarian, who is by the Centennial Farms-campaigned Preservationist, entered the Peter Pan from a sixth in the 1 3/16-mile Grade 2 Louisiana Derby after breaking through the gate on March 23 at Fair Grounds. Before that effort, the chestnut graduated at second asking going 1 1/16 miles there over next-out winner Cornishman. “Obviously, he is a colt, and she is a filly,” said Green regarding the work partners. “So, it is hard to judge them against each other, but she did it nicely, too.” Pletcher said he was pleased with the good report from Green. “Amelia said he worked really well, strong gallop out,” said Pletcher. “She said Irad was raving about how well he went. I’m happy with that. The plan is to ship here tomorrow.” Centennial Farms looks to add another Belmont Stakes to its historic resume featuring Colonial Affair capturing the ‘Test of the Champion’ in 1993. Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners’ Candied was on target for the Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks on May 3 but did not draw in after being listed as an also-eligible. The daughter of Candy Ride, who has recovered from a bruised quarter, now set her sights on the Grade 1, $500,000 DK Horse Acorn. “Candied has been doing well and that was a good work from her also,” said Pletcher. “We were disappointed we didn’t draw into the Oaks, but we’ll regroup and try this.” Candied graduated on debut in August at Saratoga and followed with a score in the Grade 1 Darley Alcibiades in Oct. at Keeneland before completing her juvenile campaign with a rallying third-place finish in the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies in Nov. at Santa Anita. She made her seasonal debut April 5 at Keeneland with a fourth-place finish in the 1 1/16-mile Grade 1 Ashland after exiting the inside post in a field of eight. “It was a little bit of a layoff and the inside post – I thought she ran well considering everything,” Pletcher said. “I think she should appreciate the added distance.” Repole Stable’s maiden Protective has made his last two starts in graded events traveling nine furlongs at the Big A, finishing third in the Grade 2 Wood Memorial presented by Resorts World Casino on April 6 and the Grade 3 Peter Pan on May 11. The Medaglia d’Oro colt, a $250,000 Keeneland September Yearling Sale purchase, endured a troubled trip in the Wood Memorial when bumped at the break and taken up. He was full of run down the lane when Deposition fell to his outside while trying to split rivals to the inside of Uncle Heavy. Despite the troubled trip, Protective finished strong to earn show honors 3 3/4-lengths back of the victorious Resilience. Last out, a more prominent Protective tracked from fourth position and stayed on strong to complete the trifecta two lengths back of his victorious stablemate Antiquarian, who was a three-quarter length winner over The Wine Steward. NYRA will waive the entry and starting fees to the Belmont Stakes, excluding the supplemental fee, for the first three finishers of the Peter Pan. Protective, out of the Grade 1-winning Empire Maker mare Grace Hall, had his first work back Wednesday, covering a half-mile in 48.68 over the Belmont dirt training track. “He breezed very well and he’s doing well,” Pletcher said. “We’re not committed to the Belmont, but we’re not ruling it out either. We will assess how he’s doing and how the field is shaping up and make a decision on entry day.” Pletcher will have several possible starters at the four-day 2024 Belmont Stakes Racing Festival, held at Saratoga Race Course from Thursday, June 6 through Sunday, June 9. Highlighted by the 156th edition of the Grade 1, $2 million Belmont Stakes presented by NYRA Bets on Saturday, June 8, the four-day Belmont Stakes Racing Festival will include 24 stakes races with purses totaling $10.25 million, the highest purse levels and number of stakes offered since the launch of the multi-day Festival in 2014. Whisper Hill Farm’s Kentucky homebred Charge It, a 5-year-old Tapit horse, will be nominated to a pair of races on Belmont Stakes Day, including the 10-furlong Grade 2, $350,000 Suburban and the Grade 1, $ 1 million Hill ‘N’ Dale Metropolitan Handicap, which offers a Breeders’ Cup “Win and You’re In” berth to the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile in November at Del Mar. “We’ll see how things shape up, but we’re probably leaning towards the Suburban with Charge It,” Pletcher said. Last year, Charge It ran fourth in the Grade 1 Met Mile one month ahead of a prominent 4 3/4-length score in the Grade 2 Suburban on July 8 when both races were held at Belmont Park. Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable’s Crupi is also pointing to the Suburban. He won a pair of Listed nine-furlong stakes this winter at Aqueduct, taking the Discovery in November and Queens County against elders on New Year’s Eve. He was a closing third in the Grade 1 Pegasus World Cup Invitational in January and was last seen finishing 10th in the Group 1 Dubai World Cup on March 30 at Meydan Racecourse. Joseph Allen and CHC Inc.’s multiple graded stakes-placed Talk of the Nation will point to the Grade 3, $350,000 Poker, a one-mile turf test for older horses on Belmont Stakes Day June 8. The 4-year-old Quality Road colt made his first eight starts for Hall of Fame trainer Shug McGaughey, winning the Columbia at Tampa Bay Downs and Gun Runner at Kentucky Downs last year along with runner-up efforts in the Grade 3 Manila at Belmont and the Grade 3 Bryan Station at Keeneland. He made his seasonal debut last out for Pletcher, setting the pace in the one-mile Listed Opening Verse on May 2 at Churchill Downs where he was nailed at the wire by Carl Spackler, who prevailed by a head. “I thought he ran great at Churchill. It was a tough beat, but he ran really well,” Pletcher said. “Hopefully, second time off the layoff he makes a move forward.” Among other possible Belmont Stakes Racing Festival starters for Pletcher are Repole Stable’s graded stakes-winner Surprisingly, who will target the Grade 1, $750,000 New York, a 1 3/16-mile turf test for older fillies and mares on June 7; and KimDon Racing’s graded stakes-placed Tizzy in the Sky, last-out winner of the Big A’s Listed Top Flight Invitational, who will try the Grade 1, $500,000 Ogden Phipps presented by Ford, a nine-furlong test for older fillies and mares offering a Breeders’ Cup “Win and You’re In” berth to the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Distaff. Pletcher said Spendthrift Farm’s dual graded stakes-winner Kingsbarns, runner-up in last weekend’s Grade 3 Pimlico Special, will point to the Grade 1, $1 million Stephen Foster on June 29 at Churchill, which offers a Breeders’ Cup “Win and You’re In” berth to the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Classic in November at Del Mar. Kingsbarns could be joined in the Stephen Foster by Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable’s Grade 1-placed Dreamlike, who is pointing to the Grade 3, $275,000 Blame, a nine-furlong test for older horses on June 1 at Churchill. “Dreamlike is scheduled to go to the Blame at Churchill which will hopefully be a prep for the Stephen Foster,” Pletcher said. “Kingsbarns will probably wait for the Stephen Foster.” Pletcher also noted that Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable’s Bright Future, last year’s Grade 1 Jockey Club Gold Cup winner, could target the Grade 3 Salvator Mile on June 15 at Monmouth Park for his seasonal debut. *** G3 Chick Lang-winner Frost Free set for G1 Woody Stephens Keene Thoroughbreds’ Frost Free, winner of last Friday’s Grade 3 Chick Lang at Pimlico Race Course, is slated to make his next start in the Grade 1, $500,0000 Woody Stephens on Belmont Stakes Day June 8 at Saratoga Race Course. The Chick Lang marked the graded stakes debut for both Frost Free and trainer Brett Creighton, who launched his career in 1989. “At the time, I didn’t really think about it but it’s an accomplishment,” Creighton said. “I’m proud of it. I really am.” Frost Free made every pole a winning one in the six-furlong Chick Lang, exiting post 6-of-8 under jockey Irad Ortiz, Jr. and powering home a 1 1/2-length winner over the muddy and sealed going. “That’s kind of his running style and I’m not going to try and change that,” Creighton said. “He’s improved every race. He’s more mature and grew up. This race did a whole lot for him, and I’m really pleased. He came back healthy and he’s sitting on go.” The $100,000 Texas Thoroughbred Association 2-Year-Old in Training Sale purchase made his first start last June for trainer Danny Pish at Lone Star Park, pouncing to a 1 1/4-length win in a five-furlong maiden special weight over sloppy going. He was transferred to Creighton and was off-the-board in the Advent and Renaissance in December at Oaklawn Park to complete his 2-year-old campaign. Frost Free has a perfect in-the-money record this year of 5-2-1-2, including an optional-claiming win going six furlongs on March 1 along with a third-place finish in the one-mile Hot Springs three weeks later ahead of a runner-up effort to Valentine Candy on April 27 in the six-furlong Bachelor. Creighton said the Hot Springs effort gives him confidence the talented grey can stretch his sprint skills to seven-eighths. “I took the blinkers off him and ran him a mile there at Oaklawn and he didn’t run a bad race first time around two turns,” Creighton said. “I think he’ll handle the seven furlongs.” Frost Free is out of the winning Union Rags mare D J’s Favorite, who is out of the stakes-winning Indian Charlie mare I’m Mom’s Favorite. *** Dornoch breezes for G1 Belmont Stakes West Paces Racing, R. A. Hill Stable, Belmar Racing and Breeding, Two Eight Racing, and Pine Racing Stables’ dual graded stakes-winner Dornoch had his first work back since the Kentucky Derby on May 4, covering a half-mile in 48.48 seconds Friday over Saratoga Race Course’s Oklahoma training track. The son of Good Magic is targeting the Grade 1, $2 million Belmont Stakes on June 8 at the Spa. Trained by Danny Gargan, Dornoch went in company with multiple stakes-winning New York-bred Ramblin’ Wreck, keeping on even terms with his workmate through to mid-stretch before drawing off easily and reaching the wire well in front. He continued to distance himself even further in the gallop out. “It was good. I told them to go 49 and they went 48 and change,” said Gargan. “Three weeks after the Derby, I only want to work him twice. He did it pretty handily.” Dornoch won the Grade 2 Remsen at Aqueduct Racetrack and Grade 2 Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Park en route to a fourth-place effort in the Grade 1 Blue Grass at Keeneland and a tenth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby where he drew the rail and was shuffled back at the half-mile call. He checked again at the quarter pole before running evenly down the lane to finish well back of the victorious Mystik Dan. “He ran good in the Derby for the trip he had and he still fought,” said Gargan. “He wanted to run, he just couldn’t.” Dornoch was a $325,000 purchase at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale and is out of the graded stakes-placed Big Brown mare Puca, making him a full-brother to the 2023 Kentucky Derby-winner Mage. *** Star Fortress en route for G1 New York John D. Gunther and Eurowest Bloodstock Services’ graded stakes-winner Star Fortress is pointing to a start in the Grade 1, $750,000 New York, a 1 3/16-mile turf test for older fillies and mares on June 7 at Saratoga Race Course. Trained by Cherie DeVaux, the 5-year-old Sea The Stars mare made her first seven starts in Europe for conditioner Ralph Beckett before making a memorable stateside debut for current connections when a 10-length winner of the nine-furlong Grade 3 Cardinal in Nov. over good-going at Churchill Downs. Star Fortress has made four starts this year, beginning with a troubled off-the-board effort in the Grade 2 Pegasus World Cup Filly and Mare Turf Invitational in January at Gulfstream Park. She was most recently a close second in the 11-furlong Grade 3 Sheepshead Bay here, rallying from last-of-5 to miss by a head to the pacesetting winner Royalty Interest. DeVaux said the moderate splits of 52.08 and 1:18.20 didn’t help her mare. “It wasn’t ideal, but she came with a really nice kick to just miss,” DeVaux said. “She seems to relish the distance. Even though this is a step back, the farther the better for her.” Twisted Chaps Racing Stables’ stakes-winner Medalla Match could make her next start in the Grade 2, $200,000 Intercontinental, a 5 1/2-furlong turf sprint for older fillies and mares on June 7 at Saratoga. The 6-year-old Summer Front mare spent her first 21 career starts with trainer Michael Biehler, taking the Ricks Memorial in September at Remington Park. She debuted last out on May 3 for DeVaux in the Grade 3 Unbridled Sydney traveling 5 1/2-furlongs over yielding Churchill turf to finish a good fourth, one length back of the victorious Ova Charged. “She came with a nice run. It would be more ideal if this race was six furlongs, but we have to run in the races that are there,” DeVaux said. DeVaux said she will wait to see how the mare breezes this week before her status is confirmed. DeVaux said that West Point Thoroughbred Racing and David Ingordo’s stakes-winner Northern Invader will point to the 1 1/16-mile Grade 3, $275,000 Arlington after his impressive pacesetting allowance win on April 19 at Keeneland. The now 4-year-old Ontario-bred son of Collected won the Gio Ponti in Oct. here ahead of runner-up efforts to Gigante in the off-the-turf Commonwealth Turf in Nov. at Churchill and the Woodchopper in December at Fair Grounds. “He ran well,” DeVaux said of the Keeneland effort. “It was his second time facing older and we just wanted to make sure before we put him back in stakes company that he was going to be able to handle that.”",

Piloted by Irad Ortiz, Jr. for the breeze, he worked with Candied, who had exercise rider Hector Ramos aboard as she prepared for the Grade 1, $500,000 DK Horse Acorn on June 7 at Saratoga Race Course. NYRA clockers had the pair completing a half-mile in 48.65 seconds over the Belmont Park dirt training track. “It was pretty even the whole way. I got them in 12 and 1, 24 and 3, 48 and 3, galloped out 1:01,” said Pletcher’s New York-based assistant Amelia Green. “It was a strong gallop out, 1:13 and 1. An eased down 1:26 and 4. Honestly, he did it very impressively on this track. “I’d say the track is a little faster today than it has been all week, but the way he did it was the main thing, which was well within himself,” Green added. Antiquarian, who is by the Centennial Farms-campaigned Preservationist, entered the Peter Pan from a sixth in the 1 3/16-mile Grade 2 Louisiana Derby after breaking through the gate on March 23 at Fair Grounds. Before that effort, the chestnut graduated at second asking going 1 1/16 miles there over next-out winner Cornishman. “Obviously, he is a colt, and she is a filly,” said Green regarding the work partners. “So, it is hard to judge them against each other, but she did it nicely, too.” Pletcher said he was pleased with the good report from Green. “Amelia said he worked really well, strong gallop out,” said Pletcher. “She said Irad was raving about how well he went. I’m happy with that. The plan is to ship here tomorrow.” Centennial Farms looks to add another Belmont Stakes to its historic resume featuring Colonial Affair capturing the ‘Test of the Champion’ in 1993. Eclipse Thoroughbred Partners’ Candied was on target for the Grade 1 Kentucky Oaks on May 3 but did not draw in after being listed as an also-eligible. The daughter of Candy Ride, who has recovered from a bruised quarter, now set her sights on the Grade 1, $500,000 DK Horse Acorn. “Candied has been doing well and that was a good work from her also,” said Pletcher. “We were disappointed we didn’t draw into the Oaks, but we’ll regroup and try this.” Candied graduated on debut in August at Saratoga and followed with a score in the Grade 1 Darley Alcibiades in Oct. at Keeneland before completing her juvenile campaign with a rallying third-place finish in the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies in Nov. at Santa Anita. She made her seasonal debut April 5 at Keeneland with a fourth-place finish in the 1 1/16-mile Grade 1 Ashland after exiting the inside post in a field of eight. “It was a little bit of a layoff and the inside post – I thought she ran well considering everything,” Pletcher said. “I think she should appreciate the added distance.” Repole Stable’s maiden Protective has made his last two starts in graded events traveling nine furlongs at the Big A, finishing third in the Grade 2 Wood Memorial presented by Resorts World Casino on April 6 and the Grade 3 Peter Pan on May 11. The Medaglia d’Oro colt, a $250,000 Keeneland September Yearling Sale purchase, endured a troubled trip in the Wood Memorial when bumped at the break and taken up. He was full of run down the lane when Deposition fell to his outside while trying to split rivals to the inside of Uncle Heavy. Despite the troubled trip, Protective finished strong to earn show honors 3 3/4-lengths back of the victorious Resilience. Last out, a more prominent Protective tracked from fourth position and stayed on strong to complete the trifecta two lengths back of his victorious stablemate Antiquarian, who was a three-quarter length winner over The Wine Steward. NYRA will waive the entry and starting fees to the Belmont Stakes, excluding the supplemental fee, for the first three finishers of the Peter Pan. Protective, out of the Grade 1-winning Empire Maker mare Grace Hall, had his first work back Wednesday, covering a half-mile in 48.68 over the Belmont dirt training track. “He breezed very well and he’s doing well,” Pletcher said. “We’re not committed to the Belmont, but we’re not ruling it out either. We will assess how he’s doing and how the field is shaping up and make a decision on entry day.” Pletcher will have several possible starters at the four-day 2024 Belmont Stakes Racing Festival, held at Saratoga Race Course from Thursday, June 6 through Sunday, June 9. Highlighted by the 156th edition of the Grade 1, $2 million Belmont Stakes presented by NYRA Bets on Saturday, June 8, the four-day Belmont Stakes Racing Festival will include 24 stakes races with purses totaling $10.25 million, the highest purse levels and number of stakes offered since the launch of the multi-day Festival in 2014. Whisper Hill Farm’s Kentucky homebred Charge It, a 5-year-old Tapit horse, will be nominated to a pair of races on Belmont Stakes Day, including the 10-furlong Grade 2, $350,000 Suburban and the Grade 1, $ 1 million Hill ‘N’ Dale Metropolitan Handicap, which offers a Breeders’ Cup “Win and You’re In” berth to the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Dirt Mile in November at Del Mar. “We’ll see how things shape up, but we’re probably leaning towards the Suburban with Charge It,” Pletcher said. Last year, Charge It ran fourth in the Grade 1 Met Mile one month ahead of a prominent 4 3/4-length score in the Grade 2 Suburban on July 8 when both races were held at Belmont Park. Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable’s Crupi is also pointing to the Suburban. He won a pair of Listed nine-furlong stakes this winter at Aqueduct, taking the Discovery in November and Queens County against elders on New Year’s Eve. He was a closing third in the Grade 1 Pegasus World Cup Invitational in January and was last seen finishing 10th in the Group 1 Dubai World Cup on March 30 at Meydan Racecourse. Joseph Allen and CHC Inc.’s multiple graded stakes-placed Talk of the Nation will point to the Grade 3, $350,000 Poker, a one-mile turf test for older horses on Belmont Stakes Day June 8. The 4-year-old Quality Road colt made his first eight starts for Hall of Fame trainer Shug McGaughey, winning the Columbia at Tampa Bay Downs and Gun Runner at Kentucky Downs last year along with runner-up efforts in the Grade 3 Manila at Belmont and the Grade 3 Bryan Station at Keeneland. He made his seasonal debut last out for Pletcher, setting the pace in the one-mile Listed Opening Verse on May 2 at Churchill Downs where he was nailed at the wire by Carl Spackler, who prevailed by a head. “I thought he ran great at Churchill. It was a tough beat, but he ran really well,” Pletcher said. “Hopefully, second time off the layoff he makes a move forward.” Among other possible Belmont Stakes Racing Festival starters for Pletcher are Repole Stable’s graded stakes-winner Surprisingly, who will target the Grade 1, $750,000 New York, a 1 3/16-mile turf test for older fillies and mares on June 7; and KimDon Racing’s graded stakes-placed Tizzy in the Sky, last-out winner of the Big A’s Listed Top Flight Invitational, who will try the Grade 1, $500,000 Ogden Phipps presented by Ford, a nine-furlong test for older fillies and mares offering a Breeders’ Cup “Win and You’re In” berth to the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Distaff. Pletcher said Spendthrift Farm’s dual graded stakes-winner Kingsbarns, runner-up in last weekend’s Grade 3 Pimlico Special, will point to the Grade 1, $1 million Stephen Foster on June 29 at Churchill, which offers a Breeders’ Cup “Win and You’re In” berth to the Grade 1 Breeders’ Cup Classic in November at Del Mar. Kingsbarns could be joined in the Stephen Foster by Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable’s Grade 1-placed Dreamlike, who is pointing to the Grade 3, $275,000 Blame, a nine-furlong test for older horses on June 1 at Churchill. “Dreamlike is scheduled to go to the Blame at Churchill which will hopefully be a prep for the Stephen Foster,” Pletcher said. “Kingsbarns will probably wait for the Stephen Foster.” Pletcher also noted that Repole Stable and St. Elias Stable’s Bright Future, last year’s Grade 1 Jockey Club Gold Cup winner, could target the Grade 3 Salvator Mile on June 15 at Monmouth Park for his seasonal debut. *** G3 Chick Lang-winner Frost Free set for G1 Woody Stephens Keene Thoroughbreds’ Frost Free, winner of last Friday’s Grade 3 Chick Lang at Pimlico Race Course, is slated to make his next start in the Grade 1, $500,0000 Woody Stephens on Belmont Stakes Day June 8 at Saratoga Race Course. The Chick Lang marked the graded stakes debut for both Frost Free and trainer Brett Creighton, who launched his career in 1989. “At the time, I didn’t really think about it but it’s an accomplishment,” Creighton said. “I’m proud of it. I really am.” Frost Free made every pole a winning one in the six-furlong Chick Lang, exiting post 6-of-8 under jockey Irad Ortiz, Jr. and powering home a 1 1/2-length winner over the muddy and sealed going. “That’s kind of his running style and I’m not going to try and change that,” Creighton said. “He’s improved every race. He’s more mature and grew up. This race did a whole lot for him, and I’m really pleased. He came back healthy and he’s sitting on go.” The $100,000 Texas Thoroughbred Association 2-Year-Old in Training Sale purchase made his first start last June for trainer Danny Pish at Lone Star Park, pouncing to a 1 1/4-length win in a five-furlong maiden special weight over sloppy going. He was transferred to Creighton and was off-the-board in the Advent and Renaissance in December at Oaklawn Park to complete his 2-year-old campaign. Frost Free has a perfect in-the-money record this year of 5-2-1-2, including an optional-claiming win going six furlongs on March 1 along with a third-place finish in the one-mile Hot Springs three weeks later ahead of a runner-up effort to Valentine Candy on April 27 in the six-furlong Bachelor. Creighton said the Hot Springs effort gives him confidence the talented grey can stretch his sprint skills to seven-eighths. “I took the blinkers off him and ran him a mile there at Oaklawn and he didn’t run a bad race first time around two turns,” Creighton said. “I think he’ll handle the seven furlongs.” Frost Free is out of the winning Union Rags mare D J’s Favorite, who is out of the stakes-winning Indian Charlie mare I’m Mom’s Favorite. *** Dornoch breezes for G1 Belmont Stakes West Paces Racing, R. A. Hill Stable, Belmar Racing and Breeding, Two Eight Racing, and Pine Racing Stables’ dual graded stakes-winner Dornoch had his first work back since the Kentucky Derby on May 4, covering a half-mile in 48.48 seconds Friday over Saratoga Race Course’s Oklahoma training track. The son of Good Magic is targeting the Grade 1, $2 million Belmont Stakes on June 8 at the Spa. Trained by Danny Gargan, Dornoch went in company with multiple stakes-winning New York-bred Ramblin’ Wreck, keeping on even terms with his workmate through to mid-stretch before drawing off easily and reaching the wire well in front. He continued to distance himself even further in the gallop out. “It was good. I told them to go 49 and they went 48 and change,” said Gargan. “Three weeks after the Derby, I only want to work him twice. He did it pretty handily.” Dornoch won the Grade 2 Remsen at Aqueduct Racetrack and Grade 2 Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Park en route to a fourth-place effort in the Grade 1 Blue Grass at Keeneland and a tenth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby where he drew the rail and was shuffled back at the half-mile call. He checked again at the quarter pole before running evenly down the lane to finish well back of the victorious Mystik Dan. “He ran good in the Derby for the trip he had and he still fought,” said Gargan. “He wanted to run, he just couldn’t.” Dornoch was a $325,000 purchase at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale and is out of the graded stakes-placed Big Brown mare Puca, making him a full-brother to the 2023 Kentucky Derby-winner Mage. *** Star Fortress en route for G1 New York John D. Gunther and Eurowest Bloodstock Services’ graded stakes-winner Star Fortress is pointing to a start in the Grade 1, $750,000 New York, a 1 3/16-mile turf test for older fillies and mares on June 7 at Saratoga Race Course. Trained by Cherie DeVaux, the 5-year-old Sea The Stars mare made her first seven starts in Europe for conditioner Ralph Beckett before making a memorable stateside debut for current connections when a 10-length winner of the nine-furlong Grade 3 Cardinal in Nov. over good-going at Churchill Downs. Star Fortress has made four starts this year, beginning with a troubled off-the-board effort in the Grade 2 Pegasus World Cup Filly and Mare Turf Invitational in January at Gulfstream Park. She was most recently a close second in the 11-furlong Grade 3 Sheepshead Bay here, rallying from last-of-5 to miss by a head to the pacesetting winner Royalty Interest. DeVaux said the moderate splits of 52.08 and 1:18.20 didn’t help her mare. “It wasn’t ideal, but she came with a really nice kick to just miss,” DeVaux said. “She seems to relish the distance. Even though this is a step back, the farther the better for her.” Twisted Chaps Racing Stables’ stakes-winner Medalla Match could make her next start in the Grade 2, $200,000 Intercontinental, a 5 1/2-furlong turf sprint for older fillies and mares on June 7 at Saratoga. The 6-year-old Summer Front mare spent her first 21 career starts with trainer Michael Biehler, taking the Ricks Memorial in September at Remington Park. She debuted last out on May 3 for DeVaux in the Grade 3 Unbridled Sydney traveling 5 1/2-furlongs over yielding Churchill turf to finish a good fourth, one length back of the victorious Ova Charged. “She came with a nice run. It would be more ideal if this race was six furlongs, but we have to run in the races that are there,” DeVaux said. DeVaux said she will wait to see how the mare breezes this week before her status is confirmed. DeVaux said that West Point Thoroughbred Racing and David Ingordo’s stakes-winner Northern Invader will point to the 1 1/16-mile Grade 3, $275,000 Arlington after his impressive pacesetting allowance win on April 19 at Keeneland. The now 4-year-old Ontario-bred son of Collected won the Gio Ponti in Oct. here ahead of runner-up efforts to Gigante in the off-the-turf Commonwealth Turf in Nov. at Churchill and the Woodchopper in December at Fair Grounds. “He ran well,” DeVaux said of the Keeneland effort. “It was his second time facing older and we just wanted to make sure before we put him back in stakes company that he was going to be able to handle that.”",

        "description": "The Memorial Day ceremony was the first at the cemetery since its ownership was officially transferred from the City of Vallejo to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs in late November.",
        "content": "Sacramento Valley National Cemetery Director Ashaley Jackson had a simple request on Monday morning at Mare Island’s National Cemetery Memorial Day event. Say their names out loud. Since World War I, more than 600,000 people have lost their lives in military conflicts, according to data maintained by the U.S. government. The deadliest conflict for the United States over this time frame was during World War II, where 400,000 service members died, while more than 7,000 military members have died as part of the military operations tied to Afghanistan and Iraq. These aren’t just statistics — they’re people. People who had dreams, plans, ambitions that were cut short so instead generations after them could have those opportunities many take for granted. “Our presence today ensures that these veterans and their families will not be forgotten,” Jackson said. “We have been given a sacred trust to care and maintain the memory of the service members and families who have been laid to rest here at Mare Island.” Earlier in the ceremony the point was also driven home by California State Representative Lori Wilson who said, “Our freedoms did not come free.” “On a beautiful day like today with the wind blowing and seeing the water from afar and realizing how blessed we are to breathe the air we are breathing right now,” Wilson said. “We’re doing this now because of others that cannot. People we love, people we adore, people we cared for and people that served that created safety to allow each one of us to have liberty and freedom that we get to have today. And that is extremely important today. “This is not about a vacation day. Today is about recognition and giving honor to those who have given their lives for our country.” Longtime veteran advocate Nestor Aliga teared up a little when describing what Memorial Day meant for himself. “It’s a tough day,” Aliga said. “It reminds me so much of a lot of fellow service members in the Marine Corps and the Army that were so young and they went to heaven. I think of them a lot today. My tribute to them is a year-round thing but I like to visit the graves, say the names of the fallen heroes and thank God for blessing all of us here today.” The ceremony was the first at the cemetery since its ownership was officially transferred from the City of Vallejo to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs in late November. The cemetery, the oldest Naval one on the West Coast, has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. It has three Congressional Medal of Honor recipients — James Cooney, Alexander Parker and William Halford. The cemetery has gone through a major restoration. Neglected for years, a process to repair it began shortly after retired U.S. Navy Commander Ralph Parrott visited the venue in 2017 and voiced his displeasure over the condition to then-Vallejo Mayor Bob Sampayan. Jackson told Monday’s crowd that work will continue at the cemetery and will include replacing damaged headstones, raising and realigning headstones and markers, installing an irrigation system and replacing the cemetery’s turf. “This place is truly a magical platform. We sit here and hear the birds singing, feel the comfort of the breeze with the train whistles in the background, we know it’s a very fitting location for a cemetery such as this,” said Vallejo Mayor Robert McConnell, who is also a veteran. “We enter these grounds we can remember those who had friends who fell. So it’s a very fitting place.” Norman Reece, one of a slew of veterans at the service, served in the U.S. Navy in Vietnam. “These are the ones that paid the ultimate price,” Reece said. “It’s very humbling to be able to honor them. I personally was in Vietnam but in a very safe area, so I really respect those that were. This place is special because it has a long history.” Kenneth Kolby of San Francisco came to the event, and although not a veteran himself, he considers himself a “true patriot.” Kolby roamed the cemetery after the ceremony and while carrying a large United States flag, picked up other flags near gravesites that had blown away due to the wind. “I come here quite often. I want to give respect to those who fought and died for this nation,” Kolby said. “Especially in light of those who do not support this nation today and those who don’t respect the proper spending of money and the increase in taxes they want for next year. I am a patriot ... we need maybe a little more patriotism in the public square.”",

        "description": "Get to know the only MAFS NZ couple who are still married — and in love.",
        "content": "Alex Casey takes a trip to Lincoln to visit the only couple from the first season of Married at First Sight NZ who are still together. Originally published by the Spinoff To cross the threshold into Brett and Angel’s marital abode is to be greeted with a welcome that sums up the MAFS NZ season one golden couple perfectly. “Come on in,” the doormat exclaims, “we’re awesome!” The pair meet me at the door with huge bear hugs, both wearing Crocs studded with matching Lincoln FC Jibbitz. As we go to sit down at their kitchen table, Brett turns off a noisy plastic hedgehog toy, placing it down on a tiny table near a stack of soft-coloured blocks. Their daughter, Vienna , is with Nana for the morning, but she, too, clearly has awesome vibes. Looking across their sun-soaked 4ha Lincoln lifestyle block, I posit to the pair an eerie Sliding Doors -inspired thought: none of this would be here if they hadn’t both applied for Married at First Sight NZ nearly seven years ago. “Sometimes I just forget that that’s how we met because it’s been so long now,” Brett says with a laugh. “I never think about meeting Angel on a TV show, it wouldn’t even cross my mind. I can go a whole year and not think about MAFS once.” Angel admits she thinks about it slightly more often, and gets “goosebumps” if she ponders it too hard. Fans of season one of Married at First Sight NZ will remember the pair’s competing giant grins and relentlessly sunny disposition, even when faced with catty cliques and explosive dinner parties. He was a woodworking boy from the South, she was a marketing girl from the North, and both recall throwing in an application video off the cuff. “I just grabbed my phone one day at work and said I ran a side business, that I was 32 and looking to settle down — that was about it,” says Brett. “It was pretty short and sweet.” Angel says she was “frigging young” at just 26 when she applied for the show. “I’d lived a pretty crazy life, I’d lived overseas for years, I’d already done a lot of s***,” she said with a laugh. Already a big reality romance fan, she didn’t like the idea of having to fight over one person as with formats like The Bachelor. “I loved with Married that there was this deeper commitment to it, and I loved that whoever was going on this was probably wanting to settle down.” Both admit they had a similar, open-minded attitude to going on the show. “The way we’ve always approached life is really random and out the gate,” says Angel. “We’re pretty optimist, glass-half-full people. Life can throw us anything and we don’t really blink eyes about it.” Although she didn’t have a particular type she was looking for, Angel did have one serious caveat when it came to her “icks” in a man. “I remember the only thing I said was that I didn’t want anyone that started their day with a Red Bull and a pie,” she cackles. “But Brett starts his day with a Pepsi Max and a pie, so that’s okay.” Brett got cast only two weeks before the wedding. “It was just like ‘all right, you’re flying up tomorrow to Auckland to meet the team’. It was quite cleverly done, they don’t really give you any time to think about it.” Elsewhere in Auckland, Angel had been flown up to choose her wedding dress. “I was only allowed to try on three dresses at the shop so I was just like ‘s*** a brick’,” she said, laughing. “The first one was really classic, the second one was total marshmallow queen, and in the last one I looked like a sausage stuck in casing.” High anxiety The night before their wedding, both of them recall having feelings of anxiety and restlessness in their hotel rooms. “I could barely sleep,” says Angel, who had also just experienced the first spray tan of her life. “But my sister was freaking out even more than me because she’d been married before.” Brett was so worried about sleeping through his 5am alarm that he made his best man sleep in his room with him. Neither of them knew where they were getting married the next day. “They were hectic organising six weddings at once, so the communication wasn’t great.” As it turns out, they were to be married in romantic Kumeū. Brett arrived first, and remembers being offered a shot of coffee tequila to take the edge off. “Then I had to go up and stand at the altar for ages and ages without any of my groomsmen, the bastards.” Meanwhile Angel and her dad were nattering away in an old vintage car as it crawled towards the venue. I ask if she can remember the first moment she saw Brett. “Oh man,” she says with a laugh, blinking back giant, happy tears. “It was just fricking crazy, I just remember this really big smile.” While Angel wipes her tears, our chat is interrupted with a knock at the door — Brett’s mum is cradling their 2-year-old daughter Vienna, who is crying. She hasn’t had a happy morning and needs her parents. Immediately, the pair shoot out of their seats and activate MAFS Mum and Dad mode, Brett popping Shrek on the telly and Angel pulling a syringe of baby medicine and loading up a tray with snacks and sucky yoghurt pouches. I offer to leave, but they insist she’ll be fine in a few minutes — as promised, neither is blinking eyes about it. We retire to their lounge area as Vienna snuggles into Brett on the couch, Angel nearly vanishes into a giant forest-green beanbag, and Shrek and Donkey make their way to Duloc. Where were we? Their first looks at the wedding. “Straight away I was just like ‘yeah, sweet’,” says Brett. “She looked good.” The first interaction they had was a slightly confused one, with Angel asking “how are you” twice and Brett simply replying “I am 34′′. Later, during their newlywed photoshoot, Brett recalls another near-flub when he was asked to pick up his bride. “I’d been awake since 4.30am, I’d hardly eaten, I was so nervous, I’d had a tequila shot, so I picked her up and I’m just standing there like ‘oh my God, I’m going to pass out’.” Even with the presence of TV cameras and blue tape on the soles of their rental shoes to ensure they didn’t get dirty, the pair remember the wedding feeling very natural. “The No 1 question we still get is ‘are you ever going to have an actual wedding’ and we’re just like nah, that was good. Why would we bother doing it all again?” The families and friends mingled and revelled in the open bar and, despite most of the filmed reception being soundtrack-less due to rights issues, they were allowed to play You and Me by Lifehouse for their first dance. Just the two of us Then came the honeymoon in Adelaide, where the pair finally got some alone time without cameras. “We were really lucky because the plane was delayed. So we almost had like six or eight hours to talk and get to know each other and ask each other all these big life questions,” says Brett. “I remember this old woman looking at us like ‘are you two ever going to shut up’.” They spent their honeymoon at a famous filming location for McLeod’s Daughters , where Brett recalls being wined and dined with haute cuisine and premium plonk, when all he wanted was “mashed potatoes, sausages, peas” and a can of Diet Coke. His southern charm continued to shine when it came time to tip their gracious host. “I thought I would give him this big bag of nuts,” he roars. “It wasn’t nuts, it was scroggin,” corrects Angel. “She’s given me s*** about that for seven years, but I still reckon he was a big-bag-of-nuts guy.” When they returned to New Zealand, their MAFS experience got even nuttier. While they had been babbling in bubble baths, almost all the other couples had hit the rocks already. “We came back from our honeymoon and went to that first dinner party, and everyone was just at each other’s throats,” remembers Angel. “We did feel a bit bad that our relationship was going well when everyone else was crumbling around us. We really didn’t want to be all lovey-dovey and rub it in their faces.” They both knew they had fallen in love early on, but wanted to wait to tell each other after the show had finished filming. “We wanted to keep something for us, given that we were opening up everything else for everyone.” The moment came when they were holed up in an Auckland hotel room, watching the latest MAFS episode together after doing a day of publicity. “I remember that I said it first, but then Brett tried to beat me to it,” says Angel. “It’s just three words, but we just knew,” he says, patting Vienna’s curls as she snoozes. Real fandom Visiting each other in secret while the show was airing, Brett and Angel soon captured the hearts of the nation. “The fandom was real, and that puts lots of pressure on you as a couple when you’re still trying to get to know each other,” Angel says. “We also didn’t realise we were literally going to be the only ones who made it, so that put even more of a spotlight on us,” adds Brett. In one of the most divine showings of public support, there was even a sign outside an Auckland church saying “God loves you as much as Brett loves Angel”. The show finished airing in November, and Angel had moved down to Lincoln before Christmas. It was the talk of the town — the local gas station also erected a sign that proclaimed WELCOME TO LINCOLN ANGEL. Then came their French bulldog Cashew, their first home, a massive group of friends and eventually their daughter Vienna. “We’ve been in baby jail for a year and we’re just emerging now,” says Angel with a laugh. “We love a good concert — we’re going to Pearl Jam, Hozier, Fisher. We love a good gig.” And to this day, they get recognised when they head out in public. “People will always just look at you a certain way and say ‘I know you from somewhere’,” says Brett. “This one guy was like ‘I went to the Chiefs game with you didn’t I’ and I was like mate I’ve never been to a Chiefs game in my life.” With the first season airing as far afield as the UK and Portugal, they also get contacted by people from around the world. “People just love a love story,” says Angel. “I love that we gave so many people hope that they could fall in love.” As she launches out of her beanbag and prepares for Vienna’s naptime, I ask what they will tell their daughter when she asks how they met. “We’ve got the wedding on DVD and I’ve got an old PlayStation with a DVD player, but that probably won’t last forever,” says Brett. “She’ll be like ‘okay, so you met on TV ... what’s TV?’ It will probably just be like a fairytale story to her.” Shrek and Fiona profess their love for each other on the screen as Brett heads off to work at Woodpecker Signs and Angel puts Vienna down for a nap. A fairytale story indeed. Married at First Sight NZ returns on Sunday night at 7 on Three. Share this article",

        "description": "He was fatally shot when he came across 3 men trying to steal the catalytic converter from his vehicle, police said.",
        "content": "By Richard Winton and Tony Briscoe, Los Angeles Times (TNS) LOS ANGELES — “General Hospital” actor Johnny Wactor was fatally shot early Saturday when he came upon three men trying to steal the catalytic converter from his car, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case. The killing occurred around 3:25 a.m. when the owner of a vehicle encountered three people near Pico Boulevard and Hope Street attempting to steal the car part, said Officer Jader Chaves, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department. The man was shot by one of the thieves before all three fled in a vehicle, said Chaves. The officer did not identify the victim but said he was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A source on Sunday confirmed to The L.A. Times that the victim was Wactor, who played Brando Corbin on “General Hospital ” from 2020 to 2022. He also had roles on other shows, including “Westworld,” “Criminal Minds” and “Station 19.” Wactor, who had been working as a bartender in downtown L.A. on Saturday evening, was walking a co-worker to her car after their shift, Wactor’s brother, Grant Wactor, told The Times on Sunday. On the way, he noticed a group of men crowded around his car, and he confronted them because he thought he was being towed. That was when he was shot. The thieves were after Wactor’s catalytic converter , police said. The exhaust emission control device is typically found in the undercarriage of a vehicle and contains precious metals including rhodium, palladium and platinum. Thieves can make hundreds of dollars selling them to auto parts suppliers or scrapyards, where they can be melted down and the valuable metals extracted. “My mother is tough as nails, but she’s broken down to the bone,” said Grant Wactor, Johnny’s younger brother. “We have to get him back to Charleston (S.C.). It’s just a shame. It seems like it was just the wrong place, wrong time.” Johnny Wactor attends the \"Silent River\" opening night theatrical premiere at Laemmle Glendale on Oct. 13, 2022, in Glendale, California. (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Curious Potato, file) TNS Wactor, 37, left “General Hospital” in 2022 when his popular character was written out of the show. At the time, he told Soap Opera Digest he enjoyed the show’s large and loyal fan base. “It was all new to me, and it was a blessing,” he said. “It made it fun to go to work and then be excited about seeing people react to the storylines you were in. That they actually cared was really cool.” Grant Wactor said his brother was drawn to acting from an early age. Growing up in Summerville, S.C., Johnny participated in every play he could in his elementary and middle schools. Not long after graduating from the College of Charleston in 2009, he packed up his Honda Civic and made the cross-country drive to Los Angeles to begin his acting career. “I can’t emphasize how hard of a worker he was,” Grant Wactor said. “He would flip the Scrabble board at home because he was so competitive. But he was also one of the most charismatic people I knew. Because when he talked or listened, you could tell it was genuine.” Johnny Wactor had recently been exploring opportunities in screenwriting while working temporarily as a bartender. “He lived life his way,” Grant Wactor said. “He did exactly what he wanted, even to his last day. That’s who he was day in, day out. He walked the walk.” Former colleagues took to social media to mourn Wactor’s death on Sunday. “Johnny Wactor was a beautiful, beautiful soul,” former “General Hospital” actor Parry Shen said on X. “We all were cheated of many years with him.” Jon Lindstrom, a longtime cast member on the ABC soap, posted: “I am literally sick to my stomach at this news.” He called Wactor “one of those rare young men in this business who was kind, unassuming, humble.” “General Hospital” issued a statement saying the soap opera family was “heartbroken to hear of Johnny Wactor’s untimely passing. He was truly one of a kind and a pleasure to work with each and every day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during this difficult time.” His co-star and love interest on the show, Sofia Mattsson, added: “So genuine. So caring. Incredibly hard working and humble. With a huge heart that spread so much kindness and joy. He always made sure everyone around him felt seen, heard and loved. I admire the man he was so much and I’m a better person for having known him.” Thefts of catalytic converters skyrocketed in California during the COVID-19 pandemic, which some attributed to an increase in economic distress. The trend prompted new state laws that make it illegal for recyclers to buy the part from anyone other than the legal owner or a licensed dealer and increase penalties for buyers who fail to certify that a catalytic converter wasn’t stolen.

        "content": "Nearly two years ago, Chanel Ayan revealed on an episode of The Real Housewives of Dubai that she and her older sister Ifrah were circumcised as children without her family’s knowledge. Now, Ayan, 45, is opening up about that moment, telling Tamra Judge and Teddi Mellencamp on the May 27 episode of their Two Ts in a Pod podcast that “not even my closest friends knew I don’t have a most of my vagina.” The Kenya-born model also shared that, after her story aired on the August 2022 episode of RHODubai, she didn’t receive the reaction she expected. “When my story aired, Tamra, nobody reached out to me, and I mean nobody reached out to me,” Ayan claimed. “I was on my own in my house crying, closing the curtains, now knowing that the whole entire world knows this about me.” From left: Sara Al Madani, Caroline Brooks, Lesa Milan, Francesca Amiker, Chanel Ayan, Caroline Stanbury and Taleen Marie of ‘The Real Housewives of Dubai’ at BravoCon 2023. Trae Patton/Bravo via Getty Ayan said that in her predominately Muslim culture, people don’t typically discuss this type of subject matter. “Everything I’m doing is, like, the opposite of what I’m supposed to be doing,” she said. “And then I got the worst backlash, man. ‘We don’t accept you. We don’t want you. Who the do you think you are?’ Like, I was being crazy. I was on my own. I was, like, so stressed. I was having bad thoughts. I was so angry with myself.” The mom of teenage son Taj said she tried to “amp up myself” by listening to Nicki Minaj songs after filming “because I was really scared of what I did.” “I had to tell my husband. I had to tell my son. I had to tell my sisters because I knew I’m gonna get a lot of backlash,” Ayan continued. She called the fallout after the episode aired “the worst moment of my life,” adding, “Every time I walk around, I don’t think people see me as this girl that’s, like, funny. I feel like the first thing they see me is they know my story, and I’m OK with that now.” Some good did come out of going public with her genital mutilation experience, though. “Literally in the worst moments of my life, the messages I got from women that have gone through the same thing as me was insane,” Ayan said. “It was insane. I think that’s one of the things that kept me going. And then listening to the stories, and then me sitting there and replying back.” Chanel Ayan with her famiily at a beach clean-up at The Secret Beach, Al Sufouh on June 07, 2023 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Cedric Ribeiro/Getty Images for HUDA Beauty Ayan previously told PEOPLE that her husband Christopher “supported me and loved me for who I am” after he learned about her circumcision at age 5. “Nobody has ever heard me talk about it,” she said. “It wasn’t a plan for me to do it. I was so embarrassed my whole entire life. I never slept.” The reality star ended up opening about it during a hypnotherapy session with fellow Housewife Dr. Sara Al-Madani. For Ayan, it helped her reclaim control of her narrative. “Yes, I am a victim, but I have my power now because I talked about it,” Ayan said. “I feel like saying it [helps me] to get me my power back and confidence that I’ve always lost in it with my body and things like that.” Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE’s free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

        "content": "Related video: A DUI driver in a Tesla hit a concrete wall and nearly crashed with other cars on the Howard Frankland Bridge on Sunday night. HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA) — Officials made dozens of arrests over Memorial Day Weekend, including those driving- and boating under the influence. In a joint operation with the Florida Highway Patrol, Tampa police and Plant City police, officials in Hillsborough County conducted 367 traffic stops and 17 vessel stops. Within those traffic stops were 38 DUI’s, 34 citations, and 333 warnings. A 58-year-old man, Jose Eyngonesz Castillo, was arrested and charged with a DUI and refusal to submit to testing on Sunday afternoon after he was caught driving the wrong way on North 50th Street in Tampa. Out on the water, the Marine Unit made 17 stops resulting in two BUI arrests, 26 warnings and 10 citations. “Our deputies have made substantial DUI and BUI arrests over Memorial Day weekend, demonstrating our commitment to keeping Hillsborough County safe,” Sheriff Chad Chronister said. “It’s never okay to drink and drive, and if you do, be assured that we will catch you, and you will face the consequences. We are here to protect our citizens and ensure everyone can enjoy the holiday responsibly and safely.” The sheriff’s office said they continued their heightened patrol throughout Monday.",

        "content": "Showbiz | Celebrity News I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . The Britain’s Got Talent live semi-final returned to see opera singer Innocent Masuku and taekwondo group Ssaulabi Performance Troupe win a place in Sunday’s final. The ITV talent show kicked off on Monday with the first live semi-final featuring judges Simon Cowell , Amanda Holden , Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli , alongside presenters Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. A public vote saw singer Masuku automatically through to the final, while the judges voted for Ssaulabi Performance Troupe over dog act The Trickstars to continue to compete for the £250,000 prize and a spot at the Royal Variety Performance. The South Korean taekwondo group, who were McPartlin and Donnelly’s golden buzzer act, said they practise five hours a day and received all four votes from the judges to make the final after their “cinematic blockbuster” live performance. “If that was a movie, that would have taken about a week to shoot literally, it would,” Cowell said of their performance. “And the fact that you did the whole thing live in about two-and-a-half minutes, says everything about you. “I forget how many years we’ve been doing this now actually, but this is actually one of the best live show performances I’ve ever seen on this show.” Meanwhile, South African opera singer Masuku, who wowed the judges in his January audition before getting married, said “this is my year” after winning a spot on the bill for the final. Dixon described him as “the one to beat”, while Tonioli said his act was “flawless”. Cowell said: “How snobby classical music is, I mean it really is, it is just awful and you deserve this opportunity because you are incredibly talented, you performed like a lead, you have that presence about you and your control over the song, everything about it for me was immaculate.” The first live semi-final of this year saw Lucy Heath and her five dogs perform as The Trickstars to the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory themed dance. The dog trainer made the final of the talent show eight years ago, but missed a spot in the final line-up following the judges’ unanimous vote. “I genuinely think your act has got better over the years,” Cowell said, adding he “loved it, loved it, loved it”. Nicki Minaj announces new date for postponed Co-op Live arena gig North Korean rocket launch may have failed, says Seoul Theresa May: I should have met Grenfell Tower survivors sooner Share your cat or dog's joyful moment to win Tonioli described the act as “charming” while Holden said “you really are the golden ticket”, referencing the Roald Dahl classic book and film. Comedian Bikoon! was up next but saw Dixon, Tonioli and Holden press their red buzzer as his “magic” bag failed several times to perform a simple trick. Cowell was visibly upset at the end of the performance when the magic bag opened to reveal a man inside, to which McPartlin joked the pair were a “Japanese Ant & Dec”. “I’m really upset, I think the bag should have remained a mystery,” Cowell said. Holden and Dixon also pressed their red buzzer for air guitar act Sven Smith. “Call me old-fashioned but I prefer a guitar and a microphone,” Dixon said, while Holden questioned his place in the semi-final. Tonioli’s golden buzzer recipient Taryn Charles received a much warmer response from the judges, after the singer performed a rendition of Lose Control by Teddy Swims. Cowell described it as a “genius choice of song”, adding: “I genuinely don’t think you could have done any more”, as well as calling it “beautifully raw”. However, the judge was less impressed with his own golden buzzer act, rollerskating couple Duo Stardust from Ukraine. “It wasn’t as good as the audition, I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight which is a real shame – we lost the focus of you,” he said. The pair finished their performance picking Tonioli from the panel and spinning him high into the air, which he described as “scary”. Meanwhile, Cowell said he preferred the first half of 11-year-old dancer Trey Braine’s performance, but also revealed he recently used the schoolboy to exemplify “someone I believe has star potential – when you’ve got it, you’ve got it”. “You’re naturally cool, naturally stylish, I really believe great things are going to happen in your life and your career,” he said. The cast of Disney’s The Lion King also performed on the show, to celebrate 30 years since the release of the film. Britain’s Got Talent live semi-finals will air each day until Friday at 8pm, with Sunday’s final at 7.30pm on ITV1 and ITVX.

        "description": "DALLAS – Karl-Anthony Towns' greatest contribution to the Western Conference finals was not supposed to come from his right knee.",
        "content": "DALLAS – Karl-Anthony Towns' greatest contribution to the Western Conference finals was not supposed to come from his right knee. In the second quarter of Game 3 against the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday night, Towns went for a rebound and inadvertently kicked Mavericks standout rookie Dereck Lively II in the side of the head after Lively fell to the court. Lively did not return because of what was described as a neck strain. With Lively out, the Timberwolves produced their best offensive quarter of the series in the third, with Towns briefly coming to life, but his series-long shooting slump helped doom the Wolves to a 116-107 loss and a 3-0 deficit in the series. During this postseason, Towns was a big reason the Wolves won their first two series, and he is a major reason they are set up to be swept in the third. \"He struggled, of course,\" Wolves coach Chris Finch said. \"It was hard to watch at times, but he had enough buckets here and there and kind of stayed in there defensively in the second half. Really pleased with the way he played, rebounded pretty well. But, yeah, you know, he's struggling, there's no doubt in that right now.\" Towns went 0-for-8 from beyond the three-point arc and 5-for-18 from the field. For the series, he is 15-for-54 overall. If Towns was shooting to his statistical norms, the Wolves would probably have won one or two of the first three games. Instead, he stood in a hallway outside the visiting locker room at American Airlines Center late Sunday night sounding like every player who has ever gone through a slump, mixing denial and hope into a nasty cocktail. \"It was deja vu because we come up again with a loss,\" Towns said while shaking his head and rubbing his face. \"So we've been so good at getting those wins. \"... I put up 1,500 shots a day. Shot so well all playoffs. ... Confidence extremely high and to be having these unfortunate bounces, these looks are just not going in. It's tough. \"... I don't mean to smile, but you have to laugh. It's very disappointing.\" Towns was wearing a faded jean jacket that read, on the back, \"Miracle Academy.\" He wore a Yankees baseball cap, turned backward. He once called himself the greatest shooting big man in NBA history, and while statistics qualify him to be in that conversation, he might be dooming his reputation in this series. It's not just his shot that is failing — it's his decisionmaking. He looks so desperate to turn around his fortunes that he's driving into traffic or rushing open shots. He has the skill set to help the Wolves turn this into a competitive series, or at least to salvage a victory, but how do you resurrect your confidence when you're on the road, facing elimination in Game 4? If Lively has a concussion or can't recover quickly from his neck strain, the Wolves should have a major advantage on the front line in Game 4. Lively's bounciness and savvy had helped him nullify the Wolves' supposed big-man advantage, but without him in the lineup, the Wolves offense began finding ways to get to the basket. Kyle Anderson, who has one of the ugliest shots in the NBA, began weaving into the paint and scoring at will. Towns, a far superior shooter, should be able to feast on this version of the Mavericks defense. But he disappeared in the fourth quarter when the game could have been won. In the 2022 playoffs, D'Angelo Russell became so inept that Finch benched him late in games. In the 2024 playoffs, Towns was benched during Game 2. The Wolves might be asking themselves the same question regarding Towns that they asked about Russell: Can you keep him if you can't play him in the biggest moments? ©2024 StarTribune.

        "description": "The new ‘triple lock plus’ would ensure pensioners’ tax free allowance rises in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%.",
        "content": "Business | Money Pensioners will be given a tax break worth £2.4 billion a year, Rishi Sunak is expected to promise. The Prime Minister will announce on Tuesday that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock, as he continues the Conservatives’ election campaign. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners’ tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the “triple lock plus”, the policy is estimated to cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30, a price tag which mirrors Mr Sunak’s proposed national service duty for all 18-year-olds, billed at £2.5 billion a year. The tax cut will be funded through a previously announced plan to raise £6 billion a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. For individual pensioners, it would be worth around £100 in 2025 according to the Tories , and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension. The policy follows criticism of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance by 2p at the spring budget, after a similar cut in the autumn. State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Mr Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history Rishi Sunak The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. Labour will bring back growth, Reeves to tell businesses Burglary victims being ‘denied justice’ because of Tory failings, claims Davey Sunak shows off his football skills with young players on campaign trail Share your cat or dog's joyful moment to win “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.” Create a FREE account to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.

        "description": "The new ‘triple lock plus’ would ensure pensioners’ tax free allowance rises in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%.",
        "content": "Pensioners will be given a tax break worth £2.4 billion a year, Rishi Sunak is expected to promise. The Prime Minister will announce on Tuesday that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock, as he continues the Conservatives’ election campaign. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners’ tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the “triple lock plus”, the policy is estimated to cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30, a price tag which mirrors Mr Sunak’s proposed national service duty for all 18-year-olds, billed at £2.5 billion a year. The tax cut will be funded through a previously announced plan to raise £6 billion a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. For individual pensioners, it would be worth around £100 in 2025 according to the Tories , and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension. The policy follows criticism of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance by 2p at the spring budget, after a similar cut in the autumn. State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Mr Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock.

        "description": "EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same.",
        "content": "EDMONTON — Adam Henrique is set to join the action. Roope Hintz might be doing the same. Henrique will return to the lineup Monday when his Edmonton Oilers take on the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Western Conference final, head coach Kris Knoblauch said. Dallas counterpart Pete DeBoer added Hintz is a game-time decision. The Oilers and Stars are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven series after Dallas picked up a 3-1 home victory Saturday. Edmonton took the opener 3-2 in double overtime. Henrique suffered a suspected ankle injury in Game 5 of the first round against the Los Angeles Kings before briefly returning for Game 2 against the Vancouver Canucks. \"It's more nerve-racking watching than playing,\" the 34-year-old centre said. \"But watching the guys, seeing everybody come together and push through and battle, it was certainly great to watch, and see the team continue to get better. \"You're just itching to be a part of that.\" Acquired from the Anaheim Ducks ahead of the NHL trade deadline, Henrique has a goal and an assist in six playoff appearances this spring. Projected to play on a line with Warren Foegele and Derek Ryan in Game 3, he combined to score 24 goals and 51 points in the regular season. \"Very important player for us,\" Knoblauch said of Henrique. \"He can kill penalties, he can be on the power play, and he's a really good five-on-five player. There's games that we could have put him in. I would say he was very close — maybe not 100 per cent — but I'm sure if it was the Stanley Cup final Game 7 we would have had him in earlier.\" Oilers forward Ryan McLeod will be a healthy scratch. Hintz, the Stars' No. 1 centre, hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 4 of the second round against the Colorado Avalanche. The 27-year-old, who took part in an optional morning skate Monday, has two goals and four assists in 11 playoff games. He put up 30 goals and 65 points in 80 regular-season contests. \"He's just an awesome player,\" Stars centre Wyatt Johnston said. \"He's one of the best players in the in the world. You can't really replace a guy like that. \"Being able to get him back, it would be huge.\" McLeod comes out of Edmonton's lineup without a point in 14 playoff games. The 24-year-old has been part of an Oilers' penalty kill that has gone 20 straight short-handed opportunities without giving up a goal. Knoblauch compared McLeod, 24, taking a seat to the \"reset\" the team gave goaltender Stuart Skinner in Games 4 and 5 of the Vancouver series. \"There's a lot to like about his game,\" said the coach. \"A lot of it is from the penalty kill. He's been contributing a lot there with his quickness, his reads. Five-on-five, he hasn't been playing quite like he had been — especially around the middle part of the season. \"We've got a lot of players that are playing well. It's been difficult to take anybody out of the lineup.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. ___ Follow @JClipperton_CP on X. Joshua Clipperton, The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson had a medical emergency Sunday on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, his representatives said Monday. Tyson \"became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing,\" his representative said in a statement to The Times. \"He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.\" Tyson is now \"doing great,\" according to the representative. Tyson, 57, has been preparing to fight 27-year-old YouTube influencer Jake Paul on July 20 in Arlington, Texas. Tyson reigned as a world champion from 1987 to 1990, but retired from professional boxing in 2005 — when Paul was a child. The fight will be televised live on Netflix; the streaming giant has expanded its push into live entertainment in recent months with \"The Roast of Tom Brady\" and the multipart \"John Mulaney Presents: Everybody's in L.A.\" They also signed a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment to move the WWE's flagship weekly wrestling series \"Monday Night Raw\" to the streamer starting next year. Tyson — who was once boxing's youngest-ever heavyweight world champion — will be 58 when he faces off against Paul at AT&T Stadium this summer. The boxer's long saga in and out of the sport has included heavyweight titles, prison time, a memoir , a well-known cameo in \"The Hangover\" and, perhaps most infamously, biting off a small chunk of fellow boxer Evander Holyfield's ear during a 1997 fight. On Monday morning, Paul appeared to respond to Tyson's medical incident and subsequent questions about the upcoming fight on the social platform X , writing that people make things up \"before knowing the facts for clicks / likes. Nothing changed #PaulTyson.\" Tyson, who is considered one of boxing's all-time greats, has praised the brash Youtuber and former Disney Channel star in the past, saying last year that Paul's embrace of the sport was helping put bodies in seats. Like Tyson, the influencer-turned-fighter has also courted controversy in the past: He threw a massive house party during the summer 2020 height of the COVID-19 pandemic that sparked ire from Calabasas' mayor , among other issues . ©2024 Los Angeles Times.

        "content": "The first new Sublime song in 28 years has been released, and it features the band’s late frontman Bradley Nowell via outtakes. As Rolling Stone reports , the band released “Feel Like That (featuring Bradley Nowell)” on Friday. The song is the first from the band since Nowell passed away in May of 1996 due to a heroin overdose, and you can check it out below. Sublime broke up before they made it big, with their self-titled studio album (and major label debut) releasing two months after Nowell died. That album because a megahit, selling over 5 million copies in the US and spawning 1990s alt rock themes “What I Got,” “Santeria,” “Wrong Way,” and “Doin’ Time.” The band had already broken up following Nowell’s passing and have not released new music since. They reunited in December of 2023 with Nowell’s son Jakob having joined as singer; they also played with Jakob at Coachella and have additional tour dates going forward. Jakob also performs on “Feel Like That,” as does Scott Woodruff of reggae band Stick Figure. The track is built from a jam session in early 1996 that led to an improvised song that bootleggers originally named “Eireen.” “My dad has a verse and then I have a verse and then Stick closes out the song,” said Jakob of the song. He said of having the opportunity to collaborate with his father, “It’s a beautiful thing.”",

        "content": "Savvy Australians could earn a whopping $21 million in interest on their savings accounts with the rolling out of a new mobile phone prompt. Unveiled by banking giant Westpac on Monday, the new mobile phone push notification will alert customers on how to earn bonus interest. The big four bank said some 107,000 clients had already earned an average of $201 each in interest after responding to the mobile prompt. Managing Director of Transactional Banking Mandy Rutherford said the bank wanted to make it easier to maximise “hard-earned savings”. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. “These prompts are designed to help customers better understand opportunities to earn bonus interest and allow them to act quickly,” she said. “This is part of our (Westpac’s) continued investment in digital tools that help our customers make more informed decisions about their money.” Westpac customers are able to earn bonus interest on their Westpac Life savings account each month when they grow or increase their balance. Customers aged under 30 can also earn additional bonus interest when they use their debit card five times or more in just a single month. Westpac also issues online and mobile alerts to customers when introductory bonus rates expire, as well as about the maturity of date of term deposits. The bank’s announcement comes as many of the nation’s major banks introduce new features targeted at customers who may be struggling amid the cost of living crisis. Commonwealth Bank announced earlier this year that it had implemented loan deferrals and customised loan repayments for some borrowers.",

Tony, of Rye, East Sussex , said: “I heard the strike, saw the smoke and got in the vehicle. “We tailed over here as fast as we could and saw mass panic. People running everywhere. “I used my 4x4 to push vehicles out of the way. I just wanted to help where I could. “I don’t have a specific role here. I’m a humanitarian.

Over time, I have realized that all of those experiences have really made me who I am today and I wear them well.\" She also said writing down those experiences and hurts has helped her process them. \"I'll document my feelings, I'll put things down, they're very raw, they're very real, they're very in the moment, and I live them,\" the 'You're Still the One\" singer said. \"I like to live through my suffering.\" Some of those memories have also become , and the singer said: \"They're now reflections of what I've been through.

You really learn how to live and function while you’re afraid.\" \"When you’re in a very compromising, unsafe and dysfunctional childhood, it can either break you or it can make you very, very capable. I was definitely more prepared for the music industry than I should have been,\" she added. \"For as long as I can remember, I’ve had real clarity on what to do in a crisis. I was always able to manage myself and not fall apart. To remain focused and make decisions in challenging situations. And I learned that from the time I was a toddler.\"",

        "content": "Nigeria’s SubseaRobotix in collaboration with TSC Subsea, has moved to transform subsea engineering inspections in Nigeria through the deployment of advanced robotic solutions. The Global Sales Director and the Marketing Manager in charge of Europe and Africa, of TSC Subsea, a global leader, ROV-deployed robotic underwater inspection technology, Jonathan Bancroft and Michel Bezemer, respectively were in Lagos recently to visit their Nigerian partners, SubseaRobotix. While explaining the rationale behind the visit and the partnership, the Chief Technology Officer of SubseaRobotix, Nigeria, Bello Salihu, who received the TSC Subsea team in Lagos along with Mr Wale Olagundoye, the Sales Director of SubseaRobotix, explained via a statement made available to The PRIMANEWS on Friday, that the partnership with TSC Subsea is to provide solutions for their Nigerian clients who have subsea and deepwater engineering assets beyond the reach of divers and require robotic technology to inspect. Salihu, a fellow of the British Institute of Non-Destructive Testing and a veteran of subsea asset integrity campaigns worldwide, said, “Our partnership with TSC Subsea avails our clients in Nigeria with ROV-developed robotic Advanced Non-Destructive Testing (ANDT) solutions for the integrity inspection of subsea engineering assets.” The head of the visiting team, TSC Subsea’s Global Director of Sales, Jonathan Bancroft, emphasised the strategic importance of Nigeria to TSC Subsea and the alignment of their solutions with the increasing demand for robotic inspections in West Africa. According to him, the partnership avails Nigerian clients with remote-operated vehicles and deployed Advanced Non-Destructive Testing solutions for the integrity inspection of subsea assets. He stated, “A huge thank you to our hosts and partners at SubseaRobotix for a great week of customer visits and good company. “Nigeria is an important strategic region for TSC Subsea, and with the uptick in subsea robotic inspection in West Africa, our solutions are a perfect fit. We look forward to a long and rewarding partnership. “The challenges faced by oil and gas operators, especially those with deepwater operations, necessitate driverless solutions and non-human intervention. “Our robotic solutions and TSC Subsea’s proprietary technologies are designed to address these challenges efficiently,” he said. While highlighting the prospects of the collaboration, Wale Olagundoye, Director of Sales at SubseaRobotix, expressed satisfaction with the outcomes of the various meetings held during TSC Subsea’s visit. Olagundoye stressed, “We are very happy with the outcomes of the various meetings held with our potential clients when we received our partners, TSC Subsea, in Nigeria. “The action-packed week with back-to-back meetings with the operators was better than we anticipated. At SubseaRobotix, making a difference in the subsea inspection space in Nigeria is our primary focus, and it is great having TSC Subsea, an accomplished global player in this sector, in our corner,” he added. On his part, Marketing Manager for Europe and Africa at TSC Subsea, Michel Bezemer, pointed out that the benefits of face-to-face meetings with local asset owners in Nigeria were a strategic move to improve their presence in Africa. “Visiting the local asset owners in Nigeria allowed us to discuss in detail their inspection challenges and the solutions TSC Subsea has in their services portfolio to strategically solve them,” Bezema stressed, adding, “It is always a great opportunity to have open discussions during face-to-face meetings and solve a challenge on-the-spot with our bespoke Subsea robotic ANDT offerings. The extreme challenges of deep and ultra-deep assets in West Africa are the perfect fit for the TSC Subsea and SubseaRobotix partnership.” Our correspondent reports that through the partnership, SubseaRobotix and TSC Subsea are poised to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of subsea inspections in Nigeria, ensuring safer and more reliable operations for the oil and gas industry.",

        "content": "The Special Forces Command (SFC) have watered down claims that Brig. Gen Charity Bainababo lacks people management skills, describing the allegations as baseless and unfounded. “Our attention has been drawn to an article written by ChimpReports on one of our General Officers titled “Murmurs as SFC’s Brig Bainababo is Sent on Course in Jinja”.Having carefully analysed the article, it’s noted that, the story lacks the basic tenets of news writing in its entirety as it was only meant to dent the image of the Officer and there is no iota of truth in what has been written,” the SFC Public Information Officer, Maj. Jimmy Denis Omara said in a statement dated 27th May, 2024. According to Maj. Omara, it is true Brig. Gen. Bainababo has been sent to the National Defence College for further studies but this is a normal routine in the Uganda People’s Defense Forces (UPDF). Gen. Bainababo has been the Deputy Commander of SFC. “UPDF is a disciplined force and no Officer is above the law. There is nothing like sending an officer for a course when they have done something wrong or broken the army’s code of conduct,” he said. “The article makes other allegations but none of the mentioned officers has ever raised a complaint against the General for the army to take any disciplinary action of any kind.” Maj. Omara added that Brig Gen. Bainababo is not the first to be sent for course and the article is an attempt to undermine her credentials as a progressive lady officer. “We condemn in the strongest terms this kind of writing and we call upon the media body to investigate the motive behind this article.”",

        "content": "MELBOURNE, Australia , May 28, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- An industry-first study by global ecommerce accelerator, Pattern, has shown that despite their surging popularity, Australian consumers hold negative views on the quality of the products sold on emerging marketplaces Temu and Shein. The major Australian marketplace shopper study uncovered Australian consumers' perceptions of the seven largest marketplace platforms: Amazon, eBay, Catch, Kogan, Temu, MyDeal, and Shein. Temu was ranked as the lowest marketplace in perceived product quality at only 7%, followed by Shein, with just 8% of shoppers expressing trust in its product quality. This contrasts with a majority of shoppers saying that they trusted the quality of the products sold on Amazon. \"Temu and Shein have burst onto the Australian ecommerce landscape, attracting large numbers of younger shoppers. However, these platforms still have to play a lot of catch-up to win over Australian consumers, who didn't rate them highly for product quality, returns, and convenience,\" said Merline McGregor , General Manager of Pattern Australia. \"With a transparent product rating and review system built into its platform that educates and builds shopper trust, Amazon has become the most trusted marketplace in Australia in relation to the quality of products it sells. This is an area where Amazon leads the sector at 58%, with eBay trailing at 39%, followed by Catch (25%), Kogan (19%) and MyDeal (11%).\" Marketplaces attract shoppers as cost-of-living pressures bite As cost-of-living pressures rise, Australian consumers are increasingly turning to marketplaces to research, compare, and purchase. A large majority of Australians shopped on a marketplace in 2023, with a staggering 94% planning to buy from platforms like Amazon, Catch, and eBay over the coming year. \"With strained household budgets, marketplaces are attracting an increasing number of shoppers with their easy-to-use price comparison functionalities and sales events. With its globally recognised Prime Day event gaining popularity in Australia , Amazon has become the leading marketplace for value-for-money purchases, attracting 48% shoppers, followed by eBay at 41% and Catch at 27%,\" said McGregor. Not only are marketplaces attracting higher volumes of shoppers, but they are more likely to secure high income shoppers in 2024. Today, over 80% of $200K earning households shop on Amazon. Even newer marketplaces like Shein attract high income consumers, with 34% of those in the $160 - $199k household income bracket buying from the platform in the past 12 months. Amazon wins for convenience and returns Amazon outperforms all other marketplaces in relation to ease-of-use shopping, with 56% of consumers highlighting it was the most convenient platform to buy from, compared with eBay (46%) and Catch (23%). This can be attributed to Amazon's Prime membership benefits, where shoppers get free, fast shipping and the platform's advanced search and recommendation algorithms that personalise the shopping experience. Given the sophisticated supply chain infrastructure it has established in Australia , 49% of shoppers also said Amazon has the most reliable returns process - significantly more compared to any other single marketplace. Brands need to be present on platforms with biggest product ranges Just over 60% of Australian shoppers believe Amazon has the widest product range, followed by eBay at 52%. All other platforms lagged – Catch, 20%, Temu, 17%, Kogan 14%, Shein, 11% and MyDeal 8%. Offering the most product variety and options also buys marketplaces the highest web clicks, with Amazon averaging 75.2 million monthly site visits and eBay 50.9 million. \"It's no surprise there's a direct correlation between marketplaces perceived to have the best product ranges and those platforms, like Amazon, that attract the highest volumes of web traffic. Brands need to be present where their shoppers are. While the larger marketplaces may have more competition, they also have the biggest audiences of potential shoppers to target,\" concluded McGregor.

Responses were collected online, and the survey was restricted to adults who had shopped online in the previous 12 months ensuring there was a representative sample of age, gender and location achieved.

        "content": "News | Politics I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . Five Labour MPs , including shadow ministers, have announced that they will stand down from parliament at the General Election. Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party John Cryer joined Kevin Brennan, Barbara Keeley, John Spellar and Virendra Sharma in announcing on Monday that he would not be contesting his seat. Mr Cryer said he wanted to spend more time with his young children and that the next parliament was “likely to be extremely busy”. The MP for Leyton and Wanstead added that the next government would “inherit a very tough situation”. In a letter to his constituents, posted on social media, Mr Cryer said: “This has been an extremely difficult decision, perhaps the most difficult I have ever had to make. “It has been an immense privilege to have served as your MP for the past 14 years. As you may know, I have two young children and I feel I should try to spend more time with them.” Mr Cryer, who was MP for Hornchurch from 1997 to 2005, is married to Labour’s deputy national campaign co-ordinator and MP for Lewisham West and Penge Ellie Reeves. Labour’s shadow minister for victims and sentencing Mr Brennan said he had initially intended to stand again, but decided to step down “after discussing it with my family over the bank holiday weekend”. The Cardiff West MP said in a statement: “The job of a Member of Parliament is immensely rewarding but hugely demanding for the individual and their loved ones. “I have always enjoyed its intensity and challenge, but after surgery for prostate cancer a small seed of doubt was sown as to whether I should continue in such a full-on role. DUP and UUP disagree on unionist unity candidate proposal MP Lucy Allan quits Tories to back Reform UK candidate In Pictures: Sunak on the ball, Starmer takes tea and Lib Dems build bridges Why San Diego should be the start of your California road trip “Standing again would mean making a commitment to perform the demanding duties of an MP close to my 70th birthday. This has led me to conclude that this is the right moment to stand down.” Labour’s shadow minister for music and tourism Ms Keeley said it had “been an honour” to serve as a government whip and deputy leader of the House of Commons during the last Labour government. The MP for Worsley and Eccles South said in a statement posted on social media: “Recently, I have had treatment in hospital in London after which I was meant to have a six-week recovery period. “I was back at work in Parliament within two weeks but then the General Election was called unexpectedly early. “Thinking about the demands of the campaign, including supporting Labour colleagues in battleground seats, has made me realise that now is the time to step aside for a new Labour candidate for the constituency.” Warley MP Mr Spellar said it had been an “honour and pleasure” to represent the people of Smethwick and Oldbury for over 30 years. Mr Spellar served in various ministerial roles during Tony Blair’s government, with his briefs including the armed forces, transport, and Northern Ireland. Outgoing Ealing Southall MP Virendra Sharma said Labour had “gone from our worst result in a century, to the edge of government”. In a letter to his local party, he said: “As a British-Indian and as a Hindu, as a Labour member, councillor and MP I have never struggled to reconcile those different, but complimentary, identities. “Over nearly 50 years I have served the party in one form or another. Now I believe the time has come for another chapter to begin.” Create a FREE account to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.

        "description": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself.",
        "content": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games combined with the Portland Trail Blazers, the San Diego/Los Angeles Clippers and the Boston Celtics. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. ... \"It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with Boston in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

        "content": "KANO – The Kano State High Court on Monday ordered the Commissioner of Police to immediately evict the deposed Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, from the Nassarawa Palace. In an experte motion granted by the court, it also directed the Kano Commissioner of police, Ussaini Gumel to take control of the premises immediately. This development paves the way for Muhammadu Sanusi II to solidify his position as the undisputed Emir of Kano, unencumbered by challenges from the deposed Emirs. The court’s ruling also explicitly prohibits the deposed Emirs of Bichi, Karaye, Rano, and Gaya from parading themselves as Emirs, effectively ending their claims to the traditional throne pending the determination of the suit before it This judgment brings clarity and finality to the protracted dispute, allowing the Kano Emirate to move forward under the leadership of Emir Sanusi II. The court’s decision is seen as a significant milestone in the resolution of the Kano Emirate crisis, which had been marked by tensions and power struggles.",

According to the U.S. Department of Defense, Memorial Day is a \"day of remembrance to honor all those who died in service to the U.S. during peacetime and war.\" The Department of Defense states that Memorial Day is not the same as Veterans Day: \"While Memorial Day honors those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, Veterans Day — November 11 — celebrates the service of all veterans. The day is largely intended to thank living veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all who served — not only those who died — have sacrificed and done their duty.\" A number of social media users criticized the two representatives, such as conservative political commentator Gunther Eagleman, who wrote, \"Should Ilhan Omar be representing Americans in ...? The internet is forever.\" \"The 'Squad' doesn't know what Memorial Day is,\" @LeftismForU wrote. The popular X account End Wokeness posted, \"Rep. Ilhan Omar and Rep. Cori Bush just deleted their Memorial Day tweets after revealing they have no clue what it is.\" The two Democrats shared a new post on X shortly after the criticism to honor Memorial Day. \"On Memorial Day, let's say thank you to the brave men and women who selflessly sacrificed their lives in service to our country. Thank you to the families who also have sacrificed and have dedicated their time to ensuring their loved ones are remembered,\" Omar wrote. Bush wrote, \"This #MemorialDay, we honor those who served and lost their lives for our country, and we hold in our hearts the loved ones they've left behind. We must continue to push to protect our service members while working to build a world free of war and violence.

        "description": "This high-flying stock is far from having its wings clipped.The post This ASX 200 stock can rocket to a record high: Broker appeared first on The Motley Fool Australia.",
        "content": "The ( ) share price was in fine form on Monday. The ASX 200 pharma stock ended the day almost 16% higher at $23.97. This means that Neuren Pharmaceuticals' shares are now up 78% since this time last year. It also means that they are now trading within sight of their record high of $25.95. But if you thought the gains were over, think again. That's because the team at Bell Potter believes that this ASX 200 stock can rocket to a new record high. What is the broker saying about this ASX 200 stock? Bell Potter was pleased with the from Neuren Pharmaceuticals' phase 2 clinical trial of NNZ-2591 in children with Pitt Hopkins syndrome (PTHS). Those results revealed that NNZ-2591 delivered a \"statistically significant improvement\" across all four efficacy measures. The ASX 200 stock's CEO, Jon Pilcher, commented: \"We are very excited about the results of this first clinical trial in Pitt Hopkins patients. This underserved community has such urgent unmet need and we can now continue towards our goal of developing a first approved treatment.\" Commenting on the results, Bell Potter said: Another favourable mean CGI-I score of 2.6, albeit from a small sample size of 11 subjects. Anything under 3.5 would've been positive (lower=better), hence clearly a good result in our view. We are again impressed to see nearly half (=5/11) of subjects achieving a CGI-I score of 1 or 2, meaning the clinical investigator deemed their symptoms were \"very much\" or \"much\" improved from baseline. These larger responses after 13 weeks' treatment are less likely to be due to a placebo effect in our view. As a comparison, in the trofinetide Phase 3 trial, only 5% on placebo and 13% on trofinetide achieved a CGI-I score of 1 or 2, versus 45% in today's data. Big returns ahead In response to the trial results, the broker has retained its buy rating with an improved price target of $28.00. Based on the current Neuren Pharmaceuticals share price of $23.97, this implies potential upside of 17% for investors over the next 12 months. It would also mean a new record high for its shares. The broker concludes: Following today's further clinical validation of NNZ-2591 we increase our PT by 6% to $28.00 and maintain our BUY recommendation. Roughly half of our PT is comprised of value ascribed to NNZ-2591, which has now shown encouraging clinical data in two indications, each of which represent a similar if not larger market opportunity than Rett syndrome. For both completed Phase 2 indications, no approved treatments are available and NNZ-2591 is comfortably in poll position to be the first drug to market. A third Phase 2 readout with NNZ-2591 in Angelman syndrome is expected in Q3 CY24.",

A dirty war between sticker companies has seen Panini - who have lost the deal to publish UEFA's Euros album - block American-owned rival Topps from printing stickers of stars such as Phil Foden , Bukayo Saka , and John Stones in the official UEFA album. But that has led Topps to bulk out the England pages of their own album with uncapped players like Leicester City full back Luke Thomas and Manchester City 's Rico Lewis, who has just one cap. The bizarre use of these players has been known about for weeks - but many parents and children are only now discovering that hundreds of stickers have no relevance to the tournament, which starts on June 14. Christopher Abbott, who is collecting with his son Fionn, said: 'It's been disappointing and just an exercise in making you fork out for pointless stickers. Parents have hit out at a Euro 2024 sticker album 'rip-off' with collections incomplete A dirty war between Panini and Topps has led to uncapped players being included Rico Lewis (top right) and Leicester's Luke Thomas are both included on England's pages 'With the England players, you only get their heads - not the players in kit - but you're being asked to collect some of them several times over, for a separate \"captain\", \"artist\", \"player to watch\" and \"star player\". 'You don't realise that you're being asked to collect players like Luke Thomas and Rico Lewis because they don't print the names in the album, only on the stickers.' Panini have also struck back at Topps by publishing their own album, featuring only England, France, Italy and Germany - with which they have tie-ups - plus Spain. Children are being asked to collect five stickers of each England player - including AC Milan's Fikayo Tomori, who is not in the squad. Panini's five-sticker packs are 90p. Statisticians estimate it will cost £1,000 to fill both albums, factoring in the many doubles. Panini have even done a deal with M&S to make a third Euros album, which costs £3 and is food and lifestyle-related. Mr Abbott said: 'Fionn is only four so it's a novelty for him but if he were a bit older, he'd want to collect the Panini album too - because they have proper England players. I can get away with it this time as he just wants to tear the packets open. 'I'm finding so many additional Topps stickers which are pointless. There are no managers and no shiny sticker. It's obviously a money-making exercise.' Panini blocked Topps from printing stickers of the likes of Phil Foden and Bukayo Saka Statisticians estimate it will cost £1,000 to fill both albums, factoring in the many doubles Panini would not reveal which players they have deals with and have even blamed Topps Jean Fletcher, who is helping her eight-year-old, Eva, to collect, said that Eva only realised her favourite England players were missing when she'd bought dozens of Topps' six-sticker packets, which cost £1. 'It's a rip-off,' said Mrs Fletcher. 'Eva's ended up with dozens of players who won't be at the Euros because there are pages for Luxembourg, Israel and other countries no one's interested in. Her friend is collecting the Panini album which only has five countries in it.' Industry insiders say players missing altogether from Topps' albums have individual commercial deals with Panini. Panini would not reveal to Mail Sport which stars they have deals with - and even blamed Topps for leaving England stars out. Panini said: 'We have always acquired rights from a multitude of partners aimed at producing the best possible products for our collectors.' Meanwhile, Topps say they are infuriated by Panini's tactics. They told Mail Sport : 'We are disappointed that a small number of players are missing. This is due to the tournament's former sticker partner having blocked certain parts of the collection to the detriment of the fans.' Industry insiders say the war between the firms could hit the Premier League's album, which Topps have acquired the rights for from the 2025-26 season.

Bellingham, 20, who has enjoyed a stellar first season at the Bernabeu and will go to the Euros this summer as England’s key man, was speaking at Real Madrid’s pre-final media day at their lavish Valdebebas training complex on the outskirts of the Spanish capital. He has already helped lead the club to the La Liga title this season, scoring 19 league goals in a number 10 role in which he has shone and when he spoke to the hundreds of media who had flocked to the training ground, he talked with the same impressive maturity that has marked all his media appearances. ‘It’s definitely special,’ Bellingham said. ‘But I think the preparation has to be the same as it is for every game. It’s important to be me, and not to worry too much about the emotional side. Jude Bellingham has been dreaming of playing in a Champions League final his whole life This is the celebration Real Madrid fans hope to see against Borussia Dortmund on June 1 ‘I’m really excited. The final is a game I’ve been dreaming of since I started playing football. 'I understand the opportunity and I don’t want to waste a second. It’s a game I’ve dreamed of all my life. It would be stupid now to get here and want to hide away from the occasion.’ Bellingham said he had not spoken to any of his former team-mates in Germany recently but had swapped texts with Dortmund’s on-loan Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho some time ago and told him he would see him in the final.

Last week the Rangers midfielder marked his goal in the 3-3 draw with Hearts by posting a celebration picture and a caption which read: ‘Shushburger please’ accompanied by a laughing face emoji. After being reminded by supporters of the Ibrox club that he still had a Scottish Cup final to play in, the Englishman deleted the original message before posting it again without the caption. This was referenced by several Celtic players after their dramatic win over Rangers at Hampden completed the league and cup double. Left-back Greg Taylor’s Instagram account featured a picture of Celtic celebrating with the trophy. Team-mate Alistair Johnston replied, asking Taylor if he would be ‘eating a burger tonight wee man??? Johnston’s remark was ‘liked’ by team-mates including Taylor and Saturday’s matchwinner Adam Idah. Brown, above, made a thinly-veiled reference to Todd Cantwell and his use of social media Cantwell, above right, and Celtic's Greg Taylor were involved in a spat during cup final Cantwell and Taylor had some words on the pitch after a shoving match In a clear reference to Cantwell, Brown claimed that his old team-mates had an extra edge going into the final because of the extra ammunition the former Norwich City man gave them. ‘There’s a lot of people talk in the press and talk on social media, and do all their TikToks and YouTube stuff or whatever it is,’ said Brown, now manager of Ayr United. ‘The good thing about our club (Celtic) is that they do their talking on the park, and they continue to do that. ‘It’s not about outside, it’s about the focus that is inside the football club and the mentality to keep going day to day.’ Taylor also felt Cantwell’s conduct on the park was poor after a tangle between the pair in the second half, saying: ‘He said a few things that I didn’t like.’ Share or comment on this article: BROONY BLASTS TODD: Scott Brown takes a swipe at Todd 'TikTok' Cantwell by saying Celtic players prefer to do their talking on the park e-mail Add comment",

        "content": "Completion of what has been dubbed the \" world’s largest hydrogen refuelling station \" has been moved further down the road. Hydra Energy spokesperson Katherine Arnett confirmed Monday that its refuelling station and hydrogen production facility is now slated to be open by fall 2026. It had previously been scheduled for completion by early this year . \"Hydra's flagship refuelling station in P.G. is still on track, and while our team has made a lot of progress the reality is that the project requires a few long lead items and new requirements from BCER (BC Environmental Review) that have slowed down the schedule,\" Arnett said in an email. Specifics on the new requirements were not provided. \"We are still very positive and see no problems with the station moving forward. Hydra has been very fortunate to receive a warm welcome in the Prince George community and look forward to working with fleets in the region soon,\" Arnett added. The $62-million facility will be located on five acres at the intersection of Sintich Road and Northern Crescent and is to produce 3,250 kilograms of hydrogen per day and refuel as quickly as diesel and up to 24 converted trucks each hour across four bays. The station's low-carbon hydrogen is to be produced from two on-site, five-megawatt electrolyzers with electricity coming from BC Hydro. In March 2023, Hydra signed up eight fleets adding up to 80 heavy-duty trucks to long-term purchasing agreements.",

        "content": "Rachel Reeves will pledge on Tuesday to lead the most “pro-growth” Treasury in UK history if Labour wins the general election. Addressing business leaders, the shadow chancellor is poised to claim her party would “return to the centre ground of politics” by striking a balance between workers’ needs and business interests. She is also expected to say she is committed to delivering economic stability so that “families and businesses can plan for the future” without the risk of “a repeat of the mini-budget”. Labour will instead “offer a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other”. In a swipe at Rishi Sunak, Reeves will say the timing of the snap election was a damning indictment of his economic plans: “If he really believed his plan was working, he wouldn’t have called an election now.” She is expected to tell business chiefs: “The general election in five weeks’ time is a chance for the British people to pass judgment on 14 years of economic chaos and decline under the Conservatives. “Fourteen years of chaos that have seen taxes reach a 70-year high. National debt more than double. And the average mortgage holder having to pay £240 more a month after Liz Truss’s disastrous mini-budget.” Her words will strike the same tone as the Labour party leader, Keir Starmer, who said that claims from Sunak that the UK has turned the corner were “a form of disrespect in itself”. On Monday evening it was also reported that 121 business leaders have leant their support to Labour in a joint letter signed by former executives from JP Morgan, Heathrow, Aston Martin and JD Sports – as well as the Wikipedia founder, Sir Jimmy Wales, and Tom Kerridge, the chef and restauranteur . “We, as leaders and investors in British business, believe it is time for a change,” said the letter to the Times, which was also signed by the founder of the childcare company that Akshata Murty, the prime minister’s wife, previously held shares and the Iceland founder Sir Malcolm Walker, who in 2015 publicly backed the Conservatives. “For too long, our economy has been beset by instability, stagnation and a lack of long-term focus.” Reeves’s speech comes as the shadow chancellor seeks to strike a political balance between the views of businesses and trade unions. Her refusal to rule out all fire-and-rehire employment practices has drawn criticism from union leaders in recent days. The Unite union’s secretary general, Sharon Graham, said Labour’s plans – which exclude an outright ban on the practice – had “more holes than Swiss cheese”. Reeves has since said that the plans still amount to the “biggest ever extension of workplace rights that’s ever been introduced” and that fire-and-rehire would only be tolerated in extreme circumstances such as a company going bankrupt. She also faces further challenges in the coming weeks to illustrate how she can promise to keep a tight hand on the public finances while also rejuvenating ailing public services with fresh investment. Reeves has promised that Labour will not oversee a “ return to austerity ” as she ruled out increases to income tax or national insurance. Speaking on BBC One’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, she said: “There’s not going to be a return to austerity under a Labour government. We had austerity for five years and that is part of the reason why our economy and our public services are in a mess today.” Reeves added that the party would raise money to fund its pledges by introducing VAT on private school fees, increasing tax on private equity bonuses, extending the windfall tax on energy companies’ profits, and cracking down on non-doms and tax avoidance.",

The meeting will assess the opposition alliance's performance against BJP, with a focus on post-poll scenarios and instructions for counting and booth agents.",
        "content": "NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: The opposition INDIA bloc has called a strategy meeting on June 1 , the last day of voting for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The meeting will discuss the various post-poll scenarios and also pool in the estimates of regional players to assess the performance of the opposition alliance against BJP. The meeting has been called by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge . Sources said the meeting would focus on counting day, with instructions to be given to counting agents and booth agents on the various aspects to be taken care of, and on how to handle the returning officers' \"objectionable overreach\". Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee announced that she would not attend the meeting, saying the state was still dealing with the aftermath of cyclone Remal and the final phase of polling was scheduled on June 1. While the reasons given by Banerjee are seen as understandable, many view it as the West Bengal CM positioning herself for the post-poll scenario. She struck an independent line during the polls by refusing to tie up with Congress in Bengal and then issuing statements that she would only extend outside support if INDIA bloc forms the govt. While she later revised her statement to say that TMC would join any opposition govt, she created doubts in the minds of many about her future plans. A senior TMC MP said it was \"impractical\" to expect the party to attend the meeting. \"CM Banerjee is a voter in Bhowanipore. She will vote on June 1. Party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee is a candidate in Diamond Harbour, which goes to polls on June 1. The party's Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien is also a Kolkata South voter. These three were part of INDIA meetings earlier. Party's leader in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay is a Kolkata North candidate. We have conveyed this to Congress.\"",

        "content": "( WGN Radio ) – Injectable GLP-1 medications, like Ozempic, Mounjaro, Wegovy and Zepbound, have been the subject of a lot of excitement – some of it earned, some of it thanks to myths circulating about these so-called wonder drugs. The class of drugs, which either contain semaglutide or tirzepatide, started as ways to treat diabetes, explained Dr. Sterling Elliott, a clinical pharmacist at Northwestern Medicine and assistant professor of orthopedics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Now, there are versions of the medications that are FDA-approved for weight loss and to treat obesity. While these types of treatments are more accessible than they have been in years prior, one misunderstanding about them is that they’re easy to get, Elliott said. A month’s supply costs around $1,000 without insurance. Patients may have luck getting insurance to cover one of the drugs if it’s being prescribed to treat diabetes, but those who want to use the medication for weight loss tend to have more trouble getting coverage . “As we’re looking at these, we’re watching our patients have difficulty navigating through those issues,” said Elliott. Another issue is limited availability. Almost all dosages of the four brand names are listed as “currently in shortage” by the FDA . Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical company behind Zepbound and Mounjaro, told NBC News supply issues could last into 2025. Perhaps the biggest myth of all surrounding the drugs is that they can work miracles for weight loss, without changes to diet or exercise habits. “I think no matter what you do to lose weight, diet and exercise – healthy diet and good, solid exercise – are always going to be staples of weight loss,” Elliott said. “These drugs will help you start your way on that process. But if you don’t change your habits, you’re not going to stay that way very long.” Listen to Dr. Elliott’s full interview with WGN Radio in the audio player below. Studies have found that many of those who stop using the weekly injections regain much of the weight they lost.",

        "content": "OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) — Generations of American families have grown up not knowing exactly what happened to their loved ones who died while serving their country in World War II and other conflicts. But a federal lab tucked away above the bowling alley at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha and a sister lab in Hawaii are steadily answering those lingering questions, aiming to offer 200 families per year the chance to honor their relatives with a proper burial. “They may not even have been alive when that service member was alive, but that story gets carried down through the generations,” said Carrie Brown, a Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency lab manager at Offutt. “They may have seen on the mantle a picture of that person when they were little and not really understood or known who they were.” Memorial Day and the upcoming 80th anniversary of D-Day on June 6 are reminders of the urgency of Brown’s work. The forensic anthropologists, medical examiners and historians who work together to identify lost soldiers are in a race against time as remains buried on battlefields around the globe deteriorate. But advances in DNA technology, combined with innovative techniques including comparing bones to chest X-rays taken by the military, mean the labs can identify more of the missing soldiers every year. Some 72,000 World War II soldiers remain unaccounted for, along with roughly 10,000 more from all the conflicts since. The experts believe about half of those are recoverable. The agency identified 59 servicemembers in 2013, when the Offutt lab first opened. That number has steadily risen — 159 service members last year, up from 134 in 2022 — and the labs have a goal of 200 identifications annually. The labs’ work allowed Donna Kennedy to bury her cousin, Cpl. Charles Ray Patten, with full military honors this month in the same Lawson, Missouri, cemetery where his father and grandfather are buried. Patten died 74 years ago during the Korean War, but spent decades buried as an unknown in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. “I just I ached. I mean, it hurt. You know, I just felt so bad. Even though I didn’t know him, I loved him,” Kennedy said. Patten’s funeral was a simple affair with just a few family members. But often when veterans who fought decades earlier are identified, people waving flags and holding signs line the streets of their hometowns to herald the return of their remains. “This work is important first and foremost because these are individuals that gave their lives to protect our freedom, and they paid the ultimate sacrifice. So we’re here holding that promise that we’ll return them home to their families,” Brown said. “It’s important for their families to show them that we’ll never stop, no matter what,” she said. Often there are compelling details, Brown said. One of her first cases involved the intact remains of a World War I Marine found in a forest in France with his wallet still in his pocket. The wallet, initialed G.H., contained a New York Times article describing plans for the offensive in which he ultimately died. He also had an infantryman badge with his name and the year he received it on the back. Before leaving France with the remains, the team visited a local cemetery where other soldiers were buried and learned there were only two missing soldiers with the initials G.H. Brown had a fair idea who that soldier was before his remains even arrived in the lab. That veteran was buried in Arlington National Cemetery and Brown often visits his grave when she is in Washington D.C. Most cases aren’t that easy. The experts who work at the lab must piece together identities by looking at historical records about where the remains were found and which soldiers were in the area. They then consult the list of possible names and use the bones, objects found with them, military medical records and DNA to confirm their identities. They focus on battles and plane crashes where they have the greatest chance of success because of available information. But their work can be complicated if soldiers were buried in a temporary cemetery and moved when a unit was forced to retreat. And unidentified soldiers were often buried together. When remains are brought to the lab, they sometimes include an extra bone. Experts then spend months or even years matching the bones and waiting for DNA and other test results to confirm their identities. One test even can identify if the soldier grew up primarily eating rice or a corn-based diet. The lab also compares specific traits of collar bones to the chest X-rays the military routinely took of soldiers before they were deployed. It helps that the military keeps extensive records of all soldiers. Those clues help the experts put together the puzzle of someone’s identity. “It’s not always easy. It’s certainly not instantaneous,” Brown said. “Some of the cases, we really have to fight to get to that spot, because some of them have been gone for 80 years.” To remove this article -",

        "description": "Walton touched many lives here, and he was part of one of the greatest teams in NBA history.",
        "content": "The memories and stories started pouring in as soon as the new broke. Everyone remotely connected to the 1985-86 Celtics has a Bill Walton memory. Invariably, those stories are personal. And all of us were shocked Monday when it was learned that Walton had died in California at the age of 71. No player ever loved playing for the Celtics more than Walton. And it’s cruel and ironic that Bill would pass as the team is on the cusp of another appearance in the NBA Finals, which would mean a chance to win an NBA-record 18th banner. My friend Rich Johnson, longtime curator of the New England Sports Museum and — like Walton — someone with a lifelong stutter, weighed in online, sending out a recording of the Grateful Dead’s “He’s Gone,” while writing, “Listening while wiping away tears. His personal kindness to me was life changing.” Advertisement Bill touched a lot of lives in his short stint in Boston, and those of us lucky enough to have known him share the same emotions. Just one year younger than Walton, I became aware of him when he took over at center for the UCLA Bruins in 1971 and started winning NCAA championships. As sports fans in New England, we followed Walton from afar when he broke into the NBA and won his first championship with the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977, and then the MVP in 1978. Early in his pro career, he was clearly the best passing big man in the history of the sport. A lot of forgettable, frustrating seasons followed. A legitimate 7-footer who always claimed he was 6-11 (he thought being 7 feet tall made him freakish), Walton had bad bones in his feet and could not stay on the court long enough to maximize his seemingly infinite potential. As a result, he underachieved with the Blazers and Clippers. There was little demand for his services when he came to Boston in the autumn of 1985 in exchange for a wounded, declining Cedric Maxwell. Advertisement And then, 1985-86 happened. The Celtics enjoyed one of the greatest seasons in league history (including playoffs, they went 50-1 at home), destroying all competition en route to the franchise’s 16th championship. In his magical season, Walton was given a gift of health, playing a career-high 80 games and winning the NBA’s Sixth Man Award. But it was more than that. When Walton teamed with Larry Bird, we saw nightly passing clinics — stuff “Hoosiers” coach Norman Dale would have loved. It was basketball ballet. Give-and-go. Pick-and-roll. The picket fence. And don’t get caught watchin’ the paint dry. Bill was basketball’s Baryshnikov, enjoying a Faustian favor bestowed by the parquet gods. The California flower child (Kevin McHale accused Walton of having harbored Patty Hearst, but Bill said he never met the fugitive/heiress) became the favorite son of hardscrabble Gallery Gods in the old Boston Garden. Decades later, during the pandemic, while working on a book about that Celtics season, I called Bill to ask about 1985-86, and he said, “When you’re part of something that special, it changes you. You spend the rest of your life trying to get that back. When you’re doing it, it seems like it’s going to last forever. When it ends, you realize how fragile, how tenuous, and how fleeting it all is.” Advertisement None of us who were there will ever forget Walton’s first Celtic game. Playing in New Jersey, the Celtics blew a 19-point lead to the atrocious Nets and committed 28 turnovers in a 113-109 overtime loss. Walton scored 4 points in 19 minutes, committing five fouls and seven turnovers. He was hard on himself after the game. “We play a million of these games, and this was just another one, and we knew we were OK,” McHale remembered. “But Bill was really taking it hard. All of a sudden, he stood up and said, ‘I’d like to apologize to all of you for losing the game tonight. I was a disgrace to the game of basketball.’ “None of us had ever heard anything like it, and Larry just snapped at him and said, ‘I sure as hell hope we play better, because I can’t stand hearing this 81 more times. Go have a beer and forget about it.’ ” Walton did just that, and it ended up being one of the greatest seasons in NBA history. “It was better than perfect,” Walton told me in 2021. “It was just such a joy. It was what you dream about and I wish it lasted forever.” Unfortunately, it did not last even another year. Bill’s feet gave out on him for good in 1987 and he retired. In recent years, we stayed in touch, and I started sending him an annual Happy New Year message. Advertisement Some Walton responses: “Thanks. Shine on. Happy Everything Forever. Here we go.” “Shine on. Write on. Create on. Carry on.” “Once in a while you get shown the light. In the strangest of places if you look at it right” (Grateful Dead). “I’m the luckiest guy in the world. BW, from the bright side of the road.” Walton’s optimism was infectious. When I came home from the hospital in February after complex heart surgery, there was a text from Bill on my phone: “Please get better soon ... Good health. Good everything, forever. We have lit our votive candles ... Heal on.” Last Friday, we had one final exchange. The online version of a Rick Carlisle story I’d written included a photo of Carlisle alongside Danny Ainge and Larry Bird at City Hall Plaza after the Celtics won in ‘86. There was a little boy in the photo, standing directly under Bird’s left elbow. It was clearly one of Bill’s four sons. Unaware that he was gravely ill, I texted Walton, offering, “Hope all is well,” then asking which of his boys was in that photo. “Adam, oldest, now 48,” he texted, adding, “Larry was always so nice.” I thought maybe I’d reach out to him again once the Finals got underway. Too late. Shine on, my friend. We are all better for having known you. Dan Shaughnessy is a Globe columnist. He can be reached at daniel.shaughnessy@globe.com . Follow him @dan_shaughnessy .",

        "content": "NEW YORK, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of the securities of AXT, Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ: AXTI ) between March 24, 2021 and April 3, 2024, both dates inclusive (the Class Period), of the important July 5, 2024 lead plaintiff deadline in the securities class action first filed by the Firm. SO WHAT: If you purchased AXT securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the AXT, Inc. class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than July 5, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants throughout the Class Period made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) AXT, Inc. overstated its property holdings; (2) AXT, Inc. did not disclose that the attempted listing of an AXT, Inc. subsidiary in China had reportedly failed; (3) AXT, Inc. routinely engaged in environmental violations and unsafe business practices; (4) AXT's production declined in 2023; and (5) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the AXT, Inc. class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=24168 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

The post Rishi Sunak vows tax cut for pensioners with ‘triple lock plus’ appeared first on Politics.co.uk.",
        "content": "The Conservatives have promised to cut taxes for pensioners by creating a new “age-related” tax-free allowance. The party has announced plans to increase the personal allowance for pensioners in line with the triple lock by introducing the new age-related allowance. The policy would mean that for pensioners, both the state pension and their tax-free allowance will rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5 per cent every year. At present, people can receive £12,570 a year of their pensions before they start paying income tax on them, the same figure as the personal allowance for those who work. Featured BASC responds to general election announcement Featured Jersey votes to legalise assisted dying ***Politics.co.uk is the UK’s leading digital-only political website, providing comprehensive coverage of UK politics. Subscribe to our daily newsletter here .*** According to the party, this new “triple lock plus”, introduced from from April 2025, would amount to a tax cut of around £100 for 8 million pensioners next year, and almost £300 a year by the end of the next parliament. Rishi Sunak said the move “demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners”, and would bring people “peace of mind and security in retirement”. The Conservative Party has already stated its commitment to the “triple lock”, which sees the state pension rise by either the rate of inflation, average earnings or 2.5 per cent in April each year — whichever is highest. On current forecasts, the state pension is expected to rise by £430 next April, and by around £1,700 a year by the end of the parliament. The Conservatives have said the new triple lock plus policy will cost £2.4 billion a year by 2029/30 and be funded through the party’s plan to raise an extra £6 billion a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. It is the second policy in recent days to have the majority of its funding drawn from this measure after the National Service scheme, which was announced over the weekend. Rishi Sunak unveils plans for mandatory national service to inspire ‘pride in our country’ Commenting on the new announcement, Rishi Sunak said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ Triple Lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year.” He added: “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” Work and pensions secretary Mel Stride said: “A Conservative government is the only one which can provide pensioners the peace of mind in retirement they deserve. “Labour’s record speaks for itself. The last Labour government waged an all-out assault on pensioners, with a £118 billion pensions tax raid and an insulting 75p increase to the state pension. “Sir Keir Starmer can pay lip service to pensioners until he’s blue in the face, but we know it will always be the same old Labour, putting our pensioners at the back of the queue.” Responding to the announcement, shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth said: “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years? “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46 billion policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.” Also responding, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Sarah Olney MP said: “Rishi Sunak’s stealth tax hikes will blow a £1,000 hole in pensioners’ pockets by 2027, over four times more than what he is giving back with this meagre announcement. “The Conservative Party has hammered pensioners with years of unfair tax hikes and broken their word on the triple lock. People won’t be fooled by yet another empty promise from Rishi Sunak after this record of failure. “Liberal Democrats are proud we brought in the triple lock and will continue to stand up for the millions of pensioners who have been so badly let down by this Conservative government.” Politics.co.uk is the UK’s leading digital-only political website, providing comprehensive coverage of UK politics.

        "content": "RISHI Sunak last night promised OAPs a boost of almost £2,000 a year if he is re-elected. It comes from guaranteeing the Triple Lock and raising their tax allowance, with the full benefit felt by 2029 — giving “peace of mind and security”. The financial sweetener, which will raise the point at which pensioners begin to pay income tax, will kick in from next April in an attempt to shore up their core vote. It will put Labour under pressure to match the five-year £2.4billion spending commitment. The Prime Minister said that people must have “peace of mind and security in retirement”. Proposals to be included in the party’s manifesto will see both the state pension and allowance go up by the triple lock — whichever is highest out of the rate of inflation, earnings or 2.5 per cent. The forecast rise in the state pension will be £1,677 a year by 2029, with the tax-free allowance worth £275 a year by then. Next year alone the average pensioner will see their state pension increased by £428 and the income tax cut will be worth £95. The PM added: “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners.” The proposal comes after Mr Sunak was criticised over his treatment of pensioners after the Government twice cut National Insurance — which OAPs don’t pay. But Labour seized on Budget remarks by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt that the Tories will eventually abolish National Insurance, claiming it will create a £46billion black hole in funding earmarked for the state pension and NHS . The Tories also plan to guarantee in legislation that OAPs’ personal allowance will always be higher than the level of the state pension. Party insiders say that by 2027/28, at the current rate, the state pension will be £12,578. The tax-free allowance is now £12,570. Without action, it would mean the elderly having to go through a red-tape headache of filling out a self-assessment form. Funding for the new Tory plans will come from a previously announced proposal to crack down on tax avoidance and evasion. Welfare Secretary Mel Stride said: “Only a Conservative government can provide pensioners with the peace of mind they deserve. “Labour’s record speaks for itself. The last Labour government completely failed pensioners, with a £118billion pensions tax raid and an insulting 75p increase to the state pension. “ Sir Keir Starmer can pay lip service to supporting pensioners but we know it will always be the same old Labour, putting our pensioners at the back of the queue.” Labour tonight said it remained committed to the triple lock. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has also said income tax or National Insurance will not rise under a Labour government. Shadow Paymaster General Jonathan Ashworth said tonight: “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years? “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46billion policy to scrap National Insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.” Ms Reeves will today tell business leaders that she will bring growth back to Britain to help working people. She will say Labour will offer “a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other”.",

        "description": "Rangers gunning to claim SWPL title off Celtic next season.",
        "content": "Lizzie Arnot has insisted that Rangers will be with a fresh impetus to claim the league title next season after signing off with a League Cup and Scottish Cup double. Jo Potter’s side beat Hearts at Hampden on Sunday afternoon to ensure that there was a positive end to a season that for long periods looked set to end with a domestic treble. Losing the title on goal difference to Celtic on the final day of last season will resonate across the summer break but for Arnot, there will be a drive to go again. “We have learned so much and I think we have pushed on under Jo,” said the winger, who netted the second goal on Sunday afternoon. “We have won two Cups and come so close to the league so it has to be seen as a success. I think we can push on next season. “It will be good to switch off mentally and physically. The aim is to come back stronger and fitter next year and get some more trophies.” Arnot joined captain Nicola Docherty last week in signing a new contract at the club. While eager to get a break after the demands of what has been a fairly arduous season, she has enjoyed the different style that Rangers have played this season under Potter. “I love being part of this club and being here for another two years is special,” she said. “I just want to keep pushing on and get better. “There is a lot to look forward to. There will be the chance of Champions League football next season too so it will be good to get the break and come back refreshed.” READ MORE: Rangers cup final hero on sheer surprise of long-range goal Arnot admitted that last week was spent ensuring that the squad were in the right place mentally to go into Sunday’s final after the excruciating way that the title slipped from their grasp. The Championship had looked all set to be heading to Ibrox before Amy Gallacher netted a 90th minute winner for Celtic to give Elena Sadiku’s side the championship courtesy of their superior goal difference. “It was a really important win for us on Sunday,” said Arnot. “We wanted to end the season on a high. There is no denying it was sore to lose the league the way we did so it was important to win the Scottish Cup. We came in with one focus and that was to win.”",

        "content": "A woman alleged to have been sexually assaulted by her hockey coach is recounting her experience once again. The victim, whose identity is protected, is back in Vernon Supreme Court Monday, May 27, detailing her younger days on the ice. The accused, Keith Chase, has pleaded not guilty to a sexual assault alleged to have taken place in 2004. Chase was charged in 2020, found guilty in 2022 and sentenced to two years in 2023. But he appealed the conviction and his new trial is currently underway. Vernon North Okanagan RCMP Const. Shaun Miranda was the first witness called. A member since 2017 in Vernon, Miranda said he took the call from the victim Feb. 7, 2020 when she reported it to police. He took her statement the following day, where she alleged the incident took place the night before a hockey game in Kamloops. The victim also took the stand Monday, explaining how she knew Chase since she played ringette at age five or six and later hockey. “I was very athletic and loved all sports,” she said. Her testimony, along with that of her father, is continuing with the trial, expected to last two to three days.",

        "content": "Rishi Sunak will today say he wants to resurrect a tax cut for pensioners his own party was responsible for scrapping. If the Conservatives win the General Election , the Tory leader said he will introduce a \"new age-related\" allowance for over 65s. They were phased out by Tory austerity Chancellor George Osborne back in 2013 - in a move described as a \"granny tax\" at the time. Under Mr Sunak's plan from April 2025 the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will go up in line with the triple lock. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners' tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the \"triple lock plus\", the Tories said it will cost £2.4billion-a-year by the end of the decade and will be funded through a clampdown on tax avoidance. For individual pensioners, the party said it would be worth around £100-a-year. In an attempt to revive his chaotic election campaign, Mr Sunak said: \"I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. Thanks to the Conservatives’ Triple Lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year.\" But Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said: \"Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?

        "content": "SIR Keir Starmer made his big pitch yesterday, insisting he has “permanently” changed the Labour Party. As a result he claims he can now be trusted with national security. It’s a very public acknowledgement that he still has a lot of work to do to win over unconvinced voters. Four years ago he sat silently in the Shadow Cabinet as his leader Jeremy Corbyn swore never to fire Britain’s nuclear weapons. Now he’s pledging a “100-day review” to assess what’s needed to keep us safe. We can save him the time. The threats are: reckless dictator Putin , scheming China , North Korea, Iran , Hamas , IS , unchecked illegal migrants and international organised crime gangs. Add to that home-grown Far Right, Northern Irish and Islamist terrorism. What people really need to know is whether Labour is prepared to put its money where its mouth is. The party’s failure to say it will commit to Rishi Sunak’s plans to spend £75billion on defence means any promise it makes to protect Britain is in danger of sounding like hot air. Sir Keir’s short-term ambition is to kick out the Tories on July 4. But where it leaves the security of the country on July 5 is still not wholly clear. RISHI Sunak yesterday offered what he believes is clear blue water between the Conservatives and Labour. His offer on pensions is designed to shore up wavering older voters. A boost rising to almost £2,000 by 2029 for OAPs backs up years of action to protect their income and assets. Coupled with his surprise pledge on National Service , it’s clear the PM is aiming at his core vote. Both are welcome ideas. What is needed now are new policies to help younger voters and new families. We hope Rishi has something up his sleeve to solve the desperate housing shortage , which is pricing young people out of home ownership. As it stands, many see no reason to even consider voting Tory. Let’s see what the PM can do for them, too. AFTER a Spring washout and the soggy beginning of a so far less-than-exciting election campaign, weather experts are now predicting 50 days of summer rain. We just pray favourites England can bring us some sunnier cheer at the Euros next month. With our forward line of superstars, there’s no fear of a goal drought. So if our defence can avoid making heavy weather of it, surely the Three Lions can take the tournament by storm.",

        "content": "IT is a truth universally acknowledged that ­Manchester United cannot possibly decide Erik ten Hag’s future on the basis of a single match. But why not? Why not, when that single match saw them win football’s grandest domestic knockout competition by defeating the best team on the planet, thanks to their manager’s tactical acumen. There is no doubt that Ten Hag would have been sacked had — as expected — United lost Saturday’s FA Cup final to Manchester City . But United did win 2-1 at ­Wembley . Ten Hag did outwit Pep Guardiola by setting up his side without a centre-forward. And United did look a ­half-decent team once they had a couple of fit first-choice central defenders — as the Dutchman always argued they would. So why shouldn’t Sir Jim ­Ratcliffe change his mind on the basis of all that? Isn’t winning silverware what football is about? The vast majority of United fans would have preferred a trophy to Champions League qualification, given a straight choice. And we cannot spend several months talking up the magic of the FA Cup, only to brand the identity of the winners as irrelevant come May. Of course, United’s campaign has been poor overall — a worst-ever eighth-place Premier League finish , a negative goal difference and finishing bottom of their Champions League group. CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS United’s players admitted their season hadn’t been good enough in an unusual joint statement. The managerial situation would be different if Ratcliffe, United’s new football supremo, had a clear vision for the club’s future, with a successor to Ten Hag identified and readied for arrival. Instead, Ratcliffe and Co have been sounding out every Tom, Dick and Harry — from Mauricio Pochettino to Kieran McKenna to Thomas Tuchel to Thomas Frank to Roberto De Zerbi . Gareth Southgate and Graham Potter are also highly-regarded among the collection of green-fingered executives currently on gardening leave at rival clubs before arriving at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, Ten Hag, with two trophies in as many seasons, is left swinging in the wind. There is no bus parade for Erik, just a long wait on a sunbed for the likely arrival of the Spanish archer. Only Manchester United could manage to win a major trophy in impressive style and finish the weekend looking a complete ­shambles. But that is where we are thanks to Ratcliffe and Co managing to look simultaneously heartless and hopeless in their treatment of Ten Hag. There was no name-check for the manager in the Ineos billionaire’s triumphant post-final statement. Just as there has been no backing for Ten Hag in the five months since Ratcliffe purchased a 27.7 per cent stake in United and took over their footballing operation. Ten Hag was admirably strident in his post-match ­comments after the final. He has taken a huge amount of flak all season, from ex-players in TV studios and the likes of me, so why not give some back? To paraphrase — if United don’t want him, he’ll go somewhere else and win trophies as he’d always done; Roy Keane failed as a manager (a brave thing to say to Keane’s face) and the club was a mess when he arrived. All fair points, well made. And while no manager ever wants to rely on the sympathy vote, Ten Hag certainly gained the sympathy of a vast swathe of United supporters this weekend — as a winner, who is being openly ­disrespected by his bosses. Sir Jim and his new regime were welcomed as liberating heroes by United fans in mid-season — just as anyone lessening the influence of the Glazers would have been. Yet he has torched much of that goodwill with his shabby handling of Ten Hag’s future. The pros and cons of Ten Hag’s reign have been well argued. His first season was good, his second season was ravaged by an injury crisis, especially in defence. But the £85.5million signing of Antony has been a disaster, the handling of Jadon Sancho — who will contest Saturday’s Champions League final on loan at Borussia Dortmund — is an embarrassment, while United have too often lacked an attacking gameplan. Still, despite such a dismal league campaign and despite so many issues remaining within the squad, United have been presented with a chance to make a genuine challenge for the Premier League title before long. After his arrival, Ratcliffe made a ballsy statement about wanting to ‘knock City and Liverpool off their perch’, which was met with widespread derision. But the exit of Jurgen Klopp from Anfield, and Guardiola’s likely departure from the Etihad next summer, will allow the rest of the Premier League’s wealthiest contenders to hold more realistic title ambitions. The opportunity is there for Ratcliffe as long as he identifies the right manager. And could that manager be the bloke who has just won him the FA Cup? By Neil Custis SIR JIM RATCLIFFE looked more than a little shame-faced when he headed into Manchester United’s dressing room to congratulate his FA Cup winners. The plan had already been hatched ahead of Saturday’s 2-1 win over Manchester City . . . and this was all rather awkward. It was a stunning performance from Ten Hag’s troops and United’s triumph over a team widely regarded as the best in the world will live long in the memory. It was also a personal triumph for the unassuming guy who had arrived at Old Trafford full of life and ideas to make United better — which in many ways he has. Having been dealt a dreadful hand with injuries in his second season, he tried to explain to Ratcliffe and his team just how much this has affected performances. But it seems Sir Jim hasn’t listened. Nor has he taken notice of the way Ten Hag has carefully brought Saturday’s scorers Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo into the first team — with spectacular results. Ratcliffe has fired out emails criticising the state of an office, called the club museum ‘crap’ and withdrew travel and lunch benefits for United staff on FA Cup final day to cut costs. There is early proof the new men overseeing United’s football department do not know what they are doing, not least in the way they deal with people . . . including the most important one of all — the manager. Ratcliffe and his team seem to have spoken to anyone able to set up Subbuteo. And everyone they have spoken to believes they have got the job. Read the full column from Neil Custis here AFTER Leeds’ defeat by Southampton in the Championship play-off final, there will be fewer northern clubs in the top flight next season than at any time in English league football history. The Manchester clubs, Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle will be the only five northern sides — as opposed to 11 from the south and four Midlands clubs. Former top-flight regulars such as the Sheffield clubs, Sunderland, Middlesbrough, Blackburn, Burnley, Bolton, Stoke, Wigan and Hull have been wiped off the Premier League map. With northern clubs outside the three major footballing cities struggling to attract the wealthiest owners — and therefore the best players — there is little prospect of any ‘levelling up’ in football’s north-south divide. SPARE a thought for Daniel Farke, who is facing the sack at Leeds , despite accumulating 90 points and leading his team to third place and a narrow play-off final defeat. Especially given the career trajectories of the two managers who pipped him to promotion - Leicester’s Enzo Maresca is heading for Chelsea , while Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna attracted interest from the Stamford Bridge club as well as Manchester United and Brighton. And that’s without even mentioning relegated Burnley boss Vinny Kompany taking over at Bayern Munich. SHOULD Jack Grealish make the England squad for the Euros? Of course he should. Not because Manchester City’s £100million man would get much game time. But because, if Gareth Southgate’s men win the tournament, nobody would be more fun than Grealish on an open-top bus parade. ANDY MURRAY’S straight sets first-round French Open defeat against his fellow veteran Stan Wawrinka has increased calls for the three-time Grand Slam winner to call it a day. If Murray still enjoys playing professional tennis at the age of 37 and without any realistic hope of recapturing former glories, then that is his absolute right.",

        "content": "One day, there will be entire libraries filled with psychological studies of how broken the American left has become, and almost all of it due to their hatred of one man. Yep, you guessed it: THE BAD ORANGE MAN. The latest breathtaking display of Trump Derangement Syndrome comes to us from former federal prosecutor Jim Zirin, via The Hill: \"Who will hang next week, Trump or the jury?\" ( @TheHillOpinion ) https://t.co/z90SNU88Ka Yes, you read that correctly. The Hill and Zirin just suggested that former President Donald Trump could hang for ... giving hush money to a porn actress (that even the federal government decided was not worthy of prosecution). And just in case you think this was just some random low-level headline writer, think again. The author himself tweeted out the same op-ed with the same headline. Proudly. My latest piece in The Hill. Who will hang next week, Trump or the jury? https://t.co/CWpwW92Xow (We are laughing that he has had that tweet out all day with absolutely zero engagement. Talk about screeching into the void.) Zirin is a permanent TDS victim. His entire Twitter timeline buys into every false accusation you can think of about Trump and it oozes with unhinged hate. You will not be surprised to learn that he has also fully bought into the Justice Sam Alito flag 'scandal.' Because of course, he is. But back to the op-ed. We won't bore you with the contents of the article. You can read it here if you want , but it is everything you'd expect it to be. The evidence is OVERWHELMING. Michael Cohen (despite being a convicted perjurer who admitted he stole from Trump) is a TOTALLY credible witness. Blah, blah, blah. We get it. You hate him, Jim. And you are completely incapable of objective analysis. But 'hang'? Really? We don't need to ask what would happen if a conservative politician or commentator said something even CLOSE to this. We know from experience. Hahah, remember when Sara Palin got dragged for crosshairs on a map? https://t.co/hduNlSfoMw Yep. We're old enough to remember that. Palin showed a map of Congressional districts she was targeting for victory in the next election and it was a 24/7 media crisis with its own theme music. But The Hill can suggest a President hang for barely even a misdemeanor and ... crickets. Would @thehill even think about writing this type of headline if it was Obama? No, but Orange Man Bad so let's write whatever. https://t.co/s2ZA9sG1tJ Saint Obama? Never. Besides, we're pretty sure that The Hill considers him -- as most gods are -- to be immortal. Hoo boy https://t.co/toxA61pTH3 Honestly, we waited a little while to write this because we thought for sure that The Hill would delete the tweet and/or rewrite the headline. But nope. They are totes cool with it. What the Hell is wrong with you? https://t.co/Q3k16UxRlF Our first thought is: many things. How long you got? We are being punked people This can’t be reality https://t.co/sjm56Ikqxf Sadly, we rubbed our eyes and even pinched ourselves. It wasn't a dream. It was a real headline. The is sending their message to the jury. Convict or face riots. https://t.co/EIMfTb8hbA Of course everyone knows the Trump jury will stay away from all forms of news, right? No pressure. https://t.co/cgLZTQ4YUu Judge Merchan did not sequester the jury over the holiday weekend, which is simply ridiculous. So, yes. The jury will indeed likely see a headline suggesting Trump could (and should) be hung. Hopefully, that will only galvanize opposition to conviction among a few sane members of the jury, but we're not counting on it. Pretty sure any other random account would get suspended for posting this. https://t.co/IOGbnuIXfq This is unquestionably true. And Burt Macklin knows whereof he speaks. He's an FBI agent, after all. Why is journalism dying? Beats me https://t.co/gtClFSkZrk If y'all ever wonder why the normal people hate journalists, it's headlines like this. We're shocked ... SHOCKED that media credibility is in the toilet and that most Americans side with Trump when he calls the press 'the enemy of the people.' The US media is not biased 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/FkGENtiTCG Biased is one thing. This is downright disgraceful. I thought New York didn’t have the Death Penalty, are they waving that for Trump? It would be on brand I guess New York DID just fine the man more than $400 million for the horrendous crime of ... overvaluing his property. On a loan that he paid back on time and in full. There is nothing out of bounds for that state when it comes to its leaders' hatred of Trump. Reported for threats of violence, an obvious violation of TOS. It would be hilarious and glorious if Twitter locked The Hill and Zirin out of their accounts for the headline, but we're not holding our breath for that to happen either. This headline is suggesting a former president should be hung. It’s more likely to incite violence than anything Trump said regarding J6. The media is getting increasingly reckless with these headlines and it’s blatant attempts to rile people up if Trump is not found guilty. Sounds like 'stochastic terrorism' to us. This headline... pic.twitter.com/m5EzFPGEyp Holy schlit!! This guy is a former federal prosecutor and admits there is no way Trump got an unbiased jury in NYC. I missed his article on why this is a travesty of justice if you believe Constitutional guarantees apply to all citizens... What do you expect when we have elected officials like Sandy Cortez BRAGGING that the trial is preventing Trump from campaigning? They're not just not hiding the corruption anymore. They are actively celebrating it. That's a rather inappropriate headline. And the Understatement of the Year Award goes to ... Look, we get it. Ziring was trying to be clever with wordplay. He failed. But sorry, leftists. Conservatives don't play by the old rules anymore. Not too long ago, Trump said that there would be an economic 'bloodbath,' specifically in the auto market, if Biden won re-election. The media proceeded to undergo a week-long collective paroxysm of outrage claiming that he was inciting violence. They even lied and chopped up his words to fuel their false narrative. Welp. You created these new rules. You have to play by them. And by your rules, The Hill, Jim Zirin just called for the execution of a former president. And that is why no one ever takes them seriously. Or ever will.",

        "content": "Caley Thistle are set to move their training base 135 miles away to Kelty in Fife - but County chairman MacGregor can't understand their thinking. Get the latest news from Record Sport with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest news from Record Sport with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Ross County chairman Roy MacGregor admits he can't get his head around rivals Inverness ’ decision to decant to Fife during the week. Relegated Caley Thistle caused uproar in the Highlands last week when they revealed an agreement with League 1 opponents Kelty Hearts to use their facilities as a training base. They argue the move closer to the central belt will help attract players with their location becoming an obstacle to recruitment in recent years. But MacGregor - who watched County secure Premiership safety on Sunday backed by a strong local support in Dingwall - reckons his club has connected with a new generation of fans in the local community. And can’t understand why Inverness would would want to jeopardise their local connection by moving their midweek business 135 miles away. He said: “We will not be going to Kelty! All I will say is that’s a challenge because I don’t understand football clubs who are not in their hometown. But that’s their business. “We’ve seen what has happened with a new generation here, you saw it on Sunday. They are interested in a new era, which is great because that’s what football is all about.” Meanwhile MacGregor wants Ross County to emulate Kilmarnock, St Mirren and Dundee next season by finishing in the top six. The Staggies supremo admits a second successive top flight survival through the play-offs isn’t good enough. Three seasons ago Malky Mackay led the Dingwall men to a sixth-place finish. And MacGregor - who will sit down with Don Cowie this week to thrash out a deal to make the caretaker permanent manager - reckons it’s not unrealistic to target a repeat. He said: “It was a traumatic season. It was great on Sunday but that’s twice we’ve been in 11th so we need to take stock and make sure we’re not in that position again. “I said that last year and I thought this time we had enough in the cupboard to avoid it. But we finished 11th again and while it was great to get through the play-offs we need to take stock. “I’m not being negative but we’ve not done what we’ve set out to do. We have to find a way of being 10th or better next season. You’ve seen what particularly Kilmarnock, St Mirren and Dundee have done this season. “There are alliances with other clubs you can benefit from. These are the clubs you have to follow, not the top five or six. We have to find a way to do what they’ve done this season.”",

        "content": "News | Politics I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice . A Labour government will be both pro-business and pro-worker, Rachel Reeves is set to promise in her first major election speech on Tuesday. The shadow chancellor is expected to tell business leaders that, having brought business back to Labour, the party can now “bring growth back to Britain”. She will say: “By bringing business back to Britain we can deliver a better future for working people.” Under Sir Keir Starmer , Labour has tried to woo businesses as a way of demonstrating it can be trusted with the economy. Those efforts have brought success, with business attendance at recent party conferences higher than under Jeremy Corbyn and wealthy businessmen donating more to Labour’s war chest. But in her speech on Tuesday, former Bank of England analyst Ms Reeves is expected to stress the need for a partnership with business, government and workers. She will say Labour offers “a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other”. Her remarks come after Labour faced a backlash over an apparent rebranding of its “New Deal for Workers”, with Britain’s largest trade union Unite warning that the party must “stick to its guns” on workers’ rights. Labour insisted it had not watered down its commitments, adding the proposals had followed agreement with the unions. The Conservatives have argued that Labour’s proposals would cost jobs and place unnecessary burdens on businesses, but the opposition have claimed good businesses will welcome the plans. Ms Reeves is also expected to stress Labour’s commitment to economic stability, a key message of the campaign, and urge voters to “pass judgment on 14 years of economic chaos and decline under the Conservatives”. Her speech is the second major intervention from Labour of the week, following Sir Keir Starmer’s address on Monday, in which he promised to stand up for working people. Treasury Chief Secretary Laura Trott said Labour would “tie businesses in red tape”. Pensioners would get a £2.4bn income tax break under the Tories, Sunak to vow Burglary victims being ‘denied justice’ because of Tory failings, claims Davey MP Lucy Allan quits Tories to back Reform UK candidate San Francisco: plan a trip to the Californian city that has it all “The bosses of Asda, Marks and Spencer, Currys and the Confederation of British Industry have all warned that Labour’s French-style union laws risk damaging the economy, costing jobs,” she said. “Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan that businesses can rely on. “We took the bold action to deliver the biggest business tax cut in modern history. Labour would tie businesses in red tape and raise taxes by £2,094 on hardworking families.” SNP Westminster economy spokesman Drew Hendry said: “The latest speech by Rachel Reeves cynically ignore the most fundamental reason for the economic decline of the United Kingdom – Britain is broken and Brexit broke it.” Create a FREE account to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.

        "content": "NINE out of ten burglaries went unsolved in some parts of the country last year, police figures reveal. Some communities saw massive rises in break-ins not busted by the cops with just six per cent of cases leading to a person being charged. Police failed to catch three in four burglars across the UK in 2023 as reports soared to 215,000 - the equivalent of 592 a day. However in some areas, the rate of unsolved smash-and-grab hits was much higher than the average. Leafy Elmbridge, in Surrey, had the worst record in the country as 92 per cent of burglary reports probed by police were dropped without a suspect being nicked. Some 91 per cent of burglaries went unsolved in South Cambridgeshire, while 90 per cent of cases went unsolved in Runnymede, also in Surrey. The figures were compiled by FOI requests to police forces across the UK by the Liberal Democrats. It comes as party leader Sir Ed Davey will today pledge to launch a Burglary Response Guarantee as part of his manifesto. Sir Ed said: “Too many families now feel unsafe in their own homes because this Conservative Government has decimated frontline policing for too long. “Victims are being denied justice because Conservative ministers can’t even get the basics right on solving crime . “That is why the Liberal Democrats would deliver a Burglary Response Guarantee, to ensure all home burglaries are attended by the police and properly investigated.” Surrey Police and Cambridgeshire Police were asked to comment. Tory Policing Minister Chris Philp hit back by branding the Lib Dems \"cynical\" and claiming they \"do not have a plan\" to tackle crime. He added: “A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour Party.\"",

        "content": "As old have gotten new leases on life in recent years, more and more people have just wanted to know why Friday the 13th can’t get the same treatment. While the series was kept semi-alive with a video game not too long ago, there hasn’t been a new movie since the 2009 reboot. It sounds like even with the recent plans to launch a , it’ll be some time before Mr. Voorhees is back on screen, though not entirely for the reasons you think. At the recent Texas Frightmare Weekend, series co-creator Sean Cunningham was asked point blank what the holdup was with another Friday flick. Instead of pointing a finger at the franchise’s infamously weird rights issues, he speculated the biggest obstacle is fear on the studio’s end. He doesn’t point a finger at any specific company, but he did say whichever studio could get the ball rolling likely doesn’t want to put substantial money into a project that “might not see a huge return on its investment.” As far as he’s concerned, there won’t be another movie for “at least” three years. He went on to say movie-watching habits have changed due to the pandemic, which isn’t entirely false. Despite the performance of decent-sized hits like and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, not all box offices are equal. After The Fall Guy came out in early May, Universal recently put it on streaming while it’s still currently running in theaters. In the pandemic’s fairly early days, Warner Bros. and Disney elected to do same-day streaming with some movies like Mortal Kombat and Raya & the Last Dragon, which would make for good bragging with streaming numbers, but hit-and-miss in terms of box office performance. That being said, big horror movies tend to do fairly well in theaters. Despite mixed or negative reviews, Tarot, The Strangers: Chapter One, and Night Swim have done solid in the box office. New Line, which owns the Friday the 13th trademark, is also the studio behind Evil Dead Rise and The Nun II, which both made their money back and then some last year. It’s not clear what makes Friday the 13th an outlier, ditto why it’s got such a weird streak of bad luck behind it. Until that hypothetical new movie gets greenlit, Jason fans will have to comfort themselves with the Jason Universe: the Friday video game remains playable through the end of the year, and Jason himself is a playable character in , which launches next week.

Why not, when that single match saw them win football’s grandest domestic knockout competition by defeating the best team on the planet, thanks to their manager’s tactical acumen. There is no doubt that Ten Hag would have been sacked had — as expected — United lost Saturday’s FA Cup final to Manchester City . But United did win 2-1 at ­Wembley . Ten Hag did outwit Pep Guardiola by setting up his side without a centre-forward. And United did look a ­half-decent team once they had a couple of fit first-choice central defenders — as the Dutchman always argued they would. So why shouldn’t Sir Jim ­Ratcliffe change his mind on the basis of all that? Isn’t winning silverware what football is about? The vast majority of United fans would have preferred a trophy to Champions League qualification, given a straight choice. And we cannot spend several months talking up the magic of the FA Cup, only to brand the identity of the winners as irrelevant come May.

CASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS United’s players admitted their season hadn’t been good enough in an unusual joint statement. The managerial situation would be different if Ratcliffe, United’s new football supremo, had a clear vision for the club’s future, with a successor to Ten Hag identified and readied for arrival.

The Parkhead gaffer made it crystal clear on Saturday that he wants the striker back next season after watching the Irishman fire the Hoops to Scottish Cup glory. And Record Sport understands the Hoops hierarchy are committed to fulfilling their manager’s wishes. It was the on-loan Norwich ace’s last-minute winner which sealed victory over Rangers and completed this year's Double triumph. And it wrapped up an impressive six-month stint in Glasgow for the 23-year-old that saw him bag nine goals in 19 appearances - with that vital haul including key strikes at Easter Road, Ibrox and Rugby Park as Rodgers’ side stormed to the title. Idah’s Carrow Road parent club — understood to be looking for a fee in the region of £6million for the Republic of Ireland hitman — are still without a boss after sacking David Wagner. That might yet complicate matters if their new gaffer decides to take a look at the Cork-born striker before the new season. But Celtic are working on the assumption they will have Idah back helping to lead their attack as they take on the cream of Europe in the Champions League . That will delight Rodgers , who could not have been any more fulsome in his praise of the frontman after watching him snatch the Hampden headlines. He said after the 1-0 win over Rangers: “The board knows how I feel about Adam, that was the reason for bringing him in. “He’s been a real catalyst for us, especially over the last few months. He’s a big game player. In so many big moments, he’s stepped up to the plate for us. “I’m so happy for him - a boy from Ireland, a striker scoring the winning goal in the Scottish Cup Final against Rangers. Wow. What a summer he’ll have. “I don’t know if we’ll get him in the summer, the board will look at it. My talks with Adam will remain private because there’s a lot of work to do. But he knows my feelings and so does the club so we’ll see what happens.”",

        "description": "World War II Army Technician Clifford Strickland from Fowler was among those recently identified in December more than 80 years after his death. World War II Army Pvt. James B McCartney, from Ridgway, was also identified in last year.",
        "content": "Across the world, about 81,000 American service members are unaccounted for — buried in unidentified graves, still in their crashed planes — their final resting place unknown to their loved ones. \"For many of the families, the wounds of uncertainty still remain very raw,\" said Denise To, with the U.S. Department of Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency. The agency strives to identify about 200 service members each year, To said, and the agency estimates about 38,000 are potentially recoverable. World War II Army Technician Clifford Strickland from Fowler was among those identified in December, more than 80 years after his death, said To, who is the federal supervisory and laboratory manager for the agency. She told Strickland's story Monday under brilliant blue skies at Pikes Peak National Cemetery during a Memorial Day ceremony expected to draw more than 1,000 people. Strickland was fighting in the Philippines when he was captured following the American surrender of the Bataan Peninsula in 1942, when 12,000 Americans became prisoners of war. He was among those who made the 65-mile Bataan Death March. He was buried in Common Grave 215 in a local cemetery, To said. Following the war, he was moved to the U.S. military mausoleum near Manila where some of his fellow troops were identified. Those who could not be identified, including Strickland, were buried in the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial. In 2018, his remains and others from the same common grave were exhumed again and brought to a laboratory in Hawaii for identification, To said. He is expected to be buried for the final time in Florence. If you go: A celebration of life for Clifford Strickland will be held from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. June 29 at the Runyon Field Sports Complex in Pueblo. World War II Army Pvt. James B. McCartney, from Ridgway, was also identified in the past year. He was killed in 1945 while his unit was on patrol near Wildenguth, France. In 1951, his remains were deemed nonrecoverable. In 2022, he was exhumed from his grave in France for an analysis of his teeth, DNA and other clues that led to his identification. In March, he was buried for the final time in California, she said. In recent years, the agency has had good luck identifying service members in unidentified graves, To said in an interview. But the work was slowed significantly during the pandemic that upended politics in foreign countries where investigators work. Some of the most important relationships are with local authorities who grant access to burial sites, she said. The agency has teams working in Vietnam, Kuwait, the Philippines, Germany, France and Bosnia. During fiscal year 2023, the agency identified 158 service members, and it's building back to its pre-pandemic level of work. To identify more people annually would take additional resources, she said. \"We persist in our determination in achieving the most comprehensive accounting,\" she told the crowd. Skyler Holmes, Pikes Peak cemetery director, was unaware of any veterans identified through the agency buried at the new national burial ground. The cemetery opened in 2018 after 23 years of work to bring the community the cemetery it needed, retired Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Pete Tetley told the crowd. During the event, parking in the cemetery filled up and attendees parked along the narrow two-lane Drennan Road to attend and many wore hats, shirts, jackets, patches and other proclamations of their own service. Former American Legion State Commander Jay Bowen recounted for the crowd numerous tales of heroism of individuals and of the grand scale of D-Day, when about 156,000 troops landed in France. He also acknowledged that many in the crowd saw the sacrifices and fought alongside those honored Monday. \"Veterans have seen heroism in its purest form,\" Bowen said.",

        "description": "PENSIONERS will be given a tax break worth £2.4 billion a year, Rishi Sunak is expected to promise ...",
        "content": "The Prime Minister will announce on Tuesday that from April next year the income tax personal allowance for pensioners will be increased in line with the triple lock, as he continues the Conservatives’ election campaign. The pledge would mean both the state pension and pensioners’ tax-free allowance will always rise in line with the highest of earnings, wages or 2.5%. Billed the “triple lock plus”, the policy is estimated to cost £2.4bn a year by 2029/30, a price tag which mirrors Sunak’s proposed national service duty for all 18-year-olds, billed at £2.5bn a year. The tax cut will be funded through a previously announced plan to raise £6bn a year by the end of the next parliament by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. READ MORE: SNP to stand 'shoulder-to-shoulder' with Waspi women, says John Swinney For individual pensioners, it would be worth around £100 in 2025 according to the Tories , and would grow over time, adding to their incomes on top of rises in the state pension. The policy follows criticism of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s decision to cut national insurance by 2p at the spring budget, after a similar cut in the autumn. State pensioners did not benefit from the cut, as they do not pay national insurance. While Sunak said the Tories were committed to the triple lock, he claimed Labour would by contrast drag pensioners in receipt of the full state pension “into income tax for the first time in history”. The Prime Minister said: “I passionately believe that those who have worked hard all their lives should have peace of mind and security in retirement. “Thanks to the Conservatives’ triple lock, pensions have risen by £900 this year and now we will cut their taxes by around £100 next year. “This bold action demonstrates we are on the side of pensioners. The alternative is Labour dragging everyone in receipt of the full state pension into income tax for the first time in history.” But Labour claimed the Tories’ offer to pensioners was not credible. “Why would anyone believe the Tories and Rishi Sunak on tax after they left the country with the highest tax burden in 70 years?” said Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow paymaster general. He added: “This is just another desperate move from a chaotic Tory Party torching any remaining facade of its claims to economic credibility. “Not only have they promised to spend tens of billions of pounds since this campaign began, they also have a completely unfunded £46bn policy to scrap national insurance that threatens the very basis of the state pension. “Labour will protect the triple lock. But Rishi Sunak is planning to reward Britain’s pensioners for their loyalty by stabbing them in the back, just like he did to Boris Johnson and just like he has done to his own MPs.”",

        "content": "Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves will pledge to “lead the most pro-growth Treasury in our country’s history”, if her party is elected on July 4. The shadow Chancellor will maker her first major economic speech of the election campaign on Tuesday where she will vow to “bring growth back to Britain”. It comes after she ruled out increases to income tax or national insurance under a Labour government . Reeves is expected to argue: “If we can bring business back to Labour, we can bring growth back to Britain.” The former Bank of England economist will tell business leaders that her party has changed under Sir Keir Starmer to “offer a government that is pro-worker and pro-business”. She is set to say: “If we can change this party to bring it back to the service of working people. If we can return it to the centre ground of politics. “If we can bring business back to Labour, then I know we can bring business back to Britain. “To bring investment back to Britain. To bring growth back to Britain. To bring hope back to Britain. Because by bringing business back to Britain we can deliver a better future for working people.” Reeves will also commit to delivering economic stability with tough spending rules, and promise that her plans for economic growth are “built on partnership with business”. She will stress that Labour will be a “mission-led government... a government that will build all its plans for the future on the bedrock of economic stability”. And drawing a dividing line with the Conservative government and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, she is expected to declare: “We will fight this election on the economy. “Every day we will expose the damage they have done, and set out Labour’s alternative. “Five missions for a decade of national renewal. And six first steps to point the way to a better Britain.” But Laura Trott, chief secretary to the Treasury, hit back, warning: “The bosses of Asda, Marks and Spencer (M&S), Currys and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) have all warned that Labour’s French-style union laws risk damaging the economy, costing jobs. “Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan that businesses can rely on. We took the bold action to deliver the biggest business tax cut in modern history. Labour would tie businesses in red tape and raise taxes by £2,094 on hardworking families.”",

All domestic burglaries will be attended by the police and properly investigated, Sir Ed Davey promised as the Liberal Democrats highlighted the scale of crimes going unsolved in Tory-held seats. Information obtained by the Liberal Democrats showed that 92% of burglaries went unsolved in 2023 in Esher and Walton, the seat where Dominic Raab is standing down. In South Cambridgeshire the figure was 91%, while in Runnymede it was 90%. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s local borough council Waverley had an 88% unsolved rate, while Surrey Heath where Michael Gove is standing down, was 85% unsolved. Victims are being denied justice because Conservative ministers can’t even get the basics right on solving crime Sir Ed Davey Across England and Wales, 76% of burglaries went unsolved. The best record was 4% in Northwich, Cheshire. Sir Ed said: “Too many families now feel unsafe in their own homes because this Conservative government has decimated frontline policing for too long. “Victims are being denied justice because Conservative ministers can’t even get the basics right on solving crime. “That is why the Liberal Democrats would deliver a burglary response guarantee, to ensure all home burglaries are attended by the police and properly investigated. “ People are sick of seeing their local communities plagued by crime and just want this appalling Conservative government to be kicked out of office. “In so many parts of the country, we have shown that it is the Liberal Democrats who can beat the Conservatives and deliver the change that the country is crying out for.” The figures were compiled from a series of Freedom of Information requests by the party, breaking down unsolved burglary data by local area. Some 33 of 43 police forces across England and Wales provided full responses with data provided for 329 local areas. Policing minister Chris Philp dismissed the Lib Dem attack. “This is another cynical statement from the Liberal Democrats who cannot say what they would do to tackle crime because they do not have a plan,” he said.

The reality is that the Conservatives are taking tough action on crime, driving down burglaries by 55% since 2010. “The choice in this election is clear, stick to the clear plan with Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, who have taken bold action to drive down crime by 54% since 2010 and bring criminals to justice, or go back to square one with Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party who have no plan to crack down on crime.” Create a FREE account to continue reading Registration is a free and easy way to support our journalism.

        "description": "The Ross County forward topped the club’s scoring charts this season with 23 goals across all competitions.",
        "content": "Simon Murray thinks that his self-belief – and an added clinical streak – has him in the absolute prime of his career. The 32-year-old finished the 2023/24 season as Ross County’s top scorer, finding the back of the net 23 times across all competitions. Crucially, he grabbed a brace in the play-off final second leg against Raith Rovers to help the Staggies ease to safety in what could have been a very tense situation. After the full time whistle, he was finally able to reflect back on what was one of the best years of his career – and silencing any doubters that did not believe he was cut out for the Premiership. “I never thought I was done at this level, but obviously in my whole career, at every club I’ve gone to, I’ve had doubters,” he reasoned. “I love that, because I love proving myself. I will work hard, and you are always going to have people, no matter what sort of player you are, who don’t think you’re good enough. “Maybe people wrote me off, but I’ve always felt like I have a point to prove, and that gives me a hunger going into training every day. “I feel like I’m in my prime. My career has been a whirlwind, but I’ve loved it all and I still feel like I’m hungry. “I’ve added to my game as I’ve got older, and I still do things because that’s just the way I am, that won’t change, but one thing is that I’ve had chances in previous years that I didn’t take and the last few years I’ve been more clinical. “Since the manager took over he has given me freedom, and put his belief in me. He knows what I’m like, and he just lets me do what I want to do. “I have loved this season to be honest. We’ve had ups and downs, but we’ve had great results – beating Rangers for the first time, and then beating Hearts and Hibs. “We need to build on this now, because we don’t want to be in this position every year. It’s good that Ross County want to be in the Premiership, but as players we want more, and hopefully we can get that.” With top flight football secured for another season, the focus in Dingwall will soon turn to working out how to avoid fighting relegation once again – if it has not already done so. Murray feels as though County’s home form shows that they can compete with the biggest teams in the Premiership, and he is looking forward to seeing how they can build for next year. “I think that together as a squad we were disappointed to be down in the play-offs again, but at the same time we knew we had come through tough times in the season,” he added. “To get back on track with some really good performances against some massive clubs towards the end of the season really brought that togetherness between the club and the fans again. “Since the manager took over, form has been good. I don’t know if you took it from that point where we would be, but we have competed at home especially. “He has been disappointed with the away form, and we don’t need to win every time we go on the road. A point can be a good result, and that’s something we can work on. “Last year, Kilmarnock’s away form wasn’t good, but they have picked up and look where it’s taken them. “If we can keep this home form going and pick up our away form – I think last Thursday was our second away win of the season, which shows how important it can be – that’s definitely an area we can work on.”",

        "description": "Abdallah Sima has said he is open to a return to Rangers next season after the success of his loan move from Brighton, saying that Ibrox feels like 'home'.",
        "content": "It didn’t quite pan out the way he had hoped, either on Saturday , or in his team’s collective season. But for Abdallah Sima, his loan move to Rangers has given him more than he could have dreamed – a feeling of being at home. The loanee has impressed throughout his stay in Glasgow, and had it not been for some bad luck with injuries, would surely have been in the mix when the end of season individual awards were being dished out. Had it not been for VAR spotting a push on Joe Hart by teammate Nicolas Raskin on Saturday, he might well have been heading back to Brighton as the scorer of the winning goal in a Scottish Cup final as well. READ MORE: How Celtic celebrations are fuelling Rangers for retribution That was not to be, but Sima doesn’t want the ‘what ifs’ from his time at Ibrox to linger for too long. And certainly not as long as the warm memories he will take with him back to England’s south coast. Indeed, there may well be scope to create more. Sima isn’t ruling out the possibility of returning to Rangers to help bolster Philippe Clement’s attempt at building a squad capable of knocking Celtic off their Premiership winning perch next season. While he admits that the decision may not be his to make, if the choice is presented to him, he is likely to jump at the chance. “It’s not up to me,” Sima said. “I always say I feel at home here and I’m happy to be here. I’ve always loved to give everything for this shirt. “As I say, this place feels like home and I feel everyone wants to stay in a place that feels like home, so we will see in the next few weeks. “I think I can be proud of my season and happy with what I’ve contributed. I wanted to do more but of course I had a bad moment with my injury, which ruled me out for a long time. But I’m always looking forward and I’m not looking back. “I really wanted to win the cup for the club, for my team-mates and I think we deserved to do that, to be honest. “But it wasn’t enough and now we need to look forward to next season.” The possibility of a potential return for Sima may provide some solace to Rangers supporters over those next few weeks, as they ponder the scale of the rebuild that Clement will look to undertake as he tries to finally put them back where they feel they belong at the top of the Scottish game. The wounds from yet another close call at the weekend may sting for a little while yet though, with Sima still smarting from the way in which his big Hampden moment was ripped away from him. “It’s tough when you score and you think you have given hope to the team - then have it taken away,” he said. “I just feel so much frustration that it was disallowed. But this happens in football , and you just have to deal with it. READ MORE: Brown says Celtic 'do talking on pitch' in swipe at Rangers “I’m here to be that player [who provides the big moments]. We’ve had some big chances in some big games like we did on Saturday, and I always want to give everything for the team. But unfortunately, on Saturday it wasn’t enough. “We feel disappointed about the final result. We wanted to win this game so badly. We knew it was an important match for us a team, for our fans, for the club. “So, we’re just so disappointed we couldn’t get the result we wanted.”",

        "content": "THUNDER BAY — The City of Thunder Bay has made a slight change in its plans for reconstructing the busy intersection of Memorial Avenue and the Harbour Expressway. Motorists should expect to encounter detours and delays. Overnight work and the partial closure of the intersection begins Monday evening, which is a day earlier than previously announced, and will continue until Saturday. From May 27 until June 1, the intersection will be partially closed each day between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. The city explained in a news release Monday that the intersection will be closed on Memorial Avenue on both Monday and Tuesday nights, but through traffic will still be allowed on the Harbour Expressway. Later in the week, the road closure will shift to the Harbour Expressway, while through traffic will be permitted again on Memorial. Some partial lane closures will also be in place for the next several weeks during daytime hours. The city said work that requires closure of the intersection is taking place overnight in order to minimize disruption to the public. Further overnight closures are expected in the last week of June, but the project is expected to be completed by the end of the month. The work includes rebuilding existing traffic signals and associated underground infrastructure that have reached end-of-life, and repaving the intersection.",

        "content": "Scott Brown has taken a thinly veiled swipe at Rangers attacker Todd Cantwell, saying that the difference between his old club and their city rivals is that Celtic do their talking on the pitch. The former Celtic captain had a run out at his old stomping ground at the weekend as a team of Parkhead legends took on a side of ex-Borussia Dortmund players in aid of The Celtic Foundation. READ MORE: How Celtic celebrations are fuelling Rangers for retribution And the now Ayr United manager showed that he still had it in the press room as well as on the pitch as he spelled out exactly why Brendan Rodgers’ men have had the edge over Rangers this season, winning four or their five meetings and sealing a league and Scottish Cup double. “There’s a lot of people talk in the press and talk on social media and do all their TikToks and Youtube stuff or whatever it is,” Brown said. “The good thing about our club is that they do their talking on the park, and they continue to do that. “It’s not about outside, it’s about the focus that is inside the football club and the mentality to keep going day to day. “I think Celtic always have that belief, whether it goes to the 98th minute or whatever it is.

Kyogo came under scrutiny at times this term after failing to hit the heights of his previous two seasons at the club, and despite some crucial goals in the final weeks of the Premiership title race, had another quiet afternoon at the national stadium.

But at the end of the day that’s his decision. “We want him to stay, though.” On a personal level, the season may not have gone as well as Kyogo hoped, but the forward is delighted that he and his teammates have managed to dig deep and end an often fraught campaign with a league and Scottish Cup double. “Throughout the 90 minutes I thought everyone fought,” he said. “In the end we got the result and we made everyone smile – so we’re happy about it.”",

        "content": "Tony Khan comments on AEW potentially holding a show in Japan with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. In recent years, AEW and NJPW have built up an increasingly strong relationship. They held the first Forbidden Door event together in 2022, and it has become an annual pay-per-view. The two companies allow their wrestlers to compete for the other, and former AEW World Champion Jon Moxley currently holds the IWGP World Heavyweight Championship. During the AEW Double or Nothing post-show media scrum , Tony Khan and NJPW President Hiroshi Tanahashi were asked about potentially holding a co-promoted event in Japan. “It’s an interesting idea, the idea of maybe doing AEW versus New Japan in Japan. We always do it in North America, we’ve done Chicago, Toronto, New York, doing something different. I believe if we did something, I think that is a great idea, it’s something that would be a great possibility, it would not necessarily be Forbidden Door, though. Forbidden Door, I think we’ve built something really special. I think there’s a lot of exciting possibilities, and that would be great for AEW and New Japan, and that could be an exciting next step, in addition to what we do here at Forbidden Door, typically in North America, but we could do Forbidden Door internationally too, so you never know. But I think we’ve got something really special with Forbidden Door. We could do some more projects, potentially, too. That’s a great idea. “There are so many great wrestlers in New Japan and in AEW. I think if AEW were to send a big crew to Japan, I think that would be really exciting, and I would love that. That could be Forbidden Door, but it could also be in addition to Forbidden Door.” This article first appeared on Wrestlezone and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "Scott Brown says that the 'winning mentality' of Brendan Rodgers, Callum McGregor and James Forrest is what separates Celtic from Rangers.",
        "content": "There may have been some, but there can’t have been too many Celtic supporters who shared the same level of confidence that Scott Brown did as the clock ticked into the dying minutes of the Scottish Cup final on Saturday. The champions had largely been on the back foot during the second half at Hampden, with their main players looking leggy after a long, arduous season, and Rangers seeming to have an extra bounce in their step. Brown though, who had a ringside seat as he performed punditry duties, was the most relaxed Celtic supporter in the national stadium. Why? “Callum, James, Brendan,” Brown said simply. With that trio on hand – Brown’s successor as captain, Callum McGregor, the revitalised James Forrest and manager Brendan Rodgers - to guide the rest of the Celtic team with their vast experience of such situations, and of coming out on top of them, Brown was certain that there was only going to be one outcome. READ MORE: Brown says Celtic 'do talking on pitch' in swipe at Rangers It may have been Paulo Bernardo’s fresh legs that burst from midfield and got the shot away that proved too hot for Rangers keeper Jack Butland to handle, and it may have been Adam Idah that barrelled in to finish it off, but in Brown’s mind, there is no doubt that it is his old teammates and manager who are the difference between the Glasgow teams at present. “They know how to win, they know how to win trophies,” he said. “Rangers step up on those big occasions and they can’t finish it off. “For me, Callum, James and Brendan, they always get over the line. It’s just that winning mentality, and that is the difference between the two clubs.” The way that the match at the weekend played out seemed to encapsulate the season in many ways, with Rangers providing a stiff test to Celtic at times, but being unable to reach out and grab the prize when the opportunity presented itself. “That’s football , you’re never going to get it all your own way,” Brown said. “You’ve always got to have that belief, and when you’ve got a manager that is calm and collected and is not erratic on the bench or in the press or to the players, then it brings calmness to the whole squad. That’s what you want in a top football club like this. “I never had any doubts, I told you all at the start of the season and I’m sure a couple of other people dived in and said it was never going to happen. Yet again, I was right. “It was brilliant, I’m delighted for the lads to continue winning games and continue winning trebles and doubles, it’s brilliant because Celtic fans expect it. “At the same time the lads worked so hard, and it is probably their 55th or 56th game of the season or whatever it is, so for the lads to continue...they looked a little bit tired at the end, but they still grafted away and worked hard. “You can see what it meant to all the fans and the players as well.” The question is, and it is one that exasperated Rangers fans must have been asking themselves for some time now, is just how long this period of domestic dominance for Celtic can last. Access to the bounty that comes with participation in the expanded Champions League after winning this season’s Premiership may be one reason why it endures further still, but in Brown’s mind, it is also because the likes of Celtic captain McGregor still have plenty of miles – and medals – left in the tank. “He’s going to have a lot more, don’t worry about that,” he said. “He’s going to have a lot more, I’ve got belief in that. Same with James as well, he’ll keep continuing and keep going. I don’t know how many they have got, and how many James has got, but they will keep going and keep going. “Even for Joe (Hart) to come in and win trebles and win doubles, it’s been an exciting part of his career as well to come up at his age. “I speak to all the lads and there is not one person who says a bad word about him. He’s a very humble person. “He could have come up to Celtic and shown he was a big-time player, but he has been in that dressing room day-in, day-out, working hard. “We had the young lad Josh (Clarke) on loan from Celtic as well, and Josh couldn’t speak highly enough of him either.” That Celtic connection is benefitting Brown in his new role as manager of Ayr United, not only giving him access to promising young talent like Clarke, but helping to swell the Honest Men’s coffers, as Rodgers has agreed to bring his team to Somerset Park for the first time in 25 years on July 5th. READ MORE: How Celtic celebrations are fuelling Rangers for retribution The friendly will mark the opening of United’s new stand, and Brown is thankful to his old manager not only for the gesture, but for affording his players the opportunity to measure themselves against the best the country has to offer. “It’s brilliant, what Brendan and the club have done to come along and help us out in that way, and even to help with Josh, that’s been exceptional,” he said. “It will also give us a level to show the lads what it is to be champions, what it is to be mentally strong as well. “It might not be the starting XI from the cup final that plays because a lot of them will still be at the Euros and stuff, but it will still be a strong Celtic team and I’ll be looking forward to it.”",

        "content": "The Parkhead legend lauded the current crop of talent for doing their talking on the park away from social media. Get the latest news from Record Sport with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest news from Record Sport with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Scott Brown says Celtic do their talking in trophies and not on TikTok. And the former Parkhead hero is adamant a big-game winning mentality separates his old club from rivals Rangers . Celtic have made their latest on-pitch statements with the collection of a 13th major Double. Defeat of the Ibrox team in the Scottish Cup Final at Hampden backed up their success over the Light Blues in the Premiership title race. Celtic delivered when the heat was on with their record over Rangers in the season reading four wins and one draw from five games. The champions are currently on a staggering run of success which has seen them land 19 of the last 24 domestic trophies with Brown was captain at the start of that sequence. Celtic have maintained a humble and hard working approach through their success and with no outlandish or brash statements. Asked if his old club did their talking on the park, Brown stated: “There’s a lot of people talk in the press, talk on social media and do all their TikToks and YouTube stuff or whatever it is. The good thing about our club is that they do their talking on the park, and they continue to do that. “It’s not about outside, it’s about the focus that is inside the football club and the mentality to keep going day to day. I’m delighted for the lads to continue winning games and continue winning trebles and doubles, it’s brilliant because Celtic fans expect it.” Brown looks at the silver-laden trio of stalwarts Callum McGregor and James Forrest as well as boss Brendan Rodgers as proof of the mental ability to do it when it matters. He said: “Callum, James, Brendan. They know how to win, they know how to win trophies. “Rangers step up on those big occasions and they can’t finish it off. For me, Callum, James and Brendan, they always get over the line. It’s just that winning mentality and that is the difference between the two clubs.” Celtic displayed that trait again when defeating the Ibrox team at Hampden to win the Final through Adam Idah’s 90th minute winner. Brown said: “I think Celtic always have that belief, whether it goes to the 98th minute or whatever it is. “As soon as Celtic scored the goal, it looked like Rangers had just collapsed, and they never had any belief that they could go and nick a goal back. Celtic re-energised and you felt they could keep the ball again.”",

        "description": "All domestic burglaries will be attended by the police and properly investigated, Sir Ed Davey promised as the Liberal Democrats highlighted the scale of crimes going unsolved in Tory-held seats.",
        "content": "Information obtained by the Liberal Democrats showed that 92% of burglaries went unsolved in 2023 in Esher and Walton, the seat where Dominic Raab is standing down. In South Cambridgeshire the figure was 91%, while in Runnymede it was 90%. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s local borough council Waverley had an 88% unsolved rate, while Surrey Heath where Michael Gove is standing down, was 85% unsolved. Across England and Wales, 76% of burglaries went unsolved. The best record was 4% in Northwich, Cheshire. Sir Ed said: “Too many families now feel unsafe in their own homes because this Conservative government has decimated frontline policing for too long. “Victims are being denied justice because Conservative ministers can’t even get the basics right on solving crime. “That is why the Liberal Democrats would deliver a burglary response guarantee, to ensure all home burglaries are attended by the police and properly investigated. “People are sick of seeing their local communities plagued by crime and just want this appalling Conservative government to be kicked out of office. “In so many parts of the country, we have shown that it is the Liberal Democrats who can beat the Conservatives and deliver the change that the country is crying out for.” The figures were compiled from a series of Freedom of Information requests by the party, breaking down unsolved burglary data by local area. Some 33 of 43 police forces across England and Wales provided full responses with data provided for 329 local areas. Policing minister Chris Philp dismissed the Lib Dem attack. “This is another cynical statement from the Liberal Democrats who cannot say what they would do to tackle crime because they do not have a plan,” he said. “A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for Sir Keir Starmer and the Labour Party. The reality is that the Conservatives are taking tough action on crime, driving down burglaries by 55% since 2010. “The choice in this election is clear, stick to the clear plan with Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, who have taken bold action to drive down crime by 54% since 2010 and bring criminals to justice, or go back to square one with Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party who have no plan to crack down on crime.”",

        "description": "A Labour government will be both pro-business and pro-worker, Rachel Reeves is set to promise in her first major election speech on Tuesday.",
        "content": "The shadow chancellor is expected to tell business leaders that, having brought business back to Labour, the party can now “bring growth back to Britain”. She will say: “By bringing business back to Britain we can deliver a better future for working people.” Under Sir Keir Starmer, Labour has tried to woo businesses as a way of demonstrating it can be trusted with the economy. Those efforts have brought success, with business attendance at recent party conferences higher than under Jeremy Corbyn and wealthy businessmen donating more to Labour’s war chest. But in her speech on Tuesday, former Bank of England analyst Ms Reeves is expected to stress the need for a partnership with business, government and workers. She will say Labour offers “a government that is pro-worker and pro-business, in the knowledge that each depends upon the success of the other”. Her remarks come after Labour faced a backlash over an apparent rebranding of its “New Deal for Workers”, with Britain’s largest trade union Unite warning that the party must “stick to its guns” on workers’ rights. Labour insisted it had not watered down its commitments, adding the proposals had followed agreement with the unions. The Conservatives have argued that Labour’s proposals would cost jobs and place unnecessary burdens on businesses, but the opposition have claimed good businesses will welcome the plans. Ms Reeves is also expected to stress Labour’s commitment to economic stability, a key message of the campaign, and urge voters to “pass judgment on 14 years of economic chaos and decline under the Conservatives”. Her speech is the second major intervention from Labour of the week, following Sir Keir Starmer’s address on Monday, in which he promised to stand up for working people. Treasury Chief Secretary Laura Trott said Labour would “tie businesses in red tape”. “The bosses of Asda, Marks and Spencer, Currys and the Confederation of British Industry have all warned that Labour’s French-style union laws risk damaging the economy, costing jobs,” she said. “Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives have a clear plan that businesses can rely on. “We took the bold action to deliver the biggest business tax cut in modern history. Labour would tie businesses in red tape and raise taxes by £2,094 on hardworking families.” SNP Westminster economy spokesman Drew Hendry said: “The latest speech by Rachel Reeves cynically ignore the most fundamental reason for the economic decline of the United Kingdom – Britain is broken and Brexit broke it.”",

        "description": "Furious Inverness Caley Thistle fans plot revolt over training base plan.",
        "content": "Angry Caley Thistle fans will tonight pack out an emergency meeting to discuss a protest strategy to reverse the club’s decision to relocate first-team training to Fife . It is understood a potentially damaging season ticket boycott will be one possible tactic discussed. With shock and fury evident among fans, the ICT Supporters’ Trust will host up to three times its usual turn-out for meetings at the Caley Social Club on Greig Street. The Caley Thistle board provoked an extraordinary backlash from supporters on Friday after announcing they planned to adopt Kelty Hearts’ New Central Park ground in Fife as a first-team base from this summer. The plan has also been widely condemned and ridiculed by past players and national media outlets. Local politicians including Drew Hendry MP and Emma Roddick MSP have also called for a rethink, the latter seeking support and advice from the Scottish Government. Accused of betraying their community roots, the club has claimed that significant sums could be saved by the move following relegation from the Championship to League One. They hope to subsidise the first-team squad by removing the need to pay for rehousing of central belt-based signings in the Highlands. But the specially convened Trust meeting will hear heated demands for a U-turn by the under-fire board. “Anger, disbelief and a sense of betrayal,” was how Trust spokesman George Moodie summed up the mood among furious supporters contacting him. Mr Moodie said: “I genuinely feel that way myself. “Disbelief that the leadership of this club could do what they have done to our club. They are ripping the heart and soul of the club away from our community. “It’s an insult to Inverness and the Highlands that we are told we need to do this.” The Trust has resisted the temptation to move the emergency meeting to a larger venue given huge interest in the event and an incredible recent surge in their own membership. Contrary to speculation, the meeting will not be livestreamed on social media. Numbers pledging themselves to Trust membership have soared by 90 per cent in less than two weeks and by 173 per cent in the three months since February’s fans’ meeting. Mr Moodie said: “Pledges to attend the meeting have risen to up to 150. That’s pushing double to treble what we would normally have. “You get a sense of the incredible strength of feeling against what the board is doing. “The rise in membership has been absolutely fantastic. We have surpassed all expectations and it is growing daily. “We’re very grateful to the supporters and we would encourage those who haven’t yet joined to please do so - friends, family, kids, mum and dad. “The more members we have, the more it increases the fans’ voice. “It highlights the appreciation and love there is for our football club and adds strength to our aspirations to facilitate change at the club.” Other items on the agenda will include an update on moves by the Trust to gain a seat for supporters on the Caley Thistle board. Mr Moodie continued: “We will update the fans on our recent communications with the club, so they are fully up to speed with where the Trust is. “We’ve always listened to and always acted upon the advice and desires of the support, being that conduit for conversations with the club. “We will take forward suggestions, but we will also share what we believe should be the next steps.” Reacting to the Caley Thistle announcement of the Kelty deal on Friday, late that night the Trust issued a powerfully-worded condemnation of the training ground plan. Calling for a “change of leadership”, but avoiding a call for the board to resign, ICT Supporters’ Trust described the decision to relocate first team training to Kelty Hearts’ ground “bizarre” and said the team would now be “completely disconnected” from the local community. The statement said: “(This) rips the soul of the club out of the community. “Hundreds of fans and numerous ex-players want to see the club re-engage with the local community, supporters, and businesses. “The club’s answer to that is to move the whole footballing department’s training base 140 miles away.” The supporters’ trust also wants answers on the future of the club’s youth academy, which is remaining in Inverness, and how young local players will be able to retain a pathway to the first team. READ MORE: Major change to SPFL competition confirmed as prize money increased It is understood a senior coach will remain mainly Inverness-based to act as a bridge between the academy and the first team. The Trust statement added: “We reiterate our demands for change that allows for fresh leadership of our football club, with supporters at the centre of the club’s decision-making.” Announcing the plan as part of a “radical restructuring”, a Caley Thistle statement read: “The last few years have seen the geographic challenges in getting players to move to the Highlands become ever harder for a number of reasons “Caledonian Stadium will always be our home, but other factors in Scottish football have changed. “Where we train should not be an impediment to the quality of the players we can attract to Caley Thistle, or to our potential to progress.” The club blamed “the commercial success of the city of Inverness” for high property prices, with limited housing stock “a huge factor working against us”. But it added: “For the avoidance of any doubt, we absolutely intend to continue to develop our own homegrown Highland boys.”",

        "content": "A group of aquaculture industry suppliers are appealing to the Prime Minister and cabinet to allow for a six-year salmon farm licence renewal in the salmon farming sector in B.C. and elsewhere. “We need your help. As businesses engaged in the British Columbia Salmon Farming Sector, we directly employ many hundreds of British Columbians, and indirectly support thousands more,” says the letter signed by 24 business owners and managers in the B.C. salmon farming sector. In 2019, the federal Liberals made an election commitment that would move fish farms out of the water an onto land-based operations but that commitment “came with no consultation with our employees or the families they support,” the letter says. Since that time, little to no concrete information has been put forward – leaving an entire sector mired in uncertainty, the letter says. The impact of that uncertainty alone has and continues to negatively impact British Columbians as a whole, the businesses say. “Those within this food production sector are unable to plan for the future of their families, not knowing if their jobs will exist in the months and years ahead. This is an unjust and unfair situation for the hard-working people of this province. Additionally, the private sector is limited in its ability to invest further in the face of this continued uncertainty.” The sector has shown a commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, they say, and the plan is to accelerate this trajectory to become world leaders over the next decade, if given the opportunity. “The future that all parties want includes the most progressive and ethical methods of salmon farming. But it’s a future that requires hard work and investment, resources that require a long-term outlook to succeed. Overall, we know that a ‘Responsible BC Salmon Farming’ transition pathway is within our reach. This path can and must support enhanced wild salmon protection, further Indigenous reconciliation, continued innovation, the highest quality home-grown food production, and additional job creation across our province. “To get there, we need you to provide the certainty needed for further private sector investment. Our people need hope for the future, and certainty that they will be able to provide for their families tomorrow. A single salmon production cycle takes six years from start to finish. We ask that you take the next step with us, and support a minimum six-year license renewal.” READ MORE: First Nation finfish alliance releases review of pro-salmon-farming science B.C. group wants feds to stop marking their own salmon farming homework",

        "content": "La aerolínea mexicana Aeroméxico anunció este lunes que suspenderá sus vuelos a Quito por seis meses debido a una baja en el número de pasajeros, en medio de la crisis diplomática entre México y Ecuador. Las operaciones entre la capital ecuatoriana y Ciudad de México quedarán suspendidas del 1°. de julio al 18 de diciembre, según la compañía. Ambos países rompieron relaciones luego de que, la noche del 5 de abril, un comando policial de élite ecuatoriano irrumpió en la embajada mexicana en Quito. El objetivo era detener al refugiado exvicepresidente Jorge Glas, acusado de corrupción, pero quien pidió asilo alegando persecución política. México, el primero en anunciar la ruptura, cerró su embajada. Los ecuatorianos deben viajar a Perú o Colombia para tramitar la visa en oficinas consulares mexicanas. La embajada ecuatoriana en la capital mexicana está inactiva. Cualquier trámite se debe realizar en Guatemala o Estados Unidos. Los dos gobiernos ahora se enfrentan en la Corte Penal Internacional. México acusó a Ecuador de violar la Convención de Viena de 1961, que garantiza la inviolabilidad de las sedes diplomáticas. El gobierno mexicano exige que Ecuador pague los daños por el asalto y que sea suspendido como miembro de las Naciones Unidas. (Rafael Pacheco Granados)",

        "content": "SIR Keir Starmer made his big pitch yesterday, insisting he has “permanently” changed the Labour Party. As a result he claims he can now be trusted with national security. It’s a very public acknowledgement that he still has a lot of work to do to win over unconvinced voters. Four years ago he sat silently in the Shadow Cabinet as his leader Jeremy Corbyn swore never to fire Britain’s nuclear weapons. Now he’s pledging a “100-day review” to assess what’s needed to keep us safe. We can save him the time. The threats are: reckless dictator Putin , scheming China , North Korea, Iran , Hamas, IS, unchecked illegal migrants and international organised crime gangs. Add to that home-grown Far Right, Northern Irish and Islamist terrorism. What people really need to know is whether Labour is prepared to put its money where its mouth is. The party’s failure to say it will commit to Rishi Sunak’s plans to spend £75billion on defence means any promise it makes to protect Britain is in danger of sounding like hot air. Sir Keir’s short-term ambition is to kick out the Tories on July 4. But where it leaves the security of the country on July 5 is still not wholly clear. RISHI Sunak yesterday offered what he believes is clear blue water between the Conservatives and Labour. His offer on pensions is designed to shore up wavering older voters. A boost rising to almost £2,000 by 2029 for OAPs backs up years of action to protect their income and assets. Coupled with his surprise pledge on National Service, it’s clear the PM is aiming at his core vote. Both are welcome ideas. What is needed now are new policies to help younger voters and new families. We hope Rishi has something up his sleeve to solve the desperate housing shortage, which is pricing young people out of home ownership. As it stands, many see no reason to even consider voting Tory. Let’s see what the PM can do for them, too. AFTER a Spring washout and the soggy beginning of a so far less-than-exciting election campaign, weather experts are now predicting 50 days of summer rain. We just pray favourites England can bring us some sunnier cheer at the Euros next month. With our forward line of superstars, there’s no fear of a goal drought. So if our defence can avoid making heavy weather of it, surely the Three Lions can take the tournament by storm.",

        "description": "Newfoundland and Labrador's speed-camera program is moving from the test phase to the real thing: actual tickets instead of warnings.",
        "content": "Speed cameras could be installed on roads in Newfoundland and Labrador by the end of the summer, according to Digital Government Minister Sarah Stoodley. (Joseph Tunney/CBC) Newfoundland and Labrador's speed-camera program is moving from the test phase to the real thing. Digital Government Minister Sarah Stoodley announced Monday that cameras that generate speeding tickets will be installed on Newfoundland and Labrador's roads by the end of the summer. \"We know that speed cameras reduce accidents. They reduce incidents, and so really we're trying to make people slow down. Because people are dying on our roadways, because people are dying too fast,\" Stoodley said Monday. \"We really need to change the culture of driving in our province. We're hoping speed cameras is one way of doing that.\" Stoodley's department launched a three-month pilot program last summer, installing cameras on roads in Mount Pearl and Paradise. The cameras caught more than 94,000 vehicles travelling at least 11 km/h over the speed limit, but warnings were handed out, rather than tickets. Once the cameras are in place tickets will start at $200 for a person's first offence, and can run up to $1,900 depending on the speed. Stoodley said the tickets will be given to the registered owner of the vehicle captured on camera. Stoodley said the government will issue a request for proposals for vendors to install and monitor road speed cameras, which will require changes to legislation to allow the issuing of electronic speeding tickets by a third party that installs, operates and maintains the cameras. N.L. hopes to launch speeding cameras in 2024, minister says Warnings now, tickets later? Speed camera pilot project wraps up in Mount Pearl and Paradise Stoodley says she believes the cameras will pay for themselves but even if they don't, she'll be satisfied if they lead to safer roads. (Ted Dillon/CBC) Tickets will be issued on paper for now, Stoodley said, but the province will move to issuing electronic tickets via email and the MyGovNL system. WATCH | Technology will play a part when you get a speeding ticket on camera, says Sarah Stoodley: Speeders beware. 10 cameras are coming to N.L. roads — locations TBD 4 hours ago Duration 0:55 Service N.L. Minister Sarah Stoodley says some provincial legislation will be changed to allow for tickets to be issued to the owner of a car caught speeding on camera. Stoodley also said police won't be bogged down fighting speeding tickets in court, as the province searches to find a private company to take it on. Stoodley said the initial batch of 10 cameras should be installed by the end of the summer. The location of those cameras haven't been decided yet, she added, but will mostly be positioned on the Avalon Peninsula due to population density. The cameras won't be permanently placed but will be moved among different locations. The province will also work with municipalities who might want cameras installed. Stoodley said a cost for the plan hasn't been decided as the details for the request for proposals haven't been decided. She said the government believes the cameras will pay for themselves but added she'd be fine with taking a financial loss if it led to safer driving. There are also plans to expand the use of cameras, like at red lights and on the arms of school bus stop signs, she said.

        "content": "The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Tajudeen Abbas on Monday urged the 36 state governors to support President Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his commitment towards granting full autonomy to the local government areas in the country. Abbas made the call at the National Discourse on Nigeria’s Security Challenges and Good Governance at the Local Government Level organised by the House of Representatives in Abuja. The speaker recalled that the federal government recently filed a legal action against the usurpation of local government functions by the sub-national governments. He said the decision was indicative of Tinubu’s determination to correct the anomalies in the system to encourage speedy development at the local government level, stressing that the House has also made frantic efforts through various legislative interventions to arrest the situation. While lamenting the challenges facing the local governments, he assured that the House is committed to making the local government administration function optimally according to their mandate. Abbas represented by Deputy Speaker Benjamin Kalu said, “The failure of local government is well known to us. Despite the extensive provisions of the 1999 Constitution regarding the existence and functions of local governments, that tier of government has failed to live up to its billing. “Some of the most significant challenges impeding their ability to fulfil their constitutionally assigned roles include the covert usurpation of local government functions by state governments, a lack of financial autonomy due to the State Joint Local Government Account, political instability from tenure irregularities, and pervasive corruption. “A critical component of the President’s Renewed Hope Agenda is the integration of local governments into the mainstream of governance in Nigeria. In a significant move, the Federal Government recently instituted legal action against the governors of the 36 states at the Supreme Court, addressing alleged misconduct in the administration of Local Government Areas (LGAs). “This action underscores the President’s profound commitment to this issue, one he is intimately familiar with from his tenure as Governor of Lagos State. “We in the 10th National Assembly are determined and committed to ensuring local governments are recognised and sufficiently empowered to perform their constitutionally assigned roles. As contained in our legislative agenda, the House will continue to play a crucial role in advocating for and enacting the necessary legislative frameworks to ensure that local governments are granted the autonomy they rightfully deserve. “This is not just a legislative duty but a commitment to the democratic aspirations of the Nigerian people and the Constitution. For this reason, I call on all governors to put Nigeria first and collectively support the president in the quest to grant full autonomy to local governments. We must definitively resolve the controversy surrounding the status of local governments by providing the framework needed to ensure their optimal operation. “Let me reassure you that the outcomes of this national dialogue will receive the full attention of the House and its Committee on Constitutional Amendment.” Also speaking at the summit, Deputy Speaker Kalu represented by the House Leader, Hon. Julius Ihonvbere regretted that non-state actors are taking advantage of ungoverned spaces in the local government areas to make life unbearable for people in rural communities. “History often takes unexpected turns. Like a once-mighty warrior whose shield has grown rusty, our local governance system has faltered. The gaps in service delivery are wide, and the very people who need them most—our rural citizens—are suffering. This, in turn, has fueled social unrest and violence, creating fertile ground for those who seek to exploit instability. “As many political analysts and development experts have noted, the near absence or complete breakdown of governance at the local level has created ungoverned spaces. “These spaces have been exploited by non-state actors, making life increasingly unbearable for our rural populace. This is a stark reminder of the urgent need for reform and revitalization at the grassroots level. “Efforts to address these issues through constitutional amendments by the 7th, 8th, and 9th National Assemblies were not successful. Various reasons have been cited for these failures, but what remains clear is that the situation has continued to deteriorate without effective alternative measures being put in place,” Kalu said. “Specifically, we aim to discuss the bottlenecks inhibiting effective governance at the local government level, ascertain the extent to which weak governance contributes to insecurity and other developmental challenges, galvanize public action for improved governance and service delivery at the subnational level, leverage ongoing reforms like the debate on state police and the constitution amendment exercise, and build national consensus on the most appropriate strategies for strengthening local government governance.",

        "content": "by: Travis Schlepp Posted: May 27, 2024 / 02:29 PM PDT Updated: May 27, 2024 / 02:29 PM PDT The ocean was closed off to all beachgoers in San Clemente Monday after officials confirmed “aggressive shark behavior” just off the coast. The sharks were spotted near T-Street Beach, according to a social media post by the City of San Clemente. Officials did not elaborate on the number of sharks spotted or what led to their behavior being deemed “aggressive.” Water access was set to be closed to the public through at least 8 p.m. Monday night, assuming no new shark sightings. Video from Sky5 showed many people continuing to enjoy Memorial Day at the beach despite the warnings. Several people were seen wading into the water. A December 2022 study found that there were some 201 “confirmed shark incidents” in state waters between January 1950 and December 2021. Fifteen of those encounters were fatal and another 107 involved non-fatal injuries. Fish and Wildlife officials say the only way to avoid any risk of having a shark encounter is to avoid the ocean altogether. But while humans have greatly increased their beach and ocean activity, including surfing, swimming and scuba diving, shark incidents have not increased at the same rate.

        "content": "Last week, late Wednesday night, in the Los Angeles area was broken into and burglarized. The LAPD is currently searching for the perpetrators. Around 11:30 PM on May 22, three persons were seen inside the 27-year-old's crib, according to TMZ Sports. Police were sent to the location when the thieves were detected, maybe by a surveillance camera or by a witness on the property, even though the 7-foot tall center was not at home at the time. Police are looking into the burglary after creating a report. It's unclear what, if anything, was stolen during the break-in. Zubac, a 2013 second-round selection, has been the victim of a burglary at his house before. When police arrived at the location in 2021, two suspected individuals had already left the premises. Zubac's $20k dollar Rolex watch vanished after his residence was broken into. This season, Zubac has averaged over 12 points and 9 rebounds while playing for the Clippers. In the NBA playoffs' opening round, the Dallas Mavericks defeated the club. Throughout his time in the NBA, Ivica Zubac has resided in the Los Angeles area, being with the Clippers and Lakers. In his third season in the NBA, the Los Angeles Lakers traded him to the Clippers after selecting him with a second-round choice in the 2016 NBA draft. He joined the Clippers during the 2018–19 season. He helped lead Los Angeles to the playoffs, where it was defeated by the Dallas Mavericks in the opening round. According to his current contract, Zubac will begin his final season in 2024–2025. The Clippers are looking to , which may be hard to do. with older star players like Russell Westbrook and James Harden. Zubac has been a constant on the Clippers. He is a reliable double-double machine and a good anchor on defense. This, unfortunately, is the second time his Los Angeles home has been broken into in the past few years. All in all, the good news is that Zubac and his family were unharmed and didn't have a run-in with the burglars. [ ]",

        "content": "Lizzo is sounding off after South Park referenced her in their special episode spoofing weight-loss drugs like Ozempic. South Park: The End of Obesity , streaming now on Paramount+, follows foul-mouthed Cartman after he recruits Kyle, Stan, Butters and Kenny for help when he is denied access to a weight-loss drug. According to USA Today , after he learns his insurance won’t cover Ozempic to help him drop pounds, Cartman is made aware of a drug called Lizzo. “Insurance companies only cover the medication for diabetes, not for weight loss, so if you can’t afford them, you’re just kind of out of luck,” the doctor says. Instead, he writes Cartman “a prescription for Lizzo.” “She’s a really good singer who talks about body positivity and just being happy with the way you look,” the doctor quips. “I want you to listen to Lizzo five times a day and watch her videos just before bedtime. Oh, and I’m afraid you’ll have to be on Lizzo for the rest of your life.” “FDA-approved Lizzo makes you feel good about your weight, and it costs 90% less than Ozempic. ... In case studies, 70% of patients on Lizzo no longer cared how much they weighed,” a voiceover in a fake commercial for the drug says on the show, continuing the joke. “Lizzo helps you eat everything you want and keep physical activity to a minimum.” Following the gag, Lizzo posted a video to Instagram and TikTok , “Guys, my worst fear has been actualized. I’ve been referenced in a South Park episode. I’m so scared.” But the Grammy winner went on to call the segment “crazy” as she said she was proud she was namedropped by the animated show. “I just feel like, damn, I’m really that bitch. I really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a f— to the point where these men in Colorado ( South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone) know who the f— I am and put it on their cartoon that’s been around for 25 years. I’m really that bitch and I show you how to not give a f— and I’ll keep showing you how to not give a f—.” The South Park bit comes after Lizzo was accused last year by some of her former dancers of harassment and fat shaming. Last summer’s court filing claimed that after performing a concert in Amsterdam, Lizzo and her crew attended a sexually themed show at a club in the city’s notorious Red Light District where “Lizzo (allegedly) began inviting cast members to take turns touching the nude performers.” During the show, Lizzo allegedly led a chant pressuring one dancer to touch the breasts of one of the nude women performing at the club, the filing states. “Plaintiffs were aghast with how little regard Lizzo (allegedly) showed for the bodily autonomy of her employees and those around her, especially in the presence of many people whom she employed,” the complaint stated. Lizzo was also accused of calling out one performer for her weight gain. The About Damn Time singer has denied the allegations. mdaniell@postmedia.com",

At its height, over 100,000 people lived there, blocked by Jordan from entering into the kingdom at a time when concerns about infiltration by the extremist group were rampant.

Emergency services were called to the banks of the Cook River in Earlwood, southwest Sydney , at about 4.30pm on Monday after a passerby walking a dog spotted a placenta and an umbilical cord. The 'evidence of birth' were later confirmed by police to be human. Search teams, boats and divers returned to the river at first light on Tuesday after a large-scale search of the river and surrounding areas was conducted overnight. When asked whether police were concerned the day-old baby could be in the water, Detective Chief Superintendent Christine McDonald said the whereabouts of the mother and child was her main priority. 'At this stage our main concern is for the whereabouts for the mother and the child, we see that as a real urgent matter for us to find her and her child, hopefully safe and healthy,' she told a press conference on Monday night. Police have responded to fears a newborn baby could be in the Cook River in Sydney's southwest after a passerby walking a dog spotted 'evidence of birth' at 4.30pm on Monday A placenta and umbilical cord found on the riverbank was confirmed by police to be human Superintendent McDonald said it remained unclear whether the child was born on the banks of the Cook River or elsewhere. 'All we know is that a placenta and an umbilical cord were located. Obviously, our search will identify what has taken place,' she said. 'Whether that birth or delivery of that child occurred at this location, or another location, is yet to be determined.' Police have urged the mother and child to present at a hospital and said they do not need to speak to police if they don't want to. 'It is very important, and it is extreme urgency that we find the mother and child as soon as we can. Obviously, we will be contacting hospitals, we ask that she goes to a hospital,' Superintendent McDonald said. 'If any family and friends have any information, our request is that she gets to a hospital as soon as possible.' Superintendent McDonald said it remained unclear whether the child was born on the banks of the Cook River or elsewhere as the mother and child are urged to present to hospital Detectives are hopeful a busy walking track near the riverbank will mean there are witnesses who may have seen the mother and child. Police are also seeking CCTV footage from Lang Road, Wardell Road, Ewen Park or Tennent Parade in Earlwood, about 10km southwest of Sydney's CBD. 'That's why we are appealing for information overnight and tomorrow morning when people are hearing the news that this placenta and umbilical cord have been located,' Superintendent McDonald said on Monday. 'There's lots of houses and businesses in this area, and we do hope that someone will have CCTV footage, anyone that may have seen a pregnant woman or a woman in distress.' As inquiries continue police are urging anyone with CCTV vision or information about the incident to contact Burwood Police or Crime Stoppers.

        "content": "Kendall Jenner and her former flame Bad Bunny have sent tongues wagging once again after their recent rendezvous in Miami, Florida. The pair, who sent shockwaves through their fanbase with a surprise reunion at a Met Gala after-party in New York City earlier this month, were spotted together as they made a discreet exit from their luxury hotel. Eager paparazzi caught glimpses of the duo as they followed each other through the hotel's parking garage, with a handler dutifully carting their luggage. Despite attempts to keep a low profile, Kendall and Bad Bunny were seen slipping into the back of the same car, under the watchful eye of a security guard. Their reunion comes amidst whispers of a rekindled romance, following their split in December 2023, just before the holiday season. Fueling further speculation, the model has been a consistent presence at Bad Bunny's recent concerts in Miami, making appearances at two out of three shows at the Kaseya Center. But it's not just concerts that have brought these two back into each other's orbit. The pair has been spotted enjoying intimate dinners, including a visit to hiss own restaurant, Gekko, and plans for a leisurely lunch at Grutman's Casadonna restaurant on Sunday. Jenner stepped out sporting a chic ensemble as she attempted to shield herself from prying eyes.",

        "content": "LUTON ace Ross Barkley flaunted his shredded abs as he took to the beach in sunny Barbados with girlfriend Katherine Pilkington. The Premier League star , 30, played the doting boyfriend - carefully applying sun cream on the stunning blonde’s back as she soaked up the rays in a tiny monochrome bikini. Ross stopped to adjust his blue swim shorts - showing off his rugged physique in the process - as the loved-up couple took a stroll along the golden sands. Accounts executive Katherine, who counts Love Island’s Ellie Brown as one of her best friends, looked smitten during the romantic trip to the Caribbean island. The well-earned break comes as Aston Villa are reportedly in advanced talks to make Ross their first summer signing. Earlier this month, The Sun revealed the club has a ‘strong interest’ in signing the midfielder , who has also interested Manchester United , for a nominal fee of around £2 million Unai Emery has been impressed by the 33-times-capped England international's outstanding form this season on his return to the Premier League. SunSport understands Villa's President of Football Operations Monchi has a 'strong interest,' in signing Barkley, who has also interested Manchester United, for a nominal fee of around £2million. Although Barkley could not prevent the Hatters from dropping back into the Championship, he has excelled since joining them on a free from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The former Everton and Chelsea star scored five goals and assisted with four more in 32 appearances for Rob Edwards ' side. Villa need to trade wisely this summer as they struggle to comply with tough Profit and Sustainability Rules. And the addition of Barkley would be one of the shrewdest bargain-priced moves they could pull-off as they look to strengthen the depth of their squad for next season's Champions' League campaign. Emery admitted the club will need to \"be intelligent,\" in their transfer dealings this summer, after they ran up a loss of £119million in their last accounts - a Uefa record for the season. And with further losses forecast for last season the need to balance the books has never been more important. Landing Barkley would be seen as a coup for Emery who was impressed by the midfielder's stunning form last term.",

The Premier League star, 30, played the doting boyfriend - carefully applying sun cream on the stunning blonde’s back as she soaked up the rays in a tiny monochrome bikini. Ross stopped to adjust his blue swim shorts - showing off his rugged physique in the process - as the loved-up couple took a stroll along the golden sands. Accounts executive Katherine, who counts Love Island’s Ellie Brown as one of her best friends, looked smitten during the romantic trip to the Caribbean island. The well-earned break comes as Aston Villa are reportedly in advanced talks to make Ross their first summer signing. Earlier this month, The Sun revealed the club has a ‘strong interest’ in signing the midfielder , who has also interested Manchester United , for a nominal fee of around £2 million Unai Emery has been impressed by the 33-times-capped England international's outstanding form this season on his return to the Premier League. SunSport understands Villa's President of Football Operations Monchi has a 'strong interest,' in signing Barkley, who has also interested Manchester United, for a nominal fee of around £2million. Although Barkley could not prevent the Hatters from dropping back into the Championship, he has excelled since joining them on a free from Ligue 1 side Nice last summer. The former Everton and Chelsea star scored five goals and assisted with four more in 32 appearances for Rob Edwards ' side. Villa need to trade wisely this summer as they struggle to comply with tough Profit and Sustainability Rules. And the addition of Barkley would be one of the shrewdest bargain-priced moves they could pull-off as they look to strengthen the depth of their squad for next season's Champions' League campaign. Emery admitted the club will need to \"be intelligent,\" in their transfer dealings this summer, after they ran up a loss of £119million in their last accounts - a Uefa record for the season. And with further losses forecast for last season the need to balance the books has never been more important. Landing Barkley would be seen as a coup for Emery who was impressed by the midfielder's stunning form last term.",

        "description": "Basketball great Bill Walton, who died Monday at age 71, was a noted Deadhead who attended hundreds of Grateful Dead shows and was friends with members of the band.",
        "content": "Bill Walton was a proud Deadhead. The basketball great, who died Monday at age 71 following a prolonged cancer battle, was famously a huge fan of the Grateful Dead (and a tie-dye aficionado ). A fixture at the band’s shows — he was hard to miss at nearly 7 feet — Walton reportedly had attended more than 850 shows since 1967, including when the Dead played in front of the Great Pyramids in Egypt in 1978. As a broadcaster for ESPN, Walton often inserted references to the band in his color commentary during games. “I became the basketball player that I was because of the Grateful Dead,” said Walton in a 2016 interview with Salon . “I am the human being that I am today because of the Grateful Dead. They’re right there at the top of my teachers. Their inspiration moved me brightly.” More than just a fan, the UCLA basketball legend, who helped lead the team to back-to-back NCAA championships (and undefeated seasons) during coach John Wooden’s tenure in the 1970s, developed a friendship with the Grateful Dead over the years. The band often would stay at Walton’s house when they were in San Diego, and the Hall of Famer attended band member Jerry Garcia’s private funeral. Not only that, his home resembled a Grateful Dead museum, with photos and memorabilia lining the walls. Walton even peppered his 2016 memoir, “Back From the Dead,” with his love of (and lyrics from) the band. Among the anecdotes that Walton shared is how he got his Boston Celtics teammates into a Grateful Dead concert in 1985. (Walton, who was drafted first overall by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1974, had been traded by the Clippers to the Celtics in 1985.) His teammates had never seen the band perform and gathered at Larry Bird’s house before the show. “I had to explain to everybody in the Grateful Dead that ... the Celtics were just icons and they couldn’t really go out in public because they were so popular,” recounts Walton in a video previously shared on X , formerly Twitter. “They said, ‘We’ll take care of this, Bill.’ So they built this special little enclave right on the side of the stage where, unless you were on the stage, you couldn’t look into this little area. It was all curtained off. It was the perfect little place to watch the concert.” Following news of his death, fellow Deadheads posted tributes to Walton on social media , remembering him for his kind spirit and big smile. In a TV interview , Walton discussed how the Grateful Dead helped shape his approach to life. “I don’t look back,” said Walton. “Over the course of my basketball career I’ve had many many setbacks and many pitfalls that I’ve stumbled into. Something that I’ve learned and I’ve received a lot of encouragement and help from my friends, particularly in the Grateful Dead, [is] don’t look back. Just keep going and something good will happen.”",

        "content": "A lighting bolt killed rancher Mike Morgan on Saturday in near Rand, Colorado A Colorado rancher feeding his cattle was struck to death by lightning along with 34 of his cows. Mike Morgan, 51, was giving his animals food from a trailer when the bolt hit him around 2pm on Saturday, said the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. Bystanders and first responders performed life-saving measures on Morgan but he was pronounced dead at the scene. ‘Our deepest condolences go out to family and friends during this difficult time,’ stated the sheriff’s office. More than 100 cattle were struck by the lightning bolt (Picture: Getty Images) The lightning hit an area of open pasture near the town of Rand as well as more than 100 head of cattle that were gathered around the trailer filled with hay, said the county coroner, George Crocket. ‘All but the 34 got up,’ Crocket said of the cattle. Morgan’s wife and father-in-law were close by at the time the bolt struck and survived, he added. Rand is located about 80 miles northwest of Denver. The death shocked the tight-knit community where neighbors all knew each other, Crockett said. All the cattle got up after the lightning strike except for 34 (Picture: Getty Images) Morgan was killed as powerful storms caused twisters, flooding and heavy winds in states including Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas, over Memorial Day Weekend. The storms have killed at least 21 people. The system moved from the central US to the East Coast on Monday and grounded flights at John F Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York. Read More Stories Colorado has one of the highest rates among US states of lightning fatalities and injuries recently, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). No deaths have been recorded in Jackson County from 1980 to 2021, which is the time frame that the National Weather Service (NWS) has tracked lightning deaths and injuries. Within Colorado, El Paso and Larimer counties had the most such deaths within those four decades. The CDC advises that residents avoid being near windows, porches, concrete, electrical equipment and water during thunderstorms. Meanwhile, the NWS advises staying inside, though people have also been struck while under shelter. Morgan’s died nearly a year after a public works worker hit by lightning on a soccer field in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, was saved by a cop who performed CPR on him.

        "description": "A Massachusetts man who was mauled by a mother grizzly bear in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park provided details about the attack in an Instagram post with graphic photos.",
        "content": "A South Hadley man who was mauled by a mother grizzly bear while hiking off-trail in Wyoming’s Grand Teton National Park a week ago described the attack as “the most violent thing I have ever experienced,” in an Instagram post accompanied by gory photos of his injuries. Shayne Patrick Burke, 35, said he is a disabled veteran in the US Army Reserve, who has “experienced being shot at, mortared, and IED explosions,” but the ordeal on May 19 was his closest brush yet with mortality. “I accepted on that small hill top that I very well could die,” Burke wrote in the Thursday post. “I recorded a short video telling my people that I loved them.” Advertisement A National Park Service official confirmed Sunday that Burke is the man who survived a bear attack near Signal Mountain last weekend. Burke could not be reached for an interview Sunday. In his first public account of his near-death experience , Burke wrote, “I’ve thought long and hard about how I would share my story about my encounter with a female grizzly and her cub.” A post shared by Shayne Patrick (@n0beefstew4u) Burke said he loves and respects wildlife and pleaded with park rangers not to kill the bear. “She was defending her cub,” Burke wrote. “What happened up on Signal Mountain was a case of wrong place, wrong time.” Park officials have said the bear will not be killed or captured. Burke said he had set off that Sunday morning in search of great grey owls to photograph and was hiking through “a thick wooded area in a valley” in the backcountry when he spotted a small brown cub running up a hill about 50 to 70 yards away. He instantly removed his canister of bear spray from its holster, but the mother bear appeared and charged before he could deploy it. Advertisement “I stood my ground, shouted, and attempted to deploy the bear spray but as I did she already closed the gap,” Burke wrote. “When she pounced, I opted to turn and give her my back and I laid down in the prone position on my belly and braced for the ride, interlocking my hands behind my neck to protect my vitals.” The first bite and slash landed on his back and right shoulder, Burke said. He screamed. The bear stepped on his back, bit one of his legs, and then picked him up and slammed him on the ground multiple times, Burke said. The bear bit each leg about three times from his buttocks to his inner knees. Burke’s next scream, he said, drew the bear’s attention to his head. “I believe she went in for a kill bite on my neck,” Burke said. “I still had my hands interlocked and my arms protecting my carotid arteries. I never let go of the bear spray can.” When the bear bit Burke’s hands on the back of his neck, “she simultaneously bit the bear spray can and it exploded in her mouth,” Burke wrote. “This is what saved my life from the initial attack.” The bear ran away and Burke ran in the opposite direction, he said. Burke tried to call his wife, who was waiting for him in a parking lot. The calls wouldn’t go through, so he texted her: “Attacked.” Advertisement Burke’s wife called back as he applied improvised tourniquets to his legs using straps from his backpack, camera, and fanny pack, to slow the bleeding. She talked him through the process. “I laid alone in the woods, gripping my knife with my back to a tree, just hoping the bear wasn’t to return,” Burke said. “At this point, my legs were not really working.” While waiting for rescuers to fly to the scene, Burke recorded messages for his loved ones. A rescue team provided emergency medical care and took Burke by helicopter to an ambulance. He underwent surgery at St. John’s Medical Center in Jackson, Wyo., where they cleaned and stapled his wounds. “The number one thing that kept me alive during the attack was reading and understanding what to do in the event of a bear attack and being prepared with the bear spray,” Burke wrote. “Though I am not sure if I got to spray any at the bear,” Burke continued, “having it on me and keeping it in my hands while protecting my vitals, 100 percent is the only reason I am telling my story now.” Park authorities closed the 7,700-foot mountain to all hiking because of the attack. This is routine in the event of a bear attack. Rangers track and study the approximately 1,000 grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area, which includes Grand Teton National Park.

        "content": "NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim in Punjab on Saturday that “one of the Punj Pyaras Guru Gobind Singh was like my uncle” has evoked mixed reaction across the country, particularly in Punjab where the polling for 13 Lok Sabha seats is going to be held in the seventh phase on June 1. Modi, who in the past has cited his “long and strong relations” with Muslims and Christians, invoked the “Panj Pyaras” of Guru Gobind Singh on Saturday at an election rally in Patiala. “Aap ye pradhan mantri ki baat chhod dijiye. Mera toh aapse khoon ka rishta hai. Guru Gobindji ke paanch pyaaro mein se ek mere itwari kaka the (Forget the matter of being PM, I have a blood relation with you. One of the Panj Pyaras of Gobind Singh was like my uncle),” he said, adding that he belonged to Dwarka. Modi was referring to Mohkam Chand, who was born to Tirath Chand and Devi Bai in Dwarka, and named Bhai Mohkam Singh by Guru Gobind Singh. “Vote ke liye Modi kuch bhi karega”, said Dr Brij Mohan Kaushik pointing out that the Prime Minister is possibly stretching too far trying to establish a link with Dwarka from where one of the Punj Pyaras hailed. According to historians and eminent experts of Punjab history, many belonging to lower castes who were oppressed at the hands of the upper caste across the country were attracted towards Sikhism and they came to join the religion at that point in time. Mohkam Singh, who belonged to a lower caste, came to Punjab attracted by Guru Gobind Singh’s teachings. “His arrival in Punjab coincided with lower castes not being happy with the caste system, and his move was part of his protest against it,” experts said. Guru Gobind Singh was fighting against Mughul emperor Aurangzeb and had established Khalsa Panth for creating a dedicated army to fight enemies. He joined Guru Gobind Singh in Anandpur Sahib as the former was fighting the Mughals there. Bhai Mohkam Singh arrived in Anandpur Sahib in 1685. He soon trained in martial arts, becoming an expert and, in turn, training Guru Gobind Singh’s army. In 1699, 10th Sikh Guru Guru Gobind Singh, at a historic congregation in Anandpur Sahib, asked for the heads of five persons, who wanted to respect the five ‘Kakars’ (or items – kesh, kangha, kara, kachera, and kirpan) which the Guru had commanded Khalsa Sikhs to wear at all times. As most upper castes, who believed in mundan (shaving heads of male children), refused to keep long hair (one of the five requirements), five men offered their heads to the Guru” to set an example. Guru Gobind Singh then took the first man inside a tent, where he had kept a goat. He then came out with a sword smeared with its blood. “Despite this, the other four men offered their heads. Later, they were baptised and Guru Gobind Singh named them the Panj Pyaras,” he said. Bhai Mohkam Singh was the fourth to offer his head. The Panj Pyaras were considered Guru Gobind Singh’s loved ones. Apart from Mohkam Singh, the others included Bhai Daya Singh from Lahore, Bhai Dharam Singh from Hastinapur, Bhai Himmat Singh from Jagannath Puri and Bhai Sahib Singh from Bidar. The Panj Pyaras are deeply revered by Sikhs, who see them as symbols of steadfastness and devotion. Bhai Mohkam Singh was martyred in the battle of Chamkaur in 1705. “The Prime Minister has never been bothered about correctness or facts in history as he prefers to twist the truth according to his political convenience”, a veteran journalist Yogesh Dikshit said. —–",

The Toitū Te Tiriti National Day of Action protesters will be participating in ‘carkois’ which entails driving slowly across roadways to disrupt traffic flow at peak times. In Auckland, protesters will meet at locations near motorway on-ramps, north, south and west of the city at 6.30am. Te Pāti Māori shared on social media that this is a “rangatira revolution”. “We are being attacked for being Māori,” Te Pāti Māori wrote. We are being attacked for being Māori. This is what the rangatira revolution is about. #ToitūTeTiriti #MokopunaDecisions...

Police say an estimated 300 cars joined the Auckland protest, which was “peaceful and the vast majority of groups dispersed relatively quickly”. In Wellington, 1000 protesters gathered on Parliament grounds, where Te Pāti Māori co-leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer addressed the crowd. The convoys gathered about 7am in several cities and at traffic pressure points including near Auckland’s Northern Motorway at the Palmers Albany Garden Centre, near the Upper Harbour Motorway on Brigham Creek and Hobsonville Rds, and near the Southern Motorway at BP Bombay. Further south, the Waikato Expressway suffered a 3km backlog after being blocked by about 50 cars. This had a “significant impact on traffic”, police said. Hamilton, Whakatāne, Rotorua, Tokoroa, Taupō and Palmerston North also held gatherings of about 100 people each, with minimal disruption. - More to come Share this article",

I've saved money in a high-yield savings account for more than a decade, opening my Capital One 360 account back when it was ING. I originally opened a savings account because of the higher-than-average APY at the time to set money aside as I was starting my financial journey. High-yield savings accounts typically pay at least 20 times the interest of a traditional savings account, and the best rates now are even higher. Over the years, I've refined my savings strategy. Here's how I maximize the value of my high-yield savings accounts. When I first started saving in my early 20s, I had one savings account. I wanted to have money set aside for emergencies or anything else I might need. I had a pot of cash in savings — let's say several thousand dollars — and yet, each month, it seemed like there was a reason to dip into my savings. Having one lump sum of cash didn't give me any clarity or goals for how I should use the money. So I constantly found reasons, some legitimate and some not, why I needed to tap my savings. I finally realized how ineffective this strategy was and branched out to targeted savings accounts. I realized that my bank allowed me to open up to 25 different savings accounts — and nickname them. I decided to get more specific regarding what my savings were actually for. So, I opened one account and named it \" Emergency Fund .\" I opened another account and named it \"Travel.\" A few years ago, I created a \"Moving\" savings account when I moved back to Los Angeles from Portland, Oregon. Being self-employed, I also have a \"Biz Taxes\" savings account, \"Vacation,\" and \"Sick as a Dog\" funds. I have to pay my own taxes, so I set aside more than 30% of each check toward business taxes . After my first year of self-employment, I realized how scary it was to get sick. I realized I felt worried on vacation. Why? Because being self-employed, I don't have any benefits. If I don't work, I don't get paid. When you're sick or on vacation, stressing about money is the last thing you should do. So, I decided to take action and fund my own benefits. Having a buffer of cash in case anything happens has given me peace of mind. I know that if I have to say no to certain assignments or take on less work because I'm not well or on vacation, I can do so and still pay my rent. Being hyper-specific about what each savings account was for gave me clarity and focus. No longer could I dip into these accounts and find a reason to use the funds. The goal was clearly stated, and I knew what it was for. Having separate accounts and naming them made saving much easier for me. Not only that, but it inspired me because I knew what I was saving for instead of just saving in general. Next Steps: Earn up to 5.26% on savings and up to 5.31% on CDs with Raisin. Earn up to 5.26% APY on savings and up to 5.31% APY on CDs with 25+ federally insured banks & credit unions. One account to maximize your savings. no monthly service fee up to 5.26% on savings and up to 5.31% on CDs $1 The first thing I did with each of my savings accounts was to figure out how much I wanted in each account. For example, I knew I wanted at least $10,000 in my emergency fund. For travel, I calculated prospective costs and the time I had to save. Once I had an idea of what I wanted to save, I managed those goals with Capital One 360, which used to allow you to set a goal for each account and see a progress bar. On top of that, I automated my savings every month so I had no excuses. Every month, I have a set amount that gets transferred from my checking account to my emergency and travel funds. Depending on my income that month, I'll manually transfer money to my Biz Taxes, Vacation, and Sick accounts at the end of the month. Automating some of my savings and setting up a money date at the end of the money to manually transfer more money keep me accountable to my savings goals. Being clear and specific with my savings goals has transformed my financial life for the better. I am more clear, focused, confident, and know exactly how each dollar is used. Not only that, but it has given me peace of mind to know that I have money in the bank and that I'm prepared for a variety of situations. I'm not just saving for emergencies, either — but the fun stuff, too. Having multiple savings accounts has helped me be financially well-rounded and save for what I need ... but also what I want.

        "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's son Archie Harrison was born in May 2019, but fans are still waiting for the little one to step out into the public eye.",
        "content": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's son, Archie, has largely remained out of the public eye since his birth in 2019. Despite his parents' frequent appearances in the media, both Archie and his sister Lilibet have been kept away from the limelight. Upon Archie's birth, Royal enthusiasts were quick to examine his publicly available birth certificate, where they noticed an unusual detail. The official document lists Harry as 'His Royal Highness Henry Charles Albert David Duke of Sussex', a title that notably omits 'Prince'. This omission puzzled many, especially considering that both William and Charles were referred to as 'Prince' on their children's birth certificates. On the birth certificates of Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, William is identified as 'His Royal Highness Prince William Arthur Philip Louis Duke of Cambridge'. Similarly, Charles was styled as 'His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George Prince of Wales' on the birth certificates of William and Harry. Archie's birth certificate also disclosed previously unknown information about his birth. It confirmed that Meghan delivered at London's private Portland Hospital, contradicting reports that she had chosen a home birth, reports the Express . On the document, Meghan is named as 'Rachel Meghan Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex,' and her occupation is listed as 'Princess of the United Kingdom'. The Royal twosome welcomed their firstborn, a boy, at 5.26am on Monday, May 6. Buckingham Palace said that Prince Harry was with his wife during the birth and further stated: \"The Duchess' mother, Doria Ragland, who is overjoyed by the arrival of her first grandchild, is with Their Royal Highnesses at Frogmore Cottage.\" Celebrations were in full swing on June 4, 2021, as Harry and Meghan greeted the arrival of their second offspring, a girl they christened as Lilibet Diana, in Santa Barbara. Fascinatingly, Harry opted to use his HRH title on the birth certificate, with 'HRH' displayed as his surname and his given name as 'The Duke of Sussex'. Meghan's official name is listed as her birth name, 'Rachel Markle', with Meghan designated as a middle name. This created a ripple of intrigue because earlier in 2020, the pair were notified that they were not permitted to apply their HRH titles following their decision to step away from Royal duties. During a fresh trip to Nigeria, Meghan disclosed some facts about her two little ones. On day one, the pair stopped by a school that had profited from kind donations from the Archewell Foundation, known as the Lightway Academy located in Abuja. The couple mingled with a group of kindergartners, who put on song and dance performances for them. Harry interacted with the pupils, asking: \"Is singing and dancing your favourite class? \" To this, Meghan added: \"That's Lili's favourite class, maybe it's all the jumping around.\" The Royal couple then proceeded to a STEM class where eager children took pride in showing off the robot cars they had assembled. During a school visit, Prince Harry engaged with students about their fascination with electronics, while Meghan Markle revealed that their son Archie shares a similar interest in construction. The Royal pair also broached the subject of mental health during their visit. This prompted Meghan to share a touching story about their daughter, Lilibet. Addressing the class, she said: \"We all have our story. And there's no shame in any single one of your stories. Even on the hardest days or darkest days, everything is a pillar of your strength by each of you being there. Your teachers see that in you. And we see that in you.\" She went on to say: \"And interestingly, so our daughter, Lili, she's much, much tinier than you guys. She's about to turn three. And a few weeks ago she looked at me and she would just see the reflection in my eyes.\"",

        "description": "The 2024 NHL Draft is just about one month away, and shortly after that, NHL free agency will open on July 1. For the rebuilding Philadelphia Flyers, this is undoubtedly the most important time of year.",
        "content": "The 2024 NHL Draft is just about one month away, and shortly after that, NHL free agency will open on July 1. For the rebuilding Philadelphia Flyers , this is undoubtedly the most important time of year. As is tradition, there has been no shortage of Flyers trade rumors, and NHL rumors in general, with most teams planning their offseasons during the Stanley Cup playoffs. And there are quite a few offseason rumors that make perfect sense for the Flyers. Martin Necas Chief among them is the dubious status of Carolina Hurricanes forward Martin Necas , a pending RFA who is only 25 years old and one season removed from establishing a career-high 71 points. The word around town seems to be that the Hurricanes aren’t willing to meet Necas’ contractual demands, and with former general manager Don Waddell out of the picture, things just got even more complicated. Would Carolina allow their new GM, Eric Tulsky, to entertain calls on Necas from teams like the Flyers? With the 2024 draft coming up so soon, they might not have a choice. Tulsky is going to have to get his hands dirty in his first bit of NHL business fairly quickly, and he’s either going to sink or swim. Necas, drafted as a center, has mostly played as a winger during his time in Carolina; that should have no impact on the Flyers’ view of him. At 6-foot-1, Necas brings adequate size to the table in addition to his roadrunner speed and mercenary-like offensive talents. Combine that with his age, and Necas would be a perfect fit for the Flyers. However, it’s also been speculated that the Vancouver Canucks, among other teams, are sniffing around, even with Necas’s sizable rumored ask of a $7.5 million salary. Tanner Jeannot The ink hasn’t dried on this one yet, but Tampa Bay Lightning forward Tanner Jeannot could be on his way out of Florida after only a year and a half. NHL insider Elliotte Friedman shared on Monday’s episode of “ 32 Thoughts “, “I got a couple of calls from people saying that’s going to be one to watch. Because, his salary, which is about $2.6 (million), Tampa can use the space. It really hasn’t worked out as well as everyone has hoped there, between him and the Lightning. “But, there are a lot of teams out there that see something. And they think he’s more the player in Nashville than he was the player in Tampa Bay.” Before being traded to Tampa Bay towards the end of last season, Jeannot had a breakout campaign in 2021-22 when he scored 24 goals, 17 assists, and 41 points in 81 games for the Nashville Predators. As a 6-foot-2, 220-pound power forward, Jeannot also racked up 130 penalty minutes, 318 hits, and 64 blocked shots. The former undrafted free agent will turn 27 years old on Wednesday, so he still fits with the Flyers, albeit on the back end of their Stanley Cup contention timeline. It’s important to note that Jeannot was an effective penalty killer during his breakout season in Nashville but was not used in that role in Tampa Bay. Another thing to consider is that Garnet Hathaway , who turns 33 in November, is a penalty kill staple on the last year of his contract. Nicolas Deslauriers will turn 34 in February and has already been reduced down to being a rotational role player. The Flyers do not have a player in the mold of Jeannot who is close to his age with a similar offensive pedigree. My understanding is that Flyers GM Danny Briere has a good relationship with Lightning GM Julien Brisebois, so it would not come as a surprise to see the Flyers poking around Jeannot as the two leaders seek to rework their hockey teams. Ondrej Kase Ondrej Kase would be a curious addition for the Flyers, but the team has shown a willingness to buy low on players with value to see what they can get. Look no further than Ryan Poehling. Kase, 28, was an NHL regular at one point and burst onto the scene in 2017-18 with a 20-goal season for the Anaheim Ducks whilst playing on the third line. A series of neurological issues decimated Kase’s NHL career after that, and the Czech forward was out of the NHL entirely for the last two seasons. Kase played one game for the Hurricanes last year before suffering another setback and getting shut down, but he did manage to score 54 points in 48 games for HC Litvinov in Czechia this season. Kase’s brother, David, who also plays for Litvinov, was drafted by and played seven NHL games for the Flyers. His rights were traded to Carolina in the Massimo Rizzo trade. Ondrej, apparently, is willing to tend to his unfinished business in North America. He has played for the Ducks, the Hurricanes, the Boston Bruins, and the Toronto Maple Leafs in his NHL career, and save for the one-game cameo in Raleigh, fans of those teams really appreciated Kase’s production and style of play. That is something that would assuredly resonate with Flyers fans on Broad Street, too. Kase is a right-shot winger, though, so the Flyers would have to accommodate to make room for him.

        "description": "Two women are suing Brandon McManus and the Jacksonville Jaguars, alleging that the kicker sexually assaulted them while on the team's charter flight overseas to London last year",
        "content": "Brandon McManus is being sued by two women who allege the kicker them while on the Jacksonville Jaguars’ charter flight to London last year. The two women, who went by Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II in a lawsuit filed Friday night in Duval County Circuit Civil Court, claim they worked as flight attendants on the Jaguars’ Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings charter flight on Sept. 28, 2023. The pair allege the scene inside the cabin “quickly turned into a party,” with multiple players disregarding their personal space, air travel safety and federal law. Per the court documents obtained by , Doe I claims McManus attempted to kiss her as she was sitting down while the plane was being hit by turbulence. While this was happening, she allegedly locked eyes with another Jaguars player, who she claims donned a conscience-stricken facial expression and appeared to not approve of his teammate’s behavior. Doe 1 additionally accuses McManus of grinding up against her on two separate occasions while she was handing out the flight’s two meal services. Doe II spoke of a similar incident, alleging the kicker grinded up against her as well while she was serving the flight’s second meal service. Upon confronting McManus, he allegedly “smirked and walked away,” according to the complaint. The lawsuit also claims that McManus handed out $100 bills to three other flight attendants on board, encouraging them to drink and dance inappropriately for him. Per ESPN, the two women claim that they have suffered from “severe mental anguish, anxiety, psychological and emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation,” following the Jaguars charter flight, which was the first team flight either flight attendant had worked on. The Jaguars are additionally being sued by the two women, who allege that the team “committed gross negligence by failing to properly hire McManus, train him about inappropriate and sexual contact with flight staff, supervise him on the flight, adopt policies and procedures to protect flight staff from sexual misconduct by its employees, and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy regarding inappropriate behavior,” according to ESPN. The flight attendants are seeking over $1 million in damages. McManus signed a one-year, $2 million contract with the Jaguars in May 2023, going on to convert on 81% of his field goal attempts (30 of 37) and all 35 of his extra-point attempts last season. On March 14, the 32-year-old inked a one-year deal worth $3.6 million with the . In a statement relayed to , a Commanders spokesperson said: \"Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus. We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon’s representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.\" The Mirror U.S. has reached out to McManus and the Jaguars. A team representative from the Jaguars declined to comment.",

        "content": "An updated report from the National Weather Service was issued on Monday at 5:42 p.m. for strong thunderstorms until 6:15 p.m. for Snyder County. Residents should prepare for wind gusts of up to 55 mph. \"At 5:41 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm capable of producing a landspout near Selinsgrove, moving east at 20 mph,\" according to the weather service. \"Minor damage to outdoor objects is possible. Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects.\" Locations impacted by the alert include Selinsgrove, Winfield, Shamokin Dam, Hummels Wharf, Middleburg, Kreamer, Penns Creek, Kratzerville, Paxtonville, New Berlin, Freeburg and Selinsgrove Airport. The weather service states, \"If outdoors, consider seeking shelter inside a building. A Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains in effect until 9 p.m. for central Pennsylvania.\" Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration: 1. Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it's crucial to have a lightning safety plan in place. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. 2. Indoors safety measures: Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. 3. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In wooded areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. When heavy rain strikes, safety is paramount. Equip yourself with these guidelines from the weather service to navigate wet roads and avoid hazards: Beware of swollen waterways: During heavy rain, avoid parking or walking near culverts or drainage ditches, where swift-moving water can pose a serious risk. Maintain safe driving distances: Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness. Slow down and stay cautious: On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stick to the middle lanes on multi-lane roads to minimize the risk of hydroplaning, as water tends to accumulate in outer lanes. Prioritize visibility Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them. Watch out for slippery roads: The first half-hour of rain is when roads are slickest due to a mix of rain, grime, and oil. Exercise heightened caution during this period. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots. If the roadside is your only option, pull off as far as possible, preferably past the end of a guard rail, and wait until the storm passes. Keep your headlights on and turn on emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

        "description": "The groups say money, political power, and even health could be at stake.",
        "content": "The federal government recently reclassified race and ethnicity groups in an effort to better capture the diversity of the United States, but some groups feel the changes miss the mark. Hmong, Armenian, Black Arab, and Brazilian communities say they are not represented accurately in the official numbers. While the revisions were widely applauded, these communities say the changes have created a tension between how the federal government classifies them versus how they identify themselves. The groups say money, political power, and even health could be at stake. Being lumped into the wrong column can mean a gain or loss of government funds that are distributed based on data. For some, it’s about their identity and feeling seen by their own country. Advertisement The Office of Management and Budget said the working group that oversaw the revisions held 94 “listening sessions” with many advocacy groups, academics, and the general public, and it will continue to reach out to communities. During the Vietnam War and unbeknownst to the American public, the CIA recruited Lao and Hmong people to fight the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia. Tens of thousands of Hmong soldiers died while others fled to the United States as a result of what became known as the “secret war.” By the 1970s, many Hmong had resettled in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and central California. Today, Hmong in the United States number more than 300,000. Some states recognize Hmong and Lao veterans with annual ceremonies, and in April, the Wisconsin governor signed a law mandating that Hmong American history be taught in schools. Given their history fighting in that region for the United States, many Hmong feel strongly that they should be classified as Southeast Asian. But because China is considered the Hmong ancestral homeland, the US Census Bureau categorized them as East Asian after the 2020 census. Advertisement “That has been very hurtful to our elders and to our veterans who sacrificed so much to get us here to this country after everything they did to help the US during the Vietnam War,” said May yer Thao, president and chief executive of the St. Paul-based Hmong American Partnership. The East Asian label also pains them because the Hmong were oppressed in China as an ethnic minority and sought refuge in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, according to Quyên Dinh, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Southeast Asia Resource Action Center. Those who object to the classification also have a practical concern: The East Asian grouping could hide socioeconomic disparities between Hmong and other Asian households that need to be addressed. The per capita income of Hmong was almost $26,000, while it was more than $53,000 for Asians overall, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. “We are still one of the most impoverished communities in this nation,” Thao said. The Census Bureau says it’s working with the Hmong community to improve their classification. When the government revised its race and ethnicity standards in March — it’s first major alteration since 1997 — its seven categories included a new one, Middle Eastern or North African, or MENA. The revisions also encouraged detailed data collection about respondents’ backgrounds, such as African American, Jamaican, and Haitian under the Black category. Missing from the list of backgrounds under the new MENA category: Black Arabs from such countries as Somalia and Sudan, and Armenians. The groups were left out after a 2015 field test by the Census Bureau found that most Armenians still identified as white and most Somali and Sudanese respondents identified as Black even when MENA was an option. Advertisement Some advocates said the decision to omit Black Arabs from being included in the MENA category was based on outdated research. For many Armenian Americans, not having their own category amounts to an existential threat as a large part of their diaspora's culture is now concentrated in the United States. Ethnic Armenians also have communities around Europe and the Middle East, in particular Lebanon. Many are descendants of those who fled the 1915 campaign by Ottoman Turks in which some 1.5 million Armenians died in massacres, deportations, and forced marches. The atrocities, which emptied many ethnic areas in eastern Turkey, are widely viewed by historians as genocide . Turkey rejects the description of genocide, saying the toll has been inflated and that those killed were victims of civil war and unrest during World War I. Without Armenian inclusion in the MENA subcategories, many are likely to categorize themselves as being from a different country. That could diminish their official numbers and reduce their power when it comes to redrawing political districts in places with large Armenian communities, said Sophia Armen, chair of the Census Taskforce of the Armenian National Committee of America-Western Region. “We will now be undercounted by potentially hundreds of thousands of people,” Armen said. “It spells out a very real destruction of Armenian identity in the next two generations.” Advertisement During the last redistricting round following the 2020 census, Armenians in greater Los Angeles — which has the largest concentration of Armenians outside Armenia — were almost split up into different city districts, but the redistricting plan was modified after they sounded the alarm. There are an estimated 460,000 Armenian Americans in the United States , with half living in California, according to the 2022 American Community Survey. Being identified in the data correctly also is important to local health departments. It can influence anything from vaccination outreach in the proper language to tailoring health campaigns for specific communities. Armenian Americans, for instance, are more likely to suffer from hypertension than the general population, but there’s not a lot of data. A coding error last year in an annual Census Bureau survey offered unprecedented insight into how large numbers of Brazilians in the United States identify as Hispanic or Latino. An analysis by Pew Research Center showed that the coding mistake revealed at least 416,000 Brazilians, or more than two-thirds of Brazilians in the United States, also identified as Hispanic in the 2020 American Community Survey. Usually, if someone marks Hispanic and Brazilian on the survey, they are recorded as “not Hispanic” when the numbers are crunched. Not including Brazilians, or Haitians for that matter, in the definition of Hispanic or Latino, means that large numbers of Afro-Latinos aren’t counted, Michelle Bueno Vásquez, a PhD. candidate in political science at Northwestern University, wrote the Office of Management and Budget. Advertisement “The OMB as it stands fails Latinos, especially Afro-Latinos who continually suffer double discrimination and marginalization, on top of statistical invisibility, in the United States,” she said. Researching the impacts of categorizing Brazilians as Hispanic was among the recommendations a Census Bureau advisory committee made last month. “Policy is driven by data, first and foremost,” Armen said of people who feel missed in the classifications. “It just seems like we are purposely being ignored.”",

        "content": "Lydia Jobst, who is 91 years young, must have been beaming after carding a hole-in-one at Shaganappi Point. The smooth-swinging senior drilled a driver on No. 12 and her aim was outstanding from 88 yards away. Ian Macdonald has made a habit of this. Macdonald notched his fourth career ace during a round at D’Arcy Ranch, draining a 140-yard dandy — a nifty nine-iron from 140 yards — on the signature third assignment. Scot Knutson was the toast of the clubhouse at Carnmoney after making a splash of another sort on the island green at the sixth. Knutson knocked a nine-iron and was right on the money from 146 yards out. Glen Barreth buried a beauty on the eighth hole at Douglasdale. Nine-iron was the right call for a 125-yard challenge. Haesookoh Oh was one-and-done on No. 3 at Shaganappi Point, finding the flag-stick with a superb seven-iron that travelled 126 yards. Troy Maryniak will be saying only good things about his nine-iron, his weapon of choice for a 140-yard memory-maker on No. 6 at Lakeside. Scott Arnold skipped the putting portion on the seventh at Earl Grey, instead finishing his business with one strike of a seven-iron from a distance of 149 yards. Also at Earl Grey, Stephen Park smoked a four-wood on No. 15 and then made the 190-yard commute to retrieve his ball from the bottom of the cup. Mike Ochs and Adam Reid can swap stories after both aced the sixth hole at D’Arcy Ranch. Ochs was accurate with an eight-iron from 190 yards away, while Reid selected that same stick from 182. Mike Ballem mastered the eighth hole at Maple Ridge thanks to a wicked wedge from the 125-yard blocks. Report the details of your ace to wgilbertson@postmedia.com",

        "content": "THREE drivers woke to find their cars missing, and assumed they were stolen - a simple error caused a flurry of drama. One disgruntled driver threatened a lawsuit if they weren't paid thousands. Two years ago, three Phoenix, Arizona homeowners found their cars missing from their usual places in front of their homes, prompting them to call the police to report a theft. Instead, they were shocked by the news that their cars were towed away after reportedly parking illegally. Michael Roberson, one of the three drivers, said he was \"befuddled\" as he'd been parking his BMW in the same spot for several years without issue. \"They told me that my car was illegally parked on the road after 10 p.m. - that it had been towed,\" he told ABC affiliate KNXV-TV . The company who towed the vehicles, Metro Towing and Impounds, initially tried to uphold the charges to the drivers before realizing what went wrong. \"First of all, [Metro] wanted to charge us the towing fee to get the car back,\" said Roberson. \"Then they said, 'Okay, maybe it was our mistake.'\" The company's owner, Dominick Bova, realized his driver had input the wrong address into her GPS, resulting in the wrongful towing. \"When she put it in her GPS, it took her to 38th Street, but the property we picked up was on 38th Avenue,\" he told the outlet. The driver, he told The U.S. Sun in an exclusive follow-up interview was one of the best he ever had, and was fired to ensure that caliber of mistake never happens again. \"It made me sad because she was one of my better drivers,\" he said. \"But she was driving tired and I would rather someone tell me they weren't able to do a job and needed a break than drive sleepy because that's how mistakes like that are made. So, I let her go.\" He told another driver to use the \"yard truck,\" a truck equipped to tow vehicles that weren't registered with the Department of Public Safety (DPS) to quickly return the vehicles to their owners. He didn't charge them for the towing or storage fees to reconcile. \"I just wanted to get them their cars back as soon as possible,\" he said. \"I didn't want them to wait for another two or three hours for another truck to come by, so I just used the yard truck.\" It seems like a fairly simple and honest way to remedy the mistake. We're just a towing and impound company that abides by all state and city regulations. However, one of the three drivers wasn't satisfied with Bova's fix. Instead, he said they reported his yard truck to the DPS for not being registered with the agency, something that would call his business's legitimacy into question. It was also reported for not donning the proper badges and ID numbers that would tell drivers it was properly registered with the state of Arizona. To add insult to injury, the same driver made serious financial demands for being wrongfully towed. \"[They] demanded $3,000 because I accidentally towed their car,\" he recounted. \"I told them I wasn't going to do that like I didn't charge them to bring their cars back and I thought that was enough, but [they] weren't happy, so they demanded a $500 gift card.\" Wrongfully or not, retrieving a towed vehicle can be a hassle. If your vehicle is towed after parking in a \"No Parking\" zone or other legitimate reason, there are a few steps to take to get it back. Steps to take when your car is towed: If you feel your vehicle was wrongfully towed, contesting the action can be done with the following steps: Source: Oregon Department of Justice , National General , Rak Law Firm Bova said it didn't end there - she made additional demands before Bova's attorneys responded formally after he refused to pay. \"We have lawyers who represent us, and they sent the driver a cease and desist letter, and that's how this story came about,\" he said. \"You can't make everyone happy, I guess.\" Bova was contacted shortly after the story was published regarding the unregistered truck. \"[DPS] called me and told me I had two weeks to register the truck, so I went and registered the truck,\" he said. \"It wasn't that big of a deal.\" Since then, Bova's company has been operating without issue. \"We're just a towing and impound company that abides by all state and city regulations,\" he said.",

The Argentine pontiff's first language is Spanish. The Vatican did not respond to requests for comment.

        "content": "Georgia has been repeatedly pushed into a conflict with Russia, with “certain friends and foes” urging Tbilisi to impose sanctions on the country and even to deploy troops to Ukraine, the President of the Georgian Parliament, Shalva Papuashvili, has said. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the house speaker said the country has been repeatedly bombarded with such demands, both in public and in private. “Certain friends and foes have been pushing us into this, so that we would send fighters to Ukraine, which would have directly meant war with Russia,” he explained. Top Ukrainian officials, including the former head of the National Security Council Alexey Danilov, have repeatedly urged Georgia to open a “second front” against Russia, with the calls consistently shot down by Tbilisi. While Papuashvili did not mention any actors in particular, he implied that members of the US-led NATO bloc were among them. With “such actions” demanded for some unknown reason from Georgia, NATO states themselves were abstaining from sending in their own militaries, he said. Apart from demands to enter the conflict directly, Georgia has for long been facing pressure to join Western sanctions against Moscow, he also noted. Non-state actors have been pushing Georgia into war with Russia as well, Papuashvili claimed, stating that “non-governmental organizations that held rallies in Tbilisi with similar calls have also demanded our troops be sent to Ukraine.” The speaker’s jab at the NGOs comes as the country continues to experience domestic unrest and foreign pressure over its draft “foreign agents” legislation, requiring those organizations and individuals receiving over 20% of their funding from abroad to register and disclose their sources of income. The controversial bill ended up being shelved amid mass protests and foreign pressure last year, with the new attempt to pass its slightly modified version running into the same troubles. However, the Georgian government has stood its ground and vowed to adopt the bill no matter what. While Tbilisi has maintained an explicitly neutral stance on the Ukrainian conflict, a sizeable number of mercenaries originating from the country have been fighting on Kiev’s behalf. According to the Russian military’s estimates, the country has provided some 1,042 mercenaries, with the figure beaten only by Kiev’s top backers, namely the US and Poland, with at least 1,113 and 2,960 fighters coming from those two countries, respectively. At least 561 Georgian nationals in the Ukrainian military’s ranks ended up killed during the hostilities, according to Moscow’s estimates.",

        "content": "Financial advisor tells graduating class how they can become self-made millionaires Author and money expert Ramit Sethi revealed the 'simple' trick READ MORE: Expert reveals changes that will help anyone amass $1 million By Emma Saletta For Dailymail.Com Published: 22:16, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 22:38, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Thousands of college graduates are entering adulthood and may need to start thinking more about money management. Author, self-made millionaire, and host of the I Will Teach You to be Rich podcast Ramit Sethi revealed the 'simple' step for college graduates to be financially successful in the future. According to NBC 10 Philadelphia , Sethi's advice for college graduates to achieve financial success is 'invest 10 percent' of their salaries every year. 'At the end of the year, increase that by one percent. Do this for as long as you can and you will be a multimillionaire,' he told CNBC Make It earlier this month. Sethi, who also starred in the 2023 Netflix docuseries How to Get Rich, has years of professional experience and is the founder of IWT. Author and self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi suggests that college students look into investing 10 percent of their salaries every year to be financially successful in the future Sethi, who starred in the 2023 Netflix docuseries How to Get Rich, is the founder and CEO of IWT - a website that hosts over one million readers a month Read More Wife of Big Bang Theory creator flaunts limited edition Hermes bag during discussion on 'guilt-free spending' with Netflix's How To Get Rich star Ramit Sethi According to Sethi's LinkedIn, his parents immigrated to the US in the 1970s from India. 'With four kids and one income, they couldn't afford to send me to college so I built a system to apply 60+ scholarships,' he wrote in his profile description. He went on to receive a full scholarship to Stanford University, where he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in 2004 and 2005. However, after graduation, he admitted that he took his first scholarship check, invested it in the stock market, and lost around half of it almost immediately. This incident inspired him to learn about money and that what he learned during his schooling was 'irrelevant.' Today, he runs IWT - a website that hosts over one million readers a month that are interested in learning more about business, careers, negotiation, psychology, and money. His 2009 New York Times Best Seller I Will Teach You To Be Rich is a six-week finance program for individuals between the ages of 20 to 35. However, the steps he discussed with NBC 10 Philadelphia on how college graduates will be successful may be simpler for former students to understand. Sethi's 2009 New York Times Best Seller I Will Teach You To Be Rich is a six-week finance program for individuals between the ages of 20 to 35 The first thing a college graduate must do to get started is open their own brokerage account, traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or any other kind of investment account. In order to do so, the college graduate must provide information such as a driver's license and a social security number. Once the account is open, the owner of it can begin depositing money and select what kinds of funds they would like to invest in. NBC 10 Philadelphia also suggests that the account holder look into setting it up so that their investment account will receive automatic deposits. The investment will continue to grow and work well for the college graduate that is looking to be financially successful. Despite Sethi's suggestion in investing 10 percent of a salary every year, college graduates may not have to start doing that right away. It's best for college graduates to begin investing early on so that their money will have longer time to grow through compound interest. According to Fidelity , compound interest is when interest you earn in a savings or investment account earns interest of its own. This means that the investment account holder can earn interest on its initial balance and the interest that is added to the total amount of money over time. An example of this would be if a college graduate was to invest $1,000 and earn an annualized return of 7 percent. This would result in their investment growing to $1,070 by next year and earn 7 percent of their entire balance the year after that. If college graduates were to begin contributing $100 toward an investment account that generates a 7 percent annual return rate when they're 21-years-old, their total could be over $1.4 million by the time they're 65. 'By starting at your college graduation with your first job, you will set yourself up for a lifetime of living a rich life,' said Sethi.

        "content": "FORMULA ONE has a sizable problem and it’s called the Monaco Grand Prix. While MotoGP basked in yet another epic race and the Indy 500 sprint to the line was heart-in-the-mouth stuff, Sunday’s F1 procession in Monte Carlo was dreadful. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix was a procession Credit: Getty I always say that you know it has been a decent race when you hear people in public talking about the weekend’s action. As I queued for my flight home at Nice Airport, the discussion among fellow passengers is usually all about where people watched the race, but yesterday all I heard were moans and groans. Take nothing away from Charles Leclerc and his maiden win in his home race, but F1 has a problem when the leading driver is told to “slow down” to save his tyres. It was also the first time in F1 history that the top 10 cars all finished in the same order they started. In total there were two overtakes. TWO. Yes, you can argue this was a result of the first-lap accident involving Sergio Perez that saw the race stopped and all the leading drivers change on to the hard tyre, however, when the world’s eyes are on it, the sport simply cannot afford to have a situation where it is made to look so silly. So what can be done? There are a number of options. The preferred choice would be to have smaller cars. The current models are too wide and heavy that overtaking is not possible on such a narrow circuit. But given Monaco is unique, perhaps another element would be a bespoke set of tyre compounds which force teams to make more frequent pitstops. Monaco Grand Prix narrowly avoids catastrophe after devastating F2 near miss leaves Oliver Bearman stunned It would certainly liven up the strategy side of things, but that all feels someone manufactured and a case of simply papering over the cracks. Another option is to change the circuit. This was suggested by Red Bull boss Christian Horner, who pointed out that the Principality is reclaiming land from the sea and should consider ways of expanding the track. He said: “It’s something that we should collectively have a look at. It’s not racing as such when you’re just driving around three or four seconds off the pace because the other car hasn’t got any chance of overtaking. “Monaco is such a great place to come racing. But the cars are so big now that we just need to look at ‘can we do something that introduces an overtaking area’ or at least the potential of an overtake. “Monaco keeps reclaiming land! It’s such a great place, so much history here, but everything evolves. “The cars are so big now, if you compare them to cars of ten years ago they’re almost twice the size.” And finally, the other option of smaller cars, alternative tyres and an improved track aren’t viable – then let’s bin it altogether. There are no shortages of venues queuing up to host F1 races and, judging by the comments of my fellow passengers, there is a feeling that Monaco is no longer fit for purpose. Pizza was the secret for the victorious Charles Leclerc Credit: Rex CHARLES LECLERC said he treated himself to a pizza on the eve of breaking his Monaco duck, so perhaps he should stick to it more often. After his victory, he said: “I ate like crazy on Saturday night. I actually got in late at home and it was too late to couldn’t cook, so I ordered my favourite pizza. “It’s not the best preparation to race normally, but I was like, ‘OK, maybe mentally it will help me to take the pressure off a little bit’. And yeah, that’s it. I slept really well.” When asked what pizza he went for, he added: “Pizza Margherita with prosciutto crudo. Never pineapple.” Bagnaia made up for an earlier error to win in Barcelona Credit: Rex RED BULL will total up the cost of Sergio Perez’s huge crash in Monaco, which miraculously saw him escape with just a grazed arm. The first lap shunt sent F1 photographers scrambling for cover, as the wreckage was flung in their direction. Fortunately nobody was seriously hurt, although one casualty is the gearbox on Perez’s car, which was competing in its final GP before being replaced and had been christened ‘Donna’ by the team’s mechanics. Perez’s car, and gearbox, is no more Credit: Rex FRANCESCO BAGNAIA won a thrilling Gran Premi Monster Energy de Catalunya at Barcelona. The MotoGP world champion made an error during the Saturday sprint race but made amends on Sunday. Meanwhile, Marc Marquez continued to enjoy his revival by taking third place, despite starting P14 on the grid. The Gresini Racing rider now has three podiums in a row. Newgarden won a thrilling Indy 500 Credit: Getty JOSEF NEWGARDEN won the Indy 500 with a last lap overtake on McLaren’s Pato O’Ward. Newgarden is the first back-to-back winner of the Indy 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and gave Roger Penske a 20th win in the famous race.

More specifically, the exploit uses the system’s official API to provide alternative app icons, but bypasses the requirement for the action to be performed manually by the user. In a typical scenario, iOS requires the user to choose a custom icon in the app – and then the system displays an alert confirming the change. The action of changing an app’s icon is canceled if the system is unable to verify that it was the user who chose another icon or if the confirmation alert is not shown. As a result, there’s no way for an app to change its icon on its own in the background. But by using a private method to call the API, Bostwick was able to set custom icons without requiring confirmation from the user. The researcher also tricked the system into modifying the app’s status check, so that iOS sees the app as active even when it’s running in the background. This allows the app to change the icon automatically in the background whenever it wants. To demonstrate the possibilities, Bostwick combined multiple frames to make animated icons. Although the idea of having all the icons animated is a bit disturbing, the researcher believes it would be nice to let apps show short animations when they receive a notification, for example. Of course, the App Store Review team would probably reject any apps exploiting such a breach.

Reports suggest that the attack may have been perpetrated by rival fans, targeting Krovinovic solely because of his association with Hajduk Split. Club Statement Condemns Attack Hajduk Split issued a statement condemning the assault, asserting that Krovinovic was the victim of a targeted attack motivated by his affiliation with the club. The statement emphasised that Krovinovic did not provoke the attack and stressed the need for the authorities to investigate and punish those responsible. The statement read (via ): “Filip Krovinovic was attacked by a group of rival fans.“He was the target of a physical attack after leaving the Kranjcevic Stadium, with the only reason being that he plays for Hajduk.” “We condemn this barbarous act. We hope the authorities investigate it and punish those involved.“ “This has nothing to do with sporting rivalry. We must stress that Filip did not provoke the attack.” “His aggressors attacked him in a group when they felt it was a convenient moment. “It is just pure luck that Krovinovic did not suffer more severe consequences.”",

        "description": "Craig Counsell, who is in his first year managing the Cubs after 18 seasons with the Brewers as a player and manager, was booed in his first return to Milwaukee.",
        "content": "MILWAUKEE -- manager Craig Counsell was booed twice Monday afternoon in his return to Milwaukee after managing the for the previous nine seasons. Counsell, 53, was booed during a short video montage, which ended with a picture of him in a Brewers uniform. It happened again after his name was announced during starting lineups. \"Cheer, boo ... whatever, man,\" Counsell said to a large contingent of media before the game. \"Just have a good time at the game. That's what fans get to do.\" Counsell surprised the baseball world -- and shocked Brewers fans -- when the Wisconsin native left the only team he has ever managed for the Cubs this past winter, signing a five-year, $40 million contract. Monday was his first day back at American Family Field since leaving. \"The view from the dugout is certainly different,\" Counsell said. \"This is going to be an interesting day.\" Counsell said he first began to have thoughts about moving on from the Brewers a couple years ago when his boss at the time, president of baseball operations David Stearns, stepped down. Stearns resurfaced with the , where Counsell interviewed during the offseason. \"David Stearns leaving made me think about it a lot,\" Counsell said. \"I don't know how it couldn't. It happened over time.\" There were discussions about Counsell returning, but once his contract with Milwaukee ended last October, the Cubs came calling after David Ross was fired and a deal with Counsell was quickly reached. \"Life takes different turns,\" Counsell said. \"I don't want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. You have to take the ride of life and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you have to jump on the ride and go.\" Counsell spent the final five seasons of his playing career in Milwaukee before eventually joining the front office and then becoming their manager in 2015. In all, he spent 18 years with the Brewers organization, taking Milwaukee to the playoffs five times as manager. He was largely criticized in Wisconsin after accepting the Cubs' offer. Then he was booed again on Monday in his return. \"It bothers you, initially,\" Counsell said of the winter criticism. \"But as it goes on ... you're a fan and you can feel how you want to as a fan. That's part of it. It's what makes sports fun. \"It's not my job to tell people how to feel about something or to even figure it out. Let people feel how they want to feel. I'm good with that. It doesn't have to be all positive. We're in a public job with fans. Fans can feel how they want to feel.\" Right now, his successor and good friend Pat Murphy has the upper hand on Counsell as the Brewers are in first place in the National League Central while the Cubs are in second and have been scuffling of late. \"It's a team that's playing really well,\" Counsell said of the Brewers. \"We are not playing very well right now. We're trying to get things on track.\" Both teams have been hit with injuries, but the Brewers have thrived thanks to a surprisingly resourceful offense which ranks third in runs scored. Meanwhile, the Cubs are led by two top-notch starters -- ERA leader and . Milwaukee began the four-game series with a 31⁄2-game lead on the Cubs in a rivalry which should grow even more now that Counsell has switched sides. And while Monday may not be the last time he's booed at his former place of employment, Counsell won't let it change how he feels about where he grew up and worked most of his adult life. \"I live in Wisconsin,\" he said. \"I enjoy where I live. That's all really good.\"",

        "description": "Mike Tyson was treated by paramedics on a flight to Los Angeles after falling ill, but the boxing legend has since confirmed he will still fight Jake Paul.",
        "content": "boxing Mike Tyson expected to be in fighting shape for his upcoming bout Jake Paul Although the flight arrived two hours later than scheduled, a representative for Tyson clarified that the delay was caused by an air-conditioning fault, not Tyson's health scare. \"Thankfully, Mr. Tyson is doing great,\" read the statement. \"He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare-up 30 minutes before landing. He is appreciative to the medical staff that was there to help him. However, it's false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay. This two-hour delay was due to an air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" Misfits boxing star Elle Brooke predicts Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson fight result Mike Tyson health update provided after plane emergency After enduring the incident, the shake-up will not impact Tyson's upcoming fight with Paul on July 20. There have been concerns about Tyson fighting at 58, which he will be when the first bell rings in Texas in July. Nathan Howarth, Development and Operations Director at the Concussion Legacy Foundation UK has warned that Tyson could risk a brain injury. \"Boxing has an inherent risk of concussion and then there’s an increased risk of traumatic brain injury we have seen like bleeds on the brain,\" he told Betway . \"I’m not saying there is any evidence that as an older fighter, Mike would be at risk of that, however, we do know the impacts of subclinical concussions. \"The ones where something has happened to the brain but often turned sub-concussions, those types of blows that are doing damage, but we can’t see are just as important, and it’s particularly important for someone like Mike Tyson who has had a long period of time in the sport anyway. \"We know your exposure to head impacts increases your risk of things like chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The first reported cases from boxing are from the 1930s and we still see that in terms of boxing’s risk to CTE and it’s no secret that there is an element of neurodegeneration. There’s no definitive of what the risks would be but as someone who is 57, there’s clearly going to be a risk in terms of that age profile of potentially having more of an impact for someone who’s older.\" Tyson vs. Paul's boxing match is scheduled for July 20 at AT&T Stadium and is expected to draw a near-capacity or full-capacity crowd. The venue, which can seat over 80,000 spectators, can be expanded to accommodate up to 100,000 fans, reflecting the high demand and excitement surrounding the event. The head of MVP Promotions has openly admitted that his upcoming fight against Tyson will be the most significant moment of his life. To promote the event, Paul engaged in face-to-face confrontations with Tyson during press conferences held in Texas and New York City. The encounters allowed Paul to fully comprehend the enormity of the occasion as he prepared to step into the ring with the legendary boxer.",

        "content": "She rarely goes a week without wowing viewers with another jaw-dropping ensemble. And it’s fair to say didn’t disappoint on Monday night (May 27) when the blonde bombshell decided to melt the internet when she stepped out on stage for the semi-finals. Viewers were left seriously distracted during the first live show of the talent show as the mum-of-two ditched the bra for the skintight red gown. The Heart FM presenter caused a social media meltdown as she returned to the judging panel in her most risqué display yet. The 53-year-old rocked a sultry off-the-shoulder latex dress which featured a daring thigh-high slit and dramatic gloves. Her sizzling asymmetrical look saw Amanda flash the flesh as she showed off her endless pins in the jaw-dropping dress. She elevated the look with a pair of nude high heels as she stepped out on stage hand-in-hand with her fellow judges. To complete the look, the TV favourite pulled her golden tresses back into a dramatic high ponytail which sat at the crown of her head. The broadcaster finished the look with a full face of makeup which celebrated her youthful glow with a pinch of blush on the apples of her cheeks. She added a touch of bronzer on the high points of her face which complimented the wash of brown eyeshadow on her lid. To complete the looks, she added lashings of black mascara on her fluttery lashes and a swipe of nude pink lipstick. Amanda later took to Instagram to share a series of glamorous snaps showcasing her eye-catching attire online. She gave viewers a closer look at her show-stopping gown which featured a dramatic slash at her midriff, showing off her toned physique. The doting mum captioned the post: “@bgt Live Show One 2024”. It didn’t take long before she was showered with compliments by her adoring followers online. Her celebrity pal Sian Welby penned: “ABSOLUTE WONDER WOMAN” as Vicky Pattison gushed: “Oh Mandy.” Another viewer gushed: “[fire emoji] Looking gorge Good Luck with the lives my darling [heart emoji] #hotholden [three fire emojis].” A third echoed: “You look absolutely gorgeous [heart-eyes emoji, heart emoji, heart-eyes emoji] You look stunning.\" But Amanda wasn't the only star to dazzle the viewers with her sizzling ensemble tonight. Her co-star Alesha Dixon almost suffered an embarrassing wardrobe mishap as she showed her support for her Golden Buzzer act Taryn Charles. The 45-year-old singer rocked a lilac minidress that struggled to cover her peachy derriere on the big night. After Taryn showcased her incredible vocal range, the mum-of-two jumped to her feet as she applauded her performance. Fortunately, she managed to adjust her skintight skirt just in time before the camera could catch a small glimpse of her underwear. But it's fair to say viewers spotted her wardrobe blunder at home. One user penned: \"That was close Alesha. Nice save\" as a second gushed: \"Alesha is your dress a bit short #BritainsGotTalent.\" A third echoed: \"#BritainsGotTalent #bgt Alesha was lucky she didn't reveals something when she stood up.\" Unfortunately Taryn failed to make it through to the live finals, with opera singer Innocent Masuku and performance troupe Ssaulabi pipped her to the post.",

'Free money' from employer contributions mainly benefits highest earners, landmark research reveals Employer contribution match formulas vary depending on the company Research suggests 401(K) matches are mainly benefitting higher earners READ MORE: Americans are retiring earlier - but could they outlive their 401(K)? By Tilly Armstrong Assistant Consumer Editor For Dailymail.Com Published: 14:58 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:27 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 13 shares 13 View comments The 401(K) retirement plan is designed to help workers build a nest egg by putting money aside from their pay check every month. On top of this, they can receive extra money from their employer through a match. But new research suggests that these employer contributions are mainly benefitting the highest earners. Employers contributed $212 billion to retirement plans - roughly 58 cents for every dollar that participants saved - according to latest data from 2021. But some 44 percent of these funds went to the top 20 percent of earners, according to analysis from Vanguard Group. The lowest earners, meanwhile, received just 6 percent of the 'free money' from company matches, it found. Research by Vanguard Group suggests 401(K) employer contributions are mainly benefitting higher earners Read More More Americans than ever plan to retire at 62 - but are they at risk of outliving their 401(K)? It is not surprising that a greater share of employer matching dollars goes to those who are paid more, the study said, given that matching contributions are typically given as a proportion of salary. But it suggests that those earning the most receive a larger share of contributions than their share of income. The match formulas companies use vary. Some firms contribute a set amount each year, for example 3 percent of pay, regardless of whether the worker contributes. A small number of companies contribute up to a dollar cap - for example offering a 10 percent match on 6 percent of pay, subject to a limit of $6,000. But the most common match formula, according to Vanguard, is a percentage match. Typically, this will be half of a worker's contributions up to 6 percent of their pay. When the employer contribution is based on percentage of pay, those with higher incomes typically receive more. But top earners also receive a larger share of 401(K) matching dollars than their share of income, the study showed. On average, those in the top 20 percent income bracket received 39 percent of the income, but 44 percent of their employer's 401(K) contributions. Those in the bottom 20 percent of earners, meanwhile, receive a 29 percent smaller share of matching dollars than income, Vanguard found through analysis of over 1,000 plans between 2013 and 2022. Matching dollars often exacerbates pay inequity, said Fiona Greig, global head of investor research and policy at Vanguard Group Matching dollars often exacerbates pay inequity, Fiona Greig, global head of investor research and policy at Vanguard Group, told The Wall Street Journal . One of the reasons higher earners receive a higher amount of employer contributions is because they are more likely to participate in 401(K) plans and earn enough to get a full matching contribution. Of the 10 most popular matching formulas, all but one disproportionately rewarded the top 20 percent of earners with a higher share of matching dollars than income. The study suggests that those earning the most receive a larger share of contributions than their share of income The formula which is the best for more equally distributing employer contributions is when the funds are capped at a dollar amount, Vanguard found. Using a dollar cap formula, the top 20 percent of earners received around 33 percent of the matching contributions, compared to 35 percent of income. Costco, for example, matches 50 percent of workers' annual 401(K) savings up to a $500 cap. The maximum workers can save into a 401(K) for 2024 is $23,000 - according to guidelines set out by the IRS - and $69,000 for combined employee and employer contributions. Those over 50 can also add an additional $7,500 in catch-up contributions. The Vanguard research lays bare the divide at the heart of retirement in the US. Research from Fidelity Investments earlier this month revealed a strong stock market means there are now more 401(K) millionaires than ever before . The number of seven-figure 401(K) accounts rose to 485,000 in the first quarter of this year - up 15 percent from the previous quarter. A year ago, there were 340,000, according to the investment firm. Meanwhile, separate research earlier this year found a record number of Americans took money out of their 401(K) plan in 2023 for a financial emergency - as high inflation continues to wear away savings for many.

        "content": "Susannah Scaroni’s schedule hasn’t allowed her to compete very often at the Bolder Boulder. When she does, however, she leaves as a champion. At the 44th Bolder Boulder on Monday, Scaroni won the women’s push rim race by shattering the course record with a time of 23 minutes, 31 seconds. The previous women’s record was 25:43, set by Candace Cable in 1996. Scaroni also won the push rim race in 2013, the only other year she’s competed. “Honestly, I love this race and I love the race coordinator, Jacob Heilveil,” Scaroni said. “He was my kid role model when I was starting wheelchair racing, and almost every other year since 2013, I’ve been in another competition. That competition got pushed back this year, so I finally can come back.” The 2020 Paralympic Games champion in the women’s 5,000-meter push rim race, Scaroni has her sights set on another gold medal this year in Paris. The Champaign, Ill., native used the Bolder Boulder as a test. “This is also a Paralympic year and a lot of people going other places, so it was kind of a smaller field,” she said. “I just wanted to see how hard I could go today. Very happy, yes. “All I remember from this course (in 2013) is my lungs hurt at the end, and that’s how I feel today.” Kendall Gretsch, who won the previous two years, finished as runner-up in 27:08. Gretsch, from Colorado Springs, beat her times from the past two years. Repeating as men’s champion was Howie Sanborn of Denver. He finished third overall, with a time of 27:24. “This race is always fun, and we got caught another beautiful day,” said Sanborn, who turned 42 on Monday. “This time of year the weather can be hit or miss, especially on the winds, and today was perfect. So it was a fun day to race, plus it’s my birthday. So yeah, it’s nice to come out here and catch a win on your birthday.” Proud to be the men’s champion, Sanborn was impressed with both Scaroni and Gretsch. “Susannah is like the best in the world when it comes to racing chair and last year was the only time I’ve ever beaten Kendall in the racing chair,” Sanborn said. “So, I know she’s just gonna go so hard. I just did my best to keep up. I had her for a little bit on the downhill part, but she caught me on the final (stretch).” Gretsch and Sanborn will both compete in Paris at the Paralympics in the para triathlon later this summer. Prior to Memorial Day weekend, race director Cliff Bosley was projecting participation numbers to be around 45,000. He was pleasantly surprised to see that number get blown away. In all, there were 48,169 entrees – a more than 8,000 ahead of 2023 (40,044) and the most since 2018 (50,914). “The enthusiasm of our participants to want to be a part of it in a bigger way than we thought (was great),” Bosley said. “I didn’t judge that one right. I didn’t see it, but it’s great. This is just the last couple of weeks that there was that heightened interest.” In fact, on Sunday night, race organizers considered closing off entries because there was concern about whether they had enough T-shirts and snack bags for entrants. Ultimately, however, registration remained open and about 550 registered Monday morning. “If we don’t have to be, we don’t want to be in a position to turn people away,” Bosley said. Between the men’s pro race, women’s pro race and push rim competition, $101,800 was awarded in prize money on Monday. ... From the high number of entries to the perfect weather and thrilling finishes, Bosley said the day could not have been much better. “It all came together,” he said. “We talk in our office about we work 364 days for one, so it’s kind of cool when the one day is the day that works.” ... Bosley said roughly 43,400 of the entrants finished the race. That’s about 90%, which is the same as 2023 but better than the previous four events from 2017-2022. ... Bosley said there were some incidents of dehydration, but no abnormal medical incidents during the race.",

        "content": "The New York Yankees may have a new historic duo. Aaron Judge and Juan Soto are off to an incredible start together. Arguably the two best hitters in the game, they both are off to such amazing starts that it promises to be a fun and perhaps historic summer in the Bronx. Two seasons ago, Judge broke Roger Maris ‘s single-season American League home run record of 61 which Maris hit in 1961. This past week, Judge has a new record: he’s the only player ever to record 11 homers and 12 doubles over a 20-game stretch. It’s a hot streak never seen before in the history of baseball. Judge has gone nuclear this month, and now he tops the majors in several offensive categories. Alongside him is none other than the generational superstar Juan Soto. This past winter’s blockbuster addition looks made for the hallowed Yankees pinstripes . This duo is already the best offensively in the game. If Soto signs an extension and keeps up his current output, the Yankees may have a new historic duo similar to Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle ‘s run at the history books, bearing in mind Judge already broke Maris’s home run mark. It’s too early for proclamations a few weeks into their partnership. However, there’s an increasing chance that both will put up historic numbers together on the way to a deep October run this year. Yankees May Have a New Historic Duo Yankee Universe is already showing Juan Soto all the love. The huge Dominican community in the Bronx is playing a big part in his early comfort. As such, he’s been treated like a native son already. Soto in return embraces the love. He takes time to give back to the fans in the stands at every opportunity. His personality and game are built for the city. He has the perfect Ruthian mix of kindness, confidence, and swagger. Every Soto at-bat is an event. His shuffle, smile, and nod before sending the next pitch into orbit before flipping his bat, is pure cinema. He’s already had a few cinematic moments to start the year. Both guys are setting up target practice in ballparks across the country. Per ESPN’s Buster Olney, Soto is currently on pace to hit 42 home runs with 129 RBI and 117 runs scored. Following him, Judge is on course for 51 home runs with 117 RBI and 111 runs scored. These are video game numbers. Combined, they could end up driving in 250 runs together and hitting 90 home runs. Beyond the numbers, this makes the Yankees heavy favorites to come out of the American League and go to the World Series. They already have a top-two rotation with defending Cy Young Award winner Gerrit Cole still to join it, along with this juggernaut offense. Soto and Judge: A Look at Their Numbers It’s been an incredible start for these two sluggers. Soto, in his contract year and first year in pinstripes, is on a mission. So far, just two months into the season, he sports a .310 average with a massive 44 RBI and 14 home runs. Soto is in the top five in the league in OPS, OBP, and RBI. Furthermore, he’s in the top 10 in batting average, hits, home runs, and runs, and he’s third in total bases. Juan Soto is off to an otherworldly start, and one of the clear early front-runners for the AL MVP. Judge, after a slow start, is in superhuman form right now. As of Monday, he is second in MLB with 17 home runs. He also leads the league in slugging percentage and OPS. Judge also leads the league in the Isolated Power statistic, measured by extra-base hits per at-bat. He is leading the American League in most offensive categories, and at this point is also competing for the league’s MVP. Judge has been particularly hot over his last 15 games. In that span, he has 21 hits, batting just under .412 with 8 homers and 14 RBI. With an OPS of 1.039 over his last ten games, he is the hottest he’s ever been. Not only is Judge the hottest player in the game right now, his past 20 games are historically good. The New Bronx Bombers How will the opposition pitch to this Yankee lineup? Teams cannot pitch around Soto, because he’ll happily pass the baton to Aaron Judge to feast. With Giancarlo Stanton in the middle of the order, there’s no soft landing. Stanton himself is currently tied with Shohei Ohtani for seventh in the majors in home runs, hitting 13 already. The former MVP’s start cannot be overlooked due to his incredible bat speed. This lineup has the makings of a true Murderer’s Row. Soto and Judge should continue to get good pitches to hit with no easy stretch in the lineup. If they pitch around the duo, Stanton awaits, as Yu Darvish of the San Diego Padres learned the hard way. All three sluggers went yard off Darvish in the same inning. The trio combined to hit the ball a combined 1,250 feet in one inning. Sandwiched between the three-peat, Alex Verdugo took Darvish to the top of the wall for a double. All this came off a pitcher who had a scoreless streak of 25 innings prior to the game. AARON JUDGE AND JUAN SOTO GO BACK-TO-BACK pic.twitter.com/kD1sPkWq9q — Talkin’ Yanks (@TalkinYanks) May 25, 2024 Judge then sent ace Dylan Cease ‘s offering deep into the left field seats Saturday night. Similarly, against the excellent Seattle Mariners pitching staff, Judge hit an opposite-field blast into the right-field bleachers against Bryce Miller . Not to be outdone, Juan Soto then obliterated an opposite-field shot into the bullpen in left center. In his next at-bat, Soto hit another, this time into the left-field bleachers. The next day, Judge mashed a shot off the excellent Luis Castillo . Stanton also followed suit. The trio’s 43 homers are already more than that of four entire major league clubs. Best Duo in MLB? As of right now, Soto and Judge constitute the best duo in the majors statistically, and both are early favorites for the AL MVP. They already have a camaraderie, and each at-bat for the pair is a must-see. The Yankees may have a new historic duo if they can tie Soto down for the long term. With the best record in the AL and the second-best record in the majors, this team looks special as currently constructed. If this continues, it could lead them to the franchise’s 28th World Series title. This article first appeared on Last Word On Sports and was syndicated with permission.",

The powerhouse opera singer took to the stage on Monday 27 May and gave an incredible performance where he received a standing ovation from all four judges as well as a huge amount of praise. When Innocent finished singing, went to the judges for comments when said: “How do I sum it up? You’re the one to beat.” added: “What’s amazing is how slight you are and I never see you take a breath then you do those notes that last forever. I think Alesha’s right, you’re the one to beat tonight.” Simon said: “We felt how much this means to you”, and he went on to say: “You deserve this opportunity because you are incredibly talented.” Viewers were equally impressed by Innocent and took to social media to express how they felt. One wrote: “He is amazing!” Another added: “This opera singer WOW #BritainsGotTalent.\" But the biggest news came from Innocent later on when Dec said: \"Since we saw you last, you’re married now.\" Innocent replied \"yes I am\" as the camera panned to his new wife who jumped up and down, thrilled to have been watching him from the audience. Innocent was put straight through first on Monday night after receiving the most public votes. The judges were then forced to choose between Ssaulabi Performance Troupe and The Trickstars. straight away picked Ssaulabi whilst Alesha had to take more time to make her decision but also came to the same decision, as did Amanda. Simon said he would have also picked Ssaulabi. The group said about getting through to the final show on Sunday 2 June: “We represent Taekwondo in Korea, we will show everything we have. Dec said to Innocent: “What a year you’re having, the audition we saw you back in January, your wedding and now here you are, the winner of tonight’s semi-final. What a special time.” Innocent replied: “This is my year, I’m so happy and I’m ready. I am ready for Sunday. I hope you are ready as well.” The first who had to drag him up on stage to participate. Bruno was spun around in mid-air by the couple, but when asked if he enjoyed the act, he said: “It worked for me! It’s a bit scary - and I thought that anyway. Every time you were spinning around, I thought she was going to crash. I found it very scary and very dramatic.”",

        "content": "To start the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the New York Rangers had one of the most dynamic power plays in the league, one that looked nearly unstoppable. It was overwhelming the Washington Capitals, and it proved to be one of the difference makers early on in their second round series against the Carolina Hurricanes. However, it’s seen some struggles recently. In their last six games they’re 1 for 18 on the man advantage, and in their Eastern Conference Final series against the Florida Panthers, it’s 0 for 8. They’ve still found a way to win without it, but they’ll likely need it back at full power if they want to win the Stanley Cup. Jon Goyens joined Frank Seravalli and Colby Cohen on Daily Faceoff Live to talk about the Rangers power play, and why it’s struggling to score at the moment. Jon Goyens: Well the Rangers want to hold pucks so much. They’re a possession-type of power play. They do have movement, but if I compare them to a Tampa Bay Lightning who under handle pucks, the Rangers will overhandle, but with a purpose. They’re looking for seam passes. They look for Mika Zibanejad on that seam pass, not just on your typical flank one-timer, but he’ll be down by the goal line below bottom circle. And right now, they’ve faced basically two penalty kills that are very similar. You’ll see Carolina’s defense up high, pressing high, and we see Florida’s penalty kill pressing high. What do they want to do? They want you to continuously make indirect plays and stay on the perimeter, so then it’s a one goes, everybody goes. If New York was a little bit sharper on the execution, the chances will come their way. You can watch the full episode here, including Goyens breaking down clips...

        "description": "A 2022 Government Accountability Office Report revealed 91% of colleges understate the price students will actually pay to attend.",
        "content": "WASHINGTON, D.C. — As students applied for college this year, many were hit with an unexpected setback. The FAFSA — the tool that allows students to apply for federal financial aid — didn’t become fully available online until almost four months later than usual. Like cascading dominos, that delay has led to a slew of problems in the college admissions process. Students are visiting colleges, meeting with potential professors and charting their next steps before even receiving an aid offer. Many students will have to decide on a college, or whether to go to college at all, without even knowing how much they will pay to attend. But it’s not the first time students have faced this decision without a clear understanding of the dollars and cents. At most universities, that’s the norm. A 2022 Government Accountability Office Report revealed 91% of colleges understate the price students will actually pay to attend. Not a single school followed all the best practices identified in the GAO’s report, and two-thirds failed to mention important financial details in their communications with students. This prevents students from planning ahead or considering their borrowing costs. Even worse, a third of colleges listed loans as grants. One study found various colleges were referring to just one type of federal loan by 136 different names, some of which didn’t even include the word “loan!” Institutions often used this tactic to zero out the total, making it look like students would pay $0 to attend. Only when students read the fine print would they see much of that “aid” was actually a loan to be paid back with interest. ADVERTISEMENT This tactic is a key piece of the puzzle as to why the cost of college keeps going up. And while it’s not the only factor, when colleges and universities hide the ball, students can’t shop around for their best option. This doesn’t fly in any other financial arena. A new home or car owner has information down to the finest detail, but students borrowing similar amounts too often do not have access to an accurate bottom-line. Students fresh out of high school are taking their first steps into adulthood while making one of the biggest financial decisions in their lives. Yet, they often sign the dotted line without knowing exactly how much they’re expected to pay. That’s why we introduced a bipartisan bill, the Understanding the True Cost of College Act. When colleges offer students financial aid packages, we want to ensure they are comparable among colleges. The information students receive should use the same terms, clearly show the amount the student would borrow and allow students to compare their options apples-to-apples, not apples-to-oranges. Bipartisan, bicameral solutions like this empower students, and greater cost transparency can help lower the cost of a college education. Under our proposal, aspiring scholars would know the cost of each option from the jump. The same GAO report that found 91% of colleges understate their attendance costs also noted our bill would help fix many of the issues students are currently up against. This year’s FAFSA delays emphasize exactly why students need timely, accurate financial breakdowns. Students naturally struggle to make the right choice when they’re rushed or uninformed. Before students take the leap — and tens of thousands of dollars in loans — Congress and colleges should help make sure they have the full picture.",

        "description": "Bishop Carroll's Ani Marcotte and St. ThomasAquinas' Shalynn Elmore look to the umpire for a call on a pickoff attempt.",
        "content": "BY SCOTT PASKE KSHSAA Covered WICHITA – History will show Bishop Carroll won its unrivaled 15th state softball title in convincing fashion over St. Thomas Aquinas on Saturday at Wilkins Stadium. But when the Golden Eagles unpack memories years from now of their 12-2, run-rule victory in six innings in the Class 5A championship game, it’s likely they’ll also recall the suspense-filled semifinal that got them there. With their title hopes on the verge of extinction, Carroll rallied for four runs in the top of the seventh to edge Maize South 6-5, foiling the Mavericks’ bid for their first state title. Carroll then took the momentum and ran – and hit – in the ensuing finale, belting and blooping 15 of them while Aquinas stung itself with four errors. \"Once you do that, you’ve got to finish it,’” Carroll coach Steve Harshberger said of his team’s comeback that produced the penultimate win in a 27-4 season. “They came out and finished it, so it was a lot of fun. We had to get through the first one, though. Maize South played a good game.” The Eagles’ first victory of the season, an 8-6 decision over Maize South, was Harshberger’s 200th since he began coaching at Carroll in 2014. His 225th – the one that put the Eagles in the championship – came against the same opponent and required some gumption. “We knew the pressure was on, but we work on pressure situations all year long,” said first baseman Cambell Riordan, who hit an RBI single during the late charge. “We knew it was our last chance and we really didn’t want to be in that third- and fourth-place game. No one ever really does. We knew what we had to do.” Carroll’s comeback featured a little of everything. Ally Orth doubled, Olivia Navarro hit a sacrifice fly, Riordan scored on a wild pitch and the Eagles drew four walks, including back-to-back free passes to Zoe Buessing and Desi Segura that plated the go-ahead run. Maize South was unable to threaten in the bottom of the inning, sending Carroll to the final on a high. “The pressure was the first night,” Harshberger said. “Get to today. Then it’s get to this game. “Once we got here, it was like, ‘Don’t let anybody stop you now. It’s all yours.’ That’s kind of what our motto was. We’re here. Take care of it.” After Aquinas stranded a runner at third against Orth in the top of the first, Carroll’s offense pounced for four runs on four hits in its first turn. Riordan, who finished the season with 64 RBIs, started her 3-for-4, 4-RBI title tilt with a blooper over the infield that scored the Eagles’ first run. Aquinas (25-5), which reached the championship with a 5-4 semifinal victory over top-seeded Spring Hill, committed three errors in the first. One was a throwing miscue on a pickoff attempt at third that allowed Orth to score and make it 2-0. “We shot ourselves in the foot and they did the right things – they took full advantage,” Aquinas coach Keith Hughes said. “Very uncharacteristic. We just didn’t look like us in that game.” Orth’s run came during senior Ani Marcotte’s 19-pitch marathon at-bat in which she fouled off several pitches. While Aquinas pitcher Alayna Vaeth eventually retired Marcotte on a comebacker, the duel highlighted the relentlessness of the Eagles’ lineup. Nine Carroll batters hit safely. “We got up on them early and that always makes it easier to relax,” said Riordan, a Benedictine signee who added an RBI double in the second and a two-run single in the third. “The pressure is on them and not us basically the whole game.” The Eagles made it particularly difficult on Aquinas with two outs. In the first inning, junior Lillian Martin hit a two-out RBI single to make it 3-0, and sophomore Emerson May followed with a liner to center on an 0-2 pitch that scooted past the outfielder for a fourth run. Carroll stretched its lead to 7-0 in the second with a three-run rally that began after the first two Eagles were retired. Navarro followed Riordan’s hard-hit double with a two-run double that ended Vaeth’s time in the circle. Riordan’s good fortune continued in the third with a perfectly placed blooper to center that also came with two outs, scoring May and Natalie Thimmesch to stretch Carroll’s lead to 9-0. Meanwhile, Orth yielded just one hit in the first four innings, a single by Aquinas’ Kelsey Schenck that was quickly erased on the next pitch with a groundball double play. The Saints broke through in the fifth on a two-run triple by junior Shalynn Elmore. But Orth, who struck out seven in the complete-game victory, fanned the next two batters to silence the uprising. Marcotte highlighted Carroll’s third four-hit inning of the game with a two-run double in the bottom of the fifth to make it 11-2. After Orth quickly retired the side in the sixth, the Eagles closed out the victory after back-to-back singles and a fielder’s choice loaded the bases. Keira Stripling, who led off the semifinal rally a few hours earlier with a walk, drew a bases-loaded walk that plated Buessing with the title-clinching run. After Valley Center ruled Class 5A the past two seasons, Carroll won its first title since 2021 and fourth under Harshberger. As the Eagles celebrated in the outfield after the game, much of the conversation centered around the clutch comeback that served as the springboard. “If we can do that, we can do anything in the championship game,” Orth said.",

        "content": "An innocent shopper said she was left in tears after being wrongly accused of stealing at a Home Bargains store due to an error in a new facial recognition system used by shops to identify shoplifters . The woman, who wants to remain anonymous, said she was wrongly flagged by a system called Facewatch, and an employee at the shop searched her bag before she was led out and banned from all stores using the technology . Facewatch scans customers' faces and then checks them against a database of criminal suspects. The system is used by companies including Budgens, Sports Direct, Southern Co-Op and Costcutter. The woman said the company wrote to her, admitting it had made an error, but she said the incident left her distressed. Drug mules in 'UK’s gang capital' leave locals ‘too scared to speak’ with crime outside homes She told the BBC : \"Within less than a minute, I'm approached by a store worker who comes up to me and says, 'You're a thief, you need to leave the store'. I was just crying and crying the entire journey home... I thought, 'Oh, will my life be the same? I'm going to be looked at as a shoplifter when I've never stolen'.\" Facial recognition technology is also being used by the police across the UK to scan large crowds of people for suspects. The Metropolitan Police described it as a \"vital tool\" for policing and credited it with securing numerous arrests. Lindsey Chiswick, director of intelligence, previously said: \"From a policing perspective, facial recognition is absolutely game-changing. We've been using it for a while in the post-incidence sense, but it's only recently in the last year or so that the algorithms have really come along and it's really accurate now. \"We can use it to point our resource at the most wanted, who have committed the most prolific offending and that ability to prioritise is really key at a time when our resources are spread quite thinly.\" Instead of taking into account characteristics such as whether a person is male or female, or dark or light-skinned, the biometric tool calculates the individual measurements of people's faces. It then creates a template, comparing this to the same biometric template that was created in the custody image database when the person was arrested in the past. Within 60 seconds, from the image being inputted into the system, the technology will generate a match report for a police officer to look at manually before determining whether to make an arrest. Images can come from CCTV stills or smartphone footage. The technology is so sophisticated that it managed to find an accurate match from a grainy image where the person pictured was wearing a mask. Ms Chiswick added: \"If we didn’t have this, the alternative would be an individual sitting and manually looking and comparing that picture with the other ones, which could take weeks or months.\" The Mirror has contacted Home Bargains and Facewatch for comment.",

A spokesperson said the team is looking into the matter and has spoken with McManus’ agent and the NFL office. ESPN reported two women are suing McManus for sexually assaulting them during a charter flight to London last year when he was playing for the Jacksonville Jaguars. “We take allegations of this nature very seriously,” the spokesperson said in a message sent to The Associated Press. Citing court documents that have not yet been posted on Duval County’s public records database, ESPN reports the women, identified as Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II, are accusing McManus of rubbing and grinding against them during the flight and the Jaguars of failing to supervise him and create a safe environment for staff serving the team. They are seeking more than $1 million and asking for a jury trial, according to ESPN. A message sent to agent Drew Rosenhaus, who represents McManus, was not immediately returned. The Jaguars had no comment. McManus, who turns 33 in July, signed with Washington in March.

        "content": "Parallel downloading is one of the experimental features of Google Chrome that is often recommended to speed up downloads . This guide explains what parallel downloading is and how to enable it in Chrome. Parallel downloading – or multithreaded downloading – is a method that significantly improves download speeds for large files. It works by breaking the file into smaller segments, then downloading these segments simultaneously, using multiple connections to the server. Once downloaded, the segments are reassembled in the correct order. It maximizes your Internet bandwidth utilization by avoiding congestion on your end and possible limitations/restrictions at the server’s end. The parallel downloading feature won’t magically increase your download speed beyond your Internet plan. It increases download speed efficiently, using the available bandwidth. There are many possible limitations and bottlenecks on both the download server and your network’s end. For example, congested server/network, packet loss, bandwidth limits by server, and server queue. Parallel downloading can bypass the following situations to speed up downloads: Overall, parallel downloading speeds up downloads by optimally using available bandwidth and avoiding server/network issues that could delay the download. However, keep in mind that parallel downloading can also slow down the download speed for small files – usually under 5MBs. It adds extra overhead to the download process when it creates segments, establishes multiple connections, and reconstructs the file. For small files, this overhead can be slower than the actual file download time. To see this feature in action, I downloaded the 329MB GIMP setup file. My Internet speed is 30Mbps, so theoretically, 3.75 MBs/s is my maximum achievable download speed. Note: I started counting when the download file appeared in the Chrome download history and stopped when it became available to execute. I also deleted browser data after each test. Parallel downloading disabled: it failed on my first attempt, and I had to restart. On the second attempt, it took 2 minutes and 41 seconds to download. The download speed fluctuated between 2.0 MB/s and 2.7 MB/s, with the highest spike being 2.9 MB/s. Parallel downloading enabled: it took 1 minute and 54 seconds to complete. It fluctuated between 2.5 MB/s to 3.1 MB/s, with the highest spike being 3.4 MB/s. It did dip to 1.8 MB/s for a few seconds but quickly stabilized to above 2.5 MB/sec. I won’t say this experiment proves parallel downloading is the best choice, as too many variables can affect the outcome. However, if you usually download larger files, parallel downloading will surely be beneficial. If you are ready to take advantage of parallel downloading, enable it in Chrome from the Chrome flags . These instructions will work on both the desktop and mobile versions of the Google Chrome browser. In Chrome, type chrome://flags in the address bar, and hit Enter . Type “parallel downloading” in the search bar, and select Enabled from the drop-down menu next to the Parallel downloading flag. Restart the browser for the changes to take effect. Personally, I have parallel downloading enabled on both Chrome and Opera (Chromium-based). I have to download work-related apps often, so it’s quite beneficial for me. For people seeking more control over parallel downloading, I recommend using a dedicated download manager instead. Image credit: Canva and Google . All screenshots by Karrar Haider.

        "content": "DOZENS of hotels currently housing Ukrainian refugees could soon return to public use, the Taoiseach has said. The Government won’t renew 68 contracts that will “shortly expire” — as Simon Harris insists we need to move “beyond this emergency response” to migrants. And the State will stop paying charities to provide ­asylum seekers with tents. Mr Harris said communities could get their hotels back by the summer. He said: “We need to stop taking the only hotel in the town and there is some good news in ­relation to this. In Co Kerry, we’ve been able to put two hotels that had been used for ­migration back into use.” He added: “We’ll see many hotels and other facilities coming back into the community.” Mr Harris said he had been told people wanted to see a bit of “cop on” in our migrants policy. He added: “I believe very strongly that Irish people are compassionate. I really believe it. Irish communities have done an incredible job. “We have taken a ­number of measures to show people that there’s a rules-based system. “That if you come here and you don’t have a right to be here, you’re going to find out about that quicker and be asked to leave, that our welfare system is there to support you, but it’s never open to abuse.” The new hardline stance comes after a number of tent camps in Dublin have been cleared out in recent weeks. And the Taoiseach has indicated those asylum seekers sleeping rough along Dublin’s Grand Canal will be cleared out again this week. Speaking at the launch of Fine Gael’s European and Local Election manifestos today, Harris said there is “active work going on” in relation to the tents. He said: “There was a multi-agency meeting as recently as today in relation to that and I do expect progress on those throughout the week.\" More than 100 tents belonging to asylum seekers were previously removed from the area with metal fencing erected after they were cleared earlier in the year from Mount Street . And Mr Harris insists he wants the barriers gone soon, adding: “I certainly don’t want to see a scenario where they become anything like a semi-permanent feature.” He also confirmed the State will stop funding charities for providing tents and sleeping bags to asylum seekers. He said: “It’s not safe and secure for people to be having to pitch tents in public areas without access to sanitation. “As more State land becomes available, and as we can provide you with safe and secure tented accommodation with access to sanitation, it would then make sense to be directing you there, rather than to be funding a charity to give you a tent that, frankly, can’t meet those standards.” In recent months the Government has introduced tighter rules around welfare supports for asylum seekers and Ukrainians. Last week, the Government announced plans to means-test asylum seekers .",

The remains of only five people had been recovered by Monday, local authorities reported. It was not immediately clear why the tally of six reported on Sunday had been revised down. In a letter to the UN resident coordinator dated Sunday and seen by The Associated Press, the acting director of the country's National Disaster Center, Luseta Laso Mana, said the landslide \"buried more than 2000 people alive\" and caused \"major destruction\" in Yambali village in Enga province. Estimates of the casualties have varied widely since the disaster occurred, and it was not immediately clear how officials arrived at the number of people affected. The International Organisation for Migration, which is working closely with the government and taking a leading role in the international response, has not changed its estimated death toll of 670 released on Sunday, pending new evidence. \"We are not able to dispute what the government suggests but we are not able to comment on it,\" said Serhan Aktoprak, chief of the UN migrant agency's mission in Papua New Guinea. \"As time goes in such a massive undertaking, the number will remain fluid,\" Aktoprak said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sent \"heartfelt condolences\" to the families of the victims and the people and government of PNG and said the UN and its partners are supporting the government's response efforts, and \"the United Nations stands ready to offer additional assistance at this challenging time,\" UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. The death toll of 670 was based on calculations by Yambali village and Enga provincial officials that more than 150 homes had been buried by the landslide. The previous estimate had been 60 homes. The office of PNG Prime Minister James Marape did not respond on Monday to a request for an explanation of what the government estimate of 2000 was based on. Marape has promised to release information about the scale of the destruction and loss of life when it becomes available. Determining the scale of the disaster is difficult because of challenging conditions on the ground, including the village's remote location, a lack of telecommunications and tribal warfare throughout the province which means international relief workers and aid convoys require military escorts. At least 26 tribal warriors and mercenaries were killed in a battle between two warring tribes in Enga in February, as well as an unconfirmed number of bystanders. The national government's lack of reliable census data also adds to the challenges of determining how many are potentially dead. Earth-moving equipment used by PNG's military was being transported to the disaster scene, 400km from the east coast city of Lae. Traumatised villagers are divided over whether heavy machinery should be allowed to dig up and potentially further damage the bodies of their buried relatives, officials said.

        "content": "Justine Searle never imagined selling her home in Darwin would prove to be a challenge that lost her $100,000. \"We had purchased it back in 2010 off the plan for $465,000, and when we did sell, we sold for $362,000,\" she said. Ms Searle had bought the apartment in the inner-city suburb of Woolner, just before the construction , and rented it out. But she and her partner felt they were \"throwing good money after bad\" trying to pay off the mortgage, despite it nearly always having tenants. Late last year, Ms Searle and her partner put it on the market for just under $400,000. \"There were no takers at all, the agent didn't even get a phone call,\" she said. After months of no traction, increasing interest rates, and chipping in almost $1,000 a month for associated costs, Ms Searle and her partner decided to cut their losses. The property sold within days after dropping the price. NT property market 'in peril' Darwin remains the cheapest capital city to buy in the country, with median home prices at just over $490,000, PropTrack senior economist Eleanor Creagh said. And though prices rose marginally — to 0.16 per cent above April 2023 levels — last month, returning to positive growth for the first time in more than a year, Darwin's market is growing at one of the slowest rates in the country. Rental prices continue to increase at a fast pace in Darwin, sitting at an average of $600 a week, compared to $560 in Melbourne and $600 in Brisbane. Derek Hart has been a real estate agent in Darwin for 16 years, and is seeing scores of young people taking advantage of low sales prices, and many others fed up with high rents, buying homes instead. \"We've got a lot of first time buyers coming into the market. So people are realising that the interest rates at the end of the year are going to be dropping,\" he said. \"And with rents going up ... in the long run with capital growth, it's better for the buyer to purchase a home instead of renting.\" However, Aswin De Silva, chief executive of REINT, the NT's peak real estate body, says the \"property market is currently facing major issues\". \"I don't mind calling it, we are in peril,\" he said. He said house prices have remained stagnant since 2022, and in regional centres like Katherine and Alice Springs prices \"have taken a beating\". Mr De Silva said rental yields — the amount of money an owner is making on an investment property — were currently about 7 per cent. \"This is unhealthy and not sustainable as family income available to pay rents are going down, largely due to cost of living pressures,\" he said. \"Vacancy rates are stable at slightly under 5 per cent but could increase if we see an escalation of crime and anti-social issues particularly in Alice Springs.\" 'Nobody's going to stay here if rent rates are high' In the wake of crime waves that have been covered extensively in the media, interest rate hikes and financial stress, Mr De Silva said the NT's market challenges are not going anywhere anytime soon. And to make matters worse, he said a scarcity in affordable homes meant people aren't coming to the territory to invest. \"Nobody's going to stay here if rent rates are high, and there is no affordable housing,\" he said. \"It is very difficult to get private investments and developer inducement with exorbitant building costs, supply-chain issues and complex approval processes.\" While some parts of Australia are seeing , the NT's has remained almost stationary. The Northern Territory is losing thousands more residents interstate than it's gaining, meaning the jurisdiction is set to miss its 2030 population target of 300,000 people. Mr De Silva said that's because people don't see opportunities or a future in the NT and aren't willing to pay the high housing costs, driving down demand. \"It's why migrants come, they get their permanent residency or they finish their education and they move elsewhere,\" he said. \"Most mums and dads who have young children want to educate their children elsewhere. \"They don't see a pathway for them to grow. \"All these things need to be addressed for us to be also running the race with other capital cities, to ensure investors and landlords see a capital benefit.\" 'Bold plans' and building boosts This month the Country Liberal Party announced it would provide first home buyers up to $50,000 to help build a new home, and $30,000 to new Territorians to build a home to live in, if elected into power at the August election. \"This is a bold plan that will help boost our population, retain skilled workers and stimulate construction,\" CLP leader Lia Finocchiaro said. NT Chief Minister Eva Lawler said first home buyers in the territory have access to $10,000 stamp duty relief, and that up to 100 new homes would be built over the next five years under her government, with $50 million invested in building more affordable homes.",

        "content": "STEPHEN A. Smith had a response for Shannon Sharpe after the latter's comments about Kyrie Irving during First Take. The ESPN stars gave their approval of the Dallas Mavericks star Irving's recent play on Monday's edition of First Take . The Mavs hold a 3-0 series lead over the Minnesota Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals. And Irving has been a tremendous superstar sidekick alongside superstar Luka Doncic in the series, averaging 27.6 points per contest. Stephen A. Smith and Shannon Sharpe were at ESPN's Los Angeles studios as they spoke about Irving. Sharpe shared what Irving has impressed him the most. \"What I love most about Kyrie is the maturity and the growth which he's shown,\" the NFL icon said. The 55-year-old Sharpe was seemingly referencing Irving and his past numerous public and private outbursts with his past teams which include feuding with Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai. Smith agreed with Sharpe, saying, \"This is what we've been asking for\" from Irving. Sharpe continued, revealing his belief that Irving has been a mentor for Luka like LeBron attempted to do for the point guard when both were with the Cleveland Cavaliers . Stephen A. then gave a take of his own. \"I'll take it one step further,\" he said. \"What he was expected to do in Boston ... in Brooklyn ... he is now doing in Dallas.\" Smith referenced Irving's tenures with the Nets as well as the Boston Celtics . Despite making the All-Star team four times in the six years combined with the Nets and Celtics, Irving didn't go far in the playoffs with either team. Irving also shot just 38 percent from the field in his lone postseason appearance with Boston. Fast forward to 2024 and Irving has a chance to reach the NBA Finals for the first time since his days with the Cavaliers. He won a title alongside LeBron with the Cavaliers in the 2015-16 season. The guard duo of Irving and Doncic have been a match made in heaven as both combined for 66 points in Game 3 of the Mavericks' win over the Timberwolves. Dallas needs just one more win to reach the NBA Finals which begin on June 6. Irving has the chance to play his former team, the Celtics, in the championship . Boston has a 3-0 lead over the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.",

        "content": "BY DUDLEY E. DAWSON FAYETTEVILLE – For the sixth time in seven years, Arkansas will be hosting a NCAA Baseball Tournament Regional, but it is not something that Razorback head coach Dave Van Horn is taking for granted. “Yeah, super excited to be hosting another regional,” Van Horn said. “It’s not easy. It’s like I told the team, there’s 250-260 teams that aren’t playing anymore. And it’s hard to get in. “There were a lot of really good teams that were on the bubble this year. It’s a long grind, the whole season. And for the most part we’ve maneuvered it pretty well. “But we’re really excited for the postseason and we’re even more happy that we get to stay here and play it in front of our fans who have been incredible for us this year.” Fayetteville Regional top seed and No. 5 national seed Arkansas (43-14) will play regional fourth seed and Ohio Valley Conference champion Southeastern Missouri State (34-25) Friday at 2 p.m. The other Friday match up will have second-seed Louisiana Tech (45-17) and third-seeded Kansas State (32-24) facing off at 7 p.m. The two winners will play Saturday at 8 p.m after the two losers play at 2 p.m. The Fayetteville Regional is paired up with the Charlottesville one hosted by No. 12 overall seed and regional top seed Virginia and also includes SEC power Mississippi State, St. John’s and Pennsylvania. Van Horn was obviously happy to be a top eight national seed, which allows you to also host a best two-of-three Super Regional if you advance out of the regional. That would also mean playing at home until the College World Series if you can continue to win. “Just it’s great being a top 8,” Van Horn said. “It doesn’t matter 1 or 8 to me, or anywhere in between. So, excited about that. “Our regional is a true regional with Louisiana Tech about four or five hours away. SEMO probably five hours away, something like that. I just feel like ... And K-State, same thing. Probably 5 and a half maybe. “Should be really good crowds. I would think the other teams would be able to bring a lot of fans. You just think that anyway. But I don’t know, you never know what’s going to happen this time of the year, who’s hot or who’s not. Who’s hurt, who’s not? Who’s sick, who’s not? Been on both sides of it. So just excited to be back playing here.” Arkansas was one of a record-setting 11 SEC teams to make the 64-team NCAA Tournament, which was announced Monday morning on ESPN2. The top three national seeds, four of the top five and five of the top seven were all from the SEC – No. 1 Tennessee, No. 2 Kentucky and No. 3 Texas A&M – while ACC power North Carolina was No. 4 and Arkansas No. 5, Clemson No. 6, Georgia No. 7 and Florida State No. 8. “So if you get through this league, you’re definitely battle-tested,” Van Horn said. “You go out and you play in a regional, you’ve got a really good shot to get to the final day, so-to-speak, the championship game, whether you’ve got to win a couple or one. “Just because you’ve played such good competition, you’re not going to be shocked or anything by how good somebody is, I don’t feel like, because you’ve probably already seen it. That’s just the way the SEC is now. We kind of kid around, big-boy baseball.” Arkansas has lost its last three games, four of five and 7 of 10, with 8 of its 11 game being on the road. Van Horn knows his team is ready to play at home, where it is 33-3 this season, including a school-record tying 27 victories in a row. “We didn’t play terrible, didn’t play great,” Van. Born said. “Just played good teams. It was a neutral site. It was frustrating losing because we lost four of five games on the road trip and we’re not used to losing, doesn’t sit well with us obviously but the players don’t like losing either. “It’s not like, ‘Oh well, we lost, whatever.’ They’re like the coaches, they take it personal and we’re looking forward to getting back. I don’t think the way we played in the tournament will make us play worse in the regional, if anything we should play a little better. “Little more motivated, better rested going into this thing. If we play good, great. Hopefully we win. If we don’t, it’s probably because the other teams are really good.” As the host, Arkansas had the chance to play either a day game or night game on Friday, but Van Horn thinks playing the afternoon one is the right move for the team, alebit maybe not as much for the fans. “Really experienced with both,” Van Horn said. “Having to deal with the weather if you’re the second game and the first game gets played, and the second game gets delayed or rained out, then having to play super early in the morning and for sure going to play two the next day somehow, some way if possible. “You know, just talking to other coaches in the past about the way they do it, it used to be they’d tell me, ‘Yeah, they made us play at night.’ Until there was an issue with the weather and then they figured out it might be better to play early. “It cuts into our crowd, or it makes it harder for the fans to get here for a 1 o’clock game or 2, whatever your scheduled that day, because that’s usually what they are. We understand that, but as far as for the team, just getting up, going through routine and playing and if there is weather, you have more time to fight it throughout the day.” Arkansas has one of the best – if not the best – college pitchers in ace Hagen Smith (9-1, 1.48), who is 24-5 in his Razorback career with a school-record 353 strikeouts with 154 this season. Smith’s only loss was in the SEC Tournament after giving up two runs while the TV broadcasters were talking about his velocity being down. Van Horn said that was simply not the case. “They’re wrong,” Van Horn said. “They were watching the scoreboard, which was at least four miles an hour slow and some times five. “So we’re seeing it on TV, if you watching a game like recently, and you seeing 93, 94, they are seeing 89, 90. So they are sitting there in that booth and seeing the scoreboard and they were wrong. Hagen’s velocity was still way up there as was what you were watching on TV. “You weren’t watching that goofy scoreboard and it was really messed up – easily four miles an hour slow. Because I had said something about it in game one to one of the coaches and (pitching) Coach (Matt) Hobbs said ‘yeah, that thing is four to five miles an hour slow, all the scouts are getting a correct time on their radar guns. “That is kind of disappointing that these guys would say that to a national TV audience with not having the facts. He’s fine.” Van Horn was not ready to at least publicly state who he will start in opening game. “See who’s feeling really good, actually,” Van Horn said. “And obviously look at the team we play and their lineup and how they do against rights or lefts, if you have that option. “If we had a set rotation — because it’s been a little bit jumbled the last few weeks — it might make it a little easier. We’ll just look at all those things. Right now we’re just kind of diving into scouting reports and trying to watch some video and just make a good decision. Our goal is ... We’ve got to win at least three in this thing.” Photo by John D. James",

A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than June 28, 2024 . A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources or any meaningful peer recognition.

Rosen Law Firm has achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company.

The City of Winnipeg has officially announced the beginning of its annual road construction season. It said there is $138.3 million in the budget for repairing 150 lane kilometres of local and regional streets, and active transportation infrastructure like new bike lanes. It said another $7.2 million will be used solely for new active transportation infrastructure. All projects have been tendered and will start very soon if they haven’t already, the city said. “I thank residents for their patience and cooperation during construction season,” Winnipeg Mayor Scott Gillingham said. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “Some of the key projects included this year will be work on the St. Vital bridge — that work continues with $13 million this year — rehabilitation of the Pembina Highway bridges over the La Salle River, and the construction of a new bridge on Creek Bend Road over the Seine River.” Story continues below advertisement Several major routes, including Inkster Boulevard, Abinojii Mikanah, Grant Avenue, McGregor Street and Dugald Road, will also be under construction. “As construction picks up, we encourage drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians alike to check our lane closures app and plan ahead for any required detours. Residents can also download and use Waze to find the fastest route,” the city said.

        "description": "His time on CNN is just one out of many viral Cam’ron interview moments. The post Cam’ron’s Wildest Interview Moments appeared first on HotNewHipHop.",
        "content": "Cam'Ron has been a force in East Coast Hip Hop since the early 90s. The founder's career spans both TV and music, with his third studio album, , featuring the iconic singles \"Oh Boy\" and \"Hey Ma.\" However, Cam'Ron seems to have a secret extra talent: making interviews go viral. The Harlem legend has left quite a few interviewers dumbstruck over the years, and he’s recently done so again. In a now-viral on , Cam’ron visibly drank a jar of his sexual enhancer, Pink Horse Power, and shared that would be going to get “some cheeks” after the interview. There have been other times when Cam’ron has been at the center of a wild interview, and the following seven are worthy of note. On the carpet for the 2003 Source Hip Hop Music Awards, Cam'ron and the rest of Dipset were left a bit dumbfounded. During an interview on the red carpet, a young interviewer named Andy held a fake petition for Cam’ron to sign. The petition, titled “B*itches are people too,” was as a result of the “negative music about females.” Not one to be pranked, Cam'Ron held his face straight and asked no questions as he reached for the petition and added his signature. Andy then promised to frame Cam'ron's signature. In 2003, Bill O'Reilly, the conservative firebrand, faced off against Cam'ron, during an interview on \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" The topic was: the impact of rap lyrics and other elements of Hip Hop culture on young people. O'Reilly, with his characteristic intensity, grilled Cam'ron and Damon Dash about their responsibility towards the content they produced. A third guest on the show was Principal Salome Thomas-El, who was also there to argue how the new Hip Hop was bad for children. It didn't take long for things to start going sideways. During the interview, O'Reilly began asking Cam'ron pointedly rude questions about his music and lifestyle. These questions were fielded by Dash for a while. However, in a hilarious turn, Cam'Ron, cool and collected, responded. He looked at O'Reilly with a smirk, and mockingly laughed, saying: “You maaad...I got dirt on you, doggy!\" The host, taken aback by Cam'Ron flipping the script, attempted to regain control. But Cam'ron's composure remained unshaken. Dash would also try to return the interview back on track by talking about artistic freedom and questioning the framing of O'Reilly's arguments. However, it was too late, and the interview was awkwardly wrapped up after a few minutes. Cam’ron had left the entire interview astonished. On October 23, 2005, Cam'ron, on his way from a D.C. nightclub, had his blue Lamborghini showered with gunfire during an attempted carjacking near Howard University. Cam'ron was shot once in the arm. In a subsequent news interview after his discharge, Cam'ron, with a rolled blunt in hand, recounted the ordeal to the press. With a curious mix of humor and nonchalance, he said, \"I felt disrespected 'cause nobody's gonna take a quarter million dollar car from me. Let alone a five cent piece of chewing gum.” He also used the opportunity for a quick promotion: “I got shot three times and my album comes out November 22.” Cam'Ron also boldly told the press he would not be cooperating with the police. “I won't just give up anything to anybody because they're waving a gun around,” he said. Moreover, when asked if the attack was related to his career, Cam'ron showed more of his trademark humor. He insinuated that the robbers just didn't like that he was successful. \"It's nothing. I'm all right. It's just a flesh wound,” he said. “It's just one of those things that happen when you live that kind of life.” On April 19, 2007, Cam'ron met up with Anderson Cooper for an interview on CBS's . During this meeting, the rapper made some of his most controversial statements till date. Cam'ron explained to Cooper, how \"There's never a reason to help the police,\" when Cooper questioned his “No Snitching” creed. Then, when asked if there were exceptions to the rule, such as a serial killer neighbor, Cam'ron continued by saying that even if he had a serial killer neighbor, he would not report them to the authorities. Instead, he would simply just move away to another neighborhood. Furthermore, he shared that there would always be repercussions if he ever broke this code. He mentioned the carjacking from 2005, and why he chose not to report. According to him, any form of cooperation with the police would have cost him his “street cred.” Additionally, he would become a target. \"Where I come from,” he said. “Once word gets out that you've cooperated with the police, that only makes you a bigger target of criminal violence.” The backlash to the interview was immediate and intense. Cam'ron's comments were met with criticism from various quarters, including those who had suffered personal tragedies or worked in law enforcement. Recognizing the impact of his words, Cam'ron issued an apology on April 26, 2007. He clarified that his comments were a reflection of his frustration with his circumstances, and not intended to be harmful. On February 1, 2007, on on Hot 97 Cam’ron made yet another iconic interview appearance. was the guest on the show, promoting his third studio album . He was taking calls when Cam'ron and Koch Records’ GM Alan Grunblatt dialed in. The conversation took a sharp turn when 50 Cent called Koch Records a \"graveyard\" for artists. Cam'ron, defending his label and artists, challenged 50 Cent's comments, leading to a back-and-forth over record sales and industry clout. The Harlem rapper questioned the success of artists, compared to those under Koch. The back-and-forth then escalated as Cam'ron began to repeatedly taunt 50 Cent with his now-iconic jeer, \"Curtisss! Curtiss! How much did the mob sell Curtiss?!\" Angie Martinez, found herself in the middle of the confrontation and tried to mediate to no avail. As tensions rose, she was forced to cut the call short. Despite the abrupt end to the on-air argument however, the feud continued off the air for some time. Nine years later, on August 9, 2016, 50 Cent and Cam'ron publicly ended their feud, sharing photos on Instagram and seemingly sharing a laugh together. In a candid episode of , aired on April 3, 2021, Cam'ron shared the bewildering story of his neighbor, a woman now known to the world as 29C. Although he had shared a few clips on his Instagram before the interview, Cam'ron recounted to N.O.R.E how his simple interaction with 29C spiraled into bizarre territory. It began with the neighbor filming him from her terrace and escalated after a personal encounter. She allegedly also sent a direct message to Cam'ron stating what she actually wanted from him: “to have my Black babies,\" a request he would consider. After their hookup, the stalking situation allegedly took a turn for the worse. The neighbor's behavior became obsessive, prompting Cam'ron to record the incidents and post on his Instagram, \"just in case shit go left,\" as he put it. Despite the tension, Cam'ron mentioned that he and 29C were on good terms at the time of the interview. The incident, while unsettling, was also leveraged by Cam'ron as a marketing opportunity for his product, Pink Horsepower. Three years later, in a CNN interview, Pink Horsepower made a grand appearance. Cam'ron's interview with s Abby Phillip ended with a bag of mixed reactions and raised eyebrows. The interview, which occurred on May 21, was intended to discuss a recent graphic video involving assaulting his ex-girlfriend, Ventura. Things quickly veered off course after Cam'Ron got a series of leading questions from Phillip. Specifically, she asked if Cam'Ron “recognized” Diddy's aggressive behavior. This, and a few other questions made . “I don’t know him like that, what do you mean did I recognize him?” he asked. “I’ve seen him. What you mean my experiences?” As the interview continued, Cam'ron took a moment to chug his sex enhancement product, Pink Horsepower. After that, he made a crude remark about his plans after the show. \"Sorry, I’m gonna get some cheeks after this HorsePower joint.” He then directed a question off camera: \"Who booked me for this joint?\" he asked, visibly irritated by the direction of the conversation. “You think I be sitting watching what Diddy do all this? I didn’t know this was a Diddy joint that y’all invited me to.” The segment was abruptly concluded and Phillip thanked him for appearing, and Cam'ron responded with a curt \"thank you\" before reiterating his earlier question about who booked him for the interview. He would later confirm on his podcast that he was intentionally uncooperative with the interviewer: \"You call me on CNN for the bullsh*t, I’m gonna give you the bullsh*t.”",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal has pledged to carry on playing as long as he is enjoying his tennis , despite a first-round exit at Roland Garros at the slam he made his own, but strongly hinted he will not be playing at Wimbledon this year. Nadal said the rigours of switching to grass for the London showpiece, then reverting to clay for the Paris Olympics, would probably be too demanding given his age and recent injury issues. WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Rafael Nadal makes sad exit from the French Open. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today The 22-time grand slam champion lost in straight sets to No.4 Alexander Zverev on Monday — but showed enough flashes of brilliance to suggest he would have beaten most opponents. It was the Spaniard’s fourth defeat in 116 matches at the French Open. In a sign of just how beloved he is, the occasion drew other players — world No.1 stars Novak Djokovic and Iga Swiatek as well as his Spanish successor Carlos Alcaraz among them — to watch the match in person. Nadal’s family, including his wife Xisca and their young son, were also on hand. “The feelings I have are difficult to describe in words. It is difficult for me to talk. Honestly I don’t know if it will be the last time before you all,” the 14-time champion said. “It is a big percentage I will not be back, but the body is feeling a bit better and I having fun. Maybe in two months I will say enough (and retire), but I hope to be back on this court in two months for the Olympics. That motivates me.” Having only recently returned from a near 18-month absence that has encouraged him to keep going — and to target more gold. Nadal won singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and doubles gold at Rio 2016. That this year’s tennis tournament will be on his favourite court, where he won 14 French Open singles titles, has further tempted him. However, that does mean Wimbledon, where he won in 2008 and 2010, is likely to be sacrificed. He has only competed in SW19 once in the last four years — in 2022 when he had to withdraw through injury ahead of his semi-final with Nick Kyrgios. “It looks difficult, honestly, to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,” said Nadal. “I’m booked in Wimbledon because I had to, (but) I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now. “I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay.” Nadal, 38 next week, missed most of 2023 with a hip problem and this year’s comeback was hampered by a muscle tear, then a series of minor issues affected his Paris preparation. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,” Nadal added. “I’ve been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I’ll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. “Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what’s the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. My main goal now is to play the Olympics.” Longer term, sounding much like his old friend and rival Andy Murray who also lost in the first round in Paris, he said he wanted to carry on playing while he was healthy and having fun. And even in defeat on the clay where he had so rarely lost before, he had fun. “If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself,” Nadal said.",

        "content": "Memorial Day is a day to honor the fallen and older men and women seem to dominate the makeup of those who attend Memorial Day ceremonies. But it did Richton Park Retired Chief Petty Officer Robert J. Welch’s heart good to see the Principe family of Mercy, 9, Levi, 7, Lukas, 5, Joy, 4, and Hudson, 1, sitting in the front row Monday. Welch spoke at the 2024 Memorial Day Ceremony at General Patrick E. Rea Veterans Plaza in Tinley Park with the children listening to what he had to say. Welch, a heavily decorated veteran who serves with many veterans groups and is a engineering equipment manager with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, said younger people need to be involved and understand the meaning of Memorial Day. “Memorial Day is not just another holiday,” Welch said. “We need to pass along our knowledge to the next generation so that they may do the same. We must ensure that the youth of tomorrow understands the true cost of freedom.” Aside from the Principe family of Tinley Park, there was a smattering of youth among the several hundred in attendance. But there were also a pair of young essay winners who shared their wisdom. Emma Dix of Cardinal Joseph Bernardin School in Orland Hills, read from her Patriots Pen essay, that centered on the pride she feels living in the United States thanks to those who fought and died for the country. “Our great country, America, inspires me because of its freedom, rich history, natural beauty and people who make up this wonderful nation that I call my home” she said. “As I get older, I obtain great responsibilities that are my duties as a citizen to fulfill.” Richton Park’s Robert Welch, a much-decorated veteran, was the main speaker May 27, 2024, at the Tinley Park Memorial Day Ceremony. (Jeff Vorva/for Daily Southtown) Dix said she is looking forward to the day when she can vote and have a say in the world that is around her. “In some countries, people don’t have these liberties,” Dix said. Tinley Park High School junior Benjamin James also hit hard on the right to vote in his Voice of Democracy essay. James is involved with tennis, golf, mathletes, scholastic bowl, chess, the National Honor Society, the marching band, the symphonic band and jazz band. He also runs a lawn care business and is a lifeguard. “The right to vote for elected officials is the foundation of American democracy and is considered one of the most essential attributes of the United States political system,” he said. “Since the establishment of the United States of America, the right to vote of elected officials has been very prevalent.” Sofia Barrios, of St. George School, also was a Patriots Pen essay winner but couldn’t attend the ceremony. Fred Cagle, the commander of the Veterans of Foreign War Post 2791, salutes during a playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the Monday’s Memorial Day Ceremony in Tinley Park. (Jeff Vorva/for Daily Southtown) The ceremony also featured comments from Veteran Commission Chairman William Douglas Rasmussen III and Tinley Park Mayor Michael Glotz. There was a battlefield cross ceremony, a flag ceremony, the playing of taps, the presentation of a wreath in memory of all fallen veterans and music provided by the Tinley Park Community Bank. Mandy Barry sang the “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The 2024 veteran banner honorees were named. They will have their photos on light posts in the community. They are Daniel Bachara, Louis Bachara, James Black, Michael Bubacz, Kevin Clarke, John Domina, Thomas Dukes, Eddie Durham, Savio Gonsalves, Timothy Keating and Kryi Kirk. Also honored were Peter Laurinaltis, Robert Allen McAllister, Richard Miller, Gerald Nichols, Edward James Novak, Gerald Petrow, W. Douglas Rasmussen III, Anthony Sorrentino, Edward Stolinski, John Turas and John Wegrzyn. Welch emphasized that those who lost their lives should never be forgotten. “Generation after generation has been fortunate enough to reap the benefits paid for by those who believe that freedom is worth fighting for and, if necessary, dying for,” he said. Hudson Principe, 1, of Tinley Park waves his flag at Monday’s Tinley Park Memorial Day Ceremony. (Jeff Vorva/for Daily Southtown) “In cemeteries across American and around the world today, people will pause to spread flowers on the graves of those lost in war. But today should not be about sorrow.” He said what it should be about is a phrase Gen. George Patton used in 1944, when he said that “We should thank God that such men lived.” “That is what this very special day is all about, being thankful that such brave men and women have lived,” Welch said.",

        "content": "JEOPARDY! fans have been driven crazy by Grant DeYoung's way of answering questions. Jeopardy! viewers claimed that fan-favorite contestant Matt Amodio is guilty of responding to clues the same way. On Saturday, the Jeopardy! Instagram page posted a montage of clips showcasing Grant competing on the game show , captioned, \"And just like that, he’s a 4-day #Jeopardy ! champion.\" The grocery clerk from Prescott, Arizona was shown prefacing his responses to clues by saying \"What's\" instead of the standard \"What is.\" In the comment section, one person wrote, \"The 'what’s X' for answers about people drove me nuts!! why can’t you say 'who is X' aaaahhhh. The fan gave Grant some credit as they added, \"He has an excellent vibe tho.\" A second commenter replied, \"Another player did that and I believe he said it made it easier for him not having to think of who/what, etc.\" \"I think it was Matt Amodio,\" offered a third. \"Oh I forgot he did that! But Grant always answers with « what’s X? » too!\" replied a fourth fan while a fifth stated, \"I totally understand the strategy behind it!!\" Elsewhere in the comment thread, fans showered Grant with compliments, with one person writing, \"He was so much fun. Wish he would have made it to 5days.\" \"Really enjoyed watching this young man!!!\" added another. During his 4-day streak, Grant used a chair while competing causing viewers to stand up and notice. However, the request to sit while competing has been granted before, and Jeopardy! producers stressed there is nothing against asking for a seat. Grant won four contests and took home $81,203. He also had fans clamoring about how he competed sitting in a chair instead of standing. Grant sat in a black swivel chair with silver armrests and full back support, adjusted to the same height as his standing opponents. After noticing questions from curious fans, Grant took it upon himself to share why he was sitting on Reddit. He explained that he suffers from arthritis and producers gave him a chair so he could play at his best . \"They give it if you ask,\" he wrote. \"I have some back arthritis that makes standing still for that long very difficult.\" And he's not the first one to request an accommodation due to injury or disability. \"I wouldn't expect everyone who sits for Jeopardy! to disclose their reason for needing one, but I don't mind saying mine,\" Grant added. While contestants typically stand throughout the game show, fans might recall 2024 Tournament of Champions finalist Troy Meyer sitting for his games. It's a rarely-used accommodation, but Jeopardy! bosses have previously explained that the choice is given to everyone . \"We would never make people stand, and you'll see in the coming weeks that we had a contestant who did choose to sit,\" the higher-ups explained. Referring to Troy, they said, \"After their performance, they felt like that may be a better opportunity for them. \"We are not saying no you have to stand and play, we want you to play at your very best. \"Sitting down is absolutely an option.\" Producer Sarah Whitcomb Foss reiterated that philosophy when she addressed the situation on the Inside Jeopardy! podcast. \"This is something that we always offer to contestants,\" Sarah shared. \"Please know that any contestant is given the opportunity to have a chair at any point.\" \"We don’t ask why; it’s not our business,\" she added. \"If you want a chair, we’ll give it to you.\" One of the show's all-time champs, Amy Schneider , recently took advantage of the chair offer during the Jeopardy! Masters tournament. The 44-year-old revealed she wasn’t feeling well during the semifinals, so the producer brought out a chair. Jeopardy! first aired in 1964 until 1975. Then the nighttime version began in 1974. Since then, spinoffs of the game show have emerged. Here they all are: Jeopardy! - (primetime) 1974 to present, weekdays on ABC at 7pm.

Amy was eliminated in the semi-finals of the recently completed prime-time event. She said that while she thinks her health issues affected her performance on the game show, she said she didn’t think the other players needed to be at their peak to beat her, and that was the difference between them. Amy added that it was highly possible the other contestants also had outside circumstances affecting their play yet still played better than her. \"Whether or not my outside circumstance was the 'most' damaging is both unknowable, and irrelevant,\" she tweeted. \"I just lost, and that's ok.\" This year's Masters title went to Victoria Groce.",

        "content": "Shohei Ohtani will not pitch for the Los Angeles Dodgers this year, and there have been some questions about whether the team will want him to pitch again at all. As valuable as Ohtani’s two-way status is, the Dodgers want him healthy and hitting, after all. It is clear, however, that the Dodgers and Ohtani have no plans to hold him back from pitching. Ohtani made that obvious on Monday, as he discussed his escalating rehab efforts following his Tommy John surgery. “Just progressively increasing the distance,” Ohtani said through an interpreter Monday, via Jorge Castillo of ESPN . “Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance. Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I’m not quite sure how far I’m going to go out there, but that’s the progression.” Ohtani added that last week, he was throwing 80 mph from 60 feet away, suggesting his rehab process is going smoothly. The surgery and rehab has done nothing to detract from Ohtani’s offense. He is hitting .336 with 13 home runs so far on the season and is pacing the Dodger offense. Ohtani’s agent was very clear during free agency that the two-way star intends to pitch again once he is healthy , and it is hard to believe the Dodgers would have paid him the way they did if they were not on board with that.

        "description": "'This is a big moment for workers in this country,' said Labour Minister Seamus O'Regan",
        "content": "OTTAWA — Cheers erupted in the House of Commons on Monday after MPs of all stripes, including Conservatives, unanimously voted in favour of legislation to ban replacement workers used during strikes and lock-outs in federally regulated workplaces. Speaking after the vote, Labour Minister Seamus O’Regan said he was “very relieved, happy and delighted” that all MPs voted in favour of his bill, and said it sends a “real message” to workers across the country that “they are valued and that parliamentarians have heard them.” “This is a big moment for workers in this country. It’s a big moment for labour, and we’re thrilled that it passed unanimously,” said O’Regan. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh took the credit for the legislation going through, thanks to his party’s supply-and-confidence deal with the government. The Liberal Party had also promised to ban replacement workers as part of its election platform in 2021. “I want to be clear, this would not have happened but for New Democrats forcing the government to do this,” Singh said. The legislation will now be sent to the Senate, where it will be studied and eventually adopted. The changes will come into effect one year after the bill becomes law. The initial bill proposed 18 months to make the changes come to effect, but it was amended in committee hearings to 12 months instead. The Bloc Quebecois criticized the delays, saying the ban on replacement workers at the federal level should come into effect immediately once the bill receives royal assent. “Why wait a year before its implementation?” asked Bloc House leader Alain Therrien. “Twelve months is much too long. We’ve had this law in Quebec for the past 47 years.” Therrien however said that he hopes the Senate does not decide to amend the legislation once more, as he fears a legislative game of “ping pong” that could delay the bill even more. The Conservatives made it clear last February at second reading that they would support a ban on replacement workers as they seek to court the blue collar vote. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said in a speech last month that his party supported the legislation because “working people have the right to bargain and fight for wage increases that they need in order to keep up with the galloping inflation that has ripped them off.” Singh said he does not buy Poilievre’s new position on replacement workers, arguing that he has voted against similar legislation multiple times in the past. “When Conservatives are in power, they attack the strength of unions, they attack the strength of workers, so I have concerns ... based on facts, based on Pierre Poilievre’s record,” he said. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce has been critical of the legislation, which it said will harm the economy in federally regulated sectors like telecommunications and transportation. “Replacement workers allow organizations in rail, ports, telecom and air to sustain a basic level of ‘lights on’ continuity that preserves critical services for Canadians,” Robin Guy, vice president and deputy leader of government relations for the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, wrote in an op-ed in the Financial Post . “There are serious ramifications for all Canadians if we prohibit these workers from keeping those lights on,” he added. O’Regan pushed back on the assertion that the new legislation would harm the economy, arguing that banning replacement workers in fact speeds up the negotiation process. “You would not believe how disruptive it is ... how much time and energy that takes away from what we need their time and energy spent at, which is at the table finding solutions, providing more stability, more certainty for our economy,” he said.

        "content": "fans are all set to finally unravel the mystery surrounding . Actress Cait Fitton, who portrays the character of Lauren in the show, became a part of the Corrie team in 2022 and has since been a key player in some thrilling plotlines. Earlier this year, in her case - and viewers will soon discover the truth. Off-camera, Cait doesn't mirror her problematic character on screen and is known to love dressing up glamorous. Let's take a sneak peek into her professional journey, friendly ties on set, and hidden talents.... Cait made a name for herself with her acting skills, bagging the role in Corrie after appearances in Doctors and the children's programme Gigglebiz but she's also an accomplished vocalist. The 22 year old once treated her Instagram followers with a flawless rendition of Ben E. King's Stand By Me, reports . The talented actress who hails from Middleton, Greater Manchester, captioned her Instagram post: \"I feel beyond privileged to say my professional showreel has been filmed by @olibogroup and I am mega excited to share it with you guys!\" Music may be her passion, but it seems that a spot on the cobbles of was always Cait's ultimate ambition. She reminisced with about a childhood memory: \"The teacher asked us, 'What do you want to be when you're older?' Children were saying 'a fireman' or 'a nurse', and I said, 'I want to be in Coronation Street'. I remember all the teachers were amused, they couldn't believe it. I watched it religiously.\" She continued, sharing her adoration for the show's characters: \"I loved Gail and Becky and Kylie and I'd think, 'This is my dream'. I spent so long dreaming about it and wanted it so badly. Sometimes I'd despair and think it was never going to happen, but it just shows that if you fight and you work hard for your dreams, you can achieve.\" Cait's Instagram is a treasure trove of behind-the-scenes glimpses from the set, where she's formed close bonds with co-stars like Paddy Bever, who plays Max, and Julia Goulding, who has been a mentor figure to her. \"Everyone's just been so nice. It's been amazing. Everyone's been so kind,\" she gushed about her Corrie colleagues. Landing the role of Lauren was nothing short of a dream come true for Cait, a sentiment she expressed in an emotional Instagram post celebrating the milestone and thanking her supporters. Cait expressed her excitement by writing: \"My younger self is screaming right now! ! ! I want to say a big thank you to all the cast and crew at @coronationstreet for inviting me in with open arms and making me feel so welcome! Thank you to my amazing agent Brooke Kinsella at @intertalentactors for constantly supporting me and always pushing me to achieve.\" In an emotional tribute to her family members, she added: \"Also a massive thank you to my family and friends who have supported me throughout this process and been with me along the journey so far! I dedicate this role of achievement to my family who were huge fans of the show but unfortunately are no longer with me, but I know if they were, they'd be bursting at the seams!\"",

        "description": "Second-tier soccer club Indy Eleven has been slowed by human remains in constructing a new $1 billion stadium in Indianapolis as it hopes for an invite to the MLS",
        "content": "Construction of club Indy Eleven's new stadium, Eleven Park, was halted after on the development site. The second-tier USL side had slated $1 billion for a new stadium on a six-acre site in downtown Indianapolis, part of Indy Eleven's bid for admission into the . \"Keystone views these discoveries as an opportunity to correct past mishandlings by previous ownership and to respectfully relocate and honor what may be found,\" Eleven Park developers Keystone Group said in a statement. \"Keystone continues to work with community organizations who look to honor the memory of those who may have been buried at Greenlawn. These discussions are ongoing as the project progresses and an appropriate memorial will be included in project completion.\" In May 2023, the Indy Eleven franchise announced plans to begin construction for the 20,000-seat stadium, a mixed-use development that also included 600 apartments and around 200,000 square feet respectively for both office and retail space. This 10-figure investment all came with the goal of attracting the Major League franchise to Indianapolis, which had previously lacked consideration due to an adequate soccer-specific stadium. \"That’s why we worked over 10 years to buy a franchise, build a team, get fans to the stands, show the support to Indiana, get our vision to the statehouse and then get their support to Eleven Park,\" Ersal Ozdemir, the founder of Keystone Group, told . \"We’ve kind of been doing the process for the whole time to get to a place MLS will consider Indianapolis.\" However, the first snag in this development came in December of 2023, when an initial instance of human remains was discovered on the site. Updated estimates from the city now estimate that hundreds of remains are projected to lie within the site. These unsettling roadblocks are explained by the Greenlawn Cemetary, Indianapolis' first cemetery, which opened in 1821. Concerns regarding tomb raiding and flooding from the nearby White River quickly arose, however, and the cemetery was closed to new burials in 1890 and abandoned 40 years later. Both the city and Indy Eleven supporter groups have expressed concern about the well-being of these remains. \"As we have learned more about the site, the city has sought to take an active role in an effort to right the wrongs committed more than a century ago when the resting place of Indianapolis’ first residents were erased from the map and paved over,\" chief of staff to the Indianapols mayor Dan Parker wrote in a letter obtained by . \"Knowing what we know now, any proposed future development ought to follow a painstaking and inclusive community conversation on the different perspectives about how to respect the history of the site and the individuals still laid to rest there.\" Mike Slocum, treasurer of supporter group Brickyard Battalion, has also said: \"Take care of our people. How would you want to be taken care of when you are gone?\"",

Simon Cowell The successful music executive originally started as a judge in the British singing competition show Pop Idol, which inspired the hit spin-off American Idol, where Cowell judged from 2002-2010. Cowell also created both the British and American versions of The X Factor, where he is credited for helping launch the careers of One Direction and Fifth Harmony. Cowell has been judging on AGT since 2016, and also serves as an executive producer. That year, he spoke to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution about what inspired the show. ‘I came up with the idea of the show 12 years ago. One day in my kitchen watching another talent show, some girl was singing so badly, I actually thought to myself, 'I'd rather watch dogs dancing!'” he said. “Looking back all those years ago, it was just a fun idea. It was very difficult to sell. But we were fortunate someone at NBC bought into it. America was the first country to go for it. Now it's all over the world,’ he added. Sofia Vergara Originally from Columbia, Vergara got her big break playing Gloria on ABC’s Modern Family. She has been judging on AGT since 2020, \"It was, kind of, strange for me to start a new job. Because, it was something I was not used to at all,\" Vergara told E! News about her first season. \"But, the moment I got there everybody was so nice to me. Everybody, you know, I loved being there. I enjoyed being there. So, it was easy.\" Heidi Klum The German model has been an AGT judge since 2013, where she stayed until 2018. After a brief hiatus, she re-joined the show in 2020 for season 15. “I love being back. It’s a family affair and I am very honored to be back on AGT,” Klum told Hollywoodlife of her return. Howie Mandel The Canadian comedian joined AGT as a judge all the way back in 2009. He also famously hosted NBC’s Deal or No Deal from 2005-2019. “I don’t feel like I show up at work; I feel like I’m sitting on the couch with a bunch of my friends, just saying what I think,” Mandel told NBC Insider of his experience as a judge. “And that comfort allows me just to be honest and real.” Terry Crews (Host) Crews joined AGT as host in 2019, replacing Tyra Banks. Starting his career in the NFL, he transferred to the acting universe. His most famous roles include White Chicks, Everybody Hates Chris, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.",

        "content": "Tyrese Haliburton is dealing with a hamstring injury. He missed the Indiana Pacers' 114-111 loss to the Boston Celtics on Saturday. The Pacers are trailing their Eastern Conference finals series 3-0. If they lose on Monday, Boston will progress to the NBA Finals, having swept Rick Carlisle's team. According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Haliburton is unlikely to suit up for Game 4. The Pacers want to be cautious with their star player to avoid worsening his current injury. Reporting on Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton on NBA Today ahead of Game 4 pic.twitter.com/jmj2xwxp76 Haliburton's shiftiness, scoring and playmaking make him a tough matchup for the Celtics' perimeter defense. He opens up the floor for his teammates and is a big part of how the Pacers like to push the tempo and control the game. Without Haliburton in the rotation, a significant workload falls on Andrew Nembhard's shoulders. Nevertheless, the Pacers need to keep things in perspective. Nobody expected them to make the conference finals. It makes no sense to risk their star players' long-term health when they're already down by three games. Allowing Haliburton the time to continue recovering is what's best for the future of the team. After all, if he makes his injury worse, he may miss out on traveling with Team USA to the Paris Olympics. He will likely develop while in Paris due to the increased level of competition from his teammates. Boston will be looking to close out its series with a sweep. However, if the Pacers can force a Game 5, Haliburton could potentially return to the rotation. Still, at this point, with the series all but lost, it may be better to shut him down for the remainder of the season and let him fully recover ahead of a busy summer.",

In the end, however, many were reduced to tears as the 14-time champion slumped to a straight-sets defeat to Alexander Zverev in the first round, likely signalling the end of the 38-year-old’s Grand Slam adventure in Paris. “Personally, I’m very sad, he’s Rafa, a legend,” Mateo Castro, a 41-year-old French fan, told AFP with tears in his eyes. “It’s hard to see him go.” Michael Lundell, another Nadal fan who had travelled from Genoa to Paris to watch the match, was also in tears. “I was crying, because I don’t think there has ever been another role model like him before in sports,” said the 43-year-old. “It was a great match, I saw Rafael Nadal with an exceptional level again,” said Gregory Dubus, a 50-year-old French fan. “I’ve been following Nadal since 2005, his first victory here at Roland Garros, and to see him here, maybe in his last match was exciting.” Like many fans at Roland Garros on May 27, there was a feeling that they were witnessing the end of an era. “A player like Rafa, you never want him to retire, he’s a humble player, with an exceptional attitude on the court and in life, nobody wants him to stop,” added Dubus. Before the start of the match, fans had hailed a player dubbed a “superhero”. “You always have to keep the faith in Rafa, he will win,” Hazel, a 28-year-old fan who had flown in from China for a second straight year after being left disappointed when Nadal withdrew in 2023, told AFP. “The most important thing is that he stays healthy,” she said, as she proudly showed the banners she had made with the colours of Spain, Nadal’s face and the message “Welcome back my super hero”. Before Wednesday, Nadal had only lost three times in 115 matches at the tournament since his title-winning debut as a 19-year-old in 2005. He said at the weekend that there was a chance this may be his last French Open but insisted he was still keeping the door “100 per cent open” on continuing his career. “You see a lot of ‘Thank you Rafa’ shirts. He’s a monument at this tournament,” said 41-year-old Manolo who has come to Europe from the United States to watch Nadal and then Real Madrid play in the Champions League final in London this Saturday. He has seen Nadal win at Wimbledon and the US Open as well as Paris but admitted May 27’s clash with world number four Zverev “would be very difficult”. “I hope he beats Zverev... Rafa is Rafa,” he said. “It’s possibly the last time he plays here, so we’re very happy to watch him,” said Alsi, a 40-year-old fan living in Australia. AFP",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. “I hope to see you again, but I don't know,” Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after his straight-sets loss on Monday. “There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.” It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Spain's Nadal stuck to his routine, avoiding the lines and crossing them with his right foot, sprinting to the baseline during warm-up and positioning his two bottles diagonally aimed at the court. On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no-one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. As soon as Zverev eased the pressure, however, Nadal converted his first break point to take a 3-2 lead in the second set. “Rafa! Rafa!” went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semifinal match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. There was a sense of anticipation on the morning of the Nadal v Zverev clash as Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title here, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in Paris after her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the US Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris. In the men's draw, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics.

        "content": "A rocket launched by North Korea to deploy the country's second spy satellite exploded shortly after liftoff Monday, state media reported, in a setback for leader Kim Jong Un's hopes to field satellites to monitor the U.S. and South Korea. Monday’s failed launch came hours after leaders of South Korea, China and Japan met in Seoul in their first trilateral meeting in more than four years. It’s highly unusual for North Korea to take provocative action when China, its major ally and economic pipeline, is engaging in high-level diplomacy in the region. The launch drew rebukes from the North’s neighbors because the U.N. bans North Korea from conducting any such launches, viewing them as covers for testing long-range missile technology. The North’s official Korean Central News Agency said it launched a spy satellite aboard a new rocket at its main northwestern space center. But KCNA said the rocket blew up during a first-stage flight soon after liftoff due to a suspected engine problem. KCNA cited the unidentified vice director of the National Aerospace Technology Administration as saying that a preliminary examination showed that the explosion was related to the reliability of operation of the newly developed liquid oxygen-petroleum engine. He said other possible causes will be investigated, according to KCNA. Japan's government briefly issued a missile warning for the southern prefecture of Okinawa, urging residents to take shelter inside buildings and other safer places. The warning was lifted later because the region was no longer in danger, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said. Earlier Monday, North Korea had notified Japan’s coast guard about its plans to launch “a satellite rocket,” with a warning to exercise caution in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and China and east of the main Philippine island of Luzon during a launch window from Monday through June 3. Asia North Korea has steadfastly maintained it has the right to launch satellites and test missiles. Japanese Defense Minister Minoru Kihara called the North’s launch “a serious challenge to the entire world.” South Korea’s Unification Ministry called a satellite launch by the North “a provocation that seriously threatens our and regional security.” During the trilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Chinese Premier Li Qiang earlier Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for stern international action if North Korea went ahead with its launch plan. Kishida, for his part, urged the North to withdraw its launch plan, but Li didn’t mention the launch plan as he offered general comments about promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula through a political resolution. Some observers say that North Korea's satellite launch on the first day of its eight-day window might have been aimed at casting a chill over the Seoul-Beijing-Tokyo meeting and registering its displeasure with China. Kim Jong Un has been embracing the idea of a “new Cold War” and seeking to boost ties with Beijing and Moscow to forge a united front against Washington, so China's diplomacy with Seoul and Tokyo might have been a disturbing development for Pyongyang. Kim’s primary focus in recent months has been on Russia, as Pyongyang and Moscow — both locked in confrontations with Washington — expand their military cooperation. China, which is much more sensitive about its international reputation, has joined Russia in blocking U.S.-led efforts at the U.N. Security Council to tighten sanctions on the North but has been less bold and open about supporting Kim's “new Cold War” drive. North Korea's Foreign Ministry on Monday strongly criticized a joint statement issued by Li, Yoon and Kishida, calling them \"wanton interference in its internal affairs.” The ministry took issue with parts of the joint statement that said the three leaders re-emphasized their existing positions on the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. While North Korea focused much of its criticism on South Korea for allegedly being chiefly responsible for the statement, it's still extremely rare for North Korea to slam a statement signed by China. The failed satellite launch is a blow to Kim's plan to launch three more military spy satellites in 2024 in addition to his country's first military reconnaissance satellite that was placed in orbit last November. The November launch followed two failed liftoffs. In the first attempt, the North Korean rocket carrying the satellite crashed into the ocean soon after liftoff. After the second attempt, North Korea said there was an error in the emergency blasting system during the third-stage flight. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday it detected a launch trajectory believed to be of a spy satellite fired from the North’s main space center at 10:44 p.m. on Monday. Four minutes later, many fragments were spotted in the waters, it said.",

        "description": "The Washington Post reports that the former president affirmed his support of Israel and vowed to quell the \"radical revolution\" protesting its actions",
        "content": "Donald Trump recently told a group of donors that if he wins the 2024 presidential election, he will “throw out” students who attend pro-Palestinian protests , according to the Washington Post . “One thing I do is, any student that protests, I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they’re going to behave,” Trump said, according to donors at the event, whom the Post did not name. It is unclear if he meant he would throw out all students, regardless of their nationality, or only non-U.S. citizens studying here. Over the past several months, anti-war protests have cropped up at dozens of schools and universities across the country, beginning with Columbia University in New York, where tent enclosures and campus occupations disrupted final weeks of class, canceling its graduation ceremony . Though the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, the NYPD violently cracked down on them, arresting hundreds of people in April and May. (Many of those charges were later dropped, according to the news organization The City .) During the donor event, which per the Post occurred on May 14 in New York City, Trump called the protests a “radical revolution” and commended the NYPD’s reaction to the organizers, which he said “[have] to be stopped now.” If re-elected, he promised, “we’re going to set that movement back 25 or 30 years.” This is not the first time the former president has threatened student protesters. As Rolling Stone previously reported, Trump told attendees at a campaign rally that he would not tolerate foreign students participating in demonstrations. “If you come here from another country and try to bring jihadism or anti-Americanism or antisemitism to our campuses, we will immediately deport you, you’ll be out of that school,” Trump told a crowd in Wildwood, New Jersey on May 11.

Trump Ruled Ineligible for Libertarian Nomination Meet the Drummer Who Spent Decades With David Gilmour and David Crosby — And a Day With Bowie See Bradley Cooper Join Pearl Jam to Sing 'Maybe It's Time' at BottleRock The Black Keys Cancel Upcoming North American Leg of International Players Tour According to the Washington Post, Trump joked at the private donor event that “98 percent of my Jewish friends” were present in the room, and went on to promise support for Israel in the event that he wins in November. He said he believes Israel’s actions to be a justified “war on terror” and as president he would support the country. This is also not the first time he’s expressed support for Israel in the current Gaza war. During an appearance on Fox News in March, Trump said that he was “firmly in Israel’s camp,” and said of Israel’s strikes on Gazans, “you have to finish the problem.” According to Al Jazeera , at least 36,050 Palestinians have been killed in the war so far, as have at least 1,139 people in Israel. Though the Post noted that a representative for Trump did not answer detailed questions about their reporting, they did receive an email from the campaign’s national secretary, Karoline Leavitt. “When President Trump is back in the Oval Office, Israel will once again be protected, Iran will go back to being broke, terrorists will be hunted down, and the bloodshed will end,” she wrote.",

        "content": "Forget the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker - the perfect high street for modern Brits includes vintage shops, record stores and coffee houses. Researchers asked Brits to picture their dream high street, with a deli (38 percent), florist (45 percent) and ice cream parlour (41 percent) all coming high on the list of dream establishments. Modern Brits also love the idea of vintage shops (37 percent), farm produce shops (37 percent) and record stores (37 percent), while a clean living one in three (35 percent) dream of having a health food shop close to them. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the top wish was a decent pharmacy (58 percent), while 45 percent of those surveyed said a decent local pub was a must have. According to new research by Smart Energy GB, 62 percent believe a good high street has a mixture of modern and traditional shops. One in three (34 percent) want a Chinese restaurant nearby, while 33 percent think a chocolatier would be a tasty addition. A whopping 98 percent think that the high street has changed dramatically over the last ten years, with three quarters (74 percent) claiming it has got worse and 91 percent seeing shops close. Despite this, over half (54 percent) think that a thriving high street is an important part of building a community and that local, independent enterprises help create a sense of unity (50 percent). Over half (54 percent) of the 2,000 Brits polled say they worry about the increasing pressure that small businesses are under, with nine in ten (91 percent) seeing local shops close around them. More than half (53 percent) are concerned that more will follow. Bakeries (47 percent), cafes and restaurants (41 percent) and grocer’s (39 percent) are considered most at risk of closing down. Victoria Bacon, Smart Energy GB, said: “It is heartening to see people are proactively supporting small businesses on their local high streets. We know business owners have had to work really hard, especially over the past couple of years, to manage their running costs. One small thing they can do is get a smart meter installed, which can help them track their energy use and costs over time, control costs and manage cash flow.” To help businesses increase sales, four in ten customers (39 percent) go out of their way to support small, independent local businesses, with a further 57 percent doing so whenever they can. Nine in ten (87 percent) even go so far as to say they are happy to pay more to support independent shops, actively opting to go to a small business as many as three times a week. Our love of local shops is so strong that three quarters (77 percent) are on first name terms with the people running businesses around them - with eight in ten (79 percent) claiming that they are a fully-fledged friend. It’s no wonder that 96 percent feel sad when they see stores disappear. Over half (54 percent) say they are visiting the high street less now than they did five years ago.

        "description": "LIC explores health insurance entry, considers composite licenses, and aims to boost market coverage, reporting improved FY24 results and dividend recommendations.",
        "content": "MUMBAI: State-run Life Insurance Corporation is considering entering the health insurance segment and is exploring acquisition opportunities . The move comes amid a proposal to allow composite insurance companies in the sector. \"There is an expectation that composite licences may be permitted by the new govt, and we have done some internal groundwork. While we lack expertise in general insurance, we are interested in health insurance and are also considering opportunities for inorganic growth,\" said LIC chairman Siddhartha Mohanty. In Feb 2024, a parliamentary panel had suggested introducing composite insurance licenses to reduce costs and compliance burden for insurers. Currently, life companies can only offer long-term benefit covers under health insurance. For life companies to provide hospitalisation and indemnity cover, an amendment to the Insurance Act would be required. India is a highly under-penetrated insurance market and at the end of 2022-23, less than 2.3 crore health insurance covers were issued, covering 55 crore lives. Of this nearly 30 crore were covered by govt-sponsored business, while almost 20 crore were insured through group insurance. Govt and regulator are keen that more health covers are issued and LIC's entry into the space is expected to spur that. Irdai data showed that during FY23, life insurers issued under 2.9 lakh new policies covering almost 3 lakh lives. Mohanty's remarks on Monday came while announcing LIC's financial results for FY24. LIC reported a net profit of Rs 13,762 crore for the quarter ending March 2024, slightly higher than Rs 13,427 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Profits were impacted by a provision for wage revision, and lower margins were attributed to higher group business. During the last fiscal year, the insurance behemoth reported an 11% increase in profit after tax (PAT) to Rs 40,676 crore. LIC has recommended a final dividend of Rs 6 per share for the financial year 2023-24, subject to shareholder approval. Additionally, an interim dividend of Rs 4 per share was declared and paid during the year, bringing the total interim and recommended final dividend to Rs 10 per share. \"During the last year, we focused on making directional changes in our product mix and enhancing margins in the business. We have more than doubled our share of non-par business within our Individual business. Now, we intend to focus our strategic interventions to maximize our market share across categories,\" Mohanty said.",

        "content": "After nearly half a billion dollars in legal judgments against him this year, Donald Trump ’s company opted to offload one of his private jets this month, public filings show. And the buyer is a Republican megadonor who poured nearly $250,000 into a political committee tied to Trump’s 2020 campaign. The plane, a 1997 Cessna jet, is worth in the range of $10 million, according to evoJets , though terms of the transaction couldn’t be confirmed. Federal Aviation Administration records show that on May 13, the aircraft’s registration changed from the Trump Organization ’s DT Air Corp to a Texas entity called MM Fleet Holdings LLC. State records tie that company to Mehrdad Moayedi, an Iranian-American construction and development tycoon who lives near Dallas and runs Centurion American Custom Homes. According to his biography, Moayedi founded his company in 1990 and has since built thousands of homes. Centurion says it partners with both public and private entities. Moayedi is also a Trump donor. Federal campaign finance data show that in 2019 and 2020, he gave a combined $245,000 to Trump Victory—a committee that raised money for the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee , and state GOP parties—sending the maximum allowable $5,600 contribution to the campaign. Moayedi has also given hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of other GOP candidates and committees, including the RNC, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Nikki Haley . In 2022, the developer made a maximum primary donation of $2,900 to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema , an Arizona independent who has raked in big bucks from the real estate industry and is accused by some Democrats of being overly accommodating to Republicans. Business Insider previously reported that the plane had been sold, though the outlet did not include details about the buyer. Trump has boasted about the Cessna on the Trump Aviation website , writing that the aircraft is a “very special feature within the Trump Aviation fleet.” “This high speed jet is often referred to as a ‘rocket in the sky,’ flying at speeds up to Mach .92 and altitudes as high as 51,000 feet. It is one of the fastest in the world and allows for entry into smaller airports,” the site claims. The site further boasts that the craft is outfitted with “top of the line interiors” that can comfortably seat nine passengers, and that “the signature Trump Crest” on the exterior bestows “an even higher level of luxury and beauty to this magnificent aircraft.” Moayedi could not immediately be reached for comment.",

        "description": "President Marcos has signed the \"Eddie Garcia Law\" that seeks protection and ensures the welfare of workers in the movie and television industry.",
        "content": "President Marcos has signed the \"Eddie Garcia Law\" that seeks protection and ensures the welfare of workers in the movie and television industry. Marcos signed Republic Act 11996 on May 24. The law was called “Eddie Garcia Law” as it has taken into account the gravity of the accident that caused the death of Garcia while filming on the set. Under the law, the workers shall be protected by their employers or principal in the workplace. The law provides for the implementation of work hours, wages and other wage-related benefits, social security and welfare benefits, basic necessity, health and safety, working conditions and standards, and insurance. The new law mandates that the worker and the employer or principal shall execute an agreement or an employment contract in a language or dialect understood by both parties before the commencement of service. The protection of the movie and television workers should also be in line with the Labor Code of the Philippines or Presidential Decree No. 442 as amended, and Republic Act No. 11058 or the “Act Strengthening Compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Standards and Providing Penalties for Violations ” and other applicable laws. “No agreement or employment contract shall discriminate against a worker who has contracts or projects with other production outfits unless exclusivity is specified in the contract, nor shall any person perform any act involving preference based on race, color, descent, national or ethnic origin, or religion, which has the purpose or effect of nullifying the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise on an equal footing of any human right or fundamental freedom,” the law’s non-discriminatory provision stated. With regard to hours of work, it states that they shall be based on the terms and conditions set in the agreement or employment contract and other stipulations signed with the employer or principal. In terms of wages, the minimum wage of a worker shall not be less than the applicable minimum wage in the region where the worker is hired and wages shall be paid on time, as agreed upon in the contract, directly to the worker. The employer or principal shall strictly adhere to the provisions of Republic Act No. 7610 as amended by Republic Act No. 9231 in the employment of minors. All workers shall also be covered by and entitled to benefits provided by the Social Security System (SSS), the Home Development Mutual Fund or Pag-IBIG Fund, and the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth). To ensure the health and safety of workers, the law mandates the employer or principal to strictly comply with the occupational safety and health standards provided in Republic Act No. 11058 and Section 25 of Republic Act No. 11036. The law also calls for continued upskilling and reskilling of workers. It directs the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA), in collaboration with relevant government agencies and various stakeholders, to develop and implement a system of continuing skills upgrading, reskilling, and training of workers in the movie and television industry. Violators of any section of the law shall be fined up to P100,000 for the first offense; up to P200,000 for second offense; and up to P500,000 for the third and succeeding offenses. “If the violation is committed by a corporation, trust or firm, partnership, association or any other entity, the fines shall be imposed upon the entity's responsible officers, including, but not limited to, the executive producer, producer, production manager, and business unit manager,” the law stated.",

        "content": "Last season, the Las Vegas Raiders finally got another win over the Kansas City Chiefs. In the grand scheme of things, it didn't really matter too much for the 2023 season, as the Chiefs still went on to win their second straight Super Bowl and actually win it inside the Raiders home . So, that had to sting a bit. But it did do something for the future. After both games last year, this rivalry may be officially back. In game one at home for the Raiders, they went up 14-0, and it was looking like LV would run away with it. Obviously, that's not how it ended up, but it was a positive for sure. Then, there was the Christmas Day game, which I'm sure every single Raiders fan absolutely loved. They beat up the Chiefs and were just the more physical team. That game saw the Chiefs play one of their worst games under Andy Reid, with Patrick Mahomes as the quarterback, who also struggled really badly. The 2024 schedule was recently released, and, as Raiders fans also love, the Chiefs do not have it easy. They have games every day except Tuesday, and they play three games in a 10-day span at one point. When Mahomes was recently asked if he had any specific game circled on their calendar, he had the perfect response that should ignite Raiders fans. \"I'm going to try to be better on Christmas (laughter) because last Christmas was not great,\" Mahomes said during Chiefs OTAs last week. You don't want to say the game is haunting him because he is a three-time Super Bowl champion and won it last year. However, he certainly would like to have that one back. The Raiders beat him down, and since then, Antonio Pierce has said they have the recipe to beat Mahomes and called them the Mahomes Rules, referencing Michael Jordan. Either way, it's safe to say that game is still on his mind. While they do not play one another on Christmas Day this year, they do play each other in a primetime game, and the Raiders will hope to do the same thing then.

        "description": "Dark Fluid incident sparks speculation in Helldivers 2 community. Illuminate's return hinted through recent leaks and rumors. Past events suggest new challenges follow initial successes.",
        "content": "A recent incident involving a Dark Fluid experiment has stirred up speculation among Helldivers 2 players. The mishap, which resulted in the “spaghettification” of 12 scientists, has led some to believe that the Illuminate, a previously absent enemy faction, might be making a comeback in the game. This has intensified excitement and curiosity within the , as players anticipate new challenges and story developments. Dark Fluid is a synthesized exotic matter weaponized by Super Earth scientists to combat the Terminids. Created from technology seized from the Illuminate after the First Galactic War, this substance is intended for a targeted strike to eradicate the Terminid Supercolony on Meridia. Its volatile nature, however, recently caused an unforeseen micro black hole, leading to the tragic incident at the research facility. The Illuminate, one of the three enemy factions from the original Helldivers, have not appeared in Helldivers 2 until now. Rumors and leaks suggest that their destruction might have been exaggerated, leading to speculation about their return. A recent leak depicted a planet, suspected to be Meridia, exploding, which players believe is linked to the Dark Fluid’s instability and the subsequent resurgence of the Illuminate. In March, another leak referenced Illuminate energy readings near the created singularity by Dark Fluid. This has led to theories about the Illuminate’s return, with some believing they were not exterminated but allowed to escape. As Super Earth gears up for a significant operation on Meridia, these leaks and incidents suggest a larger narrative at play, possibly involving the Illuminate’s comeback. Helldivers 2, developed by Arrowhead , is a cooperative top-down that builds on the success of its predecessor. Released in 2024, the game features new enemy factions, advanced weaponry, and strategic elements. Set in a dystopian future, players act as elite soldiers defending Super Earth from various alien threats. The game introduces Dark Fluid, a powerful yet unstable weapon, adding new layers of strategy and danger to the missions. Comparing recent events to past incidents in Helldivers 2, the April 1st victory at Malevelon Creek was overshadowed by an immediate invasion of Automatons. Similarly, Termicide gas, initially seen as a solution, worsened the Terminid problem. These past events mirror the current situation, where the introduction of Dark Fluid has unforeseen consequences, potentially leading to the Illuminate’s unexpected return. The previous major orders in the game have shown that new technologies and strategies often come with significant risks. The deployment of Dark Fluid, despite its potential, has already resulted in casualties and may attract the attention of formidable foes like the Illuminate. This pattern suggests that players should be prepared for the unexpected and ready to adapt to new threats. – The spaghettified scientists hint at the dangers of Dark Fluid. – The Illuminate’s return could add a complex layer to the game. – Past game events show a pattern of initial success followed by greater challenges. As Helldivers 2 players navigate the aftermath of the Dark Fluid incident, they should anticipate escalating challenges. The potential return of the Illuminate could introduce new strategic elements and adversaries, reshaping the game’s landscape. The pattern of past events suggests that while new technologies offer advantages, they also bring unforeseen consequences. Staying vigilant and adaptable will be crucial for players as they face these evolving threats. The ongoing major order and the advancing operations indicate that significant developments are on the horizon, keeping the community engaged and speculative about the game’s future.",

The reality TV star and mother-of-two shared a clip to TikTok where she hops in the water with her 1-year-old son, Phoenix . It's a sweet little video ... capturing loving mom Paris bouncing her baby in what looks like a lazy on a relaxing day -- and, it seems safe. She's holding Phoenix tightly -- and he's happy and smiling -- so all good right? Well, not quite ... 'cause according to a bunch of parents online, PH made a common mistake new moms and dads make -- she's got the life jacket on the wrong way. Check it out ... little vests like the one Phoenix is wearing are supposed to have the big floaty in the front, holding on to the chest -- but, Paris put Phoenix's on so the floaty is on his back. Whoops! This isn't your normal internet call-out BTW ... 'cause lots of the TikTokers genuinely just wanna help Paris, and they're correcting her kindly. Many are admitting they made the same mistake or know people who have -- not a roast by any means. Paris has been super open to these polite corrections in the past FWIW ... remember, just earlier this month fans let Paris know her kids' car seats faced the wrong way -- and, she not only made the change but thanked people for the tips ! Live and learn, we suppose ... it ain't easy being a new mom even if you are a celeb!!! We've reached out to Paris team ... so far, no word back.",

Q1 2024 Financial Highlights Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by over $2.0 million , or approximately 126%, reaching $3.7 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The revenue increase was related to several factors including: the acquisitions of Riders and KOI that closed on March 1, 2024 ; representing one month of combined financial results. a positive contribution from Movistar KOI, the VALORANT Champions Tournament EMEA team that was transferred to OAM in connection with the KOI acquisition; and a change in estimate to record league revenues on a straight-line basis as certain league revenues contain minimum guarantees that can be evenly recorded throughout the period rather than during discrete quarters. This had a positive $0.9 million impact in the first quarter. Operating costs for the three months ended March 31, 2024 amounted to $6.2 million , representing an increase of $0.9 million or approximately 16% compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is due to the expenses related to the acquisition of Movistar Riders and KOI, partially offset partially by lower costs in the core OAM business. Adjusted EBITDA i loss for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $1.8 million , showing an improvement of approximately 51% compared to the adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.7 million for the same period in 2023. This improvement is due to the factors highlighted above. As at March 31, 2024 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $10.1 million , compared with $13.9 million as at December 31, 2023 . The decrease in cash reserves is a result of the negative EBITDA on the quarter alongside incremental operational costs related to the Movistar Riders and KOI. A significant factor in the Company's cash reduction during the quarter was a $1.9 million VAT payment related to the acquisition of KOI. The Company expects a VAT rebate for the total amount in fiscal 2024. Selected Q1 2024 Achievements The Company acquired esports organizations KOI and Movistar Riders, forming a global esports powerhouse. These acquisitions align with OverActive's expansion strategy in Spain , EMEA, and Latin America had an immediate and positive contribution to the Company's adjusted EBITDA in the first month of the quarter. OverActive welcomed Gabriel Saenz de Buruaga and Gerard Piqué to its board of directors as part of the acquisitions of Movistar Riders and KOI. OverActive received Riot Games' approval for the transfer of the VALORANT Champions Tour EMEA team participation agreement from KOI to OverActive Media. The MAD Lions KOI League of Legends EMEA Championship match on February 18th became the most-watched LEC match since summer 2021, with 830,816 ii peak viewers. The Company entered the Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS) and emerged as the Champions of Stage 1 and Stage 2 in North America and qualified for the first Overwatch Major in Dallas . Telefónica extended its partnership with Movistar Riders, resulting in the largest financial partnership in OverActive's history. OverActive renewed its relationship with Scuf Gaming and signed a new partnership with the emerging lifestyle and gaming brand Blacklyte. Significant Announcements Subsequent to Quarter End On April 16, 2024 , the Company entered into a new long-term agreement with the Call of Duty League. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will receive a termination payment of approximately $2.8 million from Activision Blizzard. All outstanding entry fees totaling approximately $35.2 million were eliminated. This will be reflected in OAM's financial statements for the second quarter of 2024. The Company announced that Neil Duffy has joined as Chief Commercial Officer, Americas. OverActive signed new partnerships with Monster Energy, Cupra, Mahou and OWO. \"Our first quarter of 2024 marks significant progress for OverActive Media as we continue to execute our strategic growth initiatives,\" said Adam Adamou , CEO of OverActive. \"We are thrilled to report that the acquisition of KOI and Movistar Riders has, as expected, immediately and positively impacted our results.

Although OverActive believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements involve risks and uncertainties, and undue reliance should not be placed thereon, as unknown or unpredictable factors could have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements of the OverActive. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include the following: the potential impact of OverActive's qualifying transaction on relationships, including with regulatory bodies, employees, suppliers, customers and competitors; changes in general economic, business and political conditions, including changes in the financial markets; changes in applicable laws and regulations both locally and in foreign jurisdictions; compliance with extensive government regulation; the risks and uncertainties associated with foreign markets; the ability of the Company to continue to execute on its existing partnerships and business strategy; the ability of the MAD Lions and Call of Duty Leagues to maintain viewership; the successful completion of the Company's new venue; and other risk factors set out in OverActive's most recent annual information form and its other filings with Canadian securities regulators, copies of which may be found under OverActive's profile at www.sedarplus.ca .

Non-IFRS Measures This press release includes references to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure and is defined by the Company net income or loss before income taxes, finance costs, depreciation and amortization, decrease in net present value of franchise obligations, foreign exchange gains / loss, assistance payments from Franchise League and government assistance, restructuring and business development costs, impairment charges, and share-based compensation. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of financial performance because it provides an indication of the Company's ability to capitalize on growth opportunities in a cost-effective manner, finance its ongoing operations and service its financial obligations. This non-IFRS financial measure is not an earnings or cash flow measure recognized by IFRS and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. Our method of calculating such a financial measure may differ from the methods used by other issuers and, accordingly, our definition of this non-IFRS financial measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that non-IFRS financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with IFRS as indicators of our performance or to cash flows from operating activities as measures of liquidity and cash flows. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income/loss may be found in the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2024 . Neither the TSXV nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSXV) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release. ____________________________________ i Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure.

        "content": "South Sydney superstar Latrell Mitchell boldly declared “I bleed blue” amid claims he gave New South Wales coach Michael Maguire the impression he wasn’t committed to representing his state. Despite the Rabbitohs’ poor start to the 2024 season, Mitchell loomed as a potential selection for the Blues ahead of Origin Game I but Maguire opted for Stephen Crichton and Joseph Sua’ali’i in the centres. The Daily Telegraph’s Phil Rothfield, however, reported on a meeting , with the latter believing the Bunnies star “wasn’t overly obsessed” about playing for the Blues. “I had mail last week that he might have had a meeting with Madge and Madge walked away from that meeting with an opinion that he (Latrell) wasn’t overly obsessed about wearing the Blues jersey,” Rothfield said. “He (Mitchell) was dreadfully concerned about the trainwreck season that is South Sydney and I think after they spoke, Madge was of the opinion he wants guys who aren’t concerned about club footy and want to do their best for the state. But Mitchell fired back on Instagram and declared he’s always willing to represent his state when called upon. “I’m always committed to playing for NSW,” Mitchell wrote. “Facts. I specifically said to Madge via phone call if I’m playing well enough for me to be in your side, then I’m 100 per cent in. “I bleed blue, I love the rivalry and the Origin arena. All I can do now is focus on Souths and winning more games. “Good luck to the boys ... I’ll be cheering NSW all the way.” Mitchell has not played for the Blues since 2021 as a hamstring injury ruled him out of the 2022 series while a calf injury sidelined him in 2023. However, the 26-year-old could figure as a selection candidate for Game II if he can string together a series of performances similar to what he showed in the Bunnies’ 42-26 victory over the Eels. Mitchell chalked up three try assists and was a livewire throughout as the Rabbitohs secured just their second win of the season.",

        "content": "The Guardians are for real. Major League Baseball says so in its updated power rankings revealed May 26. Bleacher Report also says so by the same metric. The oddsmakers in Las Vegas agree. The visible proof is in the American League Central Division standings, and the measure of the Guardians’ success goes deeper than the record of 36-17 that has them in first place, 2.5 games ahead of the Royals. Bleacher Report and MLB each rank the Guardians third among baseball’s 30 teams, behind only the Phillies and Yankees. The Guardians before the 2024 season began were pegged at +300 by BetMGM.com to win the Central Division, meaning a bettor would win $300 and recoup the original $100 if the bet wins. Anyone can still bet on the Guardians to win the Central, but the odds have changed. Dramatically. Now they are minus-110, meaning it would take a bet of $110 to win $100 and recoup the original $100. The Guardians were 24-29 after 53 games last season. The A.L. Central was so anemic they were just 3.5 games behind the division-leading Twins at 28-26. A team with a record of 24-29 in the division today would be 12 games behind the Guardians. Check out these numbers: The Guardians have scored 263 runs, fifth most in the majors, and they have homered 59 times — good for 10th. After 53 games last year they had scored 183 runs and homered 30 times. The Guardians won nine straight games, their longest winning streak since 2017 when they won 22 straight, before playing the Rockies in Denver on May 27. They have won 12 of their last 13 games. Remarkably, they have put together this amazing run while their leadoff hitter, Steven Kwan, is recovering from a hamstring injury that forced him to the injured list May 6. Kwan was leading the American League with a .353 batting average when he was sidelined. Even more remarkable than winning without Kwan is they are winning with a first-year manager who just two years ago was behind the plate catching for the A’s. Stephen Vogt was unknown to most Guardians fans before he was hired to replace legendary Terry Francona. Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti admitted knowing little about Vogt before he and General Manager Mike Chernoff began their search for the 47th manager in franchise history. The early report card on Vogt: So far, so very good. “I haven’t done anything,” Vogt answered a reporter in Anaheim on May 26 when asked about managing a team on a nine-game win streak. “It’s all about the guys in (the clubhouse). They believe in each other. They fight for each other. We play all 13 (positional players) guys. “They all chip in on their day. The pitching has really stepped up. It’s been a fun week and a half. We want to keep it going.” What Vogt said is not true. Not the part about the Guardians believing in each other and fighting for each other. That part is definitely true. The “I haven’t done anything” part of Vogt’s statement is inaccurate, yet his in-game decisions aren’t the main reason there has been a 12-game improvement from a year ago with basically the same everyday lineup — not counting Tyler Freeman replacing Myles Straw in center field. Freeman has homered four times in 48 games. Straw homered three times in 359 career games with Cleveland over three seasons. Vogt’s philosophy on hitting differs from that of Francona. Francona, 64 when he retired as manager, was big on his players making contact, pushing the runner up a base or two with another hit, and running the bases wisely. Vogt wants his hitters to be more aggressive at the plate. The results show in the numbers — 29 more home runs and 80 more runs scored after 53 games from 2023 to 2024. “It’s been a theme going back to spring training,” Antonetti said recently. “We were looking to try to impact the ball more consistently. “I think maybe we fell victim a little bit to the narrative around our identity about, ‘Hey, we’re a team that just puts the ball in play.’ And yes, that’s a strength and we want to make sure we maintain that, but the goal is to try to put the ball in play with authority. Let’s put the ball in play when we can, but let’s look to try to do a little bit more damage when we do.” Credit hitting coach Chris Valaika, too. The Guardians were dead last in the majors with 124 home runs last year, but they also struck out a Major League-fewest 1,142 times. The 2024 Guards have not sacrificed plate discipline for swinging aggressively. The Guardians have fanned 403 times this season. Only the Royals, Blue Jays and Astros have struck out fewer times.",

The 43-year old has been doing a splendid job with the European nation and the Irish has been well and truly awarded for his recent excellent work. Ireland have had successful stints against Afghanistan and Pakistan in 2024, and do stand as a potent threat to the sides at the mega event.Just in: Ireland head coach has accepted a two-year contract extension.Details 👇https://t.co/q8orMSVibh— ICC (@ICC) May 27, 2024Ever since taking over the reign in 2022, the Irish coach has successfully guided the nation into the T20 World Cup 2022 and 2024. However, he failed to guide the side into the 50-over version of the World Cup (which was in 2023). The contract has been extended by two years. Heinrich Malan's Official Statement On Contract Extension“I am delighted with the extension as it provides the squad and coaching staff a great deal more certainty as we build upon the foundations we have put in place over the last two years. We are now a three-format squad and - despite our smaller talent pool to draw from compared to other Full Members - we have been gradually building a sustainable structure that ensures we can continue to compete and improve on all three fronts,” said Heinrich Malan.“One area I have been keen on developing is our players being able to better read the game situation and then, where they judge it appropriate, to have the freedom and confidence to try and impose their style and natural instincts on the game. Some of our younger players are literally learning this ability on the job, which means there are days they will fail, but failure is a key part of the learning process,\" he added.\"What we as coaches are looking for is evidence that those unsuccessful experiences are analysed and understood by the player and become part of the experience they can draw upon in future matches. This work has borne fruit in two successful T20 World Cup qualifying campaigns and in our recent Test success,\" said the Irish coach.\"But we are all conscious that we’ve missed out on playing in the last two 50-over world cups, and qualification for the 2027 tournament will be one of the focus areas across the next three years,” he concluded.",

        "content": "Coming off their first loss of the season and travelling away against Eden, the Pakuranga United Rugby Club Premiers were expecting a tough encounter last Saturday. They started well with an early exchange into the Eden red zone after some welcomed physicality from Pasqualle Dunne. An error let Eden off the hook early and a big clearing kick by the home side showed ‘Ranga what was to come if they didn’t control the football. Eden kicked a penalty to make it 3–0 before ‘Ranga came back hard. Strong forwards play with a good maul off a shortened lineout led into Eden’s 30m zone. Constant pressure and large phases with good ball control and great ruck work saw an amazing try to George Sims. A missed conversion and the score was 5–3 Pakuranga. Eden entered the Pakuranga 30-metre zone and a penalty was given for offside play. Eden converted to make it 6–5. Two minutes later Pakuranga were awarded a scrum penalty in a kickable position. Michiale van Wyk converted to make the score 8–6 at halftime. Another attack from the backs had Ezekiel Wye pop up on off his left wing to receive an inside pass to score a great try. Van Wyk converted to make it 15–6. Eden kicked the ball to five metres out and the ensuing lineout had them over for a try, which was converted to make it 15–13 in Pakuranga’s favour. Eden then infringed 40 metres out and directly in front. Van Wyk stepped up to have a shot but the ball drifted so the score stayed 15–13. Eden converted a penalty to make it 16–15 but Pakuranga didn’t panic. The insertion of Gafatasi Su’s at hooker for Lotu Finau all game was timely. Combined with loosehead Oscar Cowley-Andreas and Jerry Samania the ‘Ranga scrum became lethal. Phases built from a lineout in Eden territory and Sean Carter crashed over for what some saw as a controversial try. Sims stepped up to convert it to make it 22–16. Randall Baker came on late and decimated the Eden lineout stealing ball at will. Pakuranga finished the game with an opportunity to go for a maul to secure a bonus point or take a shot at goal. Sione Takai rightly chose the latter option. The final score was 22–16 to Pakuranga. It was a much-needed victory after their first loss of the season the week before. Senior rugby takes a break this weekend to celebrate King’s Birthday. Everyone’s welcome along on June 8 to support the boys versus Waitakere where they hope to secure their position in the top two of the competition.",

        "content": "George Springer, Bo Bichette, and Davis Schneider homered to back five shutout innings from Chris Bassitt to lift the visiting Toronto Blue Jays to a 5-1 victory against the Chicago White Sox on Monday. Nate Pearson, Erik Swanson, Zach Pop, and Genesis Cabrera followed Bassitt with four innings of one-run relief as the Blue Jays stopped a three-game losing streak. Chicago lost its sixth in a row and has dropped 10 of 11. Opponents have held the White Sox to two runs or fewer six times over that span. White Sox rookie right-hander Nick Nastrini (0-4) lost to the Blue Jays for the second time in five days. Nastrini limited Toronto to three hits over five innings, but two left the ballpark. Nastrini scattered three runs and walked four against five strikeouts. Toronto clinched at least a share of the season series with Chicago. The Blue Jays took two of three from the visiting White Sox last week. Springer provided all the run support the Blue Jays would need when he smacked a two-run blast to left center with two outs in the second inning. Springer, who hit at least 21 home runs in each of his first three seasons with Toronto, hit his fourth long ball of the season and first since April 24. Bichette opened the fourth inning with a solo blast to center, his fourth of the season and second against Nastrini in the past week. Bassitt (5-6) spaced five hits in five innings while striking out seven to defeat the White Sox for the second straight start. Chicago avoided the shutout when Gavin Sheets homered against Swanson to lead off the eighth. It was Sheets' fourth of the season. Andrew Benintendi singled three times for the White Sox while Sheets and Corey Julks had two. Chicago, which out-hit the Blue Jays 10-6, stranded 11 runners and finished 1-for-7 with men in scoring position. The White Sox loaded the bases with two out in the first inning but didn't score. Schneider belted a two-run homer -- his sixth of the season -- against John Brebbia in the ninth to account for the final margin.

But Bill was so much more than basketball, he was larger than life. His upbeat and vibrant personality will forever be remembered and cherished, and he will be deeply missed by our organization, Rip City and all who experienced him. Our love and condolences go to Bill’s wife, Lori and his sons, Adam, Nate, Luke and Chris.” Walton died at the age of 71. The statement also included a comment from Blazers chair, Jody Allen. “Bill Walton was an icon,” Allen said. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The 6-foot-11 Walton led the Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, earning the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player award after averaging 18.5 points, 19 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 3.7 blocks. He shot 54.5% in the six-game series against the Philadelphia 76ers. -- Aaron Fentress | | (Twitter), (Instagram), (Facebook)",

        "content": "Hundreds of people, as well as the mayor of Toronto, the city’s police chief and municipal and provincial politicians, turned out in the pouring rain on May 27 to demonstrate their support for the Bais Chaya Mushka Elementary School. Shots were fired at the building just before 5 a.m. on May 25, breaking a window in front of the school, said Toronto Police. In a security video two suspects can be seen getting out of a dark-coloured vehicle—which neither of them appeared to be driving—and opening rounds of fire on the fenced-in building at 4375 Chesswood Dr., near the intersection of Dufferin and Finch. The Integrated Gun and Gang Task Force, with the help of the Hate Crime Unit are investigating, Toronto Police said in a news release. Bais Chaya Mushka had recently spent $200,000 to put in specially armoured glass and other renovations. Half the funding came from the federal government’s Security Infrastructure Program (SIP) grant. Rabbi Yaakov Vidal, principal of the Chabad Lubavitch elementary school, located in an industrial area in northwest Toronto, said he learned of the incident on Shabbat afternoon, when the school’s caretaker came to his home to inform him. “It was pretty shocking, it was something that’s totally unexpected,” he said in an interview with The CJN, shortly before the community rally and the arrival of students. “But we’ve got to move forward and makes sure the kids can come back to school. “Parents are concerned, but we’re grateful to have all the security we have here, the police force, and the reassurance that they’re going to be here with us until safety is restored.” I will never see our Jewish Community surrender to hate and acts of antisemistism. My colleagues and I joined together united at Bais Chaya Mushka School in #yorkcentre with a clear message. Every student has a right to learn safely without fear here in our Ontario. pic.twitter.com/xRD8gfJNG5 — Michael Kerzner (@MPPKerzner) May 27, 2024 Municipal and provincial politicians spoke to the crowd outside the school as parents and school buses dropped off children. “My word to the hater, to the shooter, is it’s a despicable, antisemitic act. It was a disgusting attempt to intimidate the community, to fill people with fear and we say to these cowards we will find you. You will be held responsible,” said Mayor Olivia Chow. “The chief (of police, Myron Demkiw) and I have spoken and his team is working every minute of every day to keep you and your loved ones safe in our city. They will be increasing their presence around schools and synagogues and other places where you and your family gather.” Mayor @oliviachow speaking this morning outside Bais Chaya Mushka Jewish Elementary School. 👇 pic.twitter.com/UPzyT2UmW9 — HonestReporting Canada🎗️ (@HonestRepCanada) May 27, 2024 The city has convened meetings with city staff and police to evaluate the security needs of schools and other institutions, the mayor told The CJN, starting with the Miles Nadal JCC in downtown Toronto. “We said let’s identify what needs to be done and where there’s a will, there’s always a way,” Chow told The CJN when asked whether the city would offer funding for security improvements. Several MPPs and city councillors expressed their support for the Jewish community. “I want to speak to the non-Jewish community who is with us today... to stand up and speak up against the vile rise of antisemitism being normalized on the streets of this country. To stand up to those who seek to instill fear in the hearts of young girls and children,” provincial education minister Stephen Lecce told the crowd. “We are not going to be intimidated by these acts, because there is no bully that can shatter our resolve as a country to stand up against this pernicious hate.” Proud to stand with colleagues, the community and allies to show our support for the students at this school, and to show we will not be intimidated. Thank you @UJAFederation for organizing and @TPSOperations and Chief @TPSMyronDemkiw for your action to keep the Jewish... pic.twitter.com/tTjEcRsFaD — Brad Bradford✌️ (@BradMBradford) May 27, 2024 Toronto city councillors James Pasternak and Brad Bradford spoke about their efforts to request the province to establish ‘bubble zones’ that would keep political protests at a distance from faith-based institutions. The motion failed to pass at a council meeting last week. “We’re not finished asking for bubble zones in front of our vulnerable institutions. To those who thought this debate was over, we’ll be back,” Pasternak told the crowd to cheers. Today, members from all level of government came out to show their support at a @UJAFederation rally in support of Bais Chaya Mushka All-Girls Jewish Elementary School. We will continue to fight for safety bubble zones to protect faith-baised schools and institutions from hate.... pic.twitter.com/WzYttY6ETr — James Pasternak (@PasternakTO) May 27, 2024 Parents dropping their children off at the school Monday morning said it was hard to tell their children about the shooting—and to see the boarded-up window that had been pierced by a bullet. “It’s difficult to swallow,” said Rivky Gansburg, who has three daughters at the school. “My daughter’s classroom, her Grade 8 classroom, is right above where the shooting happened. I often pull up to school during the day and the girls are at that window, waving, smiling during a break. “There’s no reason why anybody should attack children who are coming to learn and go about their day.” Tamar Liman said it was frightening to hear the news about the shooting on the weekend, but by Monday morning, encouraged by the rally, she said her children were not worried about returning to school, “I think they have faith in the police, faith in God and faith in the community to stand together,” she said. The shooting at the school is the most recent attack on a Jewish institution in Toronto. Earlier this month, the windows and doors at Synagogue Kehillat Shaarei Torah were broken in an attack. It was the second time the Orthodox synagogue had been vandalized within weeks. Two schools and a community building in Montreal were targeted by a shooter in November. Last week, Montreal police announced they had arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting at Yeshiva Gedola, a Montreal school. “This needs to be a wake-up call for our leaders and for broader society,” said Noah Shack, UJA Federation vice-president for countering hate and antisemitism. “For a school to be shot at is unconscionable. “Antisemitism is diminished when those in positions of authority speak out against it. You saw a lot of that here today, and what we need is more of that from our leaders. “We need them to take clear positions that this will not stand... The time for equivocation needs to be over now.”",

People have taken to the streets in major cities across China in a wave of protests not seen since pro-democracy rallies in 1989 were crushed.

S. was excited to meet Cai Chongguo, a Chinese dissident who was exiled to France for participating in the Tiananmen Democracy movement in 1989, but that soon would change. They connected earlier this year at a conference in Washington, D.C., about democratizing China. Last spring, S. had founded a political club with some friends to discuss social movements in their home country, China. They called it Democracy Salon NYC after similarly named clubs that helped ignite the Tiananmen protests. In 1989, the forum back was hosted by a student at the time named Wang Dan, who later became a leader of the Tiananmen Square movement. By choosing a similar name, S. and her friends wanted to pay homage to those whose demand for political reform in China was upended by a violent and bloody crackdown by the Chinese government. After the conference, S., who asked to be referred to by her first initial only to protect the privacy of her family members, came back to New York on the same train as Cai.

People have taken to the streets in major cities across China in a wave of protests not seen since pro-democracy rallies in 1989 were crushed. (Kena Betancur / AFP via Getty Images) This story originally appeared in Documented, a multilingual news site about immigrants in New York. S. was excited to meet Cai Chongguo, a Chinese dissident who was exiled to France for participating in the Tiananmen Democracy movement in 1989, but that soon would change. They connected earlier this year at a conference in Washington, D.C., about democratizing China. Last spring, S. had founded a political club with some friends to discuss social movements in their home country, China. They called it Democracy Salon NYC after similarly named clubs that helped ignite the Tiananmen protests. In 1989, the forum back was hosted by a student at the time named Wang Dan, who later became a leader of the Tiananmen Square movement. By choosing a similar name, S. and her friends wanted to pay homage to those whose demand for political reform in China was upended by a violent and bloody crackdown by the Chinese government. After the conference, S., who asked to be referred to by her first initial only to protect the privacy of her family members, came back to New York on the same train as Cai. She alleged that he tried to hold her hand, hug her, and coerce her to... https://www.thenation.com/authors",

(Robert F. Bukaty / AP Photo) President Joe Biden has stepped up efforts to reverse his disastrous loss of support among young voters, announcing a new round of cancellations for federal student loans. The initiative, covering $77 billion in debts, will forgive loans for some 160,000 borrowers via existing programs—a total that brings the overall ratio of canceled loans to one in 10, or 5 million borrowers, according to administration officials. The new program comes on the heels of the White House's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Schedule 3 drug, in order to reduce criminal penalties for its use—and just ahead of the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the parent company of Ticketmaster, whose price gouging is the bane of music fans. It's hard to avoid the sense that this grab bag of policy incentives is a desperate bid by Biden reelection strategists to divert attention from the main issue throttling his support among voters in the 18-to-34 demographic: his bear-hug support for Israel's brutal and inhumane war in Gaza, whose grip has only recently begun to loosen with his threats to withhold US military aid in the event of an Israeli offensive in Rafah. If only we can hunt up enough spare income for kids to get high with at concerts, Biden campaign officials seem to reckon, then they'll forget about this damn war and the cowardly nationwide crackdown on campus protests against it. There's a deeper irony embedded in these don't-look-at-Gaza pitches to young voters.

It wasn't the first documentary, but it was made by the first documentarian, Robert Flaherty, whose film Nanook of the North (1922) is widely considered to have inaugurated the genre despite his habit of fabricating characters and plotlines to romanticize \"primitive\" cultures. Books in review Whale Fall Buy this book Flaherty explained that his very mission as a filmmaker was \"to show the former majesty and character of these people, while it is still possible.\" It was also what audiences wanted to see: Nanook was a global hit. Its legacy in the Canadian Arctic—where Flaherty slept with at least one of the film's Inuk stars and then abandoned their son—was more complex, but by then, he had moved on. After a documentary set on a Samoan island flopped, Flaherty decided to try his luck on Ireland's wind-scoured outskirts. There, he and his crew spent two years following unrelated islanders chosen to portray \"a man of Aran,\" \"his wife,\" and \"their son\" as they clamber over house-sized boulders to scavenge seaweed, teeter on the edge of cliffs with a fishing line, and subdue a thrashing shark from a ramshackle rowboat. Man of Aran won praise abroad but was criticized even at the time for its lack of attention to social context; later commentators exposed much of it as fraudulent.

(Shannon Stapleton / Reuters) This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com. To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com. On April 22, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Grants Pass v. Johnson, a case that focuses on whether unhoused—the term that has generally replaced \"homeless\"—people with no indoor shelter options can even pull a blanket around themselves outdoors without being subject to criminal punishment. Before making its way to the Supreme Court on appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court held that municipalities can't punish involuntarily homeless people for merely living in the place where they are. This is exactly what the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, did when it outlawed resting or sleeping anywhere on public property with so much as a blanket to survive in cold weather, even when no beds in shelters were available. The law makes it impossible for unhoused residents to stay in Grants Pass, effectively forcing them to either move to another city or face endless rounds of punishment. In Grants Pass, the punishment starts with a $295 fine that, if unpaid, goes up to $500, and can escalate from there to criminal trespass charges, penalties of up to 30 days in jail, and a $1,250 fine. The issue before the court is whether such a law violates the Eighth Amendment's restrictions against cruel and unusual punishment. The city is asking the court to decide that the Eighth Amendment doesn't impose any substantive limit on what can be criminalized, so long as the punishment itself isn't considered cruel and unusual. If so, municipalities across the nation would be free to make involuntary homelessness unlawful.

But back then, Clinton was following in the footsteps of Jimmy Carter (1977), Ronald Reagan (1980), and Jesse Jackson (1984)—though the Rev.

        "content": "Politics / Samuel Alito's Opinions Are Just As Upside-Down as His Flag Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito (Carolyn Kaster / AP Photo) On Thursday, MAGA's chief justice and amateur vexillophile Samuel Alito once again used his unchecked power on the Supreme Court to help Republicans win elections. In so doing, he moved the country a little closer to his ultimate goal of reading the Reconstruction amendments right out of the Constitution. He did this through a case called Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP. At issue was South Carolina's racist congressional map—and more specifically, the way the South Carolina Republican legislature had redrawn the contours of the state's District 1. District 1 is currently represented by Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. It's historically been a safe district for Republicans, but in 2018 a Democrat, Joe Cunningham took the seat with just 50.6 percent of the vote. (Twenty eighteen was a weird election, not just because it was the \"blue wave\" year, but also because the seat had previously belonged to Republican Mark Sanford, who was embroiled in a sex scandal.) In 2020, Nancy Mace narrowly defeated Cunningham to retake the seat for Republicans, but by the same razor thin margin. To avoid these kinds of close scrapes in the future, Republicans redrew the district after the 2020 census, and Mace won reelection with 56.4 percent of the vote in 2022. The way South Carolina redrew the map, however, was racist. Republicans accomplished the goal of protecting Mace by systematically removing Black voters from her district. The new map splits the city of Charleston, South Carolina, in two, and takes most of the Black voters who live there out of District 1 and puts them in District 6 (which is currently represented by Representative Jim Clyburn and is the only one of the state's seven districts currently held by a Democrat).

        "content": "Politics / Samuel Alito's Opinions Are Just As Upside-Down as His Flag Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito (Carolyn Kaster / AP Photo) On Thursday, MAGA's chief justice and amateur vexillophile Samuel Alito once again used his unchecked power on the Supreme Court to help Republicans win elections. In so doing, he moved the country a little closer to his ultimate goal of reading the Reconstruction amendments right out of the Constitution. He did this through a case called Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP. At issue was South Carolina's racist congressional map—and more specifically, the way the South Carolina Republican legislature had redrawn the contours of the state's District 1. District 1 is currently represented by Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. It's historically been a safe district for Republicans, but in 2018 a Democrat, Joe Cunningham took the seat with just 50.6 percent of the vote. (Twenty eighteen was a weird election, not just because it was the \"blue wave\" year, but also because the seat had previously belonged to Republican Mark Sanford, who was embroiled in a sex scandal.) In 2020, Nancy Mace narrowly defeated Cunningham to retake the seat for Republicans, but by the same razor thin margin.

They are likely to be larger than current juvenile visitors and while many will be welcome, some will not, such as the venomous Portuguese man o' war, the world's second most lethal ctenophore. Already there are signs some creatures are going from seasonal to native visitors as extreme marine heatwaves set some species off course. Deadly box jellyfish are becoming increasingly common as well as weever fish, the UK's only venomous fish. We can also expect to see more shortfin mako, the world's fastest swimming shark and now a regular sighting offshore around southern Britain. Two smalltooth sand tiger sharks – previously unknown here – were washed ashore within days last summer.

Frankie Hobro, director of Anglesey Sea Zoo, Brynsiencyn, believes some creatures may pose a greater risk to beachgoers, prompting a need for greater awareness of marine medicine. She told the Daily Star: \"With an overall warmer sea around us here in the UK for much of the year, we will see an increase in certain exotic species, as creatures which were once occasional vagrants become regular seasonal visitors or even natives in our waters. Some of these will be greatly welcomed but others will not. \"It is well known that tropical seas carry many more venomous marine creatures than our temperate seas here but rising ocean...",

An RNLI crew arrived on scene to find the vessel \"almost totally destroyed\" and its occupant \"disappearing under the surface\". Emergency services including rescue helicopters were alerted to the incident shortly after 7pm on Saturday, May 25. A member of the public raised the alarm after seeing smoke in the distance whilst in Stackpole, Pembrokeshire. An all-weather lifeboat from Tenby RNLI was launched and, as the crew rounded St Margaret's Island, south of Tenby, they too spotted smoke on the horizon some 12 miles further south.

        "content": "Upgraded parking facilities at a notorious beauty spot on the edge of Eryri (Snowdonia) are backfiring, critics have claimed. Locals say parking issues have worsened since \"improvements\" were implemented at Y Glyn, an area known as \"the lagoons\" by Llyn Padarn in Llanberis. Three adjacent car park areas were resurfaced to provide 114 parking spaces and a separate aires-type \"Arosfan\" facility was created for campervans. Cyngor Gwynedd carried out the work to bring \"order and control\" to an area that at times becomes overwhelmed with visitors. But with pay machines not yet working, and height barriers only sporadically operated, local people say the car parks have become a giant \"campsite\". Two weeks ago, 95 campervans were counted overnighting at the site and, despite a ban, 32 tents.

As well as struggling for parking space, there are concerns over littering and, for volunteer rubbish collectors, the prospect of finding more human faeces. Nearby campsite owners are incensed too, as Llyn Padarn's \"free campsite\" is said to be sucking custom from their facilities. While many campervan owners prefer the freedom of unrestricted pitches, campsite operators between Llanberis and Caernarfon are reporting lower-than-usual occupancy figures for motorhomes. \"This is ruining local family businesses!\" fumed one owner, down 10 pitches last weekend. Residents insist they are not anti-tourist but they want Cyngor Gwynedd to get a grip and restore the \"order\" they were promised.

It's that time of year when intriguing and sometimes perilous creatures begin to populate our coasts. But what should you do if you encounter a beached jellyfish, and can they still sting you after they've died? Whether you're fascinated or repulsed by them, jellyfish are captivating creatures that play a crucial role in the marine food chain. They are entirely dependent on currents for transportation, which is why they often appear in large groups, reports the Daily Star. But with so many benign species being easily mistaken for the more nasty ones, and vice versa, the golden rule is always look but don't touch. Whilst in the water you should also keep your distance – the tentacles often drift a long way behind the main body of the animal, which is what makes them such effective predators.

Watch out for the stingers The harmless By-The-Wind-Sailors bear a great similarity to their much maligned and much larger relative the Portuguese Man O' War. Both have a float above the surface with a striking bluish purple 'sail' to catch the wind. Most impressive in size among our common species are lionsmane and barrel jellyfish, both of which frequently grow to the size of a dustbin lid or larger and are a staple food for our native leatherback turtles. The barrel jellyfish is harmless to humans but is still a formidable sight, a dense white mass with short tentacles which often grow to the size of a barrel, hence their name. Similarly the lionsmane jellyfish reaches 2m in diameter and gives a very nasty sting,...",

Sign up to our free newsletter for the top North Wales stories sent straight to your e-mail Nine beaches in Wales have been singled out for their beauty and \"secrecy\". They are included in a list of 13 UK beaches that, viewed from a London perspective, are seen as being \"off the beaten track\". Locals and even holidaymakers may be surprised to learn the rundown includes beaches with \"virtually no tourists\" - true for some only in the off-season. The list was compiled by The Express, which said: \"Although a few of these iconic places can be reached by coach or car, others can only be accessed at certain times of the day or via precipitous footpaths.\" While those picked out are undeniably beautiful, not all are quite as inaccessible as The Express believes. Some are indeed \"hidden away in remote coves\" but few remain undiscovered and many can become quite busy in high summer. Pick the right time, however, and you may have these beaches almost to yourself. READ MORE: Butlin's interested in coming to North Wales seaside town but there's one problem READ MORE: 'Toxic' Welsh tourist tax survives axe as country battles 'over-tourism' Still, the list includes beaches that can be trickier to reach. A few, said The Express, can \"only be reached on foot\", which is largely true of most beaches: exceptions includes the likes of Morfa Bychan (Black Rock Sands) near Porthmadog. All are definitely worth a visit, however. Details of each are outlined below. (Image: Jeff Buck/Wiki) Also referred to by its Anglicised name, Church Bay, this is an expanse of sand and pebbles beach bordered by rock pools against a backdrop of steep cliffs.

Sign up to our free newsletter for the top North Wales stories sent straight to your e-mail Two villages in North Wales have been named among the \"greatest\" in Britain. A 2024 list of the country's 30 best villages, from Gwynedd to Cumbria and Cornwall, has been compiled by The Telegraph. While most are, unsurprisingly, in England, four from Wales are included and just three from Scotland. When drawing up the shortlist, the newspaper placed an emphasis on beauty and authenticity, singling out places not overrun by tourists. Introducing its selection, The Telegraph said: \"Britain has no shortage of eye-catching villages, but a combination of good looks, convenience for day trippers and a few influential endorsements can be enough to turn what was once a peaceful retreat into an overtourism battleground inundated with selfie stick-wielding tourists from April till October.

Of the four Welsh picks, they're neatly divided between north and south. Representing South Wales are Solva, Pembrokeshire, with its \"ice-cream pastels\" and \"fjord-like harbour\", and Laugharne on the River Taf in Carmarthenshire, host to a castle ruin, old walls and reminders of poet Dylan Thomas.

        "content": "The unsolved murder of a pensioner, who was brutally beaten to death in his own home, has baffled investigators for four decades. Retired dentist John Connors, described by a friend as \"so thin you could have pushed him over with a feather\", was killed in his Neath home in 1978, sparking a massive manhunt for the perpetrator or perpetrators. As part of their investigation, police released a sketch of a man seen fleeing from Mr Connors' residence on the day of his death before jumping into a car and speeding away. However, this individual has never been identified, leaving the murder case unresolved. Mr Connors lived on Lewis Road in Neath town centre in the shadow of the landmark \"penny brick\" church. The house had also served as his dental surgery before his retirement. The 85-year-old lived alone and while he enjoying popping into the British Legion club for a drink with friends, he largely kept himself to himself. However, sometime on the afternoon or evening of Thursday, March 30, 1978, he was bludgeoned to death, reports Wales Online.

He had been repeatedly beaten about the head with what a post mortem examination would later determine had been two different blunt objects. It was said his death was likely swift, though \"defensive wounds\" to his hands showed he had put up some resistance despite his physical frailties. A number of small fires had been set in the room where the body was discovered - possibly lit in an attempt to cover the killer's tracks - and while it appeared nothing had been taken from the house detectives were sure the motive had been robbery. There was also no sign of a forced entry to the property, suggesting Mr Connors may have let his killers...",

A Welsh Commando unit leader is to be honoured for his exploits during World War II. Major Bryan Hilton-Jones recruited and led X Troop - Britain's first commandos with German speakers - and served in Normandy. His remarkable life will be commemorated with a blue plaque on the wall in his native Harlech in a ceremony on June 2. It will be put up on the side of their meeting place - now a grocer's shop - in the Gwynedd town. The grocer's shop used to be a butcher's shop, and was run by Peter Jones, 69, who was a distant cousin of Maj Hilton-Jones and who hadn't known that the building had been the unit's meeting place in 1942-1943.

Sign up to our free newsletter for the top North Wales stories sent straight to your e-mail A trip abroad doesn't have to break the bank if you're prepared to consider less traditional holiday spots. If you're planning a summer getaway this year, Manchester Airport offers a range of more affordable alternatives. Despite the cost-of-living crisis, a foreign break is still possible for those canny enough to look around for deals. A recent survey by the European Travel Commission revealed that, despite the ongoing financial strain, nearly three-quarters of Brits are planning to travel in the next six months. There are time-honoured ways to cut costs, such as travelling at off-peak times for lower air fares and hotel rates. But just choosing less-familiar destinations can also make a big difference to what's possible.

While many are emerging holiday spots, some are more familiar but have been included as they offer good value for money. Albania Often touted as the \"next Croatia\", Albania boasts the same Adriatic coastline and offers similar attractions for holidaymakers – pristine white beaches and crystal-clear waters, set against a backdrop of dramatic mountains and cliffs.

Lined by trees, with a farmhouse reminiscent of an \"Italian villa\" nearby, the \"beautiful' sandy beach was flanked by moorland and dunes that have since become part of a nature reserve.

A new study suggests the country is slowly making headway in the battle to be considered a \"luxury staycation destination\". For getaway visitors seeking relative solitude, \"remoteness\" was factored into the study by considering local population data. By this measure, four Welsh counties – Anglesey, Pembrokeshire, Gwynedd and Ceredigion – were placed within the top 14 UK of Britain's staycation areas. While they were behind big hitters such as the Lake District and Cotswolds, all four came out ahead of key players like Devon and Edinburgh. Luxury is, of course, subjective and the criteria used to assess it can be arbitrary. A survey by Defender, a Land Rover brand with its own premium cachet, based its assessment on things like golf courses, five-star hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants. The resulting list will inform recommendations for the company's customers.

As well as offering year-round camping and glamping, the site now hosts wedding guests, music events and a forest school. Last year guests were offered archery and tree-top swings, and this season's line-up includes hedge foraging, immersive theatre, flower workshops and al fresco massages. Seren-y-Môr (Star of the Sea), a wild camping site next to ancient woodland, also just to happens to offer spectacular views off the north Anglesey coast. The setting for the venture is the Carreglwyd Estate, near Llanfaethlu, whose history pre-dates the Glyndŵr rebellion of the 15th century. Originally established as a reed thatching estate, for centuries it's been home to sheep and cattle as part of Anglesey's rich farming heritage. The old reedbed marsh is now a SSSI with a diverse array of wildlife.

During the Covid pandemic, the staycation boom prompted Laura Carpenter – daughter of the estate owner – to launch Seren-y-Môr. Its popularity encouraged her to add a forest school and other outdoor pursuits to appeal to families and the adventurous. The forest school is run by Nina and Bob Roots – Bob works on the estate advise its eco-conscious owners on the ecology of their woodlands and marshes. Nina said: \"During Covid, people weren't able to go abroad and Anglesey became one of the UK's top destinations to go on holiday.

And the world feels so much heavier now. On the court, Bill was a fierce player, but off the court he wasn’t happy unless he did everything he could to make everyone around him happy. He was the best of us.” — fellow UCLA center, NBA star and Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. ___ “Bill was a special, kind, and genuine person. I’m incredibly grateful for our close friendship, and the time we spent together on the air, out to dinner after the game, or in his teepee in his backyard. An iconic athlete and broadcaster, but more important, a legendary person who always made me smile.” — ESPN broadcaster Dave Pasch, a longtime on-air partner of Walton. ___ “Bill Walton was a brilliant, interesting, thoughtful, humorous and genuine soul who loved life and cared about everyone he encountered.

        "content": "Cowboys linebacker DeMarvion Overshown’s rookie season ended before it began. He tore the anterior cruciate in his left knee during a preseason game against the Seahawks and spent the year working with Cowboys rehab specialist Britt Brown. “ , the recovery process and the rehab process with Britt,” Overshown told Clarence Hill of the . “Everything’s been great. That’s why I’m really confident in how I’m going to play this year. The hard work we put in. It was days where it was just us at the facility — me, the guys that tore their ACL and Britt. We were there while everybody else was on vacation. This rehab, this recovery definitely has been one that I feel like it’s going to add years to my career at the end. This actually saved my career, this injury.” The third-round pick in 2023 entered the NFL as a 220-pounder. He is heavier now, adding 12-13 pounds of lean mass and has a goal of opening the season at 233 or 234 pounds. “I feel so much more powerful. I’m so much stronger. I feel like I have gotten faster,” Overshown said. “I feel and look like a linebacker now. I can finally stop answering the question: Are you a safety or linebacker? I’m a linebacker that played safety. Don’t get it twisted. I got my frame and I’m ready to get out there. People ain’t seen me this big. They seen a little DeeMo. They haven’t seen the big DeeMo. People are going to be scared of this DeeMo.” Overshown is playing weak side linebacker in the new defense under coordinator Mike Zimmer, with free agent signee Eric Kendricks in the middle and Damone Clark at strong side linebacker. With Overshown’s return, and Kendricks’ signing, linebacker is the one position where the Cowboys have upgraded this offseason. “I feel like all of our linebackers can be All-Pros and Pro Bowlers,” Overshown said. “One thing I know is that run is not going to be a problem. Being around Zimmer, he loves coaching ball and we are constantly learning. One thing that I really respect about coach is he’s teaching us the ins and outs of his defense. He is going to let you know what you are not doing right and he is going to show you. I know I our defense is going to be a lot better this year.”",

        "content": "Queen Camilla honours late brother in sweet way (Image: Getty) Queen Camilla has managed to keep her late brother, Mark Shand's memory alive in a sweet way that is still going strong today, ten years after his death. Mark Shand - a British travel writer and conservationist - died on April 23, 2014 , after he tripped and struck his head as he was trying to light a cigarette outside a hotel in New York following a fundraising auction, at the age of 62. At the time, Camilla spoke to the Times about the moment she answered the phone to find out the devastating news, saying: \"An anguished voice on the other end told me that something terrible had happened to my indestructible brother. \"My charismatic and sometimes infuriating brother, who had survived tsunamis, shipwrecks, poisoned arrows and even the fearsome Komodo dragons, was no longer with us.\" function loadOvpScript(){let el=document.createElement('script');el.setAttribute('src','https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=114945&playerApiId=v114945');document.getElementById('ovp-primis').appendChild(el)}window.top.addEventListener('primisPlayerInit',e=>{try{if(e.detail&&e.detail.playerApiId===\"v114945\"){if(window.document.getElementsByClassName('jwplayer')[0]){e.detail.float('disable')}}}catch(e){}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{setTimeout(()=>{if(typeof flagTcfLoaded!=='undefined'&&flagTcfLoaded===!0){loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP flagTcfLoaded',new Date())}else{document.addEventListener(\"tcfLoaded\",()=>{loadOvpScript()ExpressApp.Log('[Load] OVP tcfLoaded',new Date())})}},1500)}) But it looks like even after all those years since his passing, the Queen has worked hard to keep her beloved brother's memory alive, with the support of her husband, King Charles .

        "description": "Delbert Kohler survived the Bataan Death March, but not captivity, while Russell Haukedahl died after saving his ship from an attacking warplane.",
        "content": "DETROIT LAKES — There’s a lot of history in churches around the area, and people should make sure they know what they have before they throw it out. Those wise words came from Darlene Olson, “sometimes known as a little lady with a little bit of spunk,” she said, who is chaplain of the American Legion Auxiliary in Detroit Lakes and active with Immanuel Lutheran Church in Audubon. She spoke at the Memorial Day program in Detroit Lakes on Tuesday. Olson found a banner while cleaning at the church that honors two local men who died in World War II. “I’m extremely interested in history and our veterans,” she said. “Maybe when you are cleaning your church you may find something wrapped up in a closet,” she said. “It may be a treasure like I found.” On the white banner with wide red borders are 20 blue stars and two gold stars, in the shape of a cross. ADVERTISEMENT “Many people don’t know about the banner and the meaning of the gold stars, “Olson said. “I know that because I’ve asked a lot of people over the last few weeks. The banner with a blue star represents a soldier in the armed services.” The concept goes back to 1917, when a man who was missing his two sons who had gone off to war decided to put up a banner with blue stars on it to honor them. Since then, displaying a blue star service banner shows a family’s pride in their service man or woman, she said. “The blue star is changed to gold if the family member lost their soldier during service time,” she said. She was captivated by the gold stars on the banner, and wanted to find out more about the service members they honored. “I looked at the cemetery map and I talked to the sextant at our church,” she said. “There they were: Private Delbert Kohler HQ company, 194th tank battalion. On April 9, 1942 he was captured (by the Japanese) and took part in the Bataan (Death) March – they were given no food or water on the march to the prison camp,” she said. Kohler survived the march, but could not survive the extremely inhumane conditions once they arrived at the camp. He died of disease at Camp O’Donnell at 26 years old. He is buried in the Philippines, but she said he “has a gravesite in our cemetery next to his parents (but he has no memorial) stone – the church wants to get a stone put up at his home grave. “We are working on this right now,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT According to the Bataan Project website: Camp O’Donnell was an unfinished Filipino military base that the Japanese put into use as a prisoner of war camp on April 1, 1942. The camp was a hellhole, with most men sleeping under buildings or on the ground. “There was no netting to protect the men from malaria-carrying mosquitos as they slept, so many men soon became ill with malaria,” according to the Bataan Project. “The Archbishop of Manila sent a truckload of medical supplies to the camp, the Japanese commandant refused to allow the truck into the camp. When the Philippine Red Cross sent medical supplies to the camp, the Japanese took 95% of the supplies for their own use. When a second truck was sent to the camp by the Red Cross, it was turned away,” according to the Bataan Project. “The POWs in the camp hospital lay on the floor elbow to elbow and only one medic — out of the six medics assigned to care for 50 sick POWs — was healthy enough to care for them. When a representative of the Philippine Red Cross stated they could supply a 150-bed hospital for the camp, he was slapped in the face by a Japanese lieutenant.” Private First Class Delbert J. Kohler was considered too ill to be transferred and remained in the camp hospital. According to records kept at Camp O’Donnell, PFC Delbert J. Kohler died on Tuesday, June 2, 1942, from dysentery and was the 1,145th POW to die in the camp and was buried there. The Japanese military didn’t release information about Kohler, so it is not known when his parents learned of his death. But after the war, they requested that he be buried at the new American Military Cemetery in Manila. He was reburied in Plot L, Row 11, Grave 58, according to the Bataan Project website. The second gold star on Olson’s banner is for Russell Haukedahl, gunner’s mate third class in the Navy during World War II. In April of 1945, “the ship was under attack by Japanese warplanes,” Olson said. “Russell was able to gun this plane down. He saved his fellow sailors and he saved his ship.” But his helmet flew off and he was seriously wounded by metal fragments. “He became unconscious,” Olson said. “A medic ship came to pick up the injured sailors. Ironically, on that ship was Cameron, Russell’s brother. Russell died that night and was buried at sea, with his brother there watching.” ADVERTISEMENT His graveside is at Immanuel Cemetery in Audubon, along with his family. He does have a military stone in his honor. “What can we do to support our veterans? We can fly our flag, especially on patriotic days like today,” Olson said. “We can write our elected officials on behalf of our veterans. We can show our support for our veterans in a VA hospital or nursing home by sending care cards or care packages, and make them visits. We can wear our poppies on Memorial Day to support our military. We can show our respect to our VFW and our American Legion. One of their mottos is ‘they will not be forgotten.’’’ Others who spoke at the Memorial Day program Monday in the Pavilion included Detroit Lakes VFW Commander Jason Bristlin, who gave opening and closing remarks, and VFW Chaplain Gary Rehborg, who handled the invocation and the benediction, and gave a heartfelt, patriotic talk on freedom and liberty as expressed throughout the song that he said nearly became the national anthem, \"My Country ‘Tis of Thee.\" Sarah Hoffert read the stirring poem, “The Little Blue Forget Me Not,” and the Lake Region Veterans Color Guard posted and retired the colors, and gave a three-shot rifle salute outside while \"Taps\" was played. Prior to the program a Memorial Day parade was held down Washington Avenue.",

        "content": "A photo of Toronto Maple Leafs star Mitch Marner and new head coach Craig Berube having a morning chat in an Etobicoke coffee shop has taken social media by storm. The image, captured by an eagle-eyed fan, has sparked widespread speculation among Leafs Nation about the nature and implications of this meeting. Marner and Berube spotted having a chat this morning ???? What are they talking about? ????: @vinterista_ pic.twitter.com/sNJdT4KpBX In Toronto, where every move related to the Leafs is intensely scrutinized, the unexpected sighting has fueled various theories. Is this simply a casual conversation between a player and a coach, or does it signal something more significant about Marner’s future with the Leafs? Chances Are This Is Just Marner and Berube Getting To Know Each Other Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman recently suggested that discussions between Marner and the Leafs would begin soon. While it is unclear if this meeting involved or was initiated by Leafs GM Brad Treliving, the timing has raised eyebrows. Could this be Marner sharing his thoughts on his role in Toronto, or is Berube exploring the possibility of integrating Marner into his no-nonsense, north-and-south style of play? The meeting seems to echo similar ‘getting to know you’ sessions, like the one John Tavares said he was also going to have upon his return to Toronto. It might involve discussing how Marner’s play style could mesh with Berube’s system. Depending on their mutual understanding, this could herald a new chapter in Marner’s career or hint at an impending departure from Toronto. With the Leafs’ off-season under intense scrutiny, any decision regarding Marner’s future will be closely watched. What Does The Berube Body Language Say, If Anything? Analyzing the photo, some fans have speculated that the body language on display is telling. Berube’s posture, leaning back with crossed arms, might suggest defensiveness or reservation. However, body language can be easily misinterpreted, and influenced by mood, energy levels, and context. An open posture usually indicates friendliness and openness, but Berube’s stance could just reflect a momentary disposition rather than a concrete stance on any issue. The internet has also seen its share of humor about the encounter. Some fans jokingly remarked that Berube must be working wonders already if he got Marner to engage in a corner – a playful jab at Marner’s perceived reluctance to battle in the corners of the rink. Ultimately, this meeting could signify Marner’s willingness to work with Berube and stay in Toronto, countering the sentiments of a fan base eager for roster changes. As the off-season unfolds, the implications of this conversation will become clearer, shaping the Leafs’ strategies and Marner’s career trajectory.

Monday's rerun episode did not end with an emotional tribute to the late actor who was murdered on Saturday. But fans were not angry about that as they continued to share thoughts and their own tributes of Johnny. Instead, they were upset about the General Hospital official X's tweet commemorating Memorial Day. The tweet read, \"Happy Memorial Day, from all of us at #GeneralHospital!\" with an American Flag emoji at the end. Fans did not like the use of the word happy in the phrase. One fan wrote: \"Do better. It is not 'Happy Memorial Day'. What you are saying is 'happy remembering those that died in service to their country day'. It's not about bbqs and getting drunk today,\" A second fan said: \"Memorial Day is not happy. It’s for honoring the deceased men and women who gave all for our freedom. Fix this please.\" Another agreed: \"It not appropriate to say 'Happy Memorial Day'. The day is set aside to honor those who died serving the country. There is nothing \"happy\" about Memorializing the millions who have died in war.\" While the show hasn't had a TV tribute yet, they did take to their social media accounts express their sorrow over the 37-year-old's death. \"The entire General Hospital family is heartbroken to hear of Johnny Wactor’s untimely passing. He was truly one of a kind and a pleasure to work with each and every day. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones during this difficult time,\" The social media post said. Under the Instagram post with their tribute, many actors from the show commented. The actress who played Sasha (Sofia Mattsson) who played the wife of Johnny's character Brando took to the post. \"We will miss you so much, Johnny. One of the most incredible humans I've ever met,\" Sofia wrote, adding a red heart emoji at the end.",

        "description": "American YouTuber and rapper IShowSpeed further injured his leg chasing after the 3kg roll of Double Gloucester at Brockworth's perilous Cooper's Hill on Monday",
        "content": "An American YouTuber had to be hospitalised after diving headfirst into one of Britain's top bizarre customs. IShowSpeed - whose real name is Darren Jason Watkins Jr - had a hard landing at Gloucestershire's cheese rolling on Monday. The content creator and rapper braved the daunting Cooper's Hill event as dozens chased the roll of Double Gloucester down the steep slope. The annual tradition has seen many injure themselves in a bid for the 3kg wheel over the decades. And this year's event was no different, as many from across the world competed for the different titles. Darren, from Cincinnati, Ohio, said the race had aggravated a pre-existing leg injury and resulted in him needing hospital treatment, but was \"totally worth it\". \"It looks scary, but once that first slide, you're like, 'you know what I can do this',\" he said. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Darren said the race aggravated a leg injury he already had, but that it was 'worth it' ( Image: PA) \"I want to do it again because I know how to win now,\" the influencer told the BBC .Asked if he'd do it again he replied, \"hell yeah\". Gutsy competitors took part in six different races at Brockworth's perilous 1:2 gradient hill, taking home cheeses weighing 3kg and 1.5kg. While the official event was axed several years ago, the race has continued unofficially ever since. Taking home champion title for 2024 was German national Tom Kopke, who travelled all the way from Munich for the event. Winning the accolade, he commented: “England is mad.” This year’s women’s champion was Abby Lampe from the United States who took the title for a second time after a win in 2022. Dozens took part in the races despite health and safety warnings ( Image: PA) The final men's downhill race was won by local Josh Shepherd, from Gloucester, who had also previously won. Last year, the event put emergency services under pressure as several participants sustained injuries, with some even being carted off the site on stretchers. One high-ranking police official warned of \"mass casualties\", but the numerous health and safety warnings went unheeded as dozens battled it out on the 180m hill. Gloucestershire Police's Assistant Chief Constable Arman Mathieson acknowledged the event as a \"unique tradition, and we have no desire to stop it\". He added they don't wish to halt but cautioned attendees to consider the potential risks involved. One woman who won one of the races last year only learned of her victory upon waking in hospital after fainting at the finish line.",

        "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players’ parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers’ practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything’s good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It’s not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series with a 5-4 overtime win on Sunday , a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn’t matter; the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers’ Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we’re trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It’s not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia. The Rangers won that game 5-4, just as they did Sunday. Perhaps a good omen for the Panthers: the Flyers won the next three games of that series and went to the Stanley Cup Final. THIRD-PERIOD CATS Florida led the NHL in third-period goal differential during the regular season, outscoring opponents 99-63 in the final 20 minutes of regulation. Form is holding in the playoffs. The Panthers outscored the Rangers 2-0 in the third of Game 3 and are now plus-13 in that period in the playoffs. Florida has 21 third-period goals in this playoff run, allowing only eight. The Rangers haven’t been great in the third, outscored 13-11 in that period in the playoffs. But New York has been perfect in overtimes in the postseason; the Game 3 win improved the Rangers’ OT record this spring to 4-0. ___ AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press",

Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Footage of Celine Dion in a Scots city filming a music video in the 80s has resurfaced leaving locals in amazement. The Canadian superstar's song Lolita came out in October 1987 and featured a music video filmed in Edinburgh with one feature which has left locals baffled. One resident, Calum, posted a clip to TikTok informing his followers of the incredible discovery after the music video resurfaced, reports Edinburgh Live. While he said he \"understands\" choosing the city as a filming location, he was a bit more perplexed about the use of the capital's local buses. One follower commented: \"Maybe the director just rates buses?\" Calum, who shared a clip from the music video on his TikTok account, said: \"Did you know that in the 1980s in Edinburgh, Celine Dion actually filmed a music video? \"Weirdly enough, most of it appears to take place on a Lothian Bus. I know that sounds like a lie, but it's not. I can understand someone using Edinburgh as a location, it makes sense. It's a lovely-looking place. \"The Lothian Bus part, I understand less well.\" The music video starts off with some shots around the city, before showing Celine walking outside Waverley and jumping on one of the buses. As Calum rightly points out, she doesn't appear to pay the driver - shocking. He continued: \"There's lots of shots of buses. \"Princes Street somehow looks so much greener than it does now. She doesn't pay! That explains why our bus fares cost so much now. \"The rest of the video is kind of her walking around the same sort of locations. You see her walking across the road one way at Princes Street and then it looks like she's heading off to the St James Centre. \"Later on it looks like she's really upset and bothered, and runs back across the same street. I'm assuming at that point she probably saw the 1970s style monstrosity of a building that was round the corner at that point.\" Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

Jean Carroll, and he may be in for a third one after his Memorial Day attack on the woman who he was found to have sexually assaulted. Trump on Monday posted a lengthy attack labeled as a Memorial Day post. \"Happy Memorial Day to All, including the Human Scum that is working so hard to destroy our Once Great Country, & to the Radical Left, Trump Hating Federal Judge in New York that presided over, get this, TWO separate trials, that awarded a woman, who I never met before (a quick handshake at a celebrity event, 25 years ago, doesn't count!), 91 MILLION DOLLARS for 'DEFAMATION,'\" he wrote, referring to Carroll's cases. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy The New York Times' Maggie Haberman, who has spent a significant amount of time with Trump and continues to have sources closes to the ex-president's campaign, followed up on that. \"After Trump, who arrived in NY last night, attacked E Jean Carroll again on Truth Social today, her lawyer Roberta Kaplan says, 'We have said several times since the last jury verdict in January that all options were on the table. And that remains true today -- all options are on the table,\" Haberman reported on Monday. A commenter replied to Haberman, saying, \"Maggie- we have lost a lot of faith in you as a journalist. I am a very honest person and what we learned from the Trump trial was disheartening to say the least! It may take a very long time to build back trust. I can’t speak for all, but many feel this way. I won’t lie to anyone and if I error in some way, I own it. Completely own it and correct it.\" This prompted pushback from conservative lawyer George Conway and Trump biographer David Cay Johnston. \"I’m sorry, but this is just complete nonsense, and reflects a lack of understanding about journalism. A vast amount of the negative information we know about Trump, his administration, and his minions, comes from Maggie’s reporting,\" Conway said. \"I sat through the part of [Michael] Cohen’s cross-examination that mentioned her, and there was nothing untoward about her handling of him or anyone else.\" Johnston added: \"You clearly don't understand the role of journalists. Maggie has done extraordinary work in getting Donald to say things. That's her job. There's plenty of places for polemics, rants, and other opinion, but Maggie is a reporter, one of the finest I've ever known.\" CONTINUE READING Show less Fox News medical commentator Dr. Marc Siegel pushed back against a right-wing conspiracy theory claiming NFL player Billy Price got a blood clot because he was vaccinated for COVID-19. During a Monday Fox News segment on Price's blood clot, Siegel addressed the theory. \"COVID definitely has increased the risk of blood clots directly, especially early in the pandemic,\" the doctor explained. \"And everyone out there asks about the vaccine.\" \"I think we have the answer to that finally,\" he added. \"A huge study out of the UK and Estonia just looked at 10 million people who were vaccinated and 10 million people who weren't and those who were vaccinated and then got COVID had 70% less chance of getting a blood clot less.\" ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy The Fox News anchor urged Siegel to focus on Price at that point. \"The vaccination or not plays no part that we are aware of in this NFL player's story,\" the anchor said. \"I wanna bring you back to that for a second.\" Figures on the right have suggested Price was forced to retire because of the COVID-19 vaccine. \"Fox news doctor Marc Seigel just claimed that Covid and not the vaccine was causing the blood clots,\" one influencer wrote . \"Is there anyone in public life not owned by Big Pharma?\" Watch the video below from Fox News or click the link. CONTINUE READING Show less Donald Trump just dropped a \"hint\" on social media about the jury instructions in his criminal case in New York, and it shows prosecutors have a new advantage, a former prosecutor said Monday. Catherine Christian, a onetime assistant district attorney, appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump's hush money cover-up case, where he stands accused of paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels in order to impact the results of the 2016 presidential election. That case goes to closing arguments on Tuesday. The host asked Christian a series of questions about Trump's ongoing trial, including one about a Truth Social post in which Trump appears to be complaining about the instructions that will be handed down to jurors before they make their decision. Those decisions are not yet public. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy \"I want to show something he posted on Truth Social,\" the host says. \"I wonder if this gives a hint about jury instructions and what they might be. I know we haven't gotten an announcement from Judge Merchan, but I wonder if he has said something to the prosecution or defense, and I'm asking because Donald Trump said this, 'The reason the highly conflicted Judge Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is the corrupt Soros' ... so he's talking about three options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous. Is he talking about federal election crime, state election crime, tax crime as the underlying felony charge, and do you have a sense that they know what the jury instructions are going to be?\" Christian replied, \"I would hope that the defense and the prosecution know what the jury instructions are going to be since they're giving their summations tomorrow. I understand why the press and why we would all want it, [but also] why the judge didn't release it. He wants to make sure the first time the jury hears about this, and the jury is abiding by judge's rules, and not watching this right now, is the first time they hear about this is tomorrow, so that post by Donald Trump is sort of a hint, if you can believe Donald Trump, that maybe the instruction to the jury will be that the unlawful means, conspire to promote an election by unlawful means, could be the federal election law violation, could be tax crimes, state tax crime violation, so I have a feeling that that's probably what Donald Trump is talking about because his lawyers have a copy of the jury instructions the judge will give tomorrow.\" She added that it's \"definitely it's a gift\" to prosecutors. \"If the jury believes all of the evidence, it's a gift to them.\" Watch the video below or click the link.

        "content": "London Councillor suggests Christian Heritage Month being singled out by pausing city hall’s proclamation policy London City Hall, as seen on June 1, 2023. (Daryl Newcombe/CTV News London) Share Official proclamations issued by the City of London are back in the spotlight. On Monday, the Corporate Services Committee paused its review of three proclamation applications so that the policy can be reviewed once again. “There’s some inconsistencies in the way that we apply proclamations, as well as what we’re proclaiming, and I do think that it should be reviewed by staff just to make sure there’s alignment,” Councillor Corrine Rahman told colleagues. Rahman’s motion referred three requests for proclamations on the agenda to a future meeting of CSC while city staff review the proclamation issuance policy, including clarifying whether requests for proclamation can be made by individuals or must come from organizations. The three applications on the agenda were: Shine the Light on Woman Abuse (November) Christian Heritage Month (December) Childhood Cancer Awareness Month (September) “It feels as though it’s Christian Heritage Month that’s being pulled aside because it’s the one that has a persons name (on the application),” suggested Councillor Susan Stevenson. “I’m not sure why it’s being seen as though it’s an attack on, or pulling out one particular proclamation?” replied Rahman. Stevenson asked that all three proclamations be approved before the policy is reviewed by staff. “The referral was for all three proclamations,” Rahman said. “And it’s again tying the motion to a referral to review all proclamations.” “I do think that we need to put a bit of a pause on our proclamation approvals, and and review the policy before we continue to issue them,” added Deputy Mayor Shawn Lewis. “We give proclamations to anybody and everybody under the sun,” responded Councillor Paul Van Meerbergen before being informed that council has denied some proclamation requests in the past. There would be sufficient time for staff and council to review the policy before the dates of the three observances. The committee recommended the referral 3-2 (Stevenson, Van Meerbergen opposed). After refusing to make proclamations for more than 20 years, council adopted a new proclamation policy in early 2020 to acknowledge Black History Month. Since then, council wades through a variety of applications each month for official recognition of certain days, weeks, or months. Applications are received by the Clerk's Office, but it's up to council to decide which are approved. “This is taking a considerable amount of staff time,” Rahman explains. “We also have to see what’s the value added of having proclamations when they do take up staff time.” She adds that the city established an Anti-Racism and Anti-Oppression team since the proclamation policy was created, “And yet there is very little involvement from that team on how we look at proclamations.” “Is the request truly for an observance of an event a month or week for honouring, remembering and celebrating— or is it something else?“ Rahman concludes. “Sometimes those do come in, and so we have to be able to look at it from that lens.” Council will consider the referral and policy review at its meeting June 4.

Bichette led off the fourth with his fourth homer, a 419-foot drive to center. Nastrini (0-4) allowed three hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked four. Last-place Chicago lost its sixth consecutive game. It dropped to 15-40 for the worst 55-game start in franchise history. Gavin Sheets homered in the eighth against Erik Swanson for the only run for the White Sox, who went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position and left 11 runners on base.

Nathan Howarth, Development and Operations Director at the Concussion Legacy Foundation UK has warned that Tyson could risk a brain injury. The professional warned, in his discussion with Betway: \"Boxing has an inherent risk of concussion and then there's an increased risk of traumatic brain injury we have seen like bleeds on the brain.

The first reported cases from boxing are from the 1930s and we still see that in terms of boxing’s risk to CTE and it’s no secret that there is an element of neurodegeneration. There’s no definitive of what the risks would be but as someone who is 57, there’s clearly going to be a risk in terms of that age profile of potentially having more of an impact for someone who’s older.\" Trending The Tyson vs Paul boxing match is set for July 20 at AT&T Stadium and is anticipated to occur in front of a nearly or completely sold-out crowd. The venue, with a seating capacity of over 80,000, can be expanded to accommodate up to 100,000 fans, reflecting the high demand and excitement surrounding the event. The MVP Promotions frontman has openly acknowledged that his upcoming bout against Tyson will be the defining moment of his life. Paul participated in face-to-face encounters with Tyson during press conferences held in Texas and New York City to promote the event. These encounters allowed Paul to fully grasp the magnitude of the occasion as he prepared to step into the ring with the legendary boxer.

        "content": "Jannik Sinner has put the rumors to rest by confirming his relationship with fellow tennis player Anna Kalinskaya. The world No. 2, recently seen with Kalinskaya, had fans buzzing about a potential new power couple in the sport. Sinner candidly responded to an inquiry about their romance after his French Open victory, stating: \"I don't like to talk about my private life much, but yes, Anna and I are dating,\" in Italian. This confirmation follows fan speculation fueled by Sinner receiving a call from 'Anna' while taking a photo with a fan in Monaco. Both Sinner and the Australian Open champ were also observed dining out together and training at the same tennis club in Italy last month. Kalinskaya was present on Court Suzanne-Lenglen during Sinner's French Open match against Christopher Eubanks, although she had her own competition to focus on as she faced Clara Burel. Rafael Nadal provides retirement update after emotional French Open exit Andy Murray's French Open journey ends in defeat to Stan Wawrinka as retirement looms Andy Murray's French Open journey ends in defeat to Stan Wawrinka as retirement looms Sinner and Kalinskaya join the ranks of tennis's elite couples, including Katie Boulter and Alex De Minaur, Elina Svitolina and Gael Monfils, and Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa. Tsitsipas and the former world No. 2 began dating a year ago but split after the Madrid Open. Despite being seen together post-breakup, they both confirmed a reunion later on. \"He already said everything. It's pretty clear. The relationship is working very well now. He already explained. I have nothing else to say,\" noted Badosa last week. \"I mean, it's already our private life. I think one of the things that I didn't like or we didn't like is that it was very public, so now we want to keep things a little bit more on our own.\" \"I still understand that it's not going to be easy because we are two public people, public person, and people will ask, but we want to keep it more for ourselves because it's never easy to combine our careers to that. Let's just try to keep it simple for both of us, because I think it helps and it's healthier.\"",

        "content": "At the rate the Blue Jays have been going, nothing is ever guaranteed — even when playing the host Chicago White Sox at Guaranteed Rate Field. Then again, any game against the worst team in the bigs should be viewed as a guaranteed win. In White Sox starter Nick Nastrini, the Jays were facing the same right-hander who they lit up at home last week when Toronto won its first series in a month. In Chris Bassitt, who was drafted and played for the South Siders, the Jays had a veteran on the mound coming off a solid start (he went seven scoreless innings against the White Sox last Wednesday.) The Jays needed a win after a miserable weekend in the Motor City. A 5-1 victory over the White Sox on Memorial Day wasn’t worthy of popping champagne bottles, but it was refreshing nonetheless for a beleaguered ball club. It all lined up against Nastrini, who gave up a home run to Bo Bichette last week when the Jays brought back a revised look of the home run jacket during their 9-2 win. Bichette took Nastrini deep again Monday in the fourth inning as the Jays took a 3-0 lead on two hits, each going yard. Isiah Kiner-Falefa produced the Jays’ third hit on a two-out line drive into left field that went for a double as he extended his hit streak to six, a stretch that has seen IKF record 10 hits, including five for extra bases. Bassitt worked his way through a couple of jams to give his team five shutout innings. He looked to be in pain for someone who was nursing neck issues last week when he opposed Nastrini at Rogers Centre. Still, Bassitt struck out seven without issuing a free pass. Keep in mind the White Sox are the 30th-ranked offence in a 30-team league. Once Bassitt’s day ended, the Jays received solid pitching from Nate Pearson, who hasn’t been solid. The big righty gave the Jays two scoreless innings. Then came Erik Swanson, who looked to have turned a corner until he surrendered a leadoff homer in the eighth inning. A very long out deep into centrefield to the next hitter didn’t inspire much confidence. A single forced another pitching change as Zach Pop was summoned from the bullpen. Suddenly, Chicago had the tying runner at the plate. And then the game turned interesting when Pop gave up a two-out single as two runners were on base. Pop induced a fly ball to right field to end the inning. The Jays were able to exhale when Davis Schneider turned on a pitch with two outs in the ninth inning for a two-run homer as much-required add-on runs were produced. Genesis Cabrera began the ninth by putting the first two hitters on base. A double play eased any potential anxiety followed by a game-ending groundout. The Jays at least give themselves a shot of a sweep, which would be a first for a team that hasn’t been swept or produced a sweep. For what it’s worth, the Jays remain the lone team in the bigs to experience neither. It marked a first for George Springer when his name appeared in the starting lineup in the No. 7 hole, a career-leadoff hitter whose struggles at the plate have forced the Jays to move the veteran down in the order. He wasn’t in the lineup Sunday at Comerica Park where the Jays lost a 14-11 heartbreaker to the Detroit Tigers on a three-run walk-off homer in the ninth. One day later, Springer turned on the first pitch he saw in his first at-bat in the second inning and deposited into the sparse seats deep in left field. With two outs, Daulton Varsho, who went deep in Detroit during a five-run eighth inning to give Toronto an 11-9 edge, drew a walk before Springer’s belt. Springer’s long ball was his fourth of the season and first since April 24, a 22-game homerless span. In the opening series against the host Tampa Bay Rays, Springer went deep on back-to-back days to begin the season. In Springer’s second at-bat against Nastrini, once again he swung on the first pitch. This time he popped out in foul territory. Bichette’s blast was his fourth home run of the season. An inning later, a fielding error provided the White Sox with their second scoring opportunity against Bassitt. For Bichette, it was his fourth error of the season. He committed two in the second game of the season on April 29 against the Rays. Bichette didn’t make his second gaffe until May 5. Speaking of the number four, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. produced a four-hit game Sunday. On Monday with the Jays having runners at the corner in the sixth, Vlad Jr. hit into an inning-ending double play. Through eight innings, the Jays had four hits, including three from the bottom of the order. The fifth hit came in the ninth inning on a Springer leadoff single. In total, six were recorded, but half went yard. Springer’s multi-hit game was his first since April 24. Toronto’s restless fanbase, whose patience with the overpaid and underachieving club is increasingly growing thinner by the day, might want to take a look at the woeful White Sox and the plight of the South Siders. Chicago entered its series opener against the Blue Jays having lost five in a row, the most recent on Sunday in a 4-1 loss to the Orioles on a day when Garrett Crochet, who was lights out last week at Rogers Centre in a win, pitched well. What stood out from the loss to Baltimore involved White Sox manager Pedro Grifol and his post-game availability when he pulled no punch after he held a closed-door meeting. He described his team’s effort as “f—ing flat” and suggested the team had disrespected the game. “I don’t have much. Crochet pitched his (tail) off ... Most of the guys were (effing) flat. Unacceptable. That’s all I got. Flat. Period. Major League game. Gotta respect it. Pretty simple.” As bad as the Blue Jays have played, whether it’s a listless lineup, a porous pen, a poor outing by a starter, nothing compares to what the Pale Hose have endured and figure to endure in their march to recording the worst season in club history. The Jays arrived in Chi-town a season-low six games under .500. “For the fanbase and for everyone who is not here, as cliche as it sounds, there’s a reason we play this many games,’’ said Jays manager John Schneider during his pre-game availability. “You can say that it’s May or you can say that our season’s over. “The guys aren’t doing that. I’m not doing that.” fzicarelli@postmedia.com",

        "content": "The Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre) has expressed deep concern regarding the notable lack of transparency and accountability in the recent announcement by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Heineken Lokpobiri and current government’s drive for the oil and gas sector revamp. According to the Minister, a certain $16.6 billion has been invested in the oil and gas sector over the past year. HEDA in a statement signed by its Chairman, Olanrewaju Suraju called for immediate and thorough disclosure of the details surrounding this claimed investments that is unknown to the country or the host communities. HEDA emphasizes the necessity for the Minister to provide a comprehensive report on the investments for the necessary engagement of relevant stakeholders, stating that the report should include a detailed breakdown of the substantial $5 billion and $10 billion prospects towards deepwater offshore assets. According to Suraju , “We demand a full disclosure of the $1.6 billion purported investment in oil and gas asset acquisition in the face of devastating pollution and legacy of liabilities in the oil producing and impacting communities.” This call for clarity underscores HEDA’s commitment to ensuring that every dollar is considered against environmental, economic and social costs for the country and its people. He stated that HEDA is seeking detailed information regarding the recently publicized $20 billion deal with investors, aimed at significantly boosting oil and gas production in Nigeria. “The organization is not just interested in the broad figures but also in the social, environmental, and economic implications of the deals, including the timeline for its implementation and the expected outcomes. “Such transparency is crucial for public trust and for ensuring that the benefits of these investments are felt by the Nigerian populace. “HEDA Resource Centre reaffirms its commitment to promoting transparency and accountability in the oil sector and calls on relevant stakeholders to ensure openness and transparency in the sector.” According to him, this statement reflects HEDA’s ongoing dedication to advocating for responsible governance and its belief that transparency is fundamental to the effective management of Nigeria’s oil and gas resources. The organization continues to push for rigorous scrutiny and public disclosure to ensure that the sector operates in the best interest of all Nigerians.",

        "content": "The National Weather Service issued a report at 5:07 p.m. on Monday for strong thunderstorms until 6 p.m. for Warren County. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph and pea-sized hail (0.25 inches) are expected. \"At 5:04 p.m., Doppler radar tracked a strong thunderstorm 20 miles southeast of Erie or 7 miles west of Elgin, moving east at 30 mph,\" according to the weather service. \"Gusty winds could knock down tree limbs and blow around unsecured objects. Minor hail damage to vegetation is possible.\" Expect strong thunderstorms in the following locations: Columbus around 5:20 p.m. Spring Creek around 5:30 p.m. Lottsville around 5:35 p.m. Other locations impacted by this storm include Bear Lake, Starbrick, and Sugar Grove. The weather service adds, \"Persons in campgrounds should consider seeking sturdy shelter until this storm passes.\" Lightning strikes the United States approximately 25 million times each year, with the bulk of these electrical discharges occurring during the summer months. Tragically, lightning claims the lives of about 20 individuals annually, as reported by the weather service. The risk of lightning-related incidents escalates as thunderstorms draw near, reaching its peak when the storm directly looms overhead. However, it gradually recedes as the tempest moves away. To protect yourself during a thunderstorm, take these recommendations into consideration: 1. Lightning safety plan: When venturing outdoors, it's vital to establish a clear plan for seeking shelter in case of lightning. Monitor the sky for threatening signs and listen for the sound of thunder. If thunder is audible, it's an indication that lightning is nearby. Seek a safe place to shelter, preferably indoors. 2. Indoors safety measures: Once you've found shelter indoors, abstain from using corded phones, electrical appliances, or plumbing fixtures, and refrain from approaching windows and doors. Lightning can follow conductive pathways, and these precautions reduce the risk of electrical surges. 3. Wait for the all-clear: After the last lightning strike or thunderclap, wait at least 30 minutes before resuming outdoor activities. It's important to remember that lightning can strike even when a storm seems to have passed, so exercise caution. When indoor shelter isn't available: If you find yourself outdoors without access to indoor shelter during a thunderstorm, take these steps to maximize your safety: Avoid open fields, hilltops, or ridge crests, as they expose you to greater lightning risk. Steer clear of tall, isolated trees and other prominent objects. In forested areas, stay close to lower stands of trees. If you're in a group, ensure that individuals are spaced out to prevent lightning current from transferring between people. Camping in an open setting during a thunderstorm is strongly discouraged. If you have no alternative, set up camp in a valley, ravine, or other low-lying areas. It's crucial to note that a tent provides no protection against lightning. Do not approach water bodies, wet objects, or metal items. Although water and metal do not attract lightning, they conduct electricity effectively and can pose significant risks. In summary, when facing the threat of lightning, preparedness and vigilance are your best allies. By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of lightning-related incidents and prioritize your safety. Rain can turn roads into hazards. Stay informed and follow these tips from the weather service to ensure safety during heavy rainfall: Beware of rapid water flow: Avoid parking or walking in close proximity to culverts or drainage ditches, as the swiftly moving water during heavy rain can potentially carry you away. Maintain safe driving distances: Adhere to the two-second rule for maintaining a safe following distance behind the vehicle in front of you. In heavy rain, allow an additional two seconds of distance to compensate for reduced traction and braking effectiveness. Reduce speed and drive cautiously: On wet roads, slowing down is paramount. Gradually ease off the accelerator and avoid abrupt braking to prevent skidding. Choose your lane wisely: Stay toward the middle lanes - water tends to pool in the outside lanes. Visibility matters: Enhance your visibility in heavy rain by activating your headlights. Be particularly vigilant for vehicles in blind spots, as rain-smeared windows can obscure them. Watch out for slippery roads: Be extra careful during the first half hour after rain begins. Grime and oil on the road surface mix with water to make the road slippery. Keep a safe distance from large vehicles: Large trucks and buses can reduce your visibility with tire spray. Avoid tailgating and pass them swiftly and safely. Mind your windshield wipers: Overloaded wiper blades can hinder visibility. If rain severely impairs your vision, pull over and wait for conditions to improve. Seek refuge at rest areas or sheltered spots. When stopping by the roadside is your only option, position your vehicle as far off the road as possible, ideally beyond guardrails. Keep your headlights on and activate emergency flashers to alert other drivers of your position. In the face of heavy rain, these precautions can make a significant difference in ensuring your safety on the road. Remember to stay informed about weather conditions and heed guidance from local authorities for a secure journey.

        "content": "The Pittsburgh Steelers have some questions at wide receiver heading into the 2024 NFL season. They traded former Pro Bowler Diontae Johnson to the Carolina Panthers after rumors emerged that he was less than content with the quarterback situation. This left many expecting the team to select a top receiver in the 2024 NFL Draft, but they waited until the third round to take Roman Wilson out of Michigan. Does this mean the team feels confident that Wilson can join George Pickens, Calvin Austin III, Quez Watkins, and Van Jefferson in creating a well-rounded receiving corps? While the team was linked to many big-name receivers during the offseason, nothing ever came of any of the rumors, creating more questions than answers. However, another player may emerge from a more unlikely location: the United Football League (UFL). That player is familiar to Pittsburgh, Hakeem Butler. Butler has bounced around the NFL since being drafted in the fourth round in 2019 by the Arizona Cardinals. The Steelers found Butler while he was playing for the St. Louis Battlehawks in 2023. Pittsburgh signed him in May of 2023 and waived him in late August. But after another successful season with the Battlehawks, Butler is getting attention. He currently leads the UFL in receiving yard s with 619, has the third-most receptions with 43, and ranks second in touchdowns with five. When Fox Sports analyst Joel Klatt handed out his end-of-the-season UFL awards, he named Butler the Offensive Player of the Year. Do you agree with @joelklatt 's 2024 UFL Award picks? pic.twitter.com/JDZETNaoLj While Butler has not found the NFL success he'd hoped for when he joined the league, he could be one step closer. There was a lot to like about 6'5\", 227 lb. Butler when he showed up in Latrobe last year, but unfortunately, he wasn't able to find enough on-field success to earn a permanent roster spot. During his time in and out of the NFL, Butler has learned how to use his rangy frame to his advantage. He has said that he realizes he's hard to tackle , and thanks to encouragement from the Battlehawks coaches, he is auditioning for the job he wants. He has learned to compensate for being bigger than many receivers with toughness and refusing to quit. One thing Steelers Head Coach Mike Tomlin loves is fortitude, and Butler has it in spades. Despite his journeyman career, he continues battling and fighting for a team spot. With an even more successful year in the UFL and the possibility that holes exist in the Steelers roster, Butler could find himself being invited back to St. Vincent for another shot with the Black and Gold. As many expected, the Steelers didn't rush out and sign a big-name receiver this offseason, like Brandon Aiyuk or Courtland Sutton. Instead, they did what the Steelers tend to do: make slow and deliberate moves that ensure the team's long-term success. As a rookie, Wilson may not be ready to make an immediate impact as a starter right away; they may not actually need him to. The Steelers brought in a new Offensive Coordinator, Arthur Smith, and the playbook is expected to look much different. It seems likely that they will revamp their run game and utilize their tight end, Pat Freiermuth, more often. This allows the team to potentially get to camp and see how the current group performs before making any decisions. However, it is helpful to know someone with as much upside as Butler is out there if they need him. This article first appeared on SteelerNation.com and was syndicated with permission.",

        "description": "Located in northeast of country, colourful city is in the spotlight.",
        "content": "It’s deep, it’s dark, it’s eerie, it’s fun. It’s 100 metres down the shaft at the Sauberg Mine in Ehrenfriedersdorf, Germany. We’ve arrived at this incredible subterranean Ore Mountains destination on the same cable-car elevator that tin miners used to take to work. But, since the mine was abandoned in 1990 and eventually reopened as an attraction, it’s tourists who now descend to the depths in this specialized cage elevator operated by a motor attached to a massive, noisy spool of burly, braided metal cable. In the mine shaft, tourists can wander around in the murk, ride a small tram and even have a play at drilling for tin ore. It’s a unique way to give tourists a thrill and teach them about the Chemnitz region’s colourful mining history and culture. After all, mining, even if it’s now defunct, is part of Chemnitz’s culture and Chemnitz has earned the European Union’s esteemed European Capital of Culture title for 2025. Chemnitz — with a population of 250,000 — was also the host city for this year’s Germany Travel Mart, a huge conference for the country to promote itself to media and tour operators. As well, it was an opportunity for Chemnitz to show off what it has and what it has planned for its reign as European Capital of Culture. Besides plunging 100 metres toward the Earth’s core, that also means 1,000 events and 120 projects throughout the year from castle visits, reflecting on its East Germany history, myriad sculpture installations, concerts, art exhibitions and festivals (including a chocolate one, yum), car races, wine, sports, opera, ballet, high-tech and small business. “It’s an invitation for everyone to come here and leave some of their money,” Veronika Hiebl from the Chemnitz 2025 Committee said with a laugh. “Our motto is: C the Unseen, and up to now Chemnitz is the unseen, waiting to be discovered.” The European Capital of Culture title can go two ways — to a famous destination like Amsterdam, Athens or Glasgow, or to a lesser-known city that wants to put itself on the map like Graz in Austria, or Mons in Belgium. When the region was part of East Germany from post-Second World War 1948 to German reunification in 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell, the socialist party changed Chemnitz’s name to Karl-Marx-Stadt to honour the Communist philosopher and economist. Karl Marx never actually visited Chemnitz, but a 40-ton bronze bust sculpture of him 7.1 metres high on a 4.5-metre platform remains the city’s most famous landmark. Germany is littered with castles — 25,000 across the nation and hundreds of them in Saxony surrounding Chemnitz. In German, the word for castle is “schloss.” So, we went schloss hunting with Chemnitz-Zwickau-Region marketing manager Benjamin Schreiter, who did double duty as guide on the Valley of Castles tour. We hit up three castles — the former residence of the Schonburg-Waldenburg princes, Schloss Waldenburg; a former summer home of the Prince of Saxony, Schloss Rochlitz; and the former seat of the Count of Schonburg, Schloss Rochburg. Rather than being the setting for the shenanigans of aristocracy, the castles today are regal tourist attractions where you can dine and drink Riesling at on-site restaurants, see a concert, host a conference or get married. “Castles are not relics of the past, but vibrant hubs of cultural activity,” said Schreiter. “So, this area has been well-positioned for centuries as a cultural capital and being the European Capital of Culture next year helps put a label on it.” Chemnitz is located in northeastern Germany, a one-hour train ride from the nearest airport in Leipzig or a five-hour train from the international hub of Frankfurt. Lufthansa, Air Canada and Condor fly between the German cities of Frankfurt and Munich and the Canadian cities of Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax. Check out .",

Springer connected in the second inning after Daulton Varsho reached on a two-out walk against Nick Nastrini. It was Springer’s fourth homer of the season. Bichette led off the fourth with his fourth homer, a 419-foot drive to center. Nastrini (0-4) allowed three hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked four.

        "description": "Pumpkin was about to be put down when his saviour, Vet Dr Sharon Williams, drove five hours so rescue him",
        "content": "A dog who was seconds away from being put to sleep was saved at the eleventh hour after a vet checked her phone. The pocket bully, named Pumpkin, was heartlessly abandoned by his owner and tied to the gates of a council-run dog pound. He was about to be put to sleep after vets suspected he had cancer. But luckily for him, Vet Dr Sharon Williams decided to drive five hours to rescue him. Under the care of the kennels, Pumpkin was unexplainably and rapidly losing weight he'd come in at 30 kilos and dropped to just 15 within a few months, reports the ECHO. READ MORE Puppy found tied up and abandoned in secluded wooded area 'where nobody would find her' Vet Dr Sharon Williams, the founder of Celandine Wood Animal Rescue (CWAR), said the kennel staff 'suspected he had cancer' and due to the cost of care he was due to be euthanized. Sharon had in the past agreed to save another dog who was due to be put to sleep, from the same kennels. She got a message from staff to ask if she could also take in Pumpkin. She said: \"I phoned the woman and said yes, we can take Pumpkin. But she said, 'oh, you're too late'. They've just sedated him and they're now putting him to sleep. \"I'd been out cleaning my yard when I was text about saving Pumpkin. My heart sank, knowing that if I'd have just seen the text a few minutes before he would still be alive.\" Thankfully he has found his forever home (Image: Sharon Williams) But then Sharon's phone rang again, and the vet told her \"we can't find a vein\" and asked \"can you still take him?\" Sharon and a CWAR volunteer Paul jumped into her car and drove five hours to pick Pumpkin up. Sharon said: \"He had a little pumpkin-coloured jumper on him, which is where we got the name from, because he was actually called George. Although he was totally emaciated and looked tired, sad and ill, he wagged his tail when he saw us. You could just tell he just wanted to be loved.\" Under the care of Sharon, Pumpkin had blood tests and a specialist ultrasound scan done which ruled out cancer. Suspecting he may have food allergies, she put him on a specialist hypoallergenic diet and he soon began putting on weight. Within weeks of the special diet, he was like a different dog. Sharon added: \"He was thriving and full of life.\" Pumpkin has now been adopted by new owners who fell in love with him. Pumpkin was seconds away from being put to sleep (Image: Sharon Williams) Sharon said: \"One of our dog walkers took a shine to him, and she wanted to foster him, then she decided to keep him. His new owners take him for long hikes in the countryside, which he loves. He even has a wife, Ginny the miniature dachshund. He just loves people and is always happy when snuggled next to someone on the sofa.\" Sadly, CWAR is facing closure unless it raises £500,000 to set up new premises. They must vacate their shelter by June 14 because the landowner is selling up. The rescue centre, based in Wirral, currently has 50 dogs in its care and also takes in cats and wildlife from across the region. CWAR was founded after owner, Sharon began taking animals home with her which had been brought in to be euthanised for no good reason. She plans to build a facility that will quadruple the amount of rescue spaces so they can save many more animals. She said: \"Pumpkin was one of the lucky ones. But the reality is that the UK rescue system is at breaking point. I get around 10 requests a day to save desperate animals in need and we have to say no because we are full. The majority of rescues up and down the country are full to bursting. That leaves so many animals with nowhere to go.\" \"Celandine is run entirely by volunteers, who juggle rescue work with their jobs and family commitments. We are all so heartbroken when we have to say no and we're all passionate about growing the rescue. We want to be able to say yes to every animal we're asked to save.\" Sharon is appealing for people's help to grow the rescue. She said: \"We fundraise, but then with tests, medications and food, often one dog can cost thousands, and it wipes our funds out. We really need people who care about animals to help us so we can help them.\" To donate to CWAR, visit the GoFundMe here.",

The former lover has vowed to fight on after losing a long and bitter child support battle in court — insisting “This isn’t over yet”. The former Celtic player and manager has won his fight against claims he owed £43,222 in child maintenance to his ex.

It comes after a hearing earlier this month in which her lawyer said the Northern Irish Hoops hero, who pays £1,500 a month for the child, should have been paying more than what was agreed in 2011. We told in 2022 how he was served with a legal document stating he owed £43,222, which he disputed and took civil action against Ms Jonsen.

In 2008, after a test, his name was added as the father. His lawyer Marie Clark had claimed her client had been “prejudiced” by wrangling over the payments, 13 years after an agreement was reached. She said: “The charge is defective because it’s about a raise in the aliment. There’s a huge prejudice to the pursuer.” Sheriff Ward replied: “It could be said there’s a huge prejudice to the child because she is not getting what she deserves.” We told how Ms Jonsen became pregnant in 2006 after what Lennon described as a “moment of madness”.

        "description": "The NBA Hall of Famer lived a long, illustrious life in sports and activism, but his true love was a jam band from San Francisco",
        "content": "The summer of 2015 was a culminating moment in Bill Walton’s life. He’d been seeing the Grateful Dead , in all its iterations, for 48 years by that point. He’d been to hundreds upon hundreds of shows, but like so many Deadheads, the series of 50th anniversary shows in Northern California and Chicago (billed as Fare Thee Well) were going to be monumental: The first time most of the group’s surviving members would play together in years, and the last time it would happen. Walton, who by then was already known as one of the world’s most famous — and, with his six-foot-eleven stature, recognizable — Dead fans on the planet, spent the summer serving as an unofficial liaison for the group: giving interviews about the reunion and writing an afterword to a coffee table commemorating the shows. Walton, who suffered from chronic pain ever since he began suffering injuries as a teenager, was ready for the grueling run of marathon shows. His spine felt good, he had a new knee, he was ready. Walton stood amidst the massive crowd for the shows, which he described, in earnest hyperbole, as the “nine days that changed the world.” “Everybody was so happy and there was just the tears of joy and pride and gratitude,” Walton later told Relix of the experience of seeing the shows up close. “I got to be in the pit, 12 people deep, right in front of Bruce Hornsby. I was there , and I will never forget, and I feel terribly sorry for the person behind me.” Bill Walton, who died earlier today at age 71 of cancer, was known to most as a Hall of Fame NBA center, and, later, an illustrious and energetic broadcaster and color commentator on national television. But just as important to Walton was his lifelong love affair with the Grateful Dead. Walton became a familiar, unmistakable presence at Dead shows, blissed out in the pit alongside the band’s uttermost diehards. It didn’t take long for the band itself to notice the towering giant who began showing up to all of the band’s West Coast shows. The first time Dead singer-bassist Bob Weir noticed Walton out in the crowd, “I was thinking to myself, ‘There’s a truly tall individual.'” “He was the only one in the audience,” said the band’s drummer Mickey Hart. “I thought everybody else was sitting down, and of course they were standing up, and he was standing up too.” Editor’s picks Every Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History Such was Walton’s devotion to the band, that he attended upwards of 850 Dead shows in his lifetime, showed up to announce nationally-televised basketball games in tie dye, went viral for sorting through recyclables at Dead shows, showed up on stage at Dead & Company New Years Eve shows as “Father Time” (a nod to the character Bill Graham used to dress up as each New Years Eve), DJ’ed on the band’s Sirius XM satellite radio channel, and eventually, in 2021, was inducted into the band’s very own “Hall of Honor,” which he later described as the single most important distinction he’d ever received. But despite the attention and platform he received as one of the group’s most famous and recognizable true believers, Walton considered himself just another member of the Dead’s ever-expanding community of devotees. “I’m really just a fan,” he said in 2022. Throughout his career, and especially when promoting his 2016 memoir (titled, what else: Back from the Dead) , Walton frequently drew comparisons between his favorite band and the sport to which he devoted his life. “Playing in a band and playing on a basketball team, I’m sure, are very, very similar,” he once said . “It requires, first of all, tremendous discipline.” The Dead, he later claimed , helped make him the basketball player that he once was, and the person that he became. As a lifelong competitive athlete, there was a unique reward in being a fan of the Grateful Dead, Walton explained , because “they play all the time, and they win all the time.” Related From Trucker Hats to Joggers, Target's Grateful Dead Drop Has You Covered From 'Dead' to Toe Dead & Company Venture Out to Space — And Their Past — at Dazzling Sphere Opener Lost Robert Hunter Manuscript Chronicling Birth of the Grateful Dead to Be Released Walton’s love for the band was far more than a useful sports analogy. For him, his Dead fandom served as a guiding light and constant beacon of stability, community and inspiration in a life plagued by pain and setbacks. “For me, the Grateful Dead, there are so many different reasons why I love it so much, but they give me strength, they give me confidence, they give me hope, and they make me believe that tomorrow is like, going to be even better,” he said in 2016. “And at the end of the day, when they run off the stage and get out of there, I’m out in that pit just saying, ‘ Yeahhh , I’m with those guys.’” When Walton cleared his calendar for the nine Fare Thee Well shows in California and Chicago in 2015, he had merely one quibble with the shows: the fact that they marked an ending. “I am going to be there,” he said in the weeks leading up to them. “I am going to be cheering for more.” Trending The Boos Have It.

        "content": "BRITAIN'S Got Talent fans have been left fuming after the first of this year's finalists were announced. Viewers had been treated to eight auditions on Monday evening during the first live semi-final show of the week. But some were unhappy with the result. The rules see one act sail through to the live final on the public vote, while another is given a pass to the final by the judges. On Monday night, 'musician' Sven Smith, dog performers The Trickstars, child street dancer Trey Braine and slapstick act Bikoon! all took to the stage. They were joined by Ukrainian roller-skaters Duo Stardust, opera singer Innocent Masuku, singer Taryn Charles and the Ssaulabi Taekwondo Troupe. Innocent Masuku, Trickstars and Ssaulabi all made it to the top three after the vote was opened to the public. South African hopeful Innocent Masukuk was crowned the winner of the night based on the votes received, while the judges unanimously put through Ssaulabi to Sunday night's final. Dog act Trickstars were sent home. But not all viewers were impressed with the outcome, as they had wanted London-born singer and music teacher Taryn to get through. Writing on X, formerly known as Twitter , one raged: \"Erm Taryn was robbed!\" Another added: \"I'm shocked Taryn didn't make top 3.\" And a third blasted: \"What? Those bloody dogs over Taryn?\" There was also outrage that child star Trey Braine didn't get a place in Sunday night's live final either. \"Cannot believe Trey Braine has gone home, he was absolutely fantastic wanted him 2 win the show,\" another fan complained. Britain's Got Talent's live semi-finals are taking place at 8pm every night on ITV this weekend. The show will break for Saturday night, before returning with a bang for the big live final on Sunday evening. Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight .",

        "content": "The Mavericks won’t have their outstanding rookie center for Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, but they could get another veteran big man back in action. Dereck Lively II won’t play as the Mavericks try to close out the series against the Timberwolves on Tuesday, Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report and TNT reports . Lively is officially listed as doubtful to play by the team, ESPN’s Tim MacMahon reports . Lively suffered a neck sprain during the second quarter in Game 3 on Sunday when he fell backward in the lane and was inadvertently kneed in the head by Timberwolves forward Karl-Anthony Towns . Lively’s head snapped forward upon contact. He was down on the court for several minutes before appearing dazed as he was helped to the locker room. Lively has knocked down all 13 of his field goal attempts in the series. He had a 14-point, 9-rebound outing in Game 2. Fortunately for Dallas, Maxi Kleber could be back in action. He’s listed as questionable, according to MacMahon. Kleber has been out since May 3 due to a right shoulder injury, officially labeled an AC joint separation. He averaged 5.7 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 19.5 minutes per game while appearing in all six first-round games against the Clippers. Luka Doncic (right knee sprain/left ankle soreness) is also listed as questionable again, though it would be surprising to see Doncic sit out a closeout game. Doncic was a game-time decision on Sunday and wound up dominating with 33 points, seven rebounds, five assists and five steals in the 116-107 victory.

In February, The Hollywood Reporter said Meghan was to bring Archetypes back, with the Duchess telling the same publication she was proud to announce she was joining the \"brilliant\" team at Lemonada to continue her love of podcasting. She also said it felt fantastic to start 2024 being able to support of company founded by women which already had a number of \"thought-provoking\" podcasts. Meghan added: \"Our plan to re-release Archetypes so more people can now have access to it, as well as launching a dynamic new podcast, is well in the works. I’m so eager to be able to share it soon, and am overjoyed to be joining the Lemonada family.\" It emerged in April that the release date of the new podcast was pushed back to next year to allow Meghan to focus on her Netflix series about cooking, gardening and friendship.

WINNIPEG – Scott Arniel believes overcoming the lowest point in his career will help him reach higher aspirations with the Winnipeg Jets. Arniel was named the new head coach of the Jets on Friday, 12 years after his only other time in the role ended with hem being fired by the Columbus Blue Jackets. “One of the darkest times for me in coaching — probably in hockey — was when I got fired in Columbus,” Arniel said at a media availability at Canada Life Centre on Monday. “I had never been through it. It took a long time to get over it. “Whether it was anger or it was doubt. Whatever it was, it took a while. You can ask my wife, you can ask my kids, even some of my friends — I was a grumpy person.” Arniel, 61, did not know if this day would ever come again. “I’ve been sitting here for 12 years wondering, always wondering, ‘Am I ever going to get a second chance?’” he said. “And I’ll tell you what, there’s some great coaches in our league right now that got a second chance and a third chance, who are having great success, and I like to think I’ve learned a lot over these past few years that are going to help me move forward. “There’s only 32 of these jobs in the league and I feel fortunate to be a part of the NHL, part of representing Winnipeg and the Jets.” Arniel, who had been the associate coach in Winnipeg over the last two seasons, takes over the reins after Rick Bowness retired. He has come full circle since being drafted in the second round by the Jets in 1981, playing for the team for five years, then being traded away, then returning. He eventually played for the International Hockey League’s Manitoba Moose before becoming the team’s head coach in the American Hockey League. Arniel met his wife in Winnipeg and they raised their two kids in the city. Bowness and Arniel had led the Jets to a franchise-tying record 52 wins while earning the Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed last season. But, after going 52-24-6, the Jets bowed out in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the second straight year. “It’s a hard league and you can’t rest on what you’ve done in the past,” said Arniel, who wants the team to be five to 10 per cent better. “There are lots of teams that have success, then take a step back. That’s going to be a big message to our group. “We did a lot of good things because we worked at it. Guys bought in to how we needed to play. We feel like we have a pretty good handle on what it takes to be good in this league and one of those areas is defending ... We’ve got a little bit of a recipe for success, and we have to build on that.” Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff believed that Arniel had a good enough handle on the team to hire him after interviewing only two other candidates. “He’s sitting here today because he’s earned this opportunity,” said Cheveldayoff, who liked the way Arniel communicated with the players and handled the team under duress. “The reality is, you’re going to build upon something that the foundation has been laid.” Arniel, who posted a 45-60-18 record over a year and a half with the Blue Jackets, admitted that he was pretty green when he was hired by Columbus, but has since learned from his mistakes. He recorded a 15-7-3 record over three stints when he was pressed into duty — twice when Bowness was ill and once while his wife Judy recovered form a seizure. “It helped me to build confidence in myself and what I can do as a coach,” Arniel said. “In my coaching career, this is the greatest personal chapter to become the head coach of the Winnipeg Jets.” The Jets have parted ways with assistant coach Brad Lauer, but will keep assistant coach Marty Johnston and goalie coach Wade Flaherty. Arniel started to interview assistant coach candidates on Monday. He needs someone to take over special teams and the defence. Arniel also plans to hold a summer summit to improve the team’s use of analytics. Arniel gave a shout-out to his mother, who is almost 90. She was watching the press conference from Kingston, Ont.

Arniel was named the new head coach of the Jets on Friday, 12 years after his only other time in the role ended with hem being fired by the Columbus Blue Jackets. “One of the darkest times for me in coaching — probably in hockey — was when I got fired in Columbus,” Arniel said at a media availability at Canada Life Centre on Monday. “I had never been through it. It took a long time to get over it. “Whether it was anger or it was doubt. Whatever it was, it took a while. You can ask my wife, you can ask my kids, even some of my friends — I was a grumpy person.” Arniel, 61, did not know if this day would ever come again. “I’ve been sitting here for 12 years wondering, always wondering, ‘Am I ever going to get a second chance?’” he said. “And I’ll tell you what, there’s some great coaches in our league right now that got a second chance and a third chance, who are having great success, and I like to think I’ve learned a lot over these past few years that are going to help me move forward. “There’s only 32 of these jobs in the league and I feel fortunate to be a part of the NHL, part of representing Winnipeg and the Jets.” Arniel, who had been the associate coach in Winnipeg over the last two seasons, takes over the reins after Rick Bowness retired. He has come full circle since being drafted in the second round by the Jets in 1981, playing for the team for five years, then being traded away, then returning. He eventually played for the International Hockey League’s Manitoba Moose before becoming the team’s head coach in the American Hockey League. Arniel met his wife in Winnipeg and they raised their two kids in the city. Bowness and Arniel had led the Jets to a franchise-tying record 52 wins while earning the Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed last season. But, after going 52-24-6, the Jets bowed out in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the second straight year. “It’s a hard league and you can’t rest on what you’ve done in the past,” said Arniel, who wants the team to be five to 10 per cent better. “There are lots of teams that have success, then take a step back. That’s going to be a big message to our group. “We did a lot of good things because we worked at it. Guys bought in to how we needed to play. We feel like we have a pretty good handle on what it takes to be good in this league and one of those areas is defending ... We’ve got a little bit of a recipe for success, and we have to build on that.” Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff believed that Arniel had a good enough handle on the team to hire him after interviewing only two other candidates. “He’s sitting here today because he’s earned this opportunity,” said Cheveldayoff, who liked the way Arniel communicated with the players and handled the team under duress. “The reality is, you’re going to build upon something that the foundation has been laid.” Arniel, who posted a 45-60-18 record over a year and a half with the Blue Jackets, admitted that he was pretty green when he was hired by Columbus, but has since learned from his mistakes. He recorded a 15-7-3 record over three stints when he was pressed into duty — twice when Bowness was ill and once while his wife Judy recovered form a seizure. “It helped me to build confidence in myself and what I can do as a coach,” Arniel said. “In my coaching career, this is the greatest personal chapter to become the head coach of the Winnipeg Jets.” The Jets have parted ways with assistant coach Brad Lauer, but will keep assistant coach Marty Johnston and goalie coach Wade Flaherty. Arniel started to interview assistant coach candidates on Monday. He needs someone to take over special teams and the defence. Arniel also plans to hold a summer summit to improve the team’s use of analytics. Arniel gave a shout-out to his mother, who is almost 90. She was watching the press conference from Kingston, Ont.

        "content": "An Argentine court on Monday ordered President Javier Milei's government to release tons of food meant for the poor -- about half the population -- but held in storage pending an audit he had ordered. Aid to tens of thousands soup kitchens was frozen after Milei took office in December vowing to slash public spending and weed out corruption in the social welfare system. Earlier this month, dozens of raids were carried out against soup kitchens and the groups that manage them, amid accusations that the poor were forced to attend anti-government protests in exchange for food. The protests were allegedly organized to pressure the government into doling out more money and food, part of which never found its way to the intended recipients. Milei is seeking to eliminate the practice of using NGOs and political parties as intermediaries to deliver state aid and end what he calls \"the business of poverty.\" On Monday, a judge granted a request brought by aid organizations, ordering the government to provide a detailed breakdown of the food being withheld, and to proceed with distributing it \"immediately.\" The judge cited the vast number of Argentines \"acutely suffering from food insecurity.\" According to official figures, about 50 percent of inhabitants of the South American country live in poverty. On Sunday, the Catholic Church in Argentina urged the government to distribute the stockpiled food -- which it said amounted ro about 5,000 tons. Presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said Monday the government would appeal the court order. The food, he said, was being stored \"for emergencies or catastrophes.\" According to social organizations, there are about 45,000 soup kitchens in Argentina. Cabinet chief Nicolas Posse, in a recent presentation to congress, said preliminary audit results had revealed that almost 50 percent of soup kitchens that had been receiving aid \"do not exist.\" Cut off by the government, some continue operating today thanks to private donations. sa/lm/atm/mlr/dw",

        "description": "WINNIPEG - Scott Arniel believes overcoming the lowest point in his career will help him reach higher aspirations with the Winnipeg Jets.",
        "content": "WINNIPEG - Scott Arniel believes overcoming the lowest point in his career will help him reach higher aspirations with the Winnipeg Jets. Arniel was named the new head coach of the Jets on Friday, 12 years after his only other time in the role ended with hem being fired by the Columbus Blue Jackets. “One of the darkest times for me in coaching — probably in hockey — was when I got fired in Columbus,” Arniel said at a media availability at Canada Life Centre on Monday. “I had never been through it. It took a long time to get over it. “Whether it was anger or it was doubt. Whatever it was, it took a while. You can ask my wife, you can ask my kids, even some of my friends — I was a grumpy person.” Arniel, 61, did not know if this day would ever come again. “I’ve been sitting here for 12 years wondering, always wondering, ‘Am I ever going to get a second chance?’” he said. “And I’ll tell you what, there’s some great coaches in our league right now that got a second chance and a third chance, who are having great success, and I like to think I’ve learned a lot over these past few years that are going to help me move forward. “There’s only 32 of these jobs in the league and I feel fortunate to be a part of the NHL, part of representing Winnipeg and the Jets.” Arniel, who had been the associate coach in Winnipeg over the last two seasons, takes over the reins after Rick Bowness retired. He has come full circle since being drafted in the second round by the Jets in 1981, playing for the team for five years, then being traded away, then returning. He eventually played for the International Hockey League’s Manitoba Moose before becoming the team’s head coach in the American Hockey League. Arniel met his wife in Winnipeg and they raised their two kids in the city. Bowness and Arniel had led the Jets to a franchise-tying record 52 wins while earning the Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed last season. But, after going 52-24-6, the Jets bowed out in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the second straight year. “It’s a hard league and you can’t rest on what you’ve done in the past,” said Arniel, who wants the team to be five to 10 per cent better. “There are lots of teams that have success, then take a step back. That’s going to be a big message to our group. “We did a lot of good things because we worked at it. Guys bought in to how we needed to play. We feel like we have a pretty good handle on what it takes to be good in this league and one of those areas is defending ... We’ve got a little bit of a recipe for success, and we have to build on that.” Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff believed that Arniel had a good enough handle on the team to hire him after interviewing only two other candidates. “He’s sitting here today because he’s earned this opportunity,” said Cheveldayoff, who liked the way Arniel communicated with the players and handled the team under duress. “The reality is, you’re going to build upon something that the foundation has been laid.” Arniel, who posted a 45-60-18 record over a year and a half with the Blue Jackets, admitted that he was pretty green when he was hired by Columbus, but has since learned from his mistakes. He recorded a 15-7-3 record over three stints when he was pressed into duty — twice when Bowness was ill and once while his wife Judy recovered form a seizure. “It helped me to build confidence in myself and what I can do as a coach,” Arniel said. “In my coaching career, this is the greatest personal chapter to become the head coach of the Winnipeg Jets.” The Jets have parted ways with assistant coach Brad Lauer, but will keep assistant coach Marty Johnston and goalie coach Wade Flaherty. Arniel started to interview assistant coach candidates on Monday. He needs someone to take over special teams and the defence. Arniel also plans to hold a summer summit to improve the team’s use of analytics. Arniel gave a shout-out to his mother, who is almost 90. She was watching the press conference from Kingston, Ont.

        "description": "The International Shark Attack File identified Volusia County as the world's hotspot for sharks preying on humans with 351 unprovoked attacks identified since the earliest records they could find, which date back to 1837.",
        "content": "Florida is the shark bite capital of the world according to a report from the state’s Museum of Natural History and Florida University — with the area around Daytona Beach having the highest concentration of attacks anywhere. The International Shark Attack File identified Volusia County as the world’s hotspot for sharks preying on humans with 351 unprovoked attacks identified since the earliest records they could find, which date back to 1837. Florida, which has the longest coastline in the contiguous United States, has seen a whopping 928 attacks in that time frame, followed by Hawaii with 195, then California with 138 and South Carolina with 118. New York has only reported 24 unprovoked shark attacks in that time. The shark attack file found data for 1,640 total attacks in the US going back almost 200 years, which leads the table in terms of the country which has suffered the most attacks. The US is followed by Australia with 706 then South Africa which has seen 262 attacks, from all types of sharks combined. In 2023, the Shark Attack File documented 69 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide. Of those attacks, 36 of them happened in US waters. Florida had 16 cases representing 44% of the US total and 23% of unprovoked bites worldwide — and half of those were in Volusia County. Most of the attacks happened during the summer months between Memorial Day and Labor Day when more people are in the water. On Labor Day 2023, two swimmers were bitten by sharks in separate incidents near Ponce Inlet, just south of Daytona Beach. A man was bitten on his left hand, while a different shark bit a woman’s right foot. Neither attack was life-threatening. Lifeguards in Volusia County say they see sharks all the time but its very rare they attack. “Locals that live here interact with sharks on a daily basis and never have any issues,” Volusia Beach Safety Deputy Chief Tammy Malphurs told WKMG-TV. “The bites here are a case of mistaken identity.” “We’ve never had any life-threatening injuries,” Malphurs continued, “but we do have a lot of bites, mainly in the New Smyrna Beach area.” Last year’s shark attacks include the attack on Tatyana Koltunuk, of Queens , who was swimming last summer at Rockaway Beach when a shark took a chunk out of her thigh — the first attack there in 70 years. In addition to the 69 unprovoked attacks, there were another 22 bites that are classified as provoked, meaning humans initiated the contact with the shark. Other cases involved boats, aquariums, or post-mortem bites. According to the National Ocean Service , sharks’ scary reputation isn’t based in reality. Out of 300 species of sharks, only a dozen of them have ever attacked humans and they generally don’t like our taste, preferring to feast on other marine mammals. If you’re attacked by a shark, experts urge you to defend yourself as playing dead won’t work. People are encouraged to fight back, concentrating on attacking the eyes, nose and gills of the shark. Experts recommend if you have anything at your disposal such as a surfboard or fishing equipment, utilize those items to immobilize the shark. But most of all, don’t overthink the danger. “Sharks have only been known to attack humans when they are confused or curious,” the National Ocean Service says. “If a shark sees a human splashing in the water, it may try to investigate, leading to an accidental attack.”",

        "content": "The Education Above All Foundation (EAA), with the support of its strategic partner Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD), has successfully supported the graduation of 120 outstanding students out of 316 scholarship recipients at the American University of Beirut (AUB) through its Qatar Scholarships Programme. The diverse cohort of graduates, spanning various majors, specialties and backgrounds, was honoured in a ceremony attended by members of the AUB community, graduates, and their families. Of the 316 recipients of the EAA Qatar Scholarship Programme, 73 % are Lebanese, while the rest are Syrians and Palestinians, a press release by the EAA said. \"Over the span of four years and through a contribution of $4.2mn, Education Above All Foundation's Al Fakhoora Programme has provided invaluable opportunities for Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian students to pursue their academic journey at AUB,” said EAA Al Fakhoora Programme director Talal al-Hathal. “We are proud of the achievements they have attained today as their graduation signifies the importance of equipping oneself with the skills, critical thinking, and adaptability needed to navigate the complexities of life with a sense of purpose,\" he said. \"The Qatar Fund for Development strives to achieve its vision of promoting sustainable development and social justice through education,” said QFFD acting director-general Sultan al-Aseeri. “We believe that education is the foundation for building strong and resilient communities, and it is the best way to empower individuals to achieve their full potential and create opportunities while fueling sustainable growth.\" Qatar Scholarship Programme director Professor Joseph Costantine introduced in his speech the second edition of the Ace Talks competition, which is open to the students of the programme at AUB who would like to compete in public speaking, writing, presenting, and creative thinking. He emphasised the scholarship's goal of pushing students to think creatively, acquire new skills, and embark on remarkable journeys. Costantine also shed light on the programme’s significant accomplishments, including the launch of a new study abroad programme in collaboration with the EAA and Qatar Foundation. He said that the educational journey of the vast majority of adolescents and youth is hampered by economic instability, a refugee crisis, and others. Addressing these challenges, he continued, requires a comprehensive approach that involves tackling economic issues, investing in education infrastructure, and ensuring equitable access to education for all students, regardless of their background or geographic location. – QNA Related Story Qatar University, QDB organise 2024 'Al-Fikra' National Entrepreneurship Competition QU department celebrates success of Smart Start Campaign in primary schools",

        "content": "close Video Fox News Flash top sports headlines for May 27 Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Miguel Sano is the leader in the clubhouse for the weirdest injury of 2024. The Los Angeles Angels infielder has been on the injured list since May 1, retroactive to April 28, for left knee inflammation. Last week, the club sent him on a rehab assignment in the Arizona Complex League, as he was set to gear up for a return.

(Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images) But while rehabbing his injury, he got hurt even further — off the field. Angels manager Ron Washington revealed on Saturday that Sano left a heating pad on his leg too long and suffered a burn. While not thought to be serious, according to the manager, it clearly has hampered him quite a bit. He was in the lineup on Wednesday and Thursday, but hasn't played since then. Sano went 1-for-2 in each of his first two rehab games, doubling in his second one.

(Dylan Buell/Getty Images) DIVISION III SCHOOL ADVANCES TO COLLEGE WORLD SERIES DAYS BEFORE IT CEASES OPERATIONS By the time of the initial injury, he was hitting .262 (16-for-61) with one homer and five RBI. When he first came up to the big leagues, Sano was one of the best power threats in the game, twice hitting 30-plus homers in a season with the Minnesota Twins . However, he remained unsigned for the 2023 season after hitting a combined .217 from an injury-plagued time span from 2018 through 2022. It's been a rough go for the Angels, as Mike Trout suffered a torn meniscus after playing in just 29 games. He was on a power surge, too, hitting 10 homers by the time he had gotten hurt.

By Abdulyassar Abdulhamid Dr Yusuf Tanko, the former spokesperson of Peter Obi Presidential campaign in the 2023 elections, has said that former Anambra governor has been meeting with political gladiators in the country, including the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP), Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso. Tanko stated this during an interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today. He said that Nigerians needed a merger in 2027 that would take them out of the woods. Tanko said, “Obi has been meeting with owners of industries, technocrats, students and political gladiators. Adamawa Govt declares 3-day mourning for ex-EFCC boss Lamorde, lawmaker Okada riders invade Lagos Police Station, engage officers in ‘gun battle’ “There are quiet a number of them that have been reached out to, for example Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso who is a good political gladiator. We had met with him. “We had meetings with different individuals and political parties like SDP and ADC. Most of the political parties will be reached out to. They are already having meetings among themselves. “You need to have a conglomerate of grounded political parties who are interested in getting Nigeria out of the wood.” I don’t see Atiku, Obi alliance However, a former federal lawmaker, Tajjuddeen Yusuf, says he does not see the possibilty of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar merging with Obi in 2027. He said, “They worked together in 2019. It would not be out of place if they work together again. However, I don’t see their minds, but I don’t see the possibility. “They met few days ago. After the meeting, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar came out to say that he would continue to contest as long as he is alive and healthy. “To me, that was to send the signal to especially the people who may have the notion that he would step down for Obi. A statement a week later clarified that. I believe both Atiku and Obi will contest.” LEARN AFFILIATE MARKETING: Learn How to Make Money with Expertnaire Affiliate Marketing Using the Simple 3-Step Method Explained to earn $500-$1000 Per Month.

        "content": "Ferrari won its second Grand Prix of the 2024 season in Monaco and it was a special one for Charles Leclerc, with it being his home race. There were delirious celebrations at the Italian outfit’s garage as Fred Vasseur was ecstatic alongside the Monegasque driver. Now, in the broader scheme of things, the Ferrari team boss has also claimed that this season’s championship is still wide open for the taking. The Frenchman cited how there are three teams now in the fight for poles and race wins every weekend – Ferrari, Red Bull, and McLaren. While he admitted that the competitive advantage might swing in either team’s favor at different tracks, they are within striking distance of having a chance for the 2024 title. Even Red Bull admits that they are under pressure and not at their dominant best like in 2023. The Austrian team struggled at the Miami and Monaco GP races, with their RB20 facing major handling issues in the Principality. Meanwhile, McLaren and Ferrari have polished their challengers with significant upgrades in Miami and Imola respectively. At the Monaco GP, both teams locked out the front two rows and finished the race accordingly to take a massive chunk of points in the constructors. While Monaco is a peculiar track, Vasseur knows that they have the pace and potential to keep Red Bull in check for the rest of the season. The past three races have given enough evidence of why the Ferrari boss is openly claiming a championship fight in 2024. Can Fred Vasseur’s prophecy carry on at the Canadian GP? After three consecutive races where Red Bull have not looked at ease , it won’t be an easy recovery for the defending champions going into the next round in Canada. However, with the Montreal track being a unique one, nothing can be said about Ferrari and McLaren’s competitiveness, too. Max Verstappen has stated that their car has a fundamental design issue of having handling issues on tracks with excessive bumps and kerbs, essentially street circuits. Monaco was the classic example of the same with the Austrian team experiencing similar issues last year in Singapore. While Red Bull performed rather well at the 2023 Canadian GP, it is pertinent to note that they had a decent performance advantage at that point of the season. 12 months later, with Ferrari and McLaren being relatively closer on ultimate pace, this year’s Canadian GP could be a wide-open battle. There are unique elements to the track in Montreal with long straights and fast chicanes that may tilt the performance balance in either team’s favor. Thus, on a circuit with overtaking opportunities galore, another race where Red Bull comes second best is not outside the realms of possibility.",

        "content": "Oftentimes in recent years, the eccentric Bill Walton, a lover of nature and the Grateful Dead, could be seen on a Pac-12 broadcast in a tie-dye shirt, finding new ways to make broadcast partner Dave Pasch laugh. The UCLA legend, two-time NBA champion and Basketball Hall of Famer, who died Monday at 71 after a battle with cancer, was an accomplished broadcaster for CBS and NBC before joining ESPN and ABC in 2002 as an NBA game analyst. Some of his most memorable moments as a broadcaster, though, came when he shifted to college hoops broadcasts in 2012, and a supercut of amusing soundbites was posted to social media Monday after Walton’s death. The best of Bill Walton on commentary: pic.twitter.com/MqwNQZj2dg It features Pasch telling Walton to take a bit out of a cupcake while the candle in it was still lit — and Walton proceeding to do just that. One time the two were joined by Jay Bilas, who was wearing a tie-dye shirt that Walton praised, saying he has one. “This is your shirt,” Bilas replied. Walton once brought dirt from Temecula and rubbed it on his arms and face, saying afterward, “Now I’m ready to go.” During one Oregon game, Walton was enjoying National Popcorn Day by pouring some on Pasch’s head and putting some in the Ducks mascot’s mouth. “Please, party on,” Walton said. “It’s a wonderful day, it’s Oregon, the sun was out.” In the middle of an Oregon-Arizona game in 2020, Walton was holding a large stone and said to Pasch, “I was just carrying it around. I was wondering if you’ve ever been stoned before,” and handed the stone over. Bill Walton asks Dave Pasch \"Have you ever been stoned?\" and \"Where are your stones?\" amongst other things pic.twitter.com/Q85ZBneqC7 Other memorable moments included him briefly going shirtless to change shirts, playing a Glockenspiel, and saying he “found that mushrooms only help you.” He once called a White Sox-Angels came with Jason Benetti and said, “I’m not a very good catcher. I’m much better at getting high than getting low.” And one time with a Hawaiian lei around his neck, Walton said, “It doesn’t get any better than this. I just got lei’d.” Walton wasn’t sure he’d make it as a broadcaster because of a stutter he dealt with at times, but he became an Emmy winner.",

Ecuador’s only representative at the Olympics in the road cycling race and individual time trial will be Jhonatan Narváez, the national cycling federation said in a statement on Monday. Carapaz said on his social media he wished “the best of luck to Jhonatan,” and added he will keep reaching for new goals. The two cyclists had a tough battle for Ecuador’s spot in Paris. Carapaz was the first Ecuadorian to win a grand tour, the 2019 Giro d’Italia. He also made the podium at the Tour de France and Spanish Vuelta, but hasn’t finished any grand tour since 2022. This year, he won a stage and finished seventh in the Tour de Romandie in Switzerland in April. The Olympic champion claimed in various interviews that the process to earn Ecuador’s only road cycling spot in Paris favored Narváez. The federation rejected the accusation. Carapaz urged the country’s sports ministry to intervene in the decision but that hasn’t happened so far. Narváez, winner of the road cycling race in the Pan American Games in Santiago last year, has yet to comment on the decision.

While they are few and far between, luckily, we still do get decent discounts from time to time. Such is the case with Sabrent's recently released Rocket 5 PCIe Gen5 NVMe SSD, as its 1TB variant has dropped to the lowest-ever price of just $171 (buying link below). Sabrent Rocket 5 4TBPCIe 5.0-based NVMe SSDs are very fast, and the Sabrent Rocket 5 is no exception. Sabrent claims the 1TB Rocket 5 is capable of delivering 13,000 MB/s of sequential reads and 9,500 MB/s of sequential write speeds. In terms of random throughput, Sabrent says read IOPS (input-output per second) can hit 1300K while write IOPS can hit 1400K. Image via AnandTechAs you can see in the spec table above, the 2TB and 4TB drives are even faster when it comes to writes, so if you want even better write performance, you can opt for those higher-capacity variants. However, irrespective of what you get, make sure you grab a heatsink, as PCIe Gen5 SSDs are known to run dangerously hot as they are very fast.

        "content": "Vernon Davis announced his retirement from the NFL in 2020, making his first year of eligibility for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2025. While Davis played for the Denver Broncos, winning a Super Bowl there, and the Washington Commanders, he is best known for his time with the San Francisco 49ers. Davis ranks seventh all-time among tight ends in points scored with 382 and 11th in receiving yards with 7,562. His receiving yard total falls just short of the average among the tight ends already inducted into the Hall of Fame, which is 7,656 yards. The Hall of Fame's criteria for inductees are stringent, understandably so. Still, fans often question why certain players are overlooked for induction. For example, 49ers fans can't believe that Roger Craig has yet to be inducted, which seems like a significant oversight by the selection committee. For Davis, the former tight end isn't overthinking his place in NFL history. Speaking to our own Al Sacco and Brian Renick on the \"No Huddle\" podcast last week , Davis acknowledged that he isn't too concerned with what might or might not happen. LISTEN and SUBSCRIBE: https://t.co/P4XtOqhjAu pic.twitter.com/h2ZfSLVowL When asked if he's taken the opportunity to think about his Hall of Fame chances, Davis responded, \"I never really thought about it. Look, if it's meant for me, then it'll happen. If not, then it won't. But I'm a firm believer in whatever is supposed to happen for a person, then it will happen, whether now or later. \"So it's just one of those things. I just go on in life, try to go on with a positive attitude, and just hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\" Davis added, with a smile, \"And if it's meant, then, hey, I'll take it.\" Drafted sixth overall in 2006, Davis finished his 14-season career with 63 touchdowns. In addition to two Pro Bowl selections (2009, 2013), he was named a second-team All-Pro in 2013 and was part of the 49ers team that competed in Super Bowl XLVII. You can listen to the entire conversation with Davis below. This article first appeared on 49ers Webzone and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "Ant McPartlin made a sweet reference to his newborn son as he returned to work on Britain’s Got Talent tonight. The 48-year-old became a first time dad earlier this month when he and wife Anne-Marie Corbett, 46, welcomed their first child together on May 14. After keeping the pregnancy a secret, they finally shared their happy news on social media and revealed they had named their son Wilder Patrick McPartlin. Sharing a black and white snap cuddling the tot, Ant wrote: \"Welcome to the family. Wilder Patrick McPartlin. Born 14/05/24 at 8.54am. Baby is beautiful, Mummy’s a legend, Sisters are over the moon. Dad’s a mess!\" And after just two weeks as a dad, “over the moon” Ant couldn’t resist talking about his little one as he returned to host a week of BGT semi-finals with sidekick Declan Donnelly . As Dec started reeling off a checklist of items supposedly needed for BGT, which included nappies and other baby-related essentials, Ant quipped: “That’s my list you idiot!” Later on, judge Simon Cowell briefly stopped the ITV show to say a special congratulations to the new dad . He said: “Can I just say congratulations to you Ant. I really am happy for you.” A made up Ant replied: “Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you for your lovely gift,” before asking where everyone else’s presents were. He joked: “Judges – still waiting on yours!” Who are the Britain's Got Talent finalists? First two acts revealed in tense semi-final Ant's pals Simon Cowell and Declan Donelly have been giving him parenting advice ( Image: PA) Simon himself became a dad later in life at the age of 54 back in 2014 and is now a proud parent to 10-year-old son Eric, who he welcomed with partner Lauren Silverman, 46. Though he is 64 now, Simon has been open about wanting to add to his family – despite once vowing he never wanted children. Describing son Eric, who is named after his own late father, as “the best thing that ever happened” to him, Simon shared last year: “I love every second I spend with him. And then I’m thinking about the next steps. He’s going to be a teenager and those years ahead. I had such an amazing experience all through those years. And I was thinking prob­­ably because of that, I’d like to do it again. Will it happen? I don’t know but would I love another kid? Yeah.” Simon has also been giving parenting advice to his close pal Ant, who he has known for over 20 years. He said: “When I heard Ant was going to become a dad, I told him it would be the best thing that ever happened to him. I basically said the first nine months are a bit strange because they can't talk to you. I remember saying to Lauren about Eric at one point: 'I don't think he likes me.' But then after a year everything changes and it's hilarious, it's great fun, and you'll really really enjoy it. And it will be life-changing. I'm really happy for both of them.” Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads Do you have a story to sell?

        "content": "PREPARATION In this photo taken on May 24, fishermen in Masinloc, Zambales, are making the most of the remaining days before the onset of the rainy season, which may come in the next few days, according to Pagasa. —Joanna Rose Aglibot SAN ANTONIO, ZAMBALES, Philippines — Aside from the continuing presence of Chinese coast guard vessels in their traditional fishing grounds in the West Philippine Sea, small-scale fishermen in this province are also bracing for the impact of the northeast monsoon on their source of livelihood and other economic activities. Also known in coastal communities as “sigwada,” the northeast monsoon forces fishermen from various municipalities in the province to suspend their operations due to large waves and strong winds. This phenomenon occurs from the last week of May to August. READ: Zambales fishers lament China Coast Guard’s bullying in Scarborough According to fishermen, it would be unsafe to venture into the sea because of the danger of strong waves and wind. “This meant more than three months of famine among the fishermen and other poor people along the coast,” Joey Marabe, provincial coordinator of fisherfolk group Pamalakaya, told the Inquirer in an interview on Monday. He noted that in recent years, fishermen have been left without a livelihood and received little support from the government during the rainy season. A small fishing boat with two to four fishermen spends at least P500 for gas and other expenses every fishing trip within the municipal waters and could earn from P1,000 to P1,500, depending on the market price of their freshly caught fish. “While no one wants to suffer from the effects of sigwada, it is criminal negligence for the government to do nothing during this period of calamity,” Marabe said. He said that despite the disaster and emergency funds available to the relevant government agencies, the most vulnerable sectors, such as the fishermen, were not receiving sufficient support. Ronnel Arambulo, Pamalakaya vice chair, said a P1-billion fund from the Department of Agriculture’s quick-response fund is available annually to mitigate the effects of disasters on the agrifisheries sector. He said they have already started to coordinate with coastal communities across the country to monitor the potential impacts of sigwada and ultimately mobilize the fisherfolk to seek sufficient economic support and other forms of aid from the government. “We are starting to conduct consultations with the fishing communities with the aim of insisting on the economic and livelihood support they deserve not only in the province of Zambales but also in different parts of the country where the disaster of the monsoon is expected,” said Arambulo in a separate interview.

Hermogenes Ebdane Jr. said the provincial government has short- and long-term programs in place to address the needs of local fishermen and has set the stage for sustainable fishing by putting up millions of pesos in funds for fisherfolk to go into “payao” fishing, a system that uses fish aggregating devices in open sea.",

        "content": "Inquirer photo/Noy Morcoso MANILA, Philippines — A woman selling her 8-day-old baby and a government employee who served as her broker have been charged in court for qualified trafficking and child exploitation. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said on Monday that the baby’s mother, 29-year-old Ma. Chariza Dizon, and her broker, Arjay Malabanan, have been charged in the Manila Regional Trial Court. The pair may face life imprisonment if found guilty for qualified trafficking under the 2003 Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act (Republic Act No. 9208) as amended by RA 10364. READ: 2 arrested as police foil baby’s sale on FB In a resolution dated May 17, Deputy State Prosecutor Olivia Laroza-Torevillas and Assistant State Prosecutor Claire Pagayanan of the DOJ’s task force against human trafficking recommended no bail for the trafficking charge. But on the child exploitation charge, they recommended a bail of P80,000. The DOJ prosecutors said the evidence given by the Philippine National Police’s Women and Children Protection Center was “uncontroverted” and “sufficiently established” the crime of qualified trafficking of the newborn. Dizon and Malabanan were arrested in a police entrapment operation on May 15 in Dasmariñas City, Cavite. According to the DOJ, the PNP acted on the request of the National Authority for Child Care in February to investigate the “proliferation” of illegal adoption and child trafficking through Facebook. A police operative pretended to want to adopt a child and wrote on her Facebook account: “I’m hoping for a blessing ... baby,” which drew several offers. The operative reportedly received a message on Feb. 29 from an account named Kuy’s Jay, who later turned out to be Malabanan, offering to sell a newborn for P90,000, excluding his commission. On May 13, Malabanan reportedly made several follow-up calls to the operative, including a video call where he showed his ID as a computer operator for the Dasmariñas City local government. On May 15, the police operative and a companion who pretended to be the spouse met Malabanan and Dizon who brought her baby, at a church in Dasmariñas City, where the two were arrested.

        "content": "History has seen leaders whose thinking have been influenced by geography—who after gaining power usually felt the need for their territorially deficient or confined countries to expand as an expression of national power and prestige. Today, this is the case of Chinese President Xi Jinping who thinks of his country as being boxed in and which therefore feels the need to expand geographically toward the sea. However, when one goes back to most of China’s history, the focus of its economic and political activities has been geographically inward with the end in view of enhancing economic productivity and instituting peace and harmony. Thus, when one looks at China’s vast topography, the land is sloping down to the east, with the lowland area being well-watered by the large Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The tilling of China’s fertile lands has been an important influence in its landward focus of socioeconomic development efforts. Its conflicts with its inland neighbors who live in porous borders have also contributed to the development of this inward focus in its efforts at building a militarily and economically strong state. Thus, we see the territorial expansion even of the powerful Han, Tang, and Yuan dynasties as being focused only within the confines of the continent.After the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the subsequent regimes of Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao were also characterized by inwardly focused administrations. But when Xi assumed China’s leadership, he strengthened mass surveillance, advocated for “wolf warrior diplomacy” and changed “China’s passivity” into an assertive strategy to defend China’s dubious claims over border and marine territories. The two major reasons why Beijing might undertake military action particularly against Taiwan are promoting China’s territorial and national identity aspirations and, more importantly, Xi’s own personal ambitions and sense of legacy. However, going back again to China’s geography, Xi must be made to realize the blunt geographic truth for China that conflict in the Taiwan Strait would occur directly off the shore of its most economically and militarily important and populated coastal provinces. A war would have an immediate impact on the three provinces nearest to Taiwan, namely, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, which together account for 22 percent of China’s GDP and 17 percent of its population. And China has no geographic “defense-in-depth” endowment, i.e., no easily traversed space to which it can retreat. Moreover, the damage will not be limited to coastal provinces but will still spread to interior ones which are part of an intricate network of domestic supply chains. Ballistic missiles may even find their way to the Three Gorges Dam—the world’s largest capacity hydroelectric power station which if destroyed could cause widespread inundation of China’s great plains. Thus, while China’s heartland suffers from the curse of proximity to enemy lines, its adversaries—particularly the United States—enjoy the blessing of “defense-in-depth” through the existence of what are called the three Pacific island chains. These island chains include the fortified areas of the Japanese archipelago, Taiwan, Mariana Islands that include Guam, Caroline Islands, Australia, and Hawaiian Islands, among others. The geomilitary capacities of these island chains provide strategic multiple encirclement by US and allied forces. Indeed, any invasion, especially on Taiwan, could entail major economic, financial, diplomatic, and reputational costs for China. Simply put, even if China gains Taiwan, it will have sacrificed its larger ambition of becoming a global superpower. This is the very definition of a Pyrrhic victory! Aside from the need for the international community to advise Xi against his risky territorial ambitions, there is also a need for policymaking circles in Beijing to persuade him to abandon his costly plans and to just focus on enhancing China’s already robust economy. And they can remind him to just observe this sound advice of Deng Xiaoping: “Hide your strength, bide your time, never take the lead.” Meliton B.

        "content": "Photo from the Alliance of Concerned Teachers MANILA, Philippines — The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) has said it plans to make full use of the recent Supreme Court decision declaring Red-tagging as a threat to one’s life by citing it in a complaint it will file with the Commission on Human Rights (CHR). ACT Chair Vladimer Quetua said the group was still gathering information about last month’s distribution by the military and Department of Education (DepEd) personnel of leaflets referring to students who belong to youth groups as terrorists during a seminar at Taytay Senior High School in Rizal province. READ: Supreme Court: Red-tagging threatens one’s right to life, security For ACT Teachers party list Rep. France Castro, the incident was a “clear case of harassment and intimidation” and a “blatant disregard” of the recent Supreme Court ruling. She said the leaflets were distributed by the Philippine Army’s 80th Infantry Battalion and DepEd Rizal. Using comic strips, it showed how students could avoid “recruiters of the CPP-NPA (Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army)” who may be spotted in rallies “teaching us to be angry at the government.” “After that Supreme Court decision, we anticipated that the government would finally, finally end this kind of practice, but they are still doing it and it’s just disappointing,” Quetua added. He said they would soon file a complaint with the CHR, adding that they would also check if the distribution of such leaflets was also happening elsewhere. The National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-Elcac), however, denied the group’s accusation, saying “a careful perusal and review of the said pamphlets [would] easily prove that there [was] no ‘Red tagging’ in the said materials.” It added that it did not target any organization, adding that “it merely informed the students of the modus operandi of recruiters of the New People’s Army, which is factual and based on evidence.” According to NTF-Elcac, the 80th Infantry Battalion held the seminar as part of a civic education program to raise awareness on national security threats and promote patriotism among the youth, in line with a memorandum of agreement between it and DepEd. “[These] seminars provided factual information that allows the youth to make informed decisions affecting their lives. The seminars were conducted transparently with the consent and cooperation of the Division of Rizal and attendance was voluntary. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Much has been written in the Philippines about the 1904 St. Louis Exposition, where more than a thousand Filipinos were displayed, put on exhibit, and made to perform rituals, including one which was faked—slaughtering and eating dogs—and probably one of the most remembered by Americans who went to the exposition, stereotyping Filipinos as dog-eaters. The exposition opened on April 30 so we just had its 120th anniversary, one which is being commemorated by the Missouri History Museum, which recognizes that the exposition was both “grand and shameful.” But first, a point of clarification about the name. Many people, including myself, call it the 1904 St. Louis Exposition but that name was used for a fair that was held almost every year for several decades in the 19th century and meant more as an agricultural county fair. The 1904, although held in St. Louis, Missouri, took a different direction. It was actually meant to be the United States’ first world fair, a grand affair to commemorate the Louisiana Purchase a century earlier that greatly expanded the US territory. The event in 1904 was meant not just to commemorate the Louisiana purchase but also to proclaim American might, and what better way to do this than to include an exhibit of Filipinos, natives of its new territory across the Pacific. The exhibit was meant to project the US’ belief in Manifest Destiny, expressed by US Sen. Alfred Jeremiah Beveridge, in a speech delivered at the fair: “We will not renounce our part in the mission of our race, trustee, under God, of the civilization of the world ... He has marked us as His chosen people, henceforth to lead in the regeneration of the world.” William Taft, the Philippine governor general, praised the fair for helping in the US’ pacification of the Philippine Islands, for opening new markets for American goods, and opening access to the archipelago’s natural resources. It’s not surprising there was more than a display of Filipinos. The human exhibits moved and performed. A schoolhouse was built with real classes daily, to show how America was educating the natives. There were three categories of Filipinos with “Visayans,” all dressed up singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” in the morning to represent the fruits of America’s civilizing mission. This was not the first time Filipinos, or people of color, were put on exhibit by the colonial powers. During the Spanish colonial period, Filipinos were put on display in international fairs in London (1851), Paris (1855, 1867), Vienna (1873), Philadelphia (1876), Amsterdam (1883), Madrid (1887), Chicago (1893). After the St. Louis fair, some of the Filipinos were practically kidnapped by entrepreneurs and moved to other places in the US, still for display. Jose Rizal and other Filipino members of the Propaganda Movement in Spain were furious about Madrid, writing in La Solidaridad, “Let the Philippines not forget that her sons have been treated like this, to be exhibited and ridiculed.” In 2023, The Washington Post ran a series of exposés about the Smithsonian Museum’s “racial brain collections” put up by Ales Hrdlička, sometimes called “the father of physical anthropology.” Hrdlička was a racist and collected brains to use for his pseudoscientific research trying to prove racial differences in the brains. Among the brains were at least four obtained from Filipinos who had been part of the 1904 exposition. One young woman, given the name “Maura,” had died of pneumonia on her way to St. Louis. Her skull was found but not her brain. All of these “research” activities were done without the permission of the Filipinos and their families. We need to include this exhibition in our social science and history textbooks, including its broader context of racism and imperialism. The racism included the maltreatment of African-American visitors to the exposition, who received such shabby treatment that the National Association of Colored Women declared a boycott of the exposition. The discussions in our schools should be broadened to discuss the other human zoos where Filipinos were displayed, together with other people from the colonies of other Western countries. We have to remember, too, that the young country that was the US also preached Social Darwinism, an imaginary world where whites were believed to be at the pinnacle of evolution. This is why the exposition in St. Louis included exhibits of impressive technologies still new even to the American public, including a wireless telephone, an improved x-ray machine, personal automobiles ... and incubators for infants born premature. The incubators were disastrous, using live infants put on display inside the incubators for the public to watch. Of the 43 babies used for the exhibits, 39 died. The fair had many other exhibits to show the world what America had achieved in science and technology. —————– Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "The practice of “othering” or looking at those who hold social, economic, and overall cultural values that are quite different from ours is a result of social exclusion. This is usually done by the ruling majority population in a geographical area, leading to another oppressive practice of sidelining (or in popular Filipino slang, “pag-itsa puera”) of the voices of minority populations. Provinces in the country that are ruled by the majority of lowland-based Christian Filipinos are most likely to disregard the belief systems of minority groups, among them Mindanao Muslim migrants, and do not consider these in local development planning and decision-making. The opposite is also true for some local government units in the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao that are dominated by Bangsamoro Muslims. Some localities in the mainland areas are not only populated by Bangsamoro Muslims (Magindanawn, in the two Magindanao provinces; and Meranaw in Lanao del Sur province), but also by indigenous communities of Teduray, Teduray-Lambangian, Blaan, Manobo, and Higaonon, among others. In addition, a substantial number of residents or those born in several localities in the region, like Cotabato City, are considered legal constituents there. They are referred to as the “settler communities” of the autonomous region. Republic Act No. 11054 or the Bangsamoro organic law (BOL), created the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), an integral offshoot of the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro signed in March 2014 during the administration of President Benigno Aquino III or P-Noy. It was the result of a long and tedious peace process spanning the terms of five Philippine presidents—Corazon Aquino, Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and P-Noy. The BOL provides for the legal guarantees of basic rights of not only its majority Muslim (Bangsamoro) populations but also of the indigenous and settler communities in it. The BARMM government has created the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples’ Affairs and the Office for Settler Communities as part of the regional autonomous bureaucracy. However, in a few localities in Maguindanao del Norte and del Sur, some indigenous communities of the Teduray and Teduray-Lambangian have expressed how the phenomenon of social exclusion reared its ugly head after the destructive Tropical Storm “Paeng” (international name: Nalgae). Several Teduray and Teduray-Lambangian houses were buried under huge rocks, mud, and floodwaters as a result of Paeng. Consequently, 27 people were killed (some Teduray regional leaders claim there were more)—they were buried alive when their houses collapsed in the onslaught of the eroding soil and boulders from nearby Mount Minandar. Their houses, built through a municipal relocation project of the municipality of Datu Odin Sinsuat in Maguindanao del Norte, were located near the foot of Mount Minandar, which is just across the coastal barangay of Kusiong. It is called Sitio Tinabon, in reference to the concave nature of the area. According to a fact-finding report of one Teduray-Lambangian member of the current Bangsamoro Transition Authority, the Teduray community in the area initially opposed the relocation site in consideration of their traditional belief that the area in Sitio Tinabon was considered “sacred.” For them, the area was a transition site for the souls of the departed among them, before they are brought to their final destination through the sea that is just across the sacred site. But the local government leadership there considered this as just a superstitious belief; it ignored several appeals from the Teduray community there and decided to go ahead with the relocation project. As a generally peace-loving people, the indigenous Teduray community beneficiaries of the relocation site assented to the local government leadership decision. A few years after, Paeng struck, hitting the relocation houses first, among others, since these were right at the foot of the mountain whose soil had loosened as a result of long years of intensive logging (since the martial law years of the elder Marcos), and of mining it of gravel for local construction needs. Social exclusionary practices of local government units have exacerbated the effects of “natural” storms that happen frequently among the impoverished, marginalized, and sidelined indigenous communities in the region. There is a need to revert such practices toward more social inclusion—engaging indigenous communities at every step in the planning and decision-making processes, even during the conception stages of any development project, until its implementation. —————– Comments to [email protected] Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Is this the worst Senate in Philippine history? One is tempted to agree. Just look at the “hearing” led by Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, which made a mockery out of the august chamber. The senator, who attained his status largely on the coattails of former president Rodrigo Duterte’s tenure, was a picture of embarrassing incompetence and performative antics. For some critics, the whole “PDEA leaks” hearings under Duterte’s former police chief—arbitrarily dragging in even actress Maricel Soriano—were nothing short of a clown show, which only exposed the troubling deterioration in the quality of membership in the country’s highest legislative office. Sure, the whole back-and-forth between former PDEA agent Jonathan Morales and Sen. Jose “Jinggoy” Estrada Jr. was entertaining. Arguably, the shadowy former drug enforcement agent pulled off one of the most memorable “UNO reverse card” moves, when he reminded everyone that it was Estrada, not him, who was actually convicted of a crime. The preposterous charade ultimately cost Sen. Juan “Migz” Zubiri his Senate presidency. Coupled with the “footgate” of Sen. Ramon “Bong” Revilla (another senator who remained in office despite facing serious criminal charges), this was the final straw. Zubiri was already facing backlash from his colleagues for lack of decisive leadership, which contributed to, inter alia, delays in the legislative process and the prolonged Quiboloy drama. Nevertheless, there are rays of hope. Over the past two weeks, Senators Risa Hontiveros and Sherwin Gatchalian provided us with a masterclass in legislative scrutiny. The curious case of Bamban Mayor Alice Guo has rightly raised alarm bells across the country and beyond since it has clear national security implications. The controversial mayor’s case came to the limelight after as many as 875 people were rounded up at the Bamban-based Chinese online casino, Zuan Yuan Technology Inc. amid accusations of kidnapping by a former alleged detainee. As if allegations of human trafficking and gangster-level crimes weren’t enough, the Philippine National Police has also revealed that they are examining whether the Chinese online casino was also involved in surveillance and hacking of government websites. In short, there is considerable evidence to suggest a toxic cocktail of criminal syndicates and espionage-influence operations at play. Things turned even more surreal when Guo, who allegedly owned the aforementioned Chinese online casino, failed to provide any proper documentation or narrative on her true origins. Efforts to “humanize” her story, thanks to a lengthy interview with a celebrated journalist, only backfired after her extremely lavish lifestyle was exposed—including the ownership of a helicopter and more than a dozen vehicles, all purchased in the final years of the pro-China Duterte administration. The intervention of Gatchalian was particularly crucial because it exposed the paucity of any accusation of “Sinophobia” by pro-Beijing proxies. As a patriotic Chinoy, Gatchalian is not only deeply knowledgeable about the lives of the Chinese-Filipino community but also in a position of moral authority to expose the perilous national security implications of not only Guo’s case but also the proliferation and persistent presence of Chinese online casinos. The newly crowned Senate President Francis “Chiz” Escudero was quick to share his own two cents by seemingly ignoring all the national security concerns in favor of placing the burden of proof on his fellow senators and government agencies. While I do agree with him that due process is a kernel of our legal system, I find the genealogy of his intervention quite curious: What did the good senator say about the brazen violation of human rights, our constitutional, and thousands of extrajudicial killings during the Duterte administration, again? But did we really need such sensational Senate hearings to expose Guo’s stupendously suspicious case? In any robust democracy or self-respecting nation, her case would have been dealt with de rigueur by authorities without much fanfare. And what happens when news fatigue sets in, and the nation moves to the next controversy? Ours is not yet a mature democracy since we are, to use the terminology by philosopher Guy Debord, a society of the spectacle (“La société du spectacle”). Instead of instituting the foundations of rule of law, and proactively guarding our national security, we simply move from one “separate pseudo-world” and fragmented yet sensational representation to another at the risk of turning into a banana republic. —————– [email protected] Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Every year, Menstrual Hygiene Day is a reminder of the critical need to address one of the most pervasive, yet least discussed aspects of girls’ health and empowerment: menstrual health and hygiene. For too long, the topic of menstruation has been shrouded in stigma and misconceptions, leaving girls feeling ashamed and uninformed about their bodies. In 2016, we published a study and found that girls learn about menstruation through a patchwork of myths and misconceptions from family and friends. Teachers often feel ill-equipped to discuss menstrual health, and the topic is frequently omitted or glossed over in school instruction. This lack of reliable information leaves girls unprepared and vulnerable to the physical and emotional challenges of menstruation. The lack of awareness among boys and men about menstruation often perpetuates teasing and stigma, creating an environment where girls feel unsupported and embarrassed. Education plays a pivotal role in ending this cycle. Understanding menstruation is essential for girls to grasp their body changes, maintain overall well-being, and empower them with knowledge about fertility and reproductive health. Educating adolescent girls about menstruation ensures they can manage their periods confidently, enabling them to make informed choices about their bodies and fostering a healthy transition into womanhood. Unicef is dedicated to empowering girls with the knowledge and confidence they need to manage their menstrual health with dignity and pride. We are supporting the #MeronAko campaign, an initiative led by the Department of Education (DepEd) in collaboration with the Center for Health Solutions and Innovations to reduce the stigma around menstruation through a series of workshops and colorful, adolescent-friendly materials. Last year, we introduced Oky, a period tracker application designed and created for and with girls in the Philippines. Oky more than tracks menstrual cycles, it delivers accessible, reliable, and engaging information about menstruation and other critical topics for young people, including relationships, mental health, family planning, and child protection. Through fun and creative content, Oky helps demystify menstruation and empowers girls to take control of their health and bodies. As of May 2024, Oky has reached 74,000 girls aged 10-19. Support from the DepEd, the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education in BARMM, the Department of Health, the National Youth Commission (NYC), and the Commission on Population facilitated roll-outs and integration into services. We want to help every girl in the Philippines access this application. Providing adolescent-friendly tools is a foundational step toward creating a world where girls and boys can talk about menstruation without shame. I remember girls proudly waving copies of the information booklet on menstruation that Unicef produced, saying that they now have the knowledge that they should have learned prior to their menarche. A couple of boys soon joined us and expressed that the booklets have enabled them to engage in healthy conversation with girls on menstruation and learned that it is normal and need not be a trigger for teasing and bullying. Normalizing menstruation and ensuring effective menstrual hygiene management entails that boys understand menstruation and its physiological, psychological, relational, and socioeconomic dimensions. It is critical for fathers like me to be part of, even facilitate, the conversation on menstrual health and hygiene with their children, girls, and boys. Menstruation signifies the beginning of the reproductive journey of girls. In effect, so, too, for boys. Without the involvement of fathers in promoting proper information and practice on menstrual health and hygiene, menstruation will not fully shed the stigma and shame for girls. On the other hand, men and boys’ proper knowledge can create the optimal environment for effective menstrual health and hygiene management. Through initiatives like these, we have seen significant advancement in policies and plans, with approximately 60 percent of schools now equipped with menstrual health information, education, and communication materials for both teachers and learners as of 2021. There has also been a substantial increase in the provision of emergency sanitary pads and information on proper disposal, with 82.5 percent of schools reporting such provisions in 2021. In the Philippines, Unicef is calling for more data and evidence on menstrual health to understand the realities of adolescent girls, increasing engagement of the government and the private sector, making manufacturers accountable for plastic materials recovery in sanitary pads, promoting alternative, affordable, and environmentally sustainable menstrual materials, and building the capacity of teachers for creative and interactive approaches to learning delivery on menstrual hygiene. —————– Jon Michael Villasenor is a water, sanitation, and hygiene officer in Unicef Philippines.

        "content": "It has been a recurring theme in my articles over the years how our government and the bureaucrats who run it at all levels seem to have turned obstructionism into an art. And while one feels this wherever government front-line services are involved, it’s in the process of starting an enterprise where this seeming obstructionist mindset probably inflicts the worst harm. True, laws have been passed to make it easier to start, operate, and sustain a business. Yet little seems to have changed in how things work in actual practice. The Barangay Micro Business Enterprises Law of 2002 (Republic Act No. 9178) provided incentives and credit facilities to encourage small businesses. The Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007 (RA 9485) mandated greater transparency and imposed maximum processing times for government transactions. Congress later saw the need to amend it in 2018 with the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act (RA 11032). But it has become clear that while rules can be legislated, good governance can’t. For all their good intentions, these laws appear to have had little effect on realities on the front lines. Stories still abound on the travails of small entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs who find the hurdles that government bureaucrats throw in their way so intimidating and exasperating, that many just choose to give up and forget it. The active online chat group of the Management Association of the Philippines has lately seen members share stories on their dealings with government. Someone told of his city government’s requirement for his firm to install a multimillion-peso sewage treatment system, supposedly based on a Department of Environment and Natural Resources regulation. “We decided to bite the bullet and had a system installed ... One year after installing, it still isn’t running because of delays in issuing permits from City Hall! Note that this same City Hall requires my staff to annually attend a food safety seminar and pass physical exams, even if we are an IT company. Talk about ease of doing business!” Another member shared their difficulties with a small nursery-kindergarten school started 44 years ago by his mother, and taken over by his wife when the mother passed away. “She had been okay for more than 13 years until the pandemic forced us to close the school ... After we re-opened in (a neighboring city) in 2022, the red tape it takes to formally close the school in (the old location) and open in the new location is still ongoing! Despite the stellar performance of the school with a 99.9 percent acceptance rate of its students to big schools that have accredited it, DepEd still insists on ‘protocol’ ... Very sad not only for entrepreneurs but educators as well!” Another member chimed in: “It took my friend and me three months to register a nongovernment organization for her, and a social enterprise for me ... Now that our documents have been finally approved, I don’t know if I still have any energy left to start operating, because we still have to go to other offices to complete the approval process, including opening a corporate bank account. I approached a bank that promotes itself as the best digital bank, but it asks for a list of 15 documents to submit! I have not returned to it. We will still have to go to the local government unit, the Bureau of Internal Revenue, etc. My friend and I now have first-hand experience on why we can’t attract more investors ... Why do we self-flagellate?” she asked. A veteran banker responded with what he described as “the tyranny of business registration.” He noted that of those who want to register a business, 95 percent probably have good intentions, while some 5 percent don’t.“ To prevent the 5 percent from registering, government makes it hell for everyone to register, including the 95 percent. And yet the 5 percent are still likely to be able to register because they know all the shortcuts, while many of the 95 percent will get fed up and give up. When finally the ‘registered’ bad guys mess up big time, government asks ‘how did these guys even get registered?’—and its ‘solution’ is to add more registration requirements, making it even more difficult for the 95 percent. But the additional requirements do not keep the bad guys away. And each new mess by the 5 percent gives birth to an additional registration requirement for everyone. The bigger the mess, the more cruel the new requirement becomes for the 95 percent. The hapless entrepreneur, who only meant to invest in his country, provide employment to his fellowmen, create value for his customers, and contribute to his country’s GDP, is punished. In the meantime, his government goes on expensive roadshows to invite foreign investors to join the 95 percent.” And that could well sum up how we keep punishing ourselves needlessly, year after year. —————– [email protected] Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

Reyes MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has again protested China’s annual imposition of a fishing moratorium in the South China Sea, including areas within the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). This was the Philippines’ 25th diplomatic protest against China this year and the 158th during the Marcos administration, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). In a statement on Monday, the DFA said that China’s unilateral fishing ban within the Philippines’ EEZ violated the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos). China’s fishing ban also “raises tension” in the West Philippine Sea and South China Sea, which contravenes the understanding between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping to de-escalate the maritime dispute, the DFA said. “The Philippines [calls] on China to cease and desist from the conduct of illegal actions that violates the Philippines’ sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in its maritime zones,” it added. China imposed the fishing ban in the South China Sea from May 1 to Sept. 16. Earlier, it announced that its coast guard would start detaining for 60 days without trial foreigners who trespass into areas in the waterway supposedly under its jurisdiction beginning June 15. The Philippines has opposed China’s new policy, which the DFA had said would be “in direct violation of international law.” It instead urged Beijing to “comply with its obligations under international law,” particularly the 1982 Unclos and the final and binding 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA also asked China to “adhere to its commitments” under the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.” It cited Paragraph 716 of the 2016 arbitral award, which states that any Chinese fishing moratorium in the South China Sea that includes the Philippines’ EEZ is considered a breach of Article 56 of the Unclos “with respect to the Philippines’ sovereign rights over the living resources of its exclusive economic zone.” The arbitral award handed down by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration declared without legal basis China’s claims over most of the South China Sea, including the Philippines’ EEZ. “The unilateral imposition of the fishing moratorium raises tensions in the West Philippine Sea and the South China Sea, and directly contravenes the understanding between [Marcos] and Chinese President Xi Jinping to manage differences through diplomacy and dialogue and to de-escalate the situation at sea,” the DFA said.

        "content": "Two blockbuster Senate hearings have gone by; local and national politicians have jumped into the fray; the President has weighed in on the fiasco, and government bureaucrats have sprung into action—all to untangle the puzzle that is this small-town mayor. Yet, in the weeks since she grabbed headlines and became a household name, the mystery has only deepened: Who is Alice Guo? The true identity of the young mayor of the second-class municipality of Bamban in Tarlac province continues to confuse and confound, as Guo has given conflicting, perplexing, and nonsensical answers to simple questions about her background. At the May 22 inquiry of the Senate women, children, and family relations committee, the woman at the center of an investigation into an offshore gaming hub in her alleged hometown and her purported connections to China spent several riveting minutes digging herself into a hole, as her questioners poked hole after hole in her story. Soap-operatic tale Appearing to be on the brink of tears, Guo, who wore a luxurious ensemble and toted a Goyard handbag, spun a soap-operatic tale of her humble roots as a pig farmer, the unwanted love child of a Chinese national, Jian Zhong Guo, or Angelito Guo, and his Filipino housekeeper, Amelia Leal, who, she claimed, had gone missing since giving birth to her on July 12, 1986. Right off the bat, the committee chair, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, presented birth records that put the lie to the mayor’s claim, as the documents indicated that her parents were in fact married and bore two other children. Confronted with this, Guo resorted to her usual excuse: “As much as possible, I don’t want to tell you that ‘I do not know.’ But I really don’t know the answer.” As it turns out, the true answer may be that Guo’s Filipino mother was just a figment of her imagination. At the same hearing, Philippine Statistics Authority legal director Eliezer Ambatali told senators that there was no official record of Guo’s supposed birth mother. “For now ... the possibility is high that [Amelia Leal] doesn’t exist,” he said. An irate Sen. Loren Legarda scolded Guo: “If you’re really Chinese and fronting for other people, go back to your country. But if you are a Filipino and you were born here, convince us because we want to be convinced.” But after the five-hour hearing, an unrepentant Guo faced reporters and insisted: “I’m a Filipino. I’m not a spy.” Association with Pogos Even President Marcos is skeptical, however. He noted last week that no one among Tarlac’s political elite had heard of Guo prior to her victory in the 2022 elections: “I know all the politicians in Tarlac, and no one knows her. We’re wondering where she came from. How did this happen?” Since then, the solicitor general has launched an investigation into whether Guo should face disqualification via quo warranto petition, while the interior secretary has endorsed the mayor’s preventive suspension to the Ombudsman. Over the weekend, Senate President Francis Escudero, a stalwart of the Nationalist People’s Coalition, which claims Guo as its own, rightly said the burden of proving her guilt should fall on her accusers. But he would be blind not to see how that is an impossible task when an accused person counters facts with half-truths and lies. It’s obvious to anyone with an iota of common sense that Guo has gamed our system, whether in regard to her origins and citizenship or to her election and ties to Pogos or the Philippine offshore gaming operators. At the very least, Guo’s prevarications tell us she has something to hide. But her identity is secondary to a more crucial question: Who does Guo serve? If she is indeed Filipino, then she must explain the source of her apparent wealth, her father’s alleged links to China, and her association with Pogos. National security crisis And if she is Chinese, the government must uncover the people behind her—the Chinese government, money launderers, the triad, or a gaming syndicate? The authorities must find out how she won a mayoral election as a charlatan, and which officials, local and national, aided her in her charade. Were they fooled or let themselves be fooled by the lure of laundered cash? Appallingly, the Commission on Elections has washed its hands by blaming the public for not challenging Guo’s credentials and credibility at the outset. Never mind that it is vested with the power to investigate candidates on its own initiative. What about immigration officers who have permitted the entry of countless foreigners as tourists, only for them to wind up as students, Pogo workers or trafficking victims? Or the Department of Foreign Affairs literally being fast and loose in issuing visas? Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address. I agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge that I have read the Privacy Policy . All these point to the disturbing conclusion that the Philippines has a national security crisis on its hands, and the mysterious Guo is just the tip of the iceberg. The bigger enigma, however, is this: How many other public officers elected to serve the Filipino people are serving other masters in secret?",

        "content": "If there is one person in the country on whom 12 million senior citizens are greatly indebted, it is none other than Albay 2 nd District congressman Joey Sarte Salceda, chairman of the present House Committee on Ways and Means. Senior citizens are oftentimes shortchanged by unscrupulous businessmen including famous fast-food establishments who limit their discounts to P40 per purchase, P5 discount for cakes and one leading coffee chain’s “one food item and one beverage per visit” policy. Hotels, restaurants, thru their “promo rates” directly dishonor senior discounts and 12 percent Value added tax (VAT) exemptions and this includes even our airlines. Even in the purchase of maintenance medicines, seniors encounter differing policies on discounts and vat exemptions. Estimated VAT leakages for Senior citizens alone in 2022 was pegged at P14.77-B. And sadly, even government’s National Commission on Senior Citizens (NCSC) is greatly remiss on their mandate and has only registered 4 million out of our estimated 12 million seniors, thereby abandoning the remaining 8 million seniors, who are either unaccounted for or inexistent. But Rep. Joey Salceda together with Senior citizens Affairs chair Rep. Rodolfo Ordanes and PWD affairs committee chair Rep. Alfred Bascug conducted 60-day marathon joint panel hearings on these problems, met with affected sectors and agreed on significant aspects to resolve them. As a result, three bills were filed to clarify and enhance the benefits for both Seniors and PWDs, namely House bills 10312, 10313 and 10314. The first, HB 10312 will clarify discounts and exemption rules if the establishments have their own discounts and promos. (The rule is that restaurant promos should be authorized by the DTI, and if they are not registered, the 20 percent discount and vat exemption apply). The second, HB1031, will do away with the massive booklets handed out to seniors and eliminate fake cards by electronic alternatives such as enrolling them on the EGovPH Super App launched by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT), This digital app streamlines access to government documents, permits, identifications and clearances, thereby enhancing the ease of doing business for the public. And the third , House Bill 10314 grants additional benefits for seniors and PWDs namely, 15 percent discount on electricity and water, 20 percent discount and VAT exemption on parking fees and skyways nationwide, Expanded basic necessities (groceries) discount for senior citizens from P260 a month to P500 a month, ease of access in online hailing and delivery platforms such as Grab, Angkas or Foodpanda or other deliveries. Rep. Salceda is the main architect of today’s immense health-related benefits enjoyed by senior citizens that were all included by him in the new tax reform landmark measures corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) and Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN). As a result , millions of senior citizens are enjoying cheaper VAT free maintenance medicines today . Today, there are more than 2,000 VAT-exempt drugs prescribed for cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, high cholesterol , TB, mental health and other ailments. This March, the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) added 20 more medicines for hypertension, cancer and mental illness. Their much lowered drug prices make them affordable to many senior citizens and other poor citizens. In 2022, discounts on medicines of 2.3 million seniors amounted to P113.7-B. Salceda explains, “The core of the Senior citizen’s welfare issue is how to address increasing needs for specialized services and reduced personal incomes due to retirement”. This naturally produces a gap in personal capacity to finance not just health care but even basic necessities and the little pleasures that come with dignified old age”. “The average senior , he says, makes around P3,000 per month which makes 47 percent of them below the poverty line. Rep.Salceda is determined to establish a separate insurance fund to cover projected P1.6 Trillion in health care for all senior citizens.. This is expected to address today’s “acute and catastrophic health care” for sick senior citizens and especially their burdened ordinary families. Salceda reiterates, “ The fiscal resources for health are not yet exhausted”. “The absorptive capacity of the DOH to spend its budget in full, typically falls short”. “There’s usually around P40-B in excess funds that can be used to support an aggressive seniors health insurance system”. “We are on our way there”, he says. So being a senior citizen myself, I would like to thank Rep. Joey Salceda for protecting, standing up for the rights, not only for us the 12 million senior citizens, but also the 1.5 million PWDs and 15 million solo parents , who for the past have been disadvantaged and neglected. And in order to prod him on, here are two of my favorite political quotes. First: Take care of families, and you take care of neighborhoods. Take care of neighborhoods, and you take care of communities. Take care of communities, and you take care of a nation. Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Port Moresby: More than 2,000 people are feared buried in a Papua New Guinea landslide that destroyed a remote highland village, the government said on Monday, as it pleaded for international help in the rescue effort. The once-bustling hillside community in Enga province was almost wiped out when a chunk of Mount Mungalo collapsed early Friday morning, smothering scores of homes and the people sleeping inside them. \"The landslide buried more than 2,000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,\" Papua New Guinea's national disaster centre said in a letter to the United Nations obtained by AFP. The main highway to the large Porgera gold mine was \"completely blocked\", it told the UN resident coordinator's office in the capital Port Moresby. The landslip was continuing to \"shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors alike\", the letter said. The scale of the catastrophe required \"immediate and collaborative actions from all players\", it added, including the army, and national and provincial responders. The centre also called on the UN to inform Papua New Guinea's development partners \"and other international friends\" of the crisis. The UN is scheduled to hold an online emergency meeting with foreign governments early Tuesday. They will try to coordinate a relief effort that has been complicated by the remoteness of the site -- which is situated in Papua New Guinea's rugged highlands -- as well as the severed road link and ongoing tribal fighting nearby. Locals and rescue teams have been using shovels and pieces of wood to find bodies under the landslide -- a mix of car-sized boulders, uprooted trees and churned-up earth that is thought to be up to eight metres (26 feet) deep. \"Nobody escaped. We don't know who died because records are buried,\" Jacob Sowai, a schoolteacher from a neighbouring village, told AFP. UN migration agency official Serhan Aktoprak told AFP that the danger was ongoing: \"The landmass is still sliding, rocks are falling from the mountain.\" Streams of water were flowing between the soil and debris, while cracks were appearing in land adjacent to the landslip, he added. \"This might trigger a further sliding,\" the UN official warned, posing a \"serious risk\" both to rescuers and people living in the area. Australia said on Monday that it would provide emergency relief supplies, such as shelters, hygiene kits and support for women and children. China's President Xi Jinping sent a message of condolences saying he was \"deeply sorry\" to learn of the disaster and offering assistance. US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and the World Health Organization have also offered support. The Vatican said in a statement that Pope Francis, who is due to visit Papua New Guinea in September, \"was deeply saddened to learn of the devastation... and he assures everyone affected by the disaster of his spiritual closeness\". Britain's King Charles III offered \"heartfelt condolences\" in a message expressing \"great admiration for the extraordinary resilience of the peoples of Papua New Guinea and the Highlands\". Locals said the landslip may have been triggered by recent heavy rains. Papua New Guinea has one of the wettest climates in the world, and research has found shifting rainfall patterns linked to climate change could exacerbate the risk of landslides. The death toll has been climbing since the disaster struck as officials reassess the size of the population lying beneath mud and rubble spanning almost four football fields in length. Estimating the toll is difficult because many people fleeing tribal violence have moved into the area in the past few years, said UN Development Programme official Nicholas Booth. Five bodies and the leg of a sixth had been pulled from the debris by Saturday night. More than 1,000 people have been displaced by the catastrophe, aid agencies have estimated. An outbreak of tribal fighting unrelated to the disaster was blocking attempts to bring in humanitarian aid from the provincial capital Wabag, the UN official Aktoprak said. \"Many houses are burning with others emitting smoke. Women and children have been displaced while all the youth and men in the area were carrying bush knives,\" he said, quoting from a report from an aid convoy attempting to reach the disaster site. The tribal battles had also delayed the delivery of heavy machinery and diggers. The area is located about 600 kilometres (370 miles) from Port Moresby. People from adjoining villages were helping to unearth bodies, said Nickson Pakea, president of the nearby Porgera Chamber of Commerce and Industry. \"Because of the hard rock and the clay, the stone, and the rocks that came in, it is quite messy. It needs excavators to remove the debris,\" Pakea told AFP. A nearby mining joint venture, New Porgera Limited, had agreed to provide mechanical diggers to help the rescuers and clear roads, he said. Located on the side of densely forested Mount Mungalo, the village was home to a transient population that could swell to more than 4,000 people. It served as a trading post for miners who panned for gold in the highlands. Since the start of the year, the country has experienced multiple earthquakes, floods and landslides, stretching the resources of emergency services.",

The act almost ended in a tragedy when Vlada flung on a trampoline towards her husband Yevhenii. Britain's Got Talent's biggest 'fix' rows Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight. She almost missed him, but was able to attach herself to his neck. He then launched them both into the air and they flung around at high speed.

        "content": "A veteran MLB scout who \"isn’t permitted to be quoted with his name by his club\" is the latest noteworthy member of the baseball community to predict that the New York Yankees will ultimately lose All-Star outfielder Juan Soto to free agency after the ongoing season. \"The Yankees better win this year because I don’t think they’re keeping Soto,\" the scout told Randy Miller of NJ Advance Media for NJ.com for a piece published Monday. \"He has (agent) Scott Boras representing him. Boras is going to ask for the world because he thinks Soto is the best player in baseball. I can see the Yankees offering Soto more money than Aaron Judge is getting (in his $360M contract), but (Yankees owner) Hal Steinbrenner isn’t going to fork over $150M more. He’s not going to pay Soto $200M more than Judge if that’s what it takes to match someone.\" Steinbrenner raised eyebrows and attracted criticism when he said last week that the Yankees' payroll is \"not sustainable\" over multiple years due to luxury-tax penalties. Soto, meanwhile, is expected to at least try to reset the market later this year and is routinely linked by reporters with the New York Mets. \"I do think someone will pay that for Soto, who already turned down $440M from the [Washington Nationals] a couple years ago,\" the scout continued. \"I think the Mets will give Soto $500M, maybe $550M, and he will go to whoever gives him the most money.\" There's no sign Soto will offer the Yankees any discount before or after he reaches the open market this fall. The 25-year-old suggested ahead of this past weekend that he is \"open to deal with anybody\" as a free agent. The first-place Yankees will enter Tuesday at 37-18. As for Soto, he recorded a .310 batting average with 14 home runs, 44 RBI and a .979 OPS across his first 55 games with the Bronx Bombers. \"Soto has been everything as advertised,\" the scout said about the slugger's New York tenure that began in December. \"It’s power. It’s patience at the plate.\" As of Monday afternoon, DraftKings Sportsbook listed the Yankees second among the betting favorites at +550 odds to win the 2024 World Series. Achieving that goal may be the only way that paying customers will tolerate Steinbrenner letting Soto sign with a different club this offseason.",

Pingua revealed he was not pushed hard enough by his opponents, especially the Ethiopian, Haftamu Gebresilase, the only other athlete to have broken 28 minutes over the 10km road distance before the race. “I was not pushed hard by those I competed against. The course is also very hard, especially towards the end,” said the Kenyan who, at the half way mark was on course to breaking the record after crossing with 14:10 with an average pace of 02:50 min/km .. He ran the last five kilometres with an average pace of 03:04 min/km and ended the race with 29:31 ahead of his countrymen, Isaac Kimpemboi (29:36) and Alex Oloitiptip Kori (29:50). Pingua has however vowed to come back next year to erase Ebenyo’s name as the Okpekpe international 10km road race course record holder. “I will come back next year to claim the course record,” he promised and revealed his readiness to battle Ebenyo for both the title and the course record in 2025. Asked if he was not scared Ebenyo might return next year to reclaim the title he was forced to relinquish without a fight, Pingua said he was ready.",

        "description": "Cision engines are designed for use in RC cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles. We explain what they are, who makes them, and how much they cost.",
        "content": "Whether you're a full-fledged gearhead with a penchant for working with miniatures or a specialty RC car fan who prefers a gas-powered engine over a battery, there's a good chance you've done a little tinkering with one of the many custom-built tiny engines available on the consumer market . But even if you're more of a casual engine enthusiast who doesn't fit into either of those categories, you may be interested to know that there are currently several companies throughout the world that specialize in crafting pint-sized versions of real, fuel-burning internal combustion engines (ICE) that not only work, but have been used to power everything from RC vehicles to some small power tools. Among the most notable of the companies that specialize in making miniature internal combustion engines is Cison Engine, whose line of miniature engine packages includes everything from a powerful inline water-cooled model to a 4-stroke small-block V8 44 cubic inch that pushes 4.8 horsepower and up to 10,000 rpm. Those models are essentially exact 1⁄6-scaled versions of actual ICEs, with the power, precision, and engineering of Cison engines continuing to dazzle mini-engine enthusiasts the world over. As each of those miniatures bares some version of the Cison insignia, it should come as no surprise that the China-based engineering outfit makes its engines themselves. Yes, Cison has been manufacturing its celebrated miniatures in a Chinese facility since its 2000 founding, attributing the quality and precision of its engines, in part, to a state-of-the-art Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining setup. If the idea of building a functional miniature internal combustion engine, or merely outfitting your RC hot rod with one is intriguing to you, we have some good news and some bad news. First for the good news, which is that Cison engines are currently available for purchase to any human being who wants one, and they are being shipped from China to all parts of the globe thanks to the company's partnerships with online retailers like EngineDIY and StirlingKit. In more good news, Cison guarantees that its engines will work as advertised, ensuring you can invest in its miniatures with a certain degree of confidence. Now for the bad news, which is that Cison's miniature engines are not exactly cheap. In fact, one of the company's precision-tooled model V8 engines can set you back as much as $2,000 or more, and that isn't far from what you might pay for a full-size second-hand V8 for your car or truck. Cison's V8 miniatures are, of course, the priciest of its engine lineup, with the company offering various other models with differing power outputs at prices in the $600 to $1,000 range. Most of those engines are built to power RC cars, boats, planes, and motorcycles, and can be ordered fully assembled or in build-it-yourself packages. If you'd prefer to pick up a working miniature engine to jazz up your desktop or display in your home office, you can even pick up a model for as little as $449 that's fit with a wooden base and an on-off toggle switch.",

        "description": "Former Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao allegedly used the 2022 MLA poaching case to pressure BJP for a compromise to help his daughter in the Delhi liquor scam case.",
        "content": "HYDERABAD: Telangana's former CM K Chandrasekhar Rao allegedly wanted to use the 2022 MLA poaching case to force BJP to arrive at a compromise and, in turn, bail out his daughter and MLC K Kavitha in the Delhi liquor scam case . This is mentioned in the confession report of Radha Kishan Rao , former DCP of Hyderabad police's task force who is an accused in the illegal phone tapping case. The BRS chief and then CM, on getting wind of the alleged poaching bid, ordered a technical surveillance, which led to a failed attempt by police to arrest senior BJP functionary B L Santhosh, according to Rao's confessions. However, KCR 's bid to trap BJP came unstuck as the matter reached Telangana HC, which transferred the case to CBI. Referring to KCR as \"peddayana\" (elder), Rao said in his confession that the then CM was upset the plan did not work out. \"Peddayana was angry for not completing the 'work' as per his expectation. I will not disclose further details as I owe a lot to Peddayana who had re-appointed me twice and posted me in the city task force after my retirement in 2020,\" he said. Rao disclosed that in Oct last year, then Special Intelligence Bureau (SIB) chief T Prabhakar Rao told him that KCR was informed by then Tandur MLA Pilot Rohith Reddy that some persons claiming to be influential in BJP were in touch with him (Rohith Reddy) and were trying to convince him to join the saffron party after leaving BRS along with some other MLAs. At KCR's behest, SIB's (former) deputy SP D Praneeth Rao intercepted the phones of some private persons and the MLA, and submitted an audio clip, Rao revealed. The former CM then ordered police to lay a trap and told Rohith to cooperate with the cops. He allegedly asked three more MLAs to be part of the operation. The Tandur MLA (Rohith Reddy) enticed three persons to come to a farmhouse in Moinabad, the ex-DCP said. The trio was arrested for luring four BRS MLAs to join BJP. \"Later, an SIT was formed and KCR wanted to arrest BJP national leader Santhosh to make the case strong, so that BJP would agree to a compromise, and it could be used to get rid of the ED case against his daughter Kavitha,\" the confession report alleged. However, due to the inefficiency of some officials in Cyberabad police, a key person escaped from police custody, it added. A team of cops, led by SP-rank officer Rema Rajeshwari, took a chartered flight to Kerala, but failed to nab the wanted person, Rao mentioned. The poaching case later reached the Telangana high court, which stayed the arrest of the accused and handed over the probe to CBI in Dec 2022.",

        "description": "It was the first time Nadal has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the clay-court Grand Slam tournament, which he has won 14 times.",
        "content": "PARIS — The noise was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out “Ra-fa! Ra-fa!” whenever their guy found the occasional moment of brilliance of the sort he has conjured up so often at the French Open and elsewhere through the years. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe Chatrier on Monday, voices echoing under the closed roof of a place he called “magical for me.” When the 14-time champion at Roland Garros approached the net for the prematch coin toss. When he took his swings during the warmup. And, especially, when he whipped his trademark topspin lefty forehand or chopped his two-fisted cross-court backhand or placed a volley perfectly to claim a point. The problem for Nadal, and for his fans, is that there were not nearly enough such points for him against Alexander Zverev . Not enough vintage play to allow his nearly 38-year-old, oft-injured body to claim one more victory, no matter how much the folks in the stands tried to will that to happen. And so he lost 6-3, 7-6 (5), 6-3 in the first round of the French Open to Zverev in what might turn out to be Nadal’s last match at the clay-court tournament he dominated for so long. “If it’s the last time that I played here,” Nadal said, “I am at peace with myself.” It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open. “The last two years, I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did,” Nadal said. “I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” Advertisement He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season, but he said Saturday he is not absolutely certain he be at the French Open again. He reiterated that after only his fourth defeat in 116 career matches at the place. “I am not saying I am retiring today,” said the Spaniard. While Nadal said it’s doubtful he’ll enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Olympic tennis will be at the French Open site. Monday’s match ended in anticlimactic fashion, with the 22-time Grand Slam champion unable to play his customary way after 11⁄2 years of hip and abdominal injuries. He had hip surgery during the 2023 French Open, the first time he missed it since winning his debut there as a teenager. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect,” Nadal said. “I wake up one day and I [felt like I had] a snake biting me. Another day, a tiger.” Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, has been limited to 16 matches and an 8-8 record since the start of last year. His infrequent play dropped his ranking to No. 275, and he was unseeded for the French Open for the first time; he’d never been anything worse than the No. 6 seed in 18 previous appearances. Advertisement That is why Nadal ended up facing the No. 4-seeded Zverev , the runner-up at the 2020 US Open, a gold medalist at the Tokyo Olympics, and the only man to reach the semifinals in Paris each of the past three years. Nadal’s other losses at Roland Garros came against Robin Soderling in 2009, and against Novak Djokovic in 2015 and 2021. The 6-foot-6-inch Zverev is a talented player coming off a title on clay at the Italian Open. The 27-year-old German leverages every bit of his long legs and considerable wingspan to cover the court well and unleash tough-to-corral groundstrokes. As he plays in Paris, he is awaiting Friday’s start of a trial in a Berlin court related to accusations of domestic abuse made by an ex-girlfriend. Zverev does not need to be present at the court and has said he won’t be there. Monday’s other winners included Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Marketa Vondrousova, Danielle Collins, Jannik Sinner, and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Eighth-seeded Maria Sakkari, a semifinalist at Roland Garros in 2021, lost in the first round for the second year in a row, eliminated 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 by Varvara Gracheva.",

        "description": "Shani Louk, a young Israeli-German, was killed by Hamas and her body was paraded in the back of a truck in a video that shocked the world - and now more details have emerged about her tragic death",
        "content": "The chilling details surrounding the brutal murder of Shani Louk , a young Israeli-German woman, by Hamas , have been revealed, shedding light on the terror she may have experienced in her final moments. Shani's lifeless body was seen in footage that sent shockwaves around the globe , showing her twisted form in the back of a pickup truck, surrounded by cheering members of Hamas during their savage attack on October 7. Numerous accounts of Hamas' brutality on that day have surfaced, including tales of torture and sexual violence. Nissim Louk, Shani's father, has found some solace in the knowledge that his daughter did not endure torture at the hands of Hamas. Nissim shared that Shani thought she had witnessed a car crash up ahead, rather than the unfolding Hamas assault. READ MORE: Palestinians taking shelter injured after Israeli troops shell school in Gaza Nissim Louk said his 22-year-old daughter had been dancing with her friends at the Nova electronic festival near Kibbutz Reim on October 7 ( Image: N12) Israelis and Shani's family appealed to find her after the Hamas attack, but she was confirmed dead three weeks later ( Image: No credit) She made a distress call to emergency services, which was later played to Nissim. In the call, she reported seeing injured individuals on the ground and a pile-up of vehicles. It is believed that as Shani attempted to leave the scene, she was met with more terrorists who shot and killed her. \"I'm sure she felt terror for 20 seconds and a few seconds earlier she thought it was simply a car accident,\" Nissim told The Telegraph. \"It's important for me to know she did not suffer.\" For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US Nissim Louk and Ricarda Louk attend the funeral service for their daughter Shani Louk during her funeral service on May 19, 2024 in Srigim-Li On, Israel ( Image: Getty Images) On the day of the Hamas attack, Nissim was at home with his family just outside Jerusalem. Shani, his youngest daughter, had spent most of the year journeying across Europe to attend various music festivals. In an early hours phone call that morning, she had informed her dad that she was in southern Israel and intended to drive back to Tel Aviv after the initial air raid sirens had gone off. It wasn't until her ex-boyfriend shared a photo revealing her lifeless form, sprawled face-down, semi-clothed in a moving pickup truck surrounded by armed men, that Nissim realised his daughter had been at the now notorious Nova festival. Instantly recognising Shani's distinctive dreadlocks and tats, Nissim was unclear about her fate. He remembered telling himself: \"We didn't see any blood on that white truck so we thought, maybe she's ok.\" This month, local authorities announced that Shani's body was one of three found in Gaza. Shani, who was 22, was identified alongside Amit Buskila, aged 28, and a male in his mid-fifties, Itzhak Gelerenter. Shani made a call to emergency services that was played to Nissim Louk, her father ( Image: Instagram) The trio were murdered by Hamas whilst escaping from the Nova music festival, a popular open-air dance party near the Gaza border, where numerous folks lost their lives to the militants, as revealed by Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari during a press briefing. A grand total of 360 individuals perished at the festival. The military has reported the discovery of bodies overnight, without providing further details or their location. Israel has been active in Rafah, a southern city in the Gaza Strip, where it believes hostages are being held. In the attack on October 7, militants led by Hamas killed approximately 1,200 people, primarily civilians, and kidnapped about 250 others. Since then, around half of these hostages have been released, mostly in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel during a week-long ceasefire in November. Israel estimates that about 100 hostages remain captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of roughly 30 more. The conflict in Gaza since the attack has resulted in the deaths of over 35,000 Palestinians, as per Gaza health officials.",

        "content": "Virgil van Dijk has pledged his future to Liverpool and says he is enthusiastic about working with new head coach Arne Slot next season as he awaits clarity on his contract situation at . The 32-year-old defender has just over 12 months remaining on his current deal with the Reds and earlier this month revealed that he is yet to be offered fresh terms from the club. However, captain , who featured in 36 out of 38 games this season, has revealed that he has held positive talks with countryman Slot after he was appointed as Liverpool's new head coach and is confident the can build on their third-place finish in the Premier League. \"I still have a year left on my contract,\" said Van Dijk over the weekend as Holland began their preparations for this summer's European Championships. \"I am club captain and I have made it clear I am there for the new coach and enthusiastic over the next season. \"Obviously, there will be a lot of changes but I am confident we will make a big success of it. \"I congratulated him of course and I'm really pleased for him and his family. We spoke about the team and the future, but now my focus is fully on the national team.\" Van Dijk, though, wasn't the only member of Liverpool's Dutch contingent to speak highly of Slot, with midfielder Ryan Gravenberch also expecting good things from the Reds' new boss. \"I think he can be good for my career,\" said Gravenberch, who has also been named in Holland's provisional squad for this summer's Euros. \"It's a coach who wants to play good football.\"",

        "content": "Michael Thorbjornsen of Stanford finished No. 1 in the PGA Tour University standings and secured his PGA Tour card as soon as he turns professional. Thorbjornsen, a 22-year-old from Massachusetts, was one of the top players in college golf this season and has capitalized on the tour's relatively new pathway for amateurs to qualify for the tour directly through college. Thorbjornsen accrued a high enough points average over the past two years to finish the 2023-24 NCAA season atop the rankings. Points are awarded for playing college tournaments as well as getting into professional events. Thorbjornsen has made the cut in four professional tournaments already, most recently the 2023 John Deere Classic. He placed fourth at the 2022 Travelers Championship, where he was playing on an exemption. Thorbjornsen, whose four-year Stanford career concluded when he missed the 54-hole cut at the NCAA Championship, would be eligible for the remainder of the 2024 PGA Tour season and the entire 2025 season whenever he turns pro. \"PGA Tour U is, I think, one of the best programs in all of sports,\" Thorbjornsen said in a news release from the tour. \"What they've done, creating a pathway to the PGA Tour and to these different tours underneath it, it's huge. It gives students and us golfers reasons to stay for four years, and you can't really pass up on the opportunities that they present to you.\" The PGA Tour University pathway has been tweaked and modified, and last year was the first time a player who finished No. 1 in a given season received immediate access to the PGA Tour. That player was , a Swede who parlayed his career at Texas Tech into a white-hot start to his pro career. He won one tournament apiece on the DP World Tour and the PGA Tour, played for the victorious Team Europe at the Ryder Cup, finished second to at last month's Masters and is currently ranked No. 6 in the world. \"Ludvig, even though he's been on tour for say a year now, he's top 10 in the world, he's done unbelievable things recently,\" Thorbjornsen said. \"We're good friends, we competed a lot last year, so he's someone I look up to but I'm also trying to beat him as well.\"",

        "content": "LETHBRIDGE, AB – It’s property tax season, as the City of Lethbridge says notices will be mailed out starting Wednesday, May 29, 2024. Taxes are due by June 28, and a seven per cent penalty will be applied to all unpaid 2024 balances as of June 29. Late payment penalties will not be waived for those who did not receive their notice, according to the City.

        "description": "Jay Bilas grew up idolizing Bill Walton, who was larger than life on and off the court and he was about finding the joy in others.",
        "content": "Heartbroken. That was the overwhelming feeling that washed over me when I received the call that Bill Walton had died at the age of 71. The man who was always bigger than life had passed from this one, and he left a legacy of basketball greatness and of a wonderful human being. Bill Walton was a one-of-a-kind person who left everyone he came in contact with feeling special and among his inner circle. He was a generous, giving soul who always put others before himself. As a kid growing up in Southern California, my idol was Bill Walton. He was, without argument, one of the two greatest players in college basketball history -- along with Kareem Abdul Jabbar, known as Lew Alcindor during his college days -- and remains so to this day. Walton was the most complete center in the game: scoring, rebounding, blocking shots, passing, outlet passing and running the floor. No center was as complete, and only Kareem could match Walton's record as a winner and champion. In three seasons at playing for the legendary John Wooden, Walton's teams were undefeated national champions twice, reached the Final Four three times and compiled an 86-4 record. Walton was a three-time national player of the year and first-team All-American and was recognized as the top amateur athlete in the nation. I remember my coaches telling me that Walton was the greatest center to play the game. His NBA career was interrupted by injury. But when healthy, Walton was just as dominant as he was at UCLA. In 1976-77, he played in 65 games, leading the to the NBA championship, and he made the All-NBA and All-Defensive teams and was Finals MVP. Injuries would limit his dominance. He finished his career with the in 1985-86, helping Larry Bird, and win the title while being named the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year. Walton not only overcame an injury-plagued pro career; he overcame a speech impediment to become one of the most entertaining, fun and beloved broadcasters of all time. He was amazingly intelligent, ridiculously funny and quick to poke fun at you and himself. When all would be thrilled to hear Bill talk about himself and his rich life in the game, he would never fail to ask questions about you and put the spotlight on others. He was genuinely interested in . I had the pleasure -- no, the joy -- of working with Walton at ESPN. From Maui to Pac-12 games, or the MegaCast of the college football title game (where he was dressed as Uncle Sam), not only did Bill never disappoint, he always brought a smile to your face, just thinking about spending time with him. I quickly realized that Walton was a better person than he was a basketball player -- and he was a Naismith Hall of Fame player. Before we went on the air, if I tried to discuss what we may encounter during a broadcast, Bill would put up one of his huge hands and say, \"Save it all for the air, Jake.\" He loved calling me Jake, pretending to get my name wrong, and nobody loved it more than I did -- that Bill Walton would include me in his wild sense of humor. On one broadcast with Bill and Dave Pasch, Walton was waxing poetic about former Kansas coach Ted Owens when he paused his soliloquy to say, \"Jake, you're too young to know who Ted Owens is!\" \"Of course I know Ted Owens,\" I replied. \"He recruited me.\" Walton quickly retorted, \"For what?!\" I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. Get your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu. and start streaming something for everyone today! Walton made everything fun. Whether he was detailing the history of the saguaro cactus or the mystical powers of the desert, or quoting the Grateful Dead as if it were scripture, Walton was about enjoying every minute of his existence, and making your existence around him meaningful and unforgettable. He was a free spirit, with endearing eccentricity. But deep down, he was about finding joy in others. Man, was Bill Walton fun. For his greatness on the floor, Walton carved out a special place in the game's history that will never be forgotten. As a friend and colleague, Walton had a spirit that was bigger than life. He was a showman. I will always love Bill Walton -- he was a national treasure, and there will never be another like him. Rest in peace, Bill. Love, Jake",

        "content": "TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — The head of the Social Security Administration is responding to Sen. Rick Scott. It comes after an 8 On Your Side investigation found millions of dollars missing from a St. Petersburg trust fund meant to help disabled people. Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O’Malley said his agency does not provide oversight to special needs trusts, adding a trust is a legal arrangement generally regulated by state law. Back in April, investigative reporter Brittany Muller brought the story of the missing millions to Sen. Scott . “I’ll look at it first,” he said. “That would surprise me that if there’s no oversight, but I’ll find out and if so, I’ll propose something.” Between 2009 and 2020, court records show that Leo Govoni, the founder of the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration, loaned $100M from the Center to his own company, Boston Finance Group. The Center has said Govoni has not paid that money back. It’s affected more than 1,000 vulnerable families, including 41-year-old Sarah Hall of Fort Myers . “This is the most the most disabled you can be there isn’t a degree beyond this,” said Theresa Schlosser, Sarah’s mom. “How in your conscience, do you decide to take what is helping her to live every day the best that she can live and take it away from where do you find that in your soul?” Schlosser said her daughter, Sarah, was 18 when she was in a car crash. Sarah was awarded money and monthly annuity payments so her family could take care of her for the rest of her life. “My lawyers advised me to put the money with the center which I did in 2003,” she said. “I didn’t think twice about it. I trusted these people.” She said that money has vanished. Sen. Scott wrote a letter to SSA Commissioner O’Malley demanding answers. Now, O’Malley is responding. He wrote, “The Social Security Act provides the agency with limited authority regarding financial trusts.” He also said his agency does not regulate trusts; state laws do. SSA said it does not investigate trusts, unless there investigating the misuse of someone’s benefits and that it remains focused on how the trust is treated for social security income.",

        "content": "NAC Foundation, Inc. (NACFI), the philanthropic arm of listed natural resource development company Nickel Asia Corp. (NAC) and the St. Luke’s Medical Center Foundation, Inc. (SLMCFI) held an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialty medical mission at Borongan, Province of Eastern Samar from May 13-17, 2024. The mission fulfills the Memorandum of Understanding between the NACFI, SLMCFI, and the Provincial Government of Eastern Samar for the province-wide surgical-medical mission. A total of 18 major surgeries and 8 minor surgeries were carried out by the St. Luke’s team and 473 patients received medical consultations for ENT cases. Additionally, a total of 158 nurses and ancillary medical staff attended specialized lectures through the St. Luke’s Healthcare Academy. “For me, the more special portion of this aside from doing the surgery was actually doing the lectures, because if you just go to one place do the surgeries, the consultations and leave, it feels like it’s just a one-time thing that you’re able to do, but if you help the ones that are left behind, make them equipped medically with knowledge of the specialty, then they will be able to carry on the treatment necessary for the specialty,” said Head of St. Luke’s Medical Center’s ENT Department Dr. Allan Carpela. “When the Office of the Governor asked the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, we received a notification last week to ask an authority to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NAC and the St. Luke’s Team, agad-agad binigay namin, dahil sobrang galak kami na andito kayo na tutulong sa amin para sa mabuting kalusugan ng mga tao sa Eastern Samar,” said Eastern Samar Vice Governor Maria Caridad S. Goteesan. The goal of the partnership between NACFI and SLMCFI is to bring St. Luke’s Medical Center’s culture of care and expertise to those underserved by the public healthcare system. “Isa sa mga mahahalagang nakita namin ay ang pakikipagugnayan sa kalusugan na napakaimportante sa aming mga stakeholders, ang kalusugan sa mga pamayanan kung nasaan may operations ang Nickel Asia at ang mga programang ito ay nagpatunay na isa ito sa ugnayan ng industriya at pamayanan,” said NAC AVP for Community Relations Reynaldo Dela Rosa. This mission is one of NAC’s ways of contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 3 which is the promotion of good health and well-being for all. “Mula rito, umaasa po kami ng patuloy na pakikipagtulungan upang makapaghatid ng serbisyong medical kasama ang aming partner, ang St. Luke’s Medical Center Foundation, Inc.,” said NAC AVP for Health Dr. Bimbo S. Almonte.",

        "description": "On Memorial Day morning families and community gathered to dedicate a new life ring at Bracken Beach. The life ring is part of a new bill going into affect in June.",
        "content": "The event included a dedication for a new bill that will go into effect in June. SB 253, or the Lake Michigan Rescue Equipment Act, will require beaches to have water safety gear like life rings at the beach. People talked and enjoyed coffee and donuts even though it was cold and windy at the beach pavilion. After coffee there were speeches and the names of drowning victims were read. 13 different families, each wearing a flower on their name tag, came to the dedication to remember their loved ones. During the ceremony state Sen. Rodney Pol, who worked on the bill, gave each of them a certificate and a flower. Evelyn Hernandez survived a drowning incident on that very beach. Unfortunately her boyfriend, Lionell Dominguez, died. She played an important part in organizing the event and getting the bill. After the incident she became a water safety advocate with the Chicago Alliance for Water Safety. The conditions on the water can change very quickly and 66% of drowning victims are strong swimmers, Hernandez said. \"It is likely that if rescue equipment had been available those drownings would have been prevented,\" Hernandez said. Dave Benjamin also nearly drowned on Dec. 26, 2010 when he went surfing on Lake Michigan. Even though he had 40 years of experience swimming he said it went \"out the window\" as the panic set in. \"Water safety is not common sense,\" Benjamin said. \"We need to elevate water safety to these standards of these other safety protocols.\" After his near drowning experience Benjamin co-started The Great Lakes Surf Rescue Project. The group tracks drowning statistics and raises awareness about water safety. The group, founded in 2011, has done 1,150 presentations in elementary through high schools. These presentations go over many different aspects of water safety. \"More school age children are going to die drowning each year than in fires, tornadoes, active shooters, earthquakes and lightning combined,\" Benjamin said. The group also advocates for more support at beaches and does lifeguard and first responder training for water rescue. Their goal is to get all eight Great Lake states to adopt water safety regulation. So far Illinois and Indiana require water safety equipment at beaches. In Michigan they are working on implementing safety programs in schools. Lifeguards are not required but Illinois has most of their beaches staffed with lifeguards. Indiana has about half of the public beaches staffed by lifeguards. \"Michigan is horrible for not having lifeguards. There's three beaches, and one's a private beach,\" Benjamin said. \"Other than that, you got to go about 230 or 250 miles to get to the next lifeguarded beach.\" Benjamin said that drowning is a public health issue that is treated as a recreational issue. According to Benjamin there have been 567 drownings in Lake Michigan since 2010 as of the end of 2023. The Great Lakes are unique because the currents and waves are caused by the weather in the area. This makes conditions in the water change quickly. Now that the bill has passed Benjamin said their next goal is to legislation that requires water safety education in school passed. \"We have come together to help raise awareness on water safety and doing it together so that our loved ones lives are not lost in vain but future lives may be preserved,\" Hernandez said.",

        "content": "Albino Gómez, a candidate for mayor in a southern Mexican municipality, was found alive after being kidnapped at gunpoint Sunday, the BBC reported. Gómez was attacked by gunmen when he returned home after a campaign rally, the outlet . Kidnapped Mexican mayoral candidate found alive — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) Gómez’s campaign manager was killed in the attack and two others were wounded, the BBC noted, citing local media. The mayor of a nearby town urged Mexican authorities to “take the necessary action to safeguard the life of our colleague and those of his team,” the outlet reported. Mexico’s national elections coming up June 2 have been the most violent in the country’s recent history, with dozens of candidates killed and hundreds threatened, according to the BBC. Nine people — including a child — died and 50 were injured after a stage last week at a rally for Jorge Alvarez Maynez, one of Mexico’s presidential candidates. Maynez is in third place in the polls for president, according to The Guardian. The odds-on favorite in the polls to win the presidential race is the former Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, to Americas Society Council of the Americas’. Sheinbaum comes from the same party as Mexico’s current president, the left-wing Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the outlet noted. The BBC blamed criminal as the source of these threats and murders of political candidates. At present, it is not known who seized Gómez and why, the BBC reported.",

The sign on the store located in the Confederation area says seating and washrooms will no longer be available at that location. A statement sent to Global News from Starbucks Coffee Canada said the store will mainly serve customers in a grab-and-go capacity, adding that patio space is still available and that washrooms will remain open for customers. 4:01 NSBA on the increase of city crime in Saskatoon Other businesses in the area said they’ve been struggling with issues around mental health and addictions, some saying they are worried it could scare customers away.

Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “It’s OK for us to give food or drinks sometimes, it doesn’t matter, we are happy to help, but sometimes it’s just too much.” Bui said he worries that these issues could stop people from coming to their business and about how it impacts his staff. “We have to do something in general about all these things — homelessness and mental health.” He said these are issues exist all across the city and that supports are needed, giving an example of the shelter going up near his home in the Mayfair area. “It’s OK, because there are a lot of people needing those services. But how you control it is more important. Story continues below advertisement “We need to find services.

Global News received a statement from SPS pointing to those same stats, adding that police will be doubling their capacity to engage in community-focused policing initiatives. “The SPS will also have five additional Alternative Response Officers trained and deployed to the street.

        "content": "A mum who was left \"completely blindsided\" after finding out she had cancer a month before her 40th birthday is warning others against the use of sunbeds. Adele Hughes, 44, is now raising awareness of the disease and urging young people to protect their skin by avoiding the use of sunbeds, after she herself overcame her battle with skin cancer. The mum to Sienna, 12, and 10-year-old Elise, is now three years cancer-free. Adele said: \"I'd never wish anybody to go on that skin cancer journey. \"I had two young children when I was diagnosed in December 2019 and being told I had cancer and that it had spread to my lymph nodes, blindsided me. It felt terrifying and when I look back on months of treatment that included six surgeries and 18 cycles of immunotherapy treatment, I realise how difficult it has been.\" Adele with daughters Sienna, 12, and Elise, 10 ( Image: Adele Hughes) But while the primary school teacher has been given the all clear, she is still extra cautious with regular scans and check-ups at Albyn Hospital in Aberdeen, reports the Daily Record . She said: \"I hope I can encourage people to think about their sun habits, take precautions and to never use sunbeds. \"As a mum, part of the routine in our house every morning is putting on sunscreen and we reapply sunscreen throughout the day so it remains effective. We need to educate parents and schools to get a message out there that it's vital to protect your skin. \"That includes covering up with clothes, a wide-brimmed hat and spending time in the shade, especially between 11am and 3pm. Melanoma is something that we can prevent and I think there's so many steps we can take to prevent this from happening to people in the future.\" According to the NHS , Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other areas of the body. The main cause is ultraviolet light, which comes from the sun and is used in sunbeds. Your chances of getting melanoma may increase from factors such as your age, having pale skin, a large number of moles, and a family history of skin cancer.",

        "content": "WORTHINGTON — This spring, three teams from Instructor Heidi Tarus’ Principles of Biology I course participated in the Plant the Moon Challenge. With funding from NASA’s Minnesota Space Grant Consortium, they aimed to find the best way to grow nutritious food on the Moon. Two of three Minnesota West Bluejay teams earned Best in Show awards in the undergrad/professional category for their contributions to experimental design and plant growth. Six students from the Bluejays A Team focused on the effects of urea and bone meal on the growth of collard greens (Brassica oleracea). Team members were Don Huynh, Autumn Luinenburg, Jocelyn Matias, Bailey Ponto, Amarilyz Vega Hernandez, Hermela Yisak and Instructor Heidi Tarus. In their preliminary research, the team uncovered that collard greens need more than just nitrogen to grow well. They also need phosphorus and calcium. Through their experimentation, the team discovered urea might be the sole additive necessary for promoting collard green growth in lunar regolith. Through careful planning and insightful hypotheses, the Bluejays A Team made progress in finding ways to grow food on the Moon. The Bluejays C Team investigated how to grow mung beans under moon-like conditions. They looked at the effects of bone meal and endomycorrhizal fungi on growth. Eight students participated: Elijah Alexander, DaShawn Clark, Olivia Hensch, Diego Montoya, Terrence Pierre, Elijah Robinson, Adrian Sanchez, Fanuel Wolday and Instructor Heidi Tarus. ADVERTISEMENT Plants need nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium to make proteins, DNA and cell walls. The team added peat moss to the soil to help the plants grow better. They tested two things: Bone meal and fungi additives, to see how they affected plant growth. Plants in pots with bone meal and fungi grew tallest, had the most leaves, and had bigger roots. They also noticed these plants had darker green leaves. The team wants to try adjusting the soil’s acidity, adding more nutrients like potassium, and studying how fungi and plant roots work together. Through their research and innovative approaches, the experiments opened doors to a multitude of future investigations. The teams have taken significant steps toward realizing the vision of sustainable food production in space. With NASA planning missions to explore the Moon, learning how to farm there is crucial.",

        "content": "Indiana Pacers star point guard Tyrese Haliburton is \"unlikely\" to play in Monday night's elimination game against the Boston Celtics, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. \"I'm told that it is unlikely that Tyrese Haliburton plays in Game 4, but he has not yet been ruled out,\" Wojnarowski said on NBA Today. \"He has wanted to try to figure out a way to play in this series, even with that hamstring soreness/stain. But the team, especially Rick Carlisle, their front office, they want to err on the side of caution with him.\" Reporting on Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton on NBA Today ahead of Game 4 pic.twitter.com/jmj2xwxp76 Haliburton, who suffered a hamstring injury in January, aggravated the injury against the Celtics in Game 2 and was sidelined for Game 3. Boston leads the series 3-0 and can close things out with a win on Monday night. Haliburton had 25 points and 10 assists in Game 1 before recording 10 points and eight assists in limited action in Game 2. The fourth-year player is averaging 18.6 points and 8.2 assists per game in his first postseason. Though Haliburton has been a bit inconsistent throughout the playoffs, he has stepped up in a handful of big moments. He notched back-to-back 30+ point performances in the semifinals as well as a 26-point showing in Game 7 to close out the New York Knicks. As Wojnarowski reported, though, Haliburton's first playoff run could be over. With Boston holding a 3-0 lead, the Pacers would need a historic comeback to win the series. Game 4 tips off at 8 p.m. ET Monday night and the Celtics are looking to advance to the Finals for the second time in the last three seasons. The Pacers will look to extend their season by at least one game, but they might have to do so with their star on the bench.",

Walton played for the Celtics for two seasons in the 1980s and was a key part of their 1985-86 championship team, considered by some the greatest team in NBA history. “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. A Hall of Famer, Most Valuable Player, and two-time NBA Champion, Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals, and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history. He derived great joy from basketball and music, and deeply cherished his moments with teammates and friends. “As a Celtic, Bill overcame years of debilitating injuries, regained his zest for the game, and helped guide the 1986 Boston Celtics championship with both his play and his spirit. “The Boston Celtics celebrate Bill’s wonderful life and legacy, and send their deepest sympathies to the Walton family.” Be civil. Be kind.",

        "description": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on May 6 asked states to make personal protective equipment (PPE) available to workers at dairy farms",
        "content": "CHICAGO — Many U.S. dairy farms have not yet increased health protections against bird flu for employees during an outbreak in cows, according to workers, activists and farmers, worrying health experts about the risk for more human infections of a virus with pandemic potential. Epidemiologists are concerned the virus could potentially spread and cause serious illnesses as farmers downplay the risk to workers while employees are not widely aware of cases in U.S. cattle. The U.S. government said last week that a second dairy worker contracted bird flu since cattle first tested positive in late March and that investigators are looking into whether the person was wearing or offered protective equipment. Nearly 24,000 farms sell milk around the country, and they offer varying protections to staff. Lobby group the National Milk Producers Federation said it encouraged farms to use protective equipment in line with federal recommendations and heard of increased worker protections. Three dairy workers, seven activists and two lawyers who assist farm employees told Reuters that dairy owners have not offered equipment like face shields and goggles to staff who spend 10- to 12-hour days side-to-side with cows. Three large dairy companies with tens of thousands of cows declined to comment on their procedures. ADVERTISEMENT The workers — all based in New York, a major dairy producer — said they heard of the new illness affecting cattle through the media or community organizers, not their employers. One, 39-year-old Luis Jimenez from Mexico, said last week it was business as usual. \"They're not doing anything,\" he said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April and May advised workers to use personal protective equipment (PPE) if they may be exposed to sick livestock, after a Texas dairy worker tested positive for bird flu. On May 6, the agency asked states to make equipment available to workers. CDC wants \"to make sure that farm workers across the country, whether they are at a farm with an affected herd or not, have access to PPE,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, last week. New York state said it is assessing CDC's recommendation and has not yet distributed equipment. Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, where cattle were infected, said they distributed equipment to eight dairies combined. Kansas, Idaho and Wisconsin said they have equipment, but no farmers asked for it. Michigan, where the second dairy worker tested positive, said many farms have protective gear but the state is coordinating a way to make it available for those that need more. Dairies became more aware of bird flu's risks in late April after the U.S. government began requiring that cows test negative before crossing state lines, said Emily Yeiser Stepp, who oversees a National Milk Producers Federation program that covers workforce development. Still, \"reaching out into some of our rural networks takes a little longer,\" she said when told of workers who said they were not informed of recommendations for protective equipment. ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. confirmed bird flu in dairy cattle in nine states. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples. Bird flu has caused serious or fatal infections globally among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. In cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads. Health experts advise dairy workers to wear gloves and disposable coveralls that can block milk splashes on their bodies or clothing. Jimenez said his coworkers are under pressure to work so quickly that they sometimes do not have time to wash their hands before meals and often drive home in their work clothes. Workers attach and detach milking equipment on cows, putting their faces close to unpasteurized milk. Most are immigrants and many do not have health insurance. \"When you're milking, splashes can't be avoided. When it splashes in our eyes, we wash it out with water,\" said another New York worker, who requested anonymity because he is undocumented. Lucas Sjostrom, a farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, uses robotic machines to attach milking equipment to cows, but said he is being extra conscious that human workers wear gloves while transporting unpasteurized milk. Minnesota has not reported bird flu in cows. In Indiana, another state without confirmed cases, farmer Steve Obert said he has not increased precautions for workers, though that could change if his herd tests positive. Extra protective equipment is not comfortable to wear, he added. ADVERTISEMENT \"We're rather isolated and I don't think the risk is really great,\" said Obert, executive director of the industry group Indiana Dairy Producers. The infected Texas worker suffered conjunctivitis and broken blood vessels that turned his eyes scarlet red, according to a photo published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He reported wearing gloves when working with cows but not respiratory or eye protection, the journal said. Scientists are watching for changes in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans. Epidemiologists said it could cause more serious illnesses if it mutates or infects someone with a compromised immune system. Some dairies with infected cows have resisted allowing federal officials on their farms because of financial concerns, said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases. The CDC said it would like to test more farm workers, but it is not required. New Mexico had anecdotal reports of workers with symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, but most were not tested, according to internal state documents that were dated April 26 and obtained by Reuters under a public records request. The workers were not tested because they did not seek healthcare, the New Mexico Department of Health said. Policy changes are needed to encourage workers to seek treatment, such as emergency income assurance for those who test positive, said Brian Castrucci, an epidemiologist and CEO at health policy group the de Beaumont Foundation. \"I don't want to wait until we have a dead dairy farm worker until we ratchet up what we're doing,\" he said.

        "content": "Jeopardy! viewers are scratching their heads after an apparent change of the rules that is letting four-day winner Grant DeYoung potentially take part in the show’s next Tournament of Champions. The quiz show has caused fans to raise eyebrows in the past and raised ire recently, specifically with the announcement of a new pop culture version of the show fans feel will ruin the original. The show has suffered from losses in viewership as well over the ways that fans have felt alienated, but in the end, it is still going strong. Jeopardy prodcuer exposes little-known show rule after contestants' rare move Chris pratt's surprise Jepardy cameo slammed by fans as star plugs new movie However, DeYoung, who has also left fans confused over other rules he seemingly has broken , has proven to be the most puzzling contestant yet. After noticing a special accommodation he had during gameplay, fans also took note of a hint that he could be in the Tournament of Champions. DeYoung impressively racked up a total prize total of $81,203 after a four-day winning streak that ended on May 21. His impressive play saw Ken Jennings tell him that his four wins could make it likely he would appear in Tournament of Champions–which led fans to be confused, as the the usual requirement for participation in the tournament is five consecutive wins. However, others quickly clarified on an Instagram post that he actually could qualify. “All 4 game champions were eventually qualified at TOC in the last 3 editions,” one fan wrote. “With a shorter eligibility window and the expansion of TOC field in the last 2 editions. I think Grant might get in the 32nd TOC. Since 2021 TOC where al 4 game champions competed, some o them made it to the semifinals like: Veronica, Ryan B, Ryan H, Maureen, John & David,” they added.

        "description": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on May 6 asked states to make personal protective equipment (PPE) available to workers at dairy farms",
        "content": "CHICAGO — Many U.S. dairy farms have not yet increased health protections against bird flu for employees during an outbreak in cows, according to workers, activists and farmers, worrying health experts about the risk for more human infections of a virus with pandemic potential. Epidemiologists are concerned the virus could potentially spread and cause serious illnesses as farmers downplay the risk to workers while employees are not widely aware of cases in U.S. cattle. The U.S. government said last week that a second dairy worker contracted bird flu since cattle first tested positive in late March and that investigators are looking into whether the person was wearing or offered protective equipment. Nearly 24,000 farms sell milk around the country, and they offer varying protections to staff. Lobby group the National Milk Producers Federation said it encouraged farms to use protective equipment in line with federal recommendations and heard of increased worker protections. Three dairy workers, seven activists and two lawyers who assist farm employees told Reuters that dairy owners have not offered equipment like face shields and goggles to staff who spend 10- to 12-hour days side-to-side with cows. Three large dairy companies with tens of thousands of cows declined to comment on their procedures. The workers — all based in New York, a major dairy producer — said they heard of the new illness affecting cattle through the media or community organizers, not their employers. One, 39-year-old Luis Jimenez from Mexico, said last week it was business as usual. \"They're not doing anything,\" he said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April and May advised workers to use personal protective equipment (PPE) if they may be exposed to sick livestock, after a Texas dairy worker tested positive for bird flu. On May 6, the agency asked states to make equipment available to workers. CDC wants \"to make sure that farm workers across the country, whether they are at a farm with an affected herd or not, have access to PPE,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, last week. New York state said it is assessing CDC's recommendation and has not yet distributed equipment. Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, where cattle were infected, said they distributed equipment to eight dairies combined. Kansas, Idaho and Wisconsin said they have equipment, but no farmers asked for it. Michigan, where the second dairy worker tested positive, said many farms have protective gear but the state is coordinating a way to make it available for those that need more. Dairies became more aware of bird flu's risks in late April after the U.S. government began requiring that cows test negative before crossing state lines, said Emily Yeiser Stepp, who oversees a National Milk Producers Federation program that covers workforce development. Still, \"reaching out into some of our rural networks takes a little longer,\" she said when told of workers who said they were not informed of recommendations for protective equipment. Close contact with cows The U.S. confirmed bird flu in dairy cattle in nine states. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples. Bird flu has caused serious or fatal infections globally among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. In cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads. Health experts advise dairy workers to wear gloves and disposable coveralls that can block milk splashes on their bodies or clothing. Jimenez said his coworkers are under pressure to work so quickly that they sometimes do not have time to wash their hands before meals and often drive home in their work clothes. Workers attach and detach milking equipment on cows, putting their faces close to unpasteurized milk. Most are immigrants and many do not have health insurance. \"When you're milking, splashes can't be avoided. When it splashes in our eyes, we wash it out with water,\" said another New York worker, who requested anonymity because he is undocumented. Lucas Sjostrom, a farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, uses robotic machines to attach milking equipment to cows, but said he is being extra conscious that human workers wear gloves while transporting unpasteurized milk. Minnesota has not reported bird flu in cows. In Indiana, another state without confirmed cases, farmer Steve Obert said he has not increased precautions for workers, though that could change if his herd tests positive. Extra protective equipment is not comfortable to wear, he added. \"We're rather isolated and I don't think the risk is really great,\" said Obert, executive director of the industry group Indiana Dairy Producers. Blood-red eyes The infected Texas worker suffered conjunctivitis and broken blood vessels that turned his eyes scarlet red, according to a photo published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He reported wearing gloves when working with cows but not respiratory or eye protection, the journal said. Scientists are watching for changes in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans. Epidemiologists said it could cause more serious illnesses if it mutates or infects someone with a compromised immune system. Some dairies with infected cows have resisted allowing federal officials on their farms because of financial concerns, said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases. The CDC said it would like to test more farm workers, but it is not required. New Mexico had anecdotal reports of workers with symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, but most were not tested, according to internal state documents that were dated April 26 and obtained by Reuters under a public records request. The workers were not tested because they did not seek healthcare, the New Mexico Department of Health said. Policy changes are needed to encourage workers to seek treatment, such as emergency income assurance for those who test positive, said Brian Castrucci, an epidemiologist and CEO at health policy group the de Beaumont Foundation. \"I don't want to wait until we have a dead dairy farm worker until we ratchet up what we're doing,\" he said.",

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in April and May advised workers to use personal protective equipment (PPE) if they may be exposed to sick livestock, after a Texas dairy worker tested positive for bird flu. On May 6, the agency asked states to make equipment available to workers. CDC wants \"to make sure that farm workers across the country, whether they are at a farm with an affected herd or not, have access to PPE,\" said Nirav Shah, principal deputy director, last week. New York state said it is assessing CDC's recommendation and has not yet distributed equipment. Texas, New Mexico and Colorado, where cattle were infected, said they distributed equipment to eight dairies combined. Kansas, Idaho and Wisconsin said they have equipment, but no farmers asked for it. Michigan, where the second dairy worker tested positive, said many farms have protective gear but the state is coordinating a way to make it available for those that need more. Dairies became more aware of bird flu's risks in late April after the U.S. government began requiring that cows test negative before crossing state lines, said Emily Yeiser Stepp, who oversees a National Milk Producers Federation program that covers workforce development. Still, \"reaching out into some of our rural networks takes a little longer,\" she said when told of workers who said they were not informed of recommendations for protective equipment. The U.S. confirmed bird flu in dairy cattle in nine states. Scientists have said they believe the outbreak is more widespread based on findings of H5N1 particles in about 20% of retail milk samples. Bird flu has caused serious or fatal infections globally among people in close contact with wild birds or poultry. In cows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it believes unpasteurized milk is the primary vector for transmitting the virus, though officials do not know exactly how it spreads. Health experts advise dairy workers to wear gloves and disposable coveralls that can block milk splashes on their bodies or clothing. Jimenez said his coworkers are under pressure to work so quickly that they sometimes do not have time to wash their hands before meals and often drive home in their work clothes. Workers attach and detach milking equipment on cows, putting their faces close to unpasteurized milk. Most are immigrants and many do not have health insurance. \"When you're milking, splashes can't be avoided. When it splashes in our eyes, we wash it out with water,\" said another New York worker, who requested anonymity because he is undocumented. Lucas Sjostrom, a farmer and executive director of the Minnesota Milk Producers Association, uses robotic machines to attach milking equipment to cows, but said he is being extra conscious that human workers wear gloves while transporting unpasteurized milk. Minnesota has not reported bird flu in cows. In Indiana, another state without confirmed cases, farmer Steve Obert said he has not increased precautions for workers, though that could change if his herd tests positive. Extra protective equipment is not comfortable to wear, he added. \"We're rather isolated and I don't think the risk is really great,\" said Obert, executive director of the industry group Indiana Dairy Producers. The infected Texas worker suffered conjunctivitis and broken blood vessels that turned his eyes scarlet red, according to a photo published in the New England Journal of Medicine. He reported wearing gloves when working with cows but not respiratory or eye protection, the journal said. Scientists are watching for changes in the virus that could make it spread more easily among humans. Epidemiologists said it could cause more serious illnesses if it mutates or infects someone with a compromised immune system. Some dairies with infected cows have resisted allowing federal officials on their farms because of financial concerns, said Gregory Gray, a University of Texas Medical Branch professor studying cattle diseases. The CDC said it would like to test more farm workers, but it is not required. New Mexico had anecdotal reports of workers with symptoms similar to conjunctivitis, but most were not tested, according to internal state documents that were dated April 26 and obtained by Reuters under a public records request. The workers were not tested because they did not seek healthcare, the New Mexico Department of Health said. Policy changes are needed to encourage workers to seek treatment, such as emergency income assurance for those who test positive, said Brian Castrucci, an epidemiologist and CEO at health policy group the de Beaumont Foundation. \"I don't want to wait until we have a dead dairy farm worker until we ratchet up what we're doing,\" he said.",

        "content": "CHICAGO — Many U.S. dairy farms have not yet increased health protections against bird flu for employees during an outbreak in cows, according to workers, activists and farmers, worrying health experts about the risk for more human infections of a virus with pandemic potential. Epidemiologists are concerned the virus could potentially spread and cause serious illnesses as farmers downplay the risk to workers while employees are not widely aware of cases in U.S. cattle. The U.S. government said last week that a second dairy worker contracted bird flu since cattle first tested positive in late March and that investigators are looking into whether the person was wearing or offered protective equipment. Nearly 24,000 farms sell milk around the country, and they offer varying protections to staff. Lobby group the National Milk Producers Federation said it encouraged farms to use protective equipment in line with federal recommendations and heard of increased worker protections. Three dairy workers, seven activists and two lawyers who assist farm employees told Reuters that dairy owners have not offered equipment like face shields and goggles to staff who spend 10- to 12-hour days side-to-side with cows. Three large dairy companies with tens of thousands of cows declined to comment on their procedures.

        "description": "The Panthers still feel confident in their abilities despite back-to-back overtime losses to the Rangers in the Eastern Conference finals.",
        "content": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — After a dispiriting overtime loss to New York in Game 3 on Sunday , Florida coach Paul Maurice said he wanted his players to “keep the growl.” He wanted to let the disappointment power the team in Game 4 so they could even the series. With the puck drop for the crucial fourth game set for 8 p.m. at Amerant Bank Arena on Tuesday, the question is how the Panthers can turn the disappointment from back-to-back overtime losses into fuel. “I think you sit on it a little bit last night; obviously, it stung,” Panthers center Sam Bennett said. “But you wake up today, it’s a new day, another opportunity tomorrow and that’s really the only way you can go about it. I think we did a good job. Everybody was in good spirits today. That’s where our focus is.” Part of the reason the Panthers are in good spirits is because they did play well in the loss . They scored four times, coming back from a two-goal deficit in the third period, and appeared to outplay the Rangers for large portions of the loss. Most glaringly, the Panthers had 108 shot attempts to the Rangers’ 43. “Why would we flush that one?” Maurice said. “We had 108 and gave up (43). Where can we get better? Where can we turn that into a win? Coming to the rink today determined to find answers to deal exactly with the whole thing, to take a look at it, make us better, make us a half-inch better, an inch better for tomorrow night’s game.” The disparity in shot attempts was a rarity, but it led to questions about whether the Panthers should wait for better shot opportunities instead of peppering the Rangers defense and goalie Igor Shesterkin with pucks. But so far, Florida’s strategy has shown success: They scored three goals in Game 1 and four in Game 3. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’ ” Maurice said. “We can be marginally better with the puck because we can make slight improvements with it, but we’re pretty good with the puck.” Beating Shesterkin for four goals is a testament to Florida’s offensive performance. Shesterkin is a former Vezina Trophy winner and was eleventh in the NHL in goals against average this year. He surrendered four goals one other time in the postseason and 15 times out of 55 games in the regular season. “We know what kind of goalie he is,” said Florida winger Vladimir Tarasenko, who played with Shesterkin in New York. “But as I mentioned before, for good goalies, you have to create traffic, make their life harder, and just get the pucks to the net.” Getting pucks to the net did prove difficult on Sunday. Of Florida’s 108 shot attempts, only 37 got to Shesterkin. The Rangers blocked 37 shots. “I think we have all the chances we needed,” Panthers forward Eetu Luostarinen said. “But we actually talked this morning: We have to go to the net with a purpose, get the goalie’s eyes. I think we did that in the first two rounds. That’s a key point for our game.” Florida will have to make sure it gets better for Game 4. The alternative is going back to New York to attempt a 3-1 comeback against the team that won the President’s Trophy. After appearing to be the better team in Game 3, the Panthers are confident they can take advantage of the good parts of their performance and minimize the difficulties they had Sunday. “We’re very excited for the challenge,” defenseman Gustav Forsling said. “I think we did a lot of good things. I think they stretched out that game. I think we played just how we wanted and we created a lot, I feel like. We had a lot of chances. We’re not too happy about the five goals we let in, though.”",

        "description": "There's a new rumor regarding the future of Spider-Man at Sony. It's separate from Marvel, and I think it's the right way forward.",
        "content": "Every rumor that we hear about upcoming Spider-Man movies needs to be taken with a grain of salt. As Spider-Man fans, we too often get treated to waves of speculation about what might happen in potential Spidey films, be it a Tom Holland-led Spider-Man 4 , or the presence of Spider-Man in a Sony spinoff movie such as Madame Web or Venom: The Last Dance . We’ve heard so many, however, it’s nearly impossible for us to know what’s true. The most recent rumor involves former Spidey actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield , who returned to the big screen for Spider-Man: No Way Home and might have more going on in the future... which, to me, is the only way forward for Sony. The new scoops come to us via industry “insider” DanielRPK (via FandomWire ), who claims that Sony wants Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire to return as Spider-Man in the series of films the studio is creating in its live-action Spider-Man universe . This means that Maguire and Garfield would appear opposite Morbius ( Jared Leto ), Vulture ( Michael Keaton ), Venom ( Tom Hardy ), Kraven the Hunter ( Aaron Taylor-Johnson ) and more. The reason why Sony allegedly wants Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield for its multiversal adventures is because Kevin Feige reportedly wants Tom Holland ’s Spider-Man 4 to help flesh out the street-level storytelling that has been teased in recent Marvel Studios efforts such as Echo and the upcoming Daredevil: Born Again . In the closing moments of Echo , Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) announces his plans to run for Mayor of New York City, a popular comic book storyline known as “Mayor Kingpin.” This powerful move could lead to narrative ramifications for Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Spider-Man (Holland), Moon Knight (Oscar Isaac), the Punisher (Jon Bernthal) and several other NY-based Marvel characters. If Marvel Studios truly wants to build out this corner of the universe, you can see why Feige doesn’t want Holland caught up in the Sony universe – especially after he read the Madame Web reviews . Using Tom Holland’s Spider-Man for this street-level story is another reason why I don’t want Spider-Man 4 to use the small dollop of symbiote that was left behind by Eddie Brock in Spider-Man: No Way Home . Listen to me rant about that right here. A post shared by CinemaBlend (@cinemablend) A photo posted by on The trick, however, probably lies in convincing Garfield and/or Maguire to return in something that isn’t being shepherded by Marvel. Sony’s track record in the Spider-Man spinoff universe has been suspect. The studio canceled by Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 4 , and Garfield’s The Amazing Spider-Man 3 . The actors reportedly are wanted for Avengers: Secret Wars , though that’s years from now. And I’ve long argued that Sony using one of the existing Spider-Men – specifically Garfield – is the best way forward for this currently disconnected universe. Because all of these movies need a Spider-Man if Sony wants the audience to care. So why not use one of the ones who has been re-introduced in Spider-Man: No Way Home ? We’ll continue to track the progress of all the Spider-Man developments, from Tom Holland’s Spider-Man 4 to the future of Sony’s Spider universe. Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News",

        "content": "A new leak reveals Apple’s most exciting iPhone in years. The iPhone 16 series launch is still a few months away. But, tech gurus are already talking about a groundbreaking iPhone for 2025. A recent report says Apple is working on a much thinner iPhone model. We had earlier talked about a slim model in the iPhone 17 lineup, but the latest report suggests something more exciting. This ultra-thin iPhone, known as D23, could be a completely new product like the iPhone X was. The iPhone X, launched in 2017, was a big change from all previous iPhones. It started a new design trend for iPhones, with a full-screen OLED display and Face ID facial recognition. iPhone designs haven’t changed much since the iPhone 11 series five years ago. But the D23 could introduce a new design trend for all future iPhones. Apple recently unveiled the new iPad Pro as its thinnest product yet, only 5.1 mm thick. The report says Apple is still exploring designs for the slimmer iPhone. One idea is an aluminium body with a smaller front camera and sensor cutout. Another idea is moving the rear cameras to the top centre of the phone’s back. The screen size will likely be between the 6.1-inch iPhone and the 6.7-inch iPhone Pro Max. The iPhone X also introduced a big price increase to $999. With the potential for another big design change, this new slimmer iPhone will likely be much more expensive than other models in the iPhone 17 lineup. It’ll be interesting to see how Apple positions this model. Will it just be a more expensive, slimmed-down version of the Pro Max, or will it have new features that make it unique? Will it be called the iPhone 17 Slim, or could it start a new “iPhone Ultra” series? While 2025 may seem far away, the idea of a major iPhone redesign is exciting.",

        "content": "Reaction from the basketball world to the death Monday of Bill Walton : “My very close friend, fellow Bruin and NBA rival Bill Walton died today. And the world feels so much heavier now. On the court, Bill was a fierce player, but off the court he wasn’t happy unless he did everything he could to make everyone around him happy. He was the best of us.” — fellow UCLA center, NBA star and Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. “Bill was a special, kind, and genuine person. I’m incredibly grateful for our close friendship, and the time we spent together on the air, out to dinner after the game, or in his teepee in his backyard. An iconic athlete and broadcaster, but more important, a legendary person who always made me smile.” — ESPN broadcaster Dave Pasch, a longtime on-air partner of Walton. “Bill Walton was a brilliant, interesting, thoughtful, humorous and genuine soul who loved life and cared about everyone he encountered. He will be dearly missed by all of us who were fortunate enough to share his friendship.” — Dan Gavitt, the NCAA’s senior vice president of basketball. “Bill’s list of accomplishments on the court, as massive as they are, are only outweighed by the quality of his character and beauty of his one-of-a-kind loving spirit. In the words of our friend and hero — Thank you, Bill, for our life.” — statement from the Pac-12 Conference. “From shooting jump shots to making incredible passes, he was one of the smartest basketball players to ever live. Bill was a great ambassador for college basketball and the NBA, and he will be sorely missed.” — Magic Johnson. “What a privilege to know him.” — longtime Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan. “I am deeply saddened by the passing of Bill Walton, a basketball legend and an incredible human being. ... You will be deeply missed.” — Pau Gasol. “We have lost one of the greatest players and personalities that this franchise, this sport and this region have ever known. Bill Walton is synonymous with Southern California basketball: a San Diego native, a UCLA phenom, a Clipper icon. He defined the game as a player, a broadcaster and an ambassador, spreading joy for generations. Wherever he went, whatever he did, Big Red stood above the crowd.” — statement from the Los Angeles Clippers. “Bill Walton was a legendary player, a hilarious, colorful broadcaster and most of all a wonderful person. I fell in love with basketball watching Bill dominate at UCLA in front of packed crowds at Pauley Pavilion, and I was blessed to get to know him later in our lives when he covered the NBA as an analyst on TV. .... His incredible energy, passion, love and zest for life was never turned off. Our hearts are broken today as we mourn Bill’s passing and grieve with his family.” — Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr. “It's a legend lost.” — Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd.

        "content": "Wouldn't it be neat to see a drone using flashing blue and red lights and a siren to chase down crooks? Well, the Responder quadcopter comes equipped with both, along with other gear designed to help quicken response times when crimes or other emergencies occur. Manufactured by Seattle-based startup Brinc, the Responder is intended for use by police forces, fire departments, ambulance services and other first response agencies. Along with its lights and siren, the autonomous drone is also equipped with a 40x-zoom HD optical camera array; a thermal imaging camera; a spotlight; a two-way communications system including a speaker and microphone; plus a payload system that allows the aircraft to carry and drop life-saving items such as EpiPens, automated external defibrillators, personal floatation devices, and naloxone (for treating opioid overdoses). The idea is that multiple Responders will be stationed throughout the city, each one protected inside its own robotic Responder Station \"charging nest\" when not in use. When a 911 call is relayed to the appropriate dispatcher, that person may decide to send the closest available Responder to the location of the emergency – the aircraft can reportedly take off from its Responder Station in less than five seconds. Depending on the scenario, a slower-traveling human response team may also be dispatched. As the drone is en route, a live feed from its cameras will be relayed to the relevant emergency service via 4G, and viewed on the system-specific LiveOps browser. Once the aircraft arrives at the location – which ideally will take no longer than 70 seconds – someone from the service will be able to have a real-time conversation with the affected individual(s) using the drone's two-way communications system. This conversation may involve providing instructions on the use of a provided EpiPen, etc, or it could entail de-escalating a potentially violent situation. It is estimated that for approximately 25% of incidents, it won't be necessary to send an actual human team. The quadcopter itself can reportedly fly for up to 42 minutes at a time, with one full charge of its battery taking 40 minutes. It can fly autonomously (with help from a forward collision-avoidance system) or be remotely controlled. In the latter case, it can be piloted either onsite using a handheld remote, or from the dispatch center. Brinc is now accepting inquiries from prospective commercial or municipal clients. You can see the Responder in action, in the following video. Source:",

        "content": "NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: The opposition INDIA bloc has called a strategy meeting on June 1 , the last day of voting for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The meeting will discuss the various post-poll scenarios and also pool in the estimates of regional players to assess the performance of the opposition alliance against BJP. The meeting has been called by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge . Sources said the meeting would focus on counting day, with instructions to be given to counting agents and booth agents on the various aspects to be taken care of, and on how to handle the returning officers' \"objectionable overreach\". Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee announced that she would not attend the meeting, saying the state was still dealing with the aftermath of cyclone Remal and the final phase of polling was scheduled on June 1. While the reasons given by Banerjee are seen as understandable, many view it as the West Bengal CM positioning herself for the post-poll scenario. She struck an independent line during the polls by refusing to tie up with Congress in Bengal and then issuing statements that she would only extend outside support if INDIA bloc forms the govt. While she later revised her statement to say that TMC would join any opposition govt, she created doubts in the minds of many about her future plans. A senior TMC MP said it was \"impractical\" to expect the party to attend the meeting. \"CM Banerjee is a voter in Bhowanipore. She will vote on June 1. Party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee is a candidate in Diamond Harbour, which goes to polls on June 1. The party's Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien is also a Kolkata South voter. These three were part of INDIA meetings earlier. Party's leader in Lok Sabha Sudip Bandyopadhyay is a Kolkata North candidate. We have conveyed this to Congress.\"",

        "description": "Fourteen-time champion Rafael Nadal was knocked out of the French Open with a 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 defeat against German fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday. The post Nadal says Olympics is main goal after early defeat at Roland-Garros appeared first on Daily Maverick.",
        "content": "Rafa Nadal likened his struggles with injury in the past 18 months to being in a jungle as the 14-times French Open champion hoped to return to Stade Roland Garros for the Olympic Games after making a premature exit from the Grand Slam on Monday. Never far from physical issues in his glittering career, the 37-year-old missed almost all of 2023 with a hip problem and his comeback earlier this year was stalled by a muscle tear, before small niggles affected his preparation for the clay court major.

(Photo: Ian MacNicol / Getty Images) Nadal crashed to a 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3 defeat by fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Court Philippe Chatrier in Paris and although there were positives, he said he could not predict how his battered body would respond to the demands of the Games in July and August. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,” Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland-Garros. “I’ve been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I’ll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. “So that’s the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what’s the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can’t say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.” Nadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio. He had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of what was probably his final French Open.

(Photo: Ian MacNicol / Getty Images) “Today in the match, I felt I was able to move myself much better than in the previous tournaments. But I had a very tough opponent in front of me. He played well,” Nadal said. “I had my chances... I mean, I wasn’t that far. That’s my feeling. That’s probably my truth... I played at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way I was playing the weeks before. So, happy for that. “Of course, disappointed to lose, but in terms of body feelings, I’m happy that I finished healthy and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more.” Nadal said it would be unwise to prepare for the grass court season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics. “It looks difficult, honestly. For me now, I can’t confirm what’s going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,” Nadal said. “I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay. “Today I feel that’s not a good idea, but I can’t confirm. But my feeling is even if I’m booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Fans were left wondering if the 14-times champion would return to the Grand Slam he has ruled for two decades. The 22-times major champion, who won the Musketeers’ Cup for the first time in 2005 and last raised the trophy in 2022 before a serious hip injury derailed his career, had previously said this year could be his final one on the tour. Having returned to the tournament that he skipped in 2023 and refusing to confirm any farewells ahead of his opener, Nadal showed flashes of top form again on Court Philippe Chatrier, but he ultimately went down fighting. “I’m not 100% sure if it’s the last time but I enjoyed it, the crowd were amazing during the whole week of preparation and today,” Nadal said. “The feelings today are difficult to describe with words but it’s special to feel the love in the place I love the most. “I enjoy playing a lot and travelling with the family. The body is feeling better than two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it’s enough. But it’s something I don’t feel yet.” Victory meant Zverev became only the third man to beat Nadal at Roland-Garros, after Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling, with the German also banishing memories of his retirement due to an ankle injury when the duo last met in the 2022 semifinals. “I don’t know what to say ... thank you Rafa from all of the tennis world, it’s such a great honour,” Zverev said. “I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him twice on this beautiful court.” Nadal was broken by in-form Rome champion Zverev in the opening game and surrendered his serve again late on to drop the first set in unfavourable conditions for him with the roof closed due to heavy rain earlier. Faced with the prospect of only his fourth Roland-Garros defeat in 116 matches, Nadal made a positive start to the next set as he leapt and pumped his fists after holding for 2-2 and broke for the first time with a delicate drop. The crowd began to sense a comeback as Nadal went ahead 4-2 with some vintage shots on both flanks but the steely Zverev hit back in the 10th game and saved two breakpoints before doubling his advantage by edging a high-octane tiebreak. Watched by his great rival Novak Djokovic and a host of other current players, Nadal surged to a 2-0 lead in the third set but squandered it as Zverev drew level and dealt another body blow in the seventh game. The boisterous crowd tried their best to roar Nadal on, but Zverev held his nerve to clinch a famous victory that could well prove to be the springboard he needs to push for an elusive first Grand Slam title.

        "description": "Race attracted nearly 200 runners.",
        "content": "A field of close to 200 runners and walkers came out on Monday to take part in the annual Memorial Day 5K Flag Run with Brooklyn’s Geoffrey Scott taking the men’s portion and Melissa Kraker repeating in the women’s division. The race, run over a double loop in Brookfield Park in humid conditions, was organized by the Staten Island Running Association. In the men’s race, a duel between longtime local stalwart Chris Calimano and Scott took place over the course with Scott pulling away to victory in a time of 16 minutes, 44 seconds. Calimano (17:08) finished in second place with two-time defending champ Jose Davila (18:14) finishing third. “It was so much fun to just be a part of the race today -- winning was just the cherry on top of a good event,” said Scott. “This was my first time running the race, and I loved it. I love these small unpretentious races where folks know each other and just have a good time with each other.” Scott said he had never Calimano before but that the latter had approached him because he had recognized him from other events, but Scott said Calimano had mistaken him for someone else. They chatted for a bit and the two wound up warming up together. “We went out together at the same pace, which was great because it’s always way more fun to be able to race someone, instead of just running by yourself,” said Scott. “At the 2 mile mark, I felt like I could tell I had a bit more energy in my legs. So I started to pull away and then I just tried not to look back.” “Geoff is a strong runner and we went head-to-head until mile 2 then he dropped me,” said Calimano, Staten Island’s top ultra-marathoner. “It was great see a Brooklyn runner joining our local events.” Meanwhile, Kraker (19:57), a longtime top runner, led from the start for the women’s win, followed by Marci Kleisch (20:26) with Pamela Ricker (22:46) finishing up in third place. “I usually have the same racing strategy that I may begin to tweak and revisit,” said Kraker. “Sometimes during a shorter distance, I catch myself losing my comfortable pace by the 2.5-mile mark and slow down to the finish. “That rhythm happened today too...until my SIAC Running Captain Doug Auer shouted out, ‘she’s catching up to you’ at the final turn on the course. Then I turned from jet lagged running to full blown jet and sprinted as fast as I could towards the finish line. And I thanked Doug, too.” *** BELL LAP: Proceeds from the race went to the Merrell/Capodanno American Legion Post for the second year and The Global Academy for Community-Based Education ...

It’s not that we’re mismanaging the money at all – we’re all roughly around the same deficit amount... we’re not being funded for this we’re not being funded for that.” Trustee Corryn Grayston (CSRD areas C, F and G) noted 88 per cent of proposed cuts affect teachers and certified education assistants (CEAs). “That is a dramatic percentage of overall reductions...,” said Grayston. “My feeling is that you know, we continue to hear from our teachers how challenging classes are, how supports are so instrumental for them to be successful...” Grayston suggested leadership go back and “see where some trimming can be done to lessen this impact.” Similarly, school board chair, trustee Amanda Krebs (Salmon Arm) advised “We look to see if there’s anything we can do on the management side to – I would even say to even it up.” “We need to find a solution,” said Krebs. “And I know there’s no magic solution out there, but we need to find something that balances a bit more. So I too believe that in this round of very difficult decisions and cuts, I would look to leadership to revisit management positions and other areas...” North Okanagan Shuswap Teachers Association president Graham Gomme shared a number of the trustees’ reactions to the proposed budget, from it being one of the worst he’s seen, to concerns about the impacts of the proposed cuts. “There’s $3 million in cuts to basically employees of School District 83 and of that, 88 per cent of that are educators and front line workers and the other 12 per cent are people working in facilities support – there’s nothing in management,” said Gomme. NOSTA provided the Observer with the following breakdown of cuts suggested in the budget. The proposed reduction in the classroom and priority learner supports: • 10 classroom teaching positions removed; • 2.6 A=alternate classroom teaching positions removed; • 2 O=online learning teaching positions removed (entire school closed and outsourced); • 1 Indigenous helping teacher position removed’ • 43 education assistants laid off; • 2 educational support workers laid off; • 4 education assistants with decreased hours; • Indigenous education worker position laid off; • 3 Indigenous education workers with decreased hours; • and 1 (of only 2) school psychologist removed. “We have education psychologists who are the ones that categorize students,” commented Gomme. “They’re the only ones qualified to do so... we have two of them and they’re actually a couple out of Kamloops and they come here to do the job and they’re cutting one of them.” Proposed cuts to facility support staff include: • 14 custodians laid off; • 3 custodians with decreased hours; •1 bus driver position laid off; • 4 ground support staff removed; • 1 payroll clerk removed. On the administration side, Gomme said one person is being added (school principal). In a public statement, NOSTA said with the various proposed cuts, “our most vulnerable students will face reduced support and resources.” “The layoffs of 43 education assistants, 2 educational support workers, and the reduction in hours for four education assistants will further strain classroom dynamics and individualized learning support,” said NOSTA. “Additionally, the elimination of one school psychologist and cuts to Indigenous Education Workers will severely impact the mental health and cultural support systems critical to many students... “These cuts underscore a failure to support the essential needs of students and educators, perpetuating a system that prioritizes management over direct educational support.” Gomme anticipates the budget will be up for a second reading at the June 18 school board meeting. He hopes anyone concerned with the proposed cuts will speak to their schools and be heard. “I didn’t see this coming, I knew they were going to make cuts but this is way beyond what I ever imagined,” said Gomme.",

        "content": "David Lynch Teases New Project Coming Next Month By Acclaimed filmmaker (Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive) shared a cryptic video on social media, announcing that there will be a secret project set to be unveiled this coming Wednesday, June 5, 2024. “Ladies and gentleman, something is coming along.... for you to see and hear,” Lynch said in the . “And it will be coming along on June 5.” It has already been nearly a two decades since Lynch went on a hiatus from directing feature-length movies. His last feature directorial project was 2006’s Inland Empire, which was a psychological thriller starring Laura Dern. In addition, Lynch recently expressed his hopes of making his long-delayed animated film in the future, even though the project already got rejected by Netflix. David Lynch’s Reaction to Denis Villeneuve’s Dune Movie In 1984, Lynch directed a film adaptation of Frank Herbert’s novel, which was led by Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides. Despite the novel’s critical success, the film failed to impressed fans during its initial theatrical run. However, as the time went by, it eventually gained a cult following. When the first installment to Denis Villeneuve’s Dune reboot was released, Lynch admitted that he in watching the Timothee Chalamet-led adaptation. “Because it was a heartache for me,” Lynch explained. “It was a failure and I didn’t have final cut. I’ve told this story a billion times. It’s not the film I wanted to make. I like certain parts of it very much — but it was a total failure for me.” Maggie Dela Paz has been writing about the movie and TV industry for more than four years now. Besides being a fan of coming-of-age films and shows, she also enjoys watching K-Dramas and listening to her favorite K-Pop groups. Her current TV obsessions right now are FX’s The Bear and the popular anime My Hero Academia. Share article Related",

        "content": "Listen to Story In a tragic turn of events in Madhya Pradesh's Sagar district, a Dalit man on Sunday died in the Khurai vilage after some miscreants thrashed him for not complying with their demands of reaching a reconciliation in connection with a brawl that resulted in the death of one of his relatives, Nitin Ahirwar nine months ago, police said. The accused had called Rajendra Ahirwar (24), who was a witness of the months-old incident, to one Pappu Rajak's home to talk over the matter and get done with it. But they allegedly attacked him after he refused to give in to their demands. Both Rajendra Ahirwar and Pappu Rajak got injured in the scuffle and were admitted to the hospital where the former died during treatment. The police reached the spot and registered a case against five accused, Aashiq, Bablu, Israil, Faheem and Tantu on the basis of the statement recorded by Rajendra Ahirwar's father. Tragedy struck twice as what further shocked everyone was the death of Rajinder Ahirwar's niece Anjana, who fell off the hearse van, when it was ferrying Rajinder's body after his postmortem before it could reach Badodia village. Notably, Ranjana was the one who narrated the whole story of the attack on Rajinder Ahirwar a day before and was at the Bundelkhand Medical College during his treatment and the postmortem as well. Additional SP Sanjeev Kumar said that the investigation is underway in the entire series of events that have transpired in the last two days. Meanwhile, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijay Singh reached the residence of the deceased girl to pay his condolences and demanded proper action in the matter. The senior Congress leader demanded the district collector and superintendent of police of Sagar be sacked and said \"The administration promised to give Anjana a government job, did they give her one? They made some other promises too like demolishing houses (of the accused), did they demolish? I am not in favour of bulldozing someone's house, but you demolish many persons' houses in the name of action\". Also, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to X (formerly Twitter) and alleged that the BJP was going to change the Constitution as they didn't want women and the deprived section of society to live with dignity. Nitin Ahirwar was allegedly beaten to death by a group of people in a matter of an old enmity in Sagar last August.",

        "content": "A RUSTY 1979 Chevrolet truck has been rescued after being abandoned in woods for 30 years. A dad and son team brought chainsaws to hack away branches that were trapping the classic vehicle . \"It looks to be in awful shape but don't let looks deceive you,\" the men told other car enthusiasts on YouTube . In their 45-minute-long YouTube video, motoring gurus Patrick and his son Jacob, filming as DontbeWily ( @DontbeWily ) and DBW4shorts ( @DBW4shorts ) explained how they found the abandoned 1979 C 20 Chevy truck rusting away. \"We are going to try to start it,\" said Patrick as they carefully picked their way through the woodland on a large farm. \"This thing has been sitting here forever, and it's got a great anti-theft device on it,\" he added, referring to the branches twisting through the vehicle. The rats have been there a while, that's not good. The men found several rats' nests, an empty tank and \"no beauty mirror.\" \"They've (the rats) been there a while, that's not good,\" Patrick told his sons. While birds tweeted in the background in the isolated rural setting, the men noted that the classic vehicle had been there for so long that an oak tree had grown right around - and even through - it. \"So we have a '79 model custom deluxe Chevrolet truck that we're pretty sure has been sitting in this very spot for 35 years,\" viewers were told. When the men lifted the bonnet, Patrick was dismayed to see damage to the wires. \"I see the rats have chewed a plug... see where the rat's been in there?\" The men looked at the dipstick, and checked the vehicle's air con system. There was confusion over some of the wiring - with it possibly being tampered with in the past few decades, Patrick added. The keys were still in the ignition, but the engine didn't immediately start. Minutes later, with Patrick working his magic on the abandoned vehicle , he told his son he was going to \"put the transmission in gear and just see if it moves.\" Incredibly, the men managed to get the truck started. \"I think the next thing is driving it out of here, sounds pretty good!\" Patrick added. He then introduced viewers to the farmer whose late father owned the abandoned vehicle - one of several on the property. \"I got the privilege of meeting him (the man's dad),\" he said. Martell's Salvage yard in Wishek, North Dakota, has been run by a single family for four generations, with cars, trucks, and tractors spanning over 70 years. Sitting on over 100 acres, the yard claims to have thousands of vehicles available for restoration selling for only a few thousand dollars. The 38-acre Colorado Auto & Parts wrecking yard was established in 1959, and features jaw-dropping muscle cars from the 1960s and 1970s. In Kansas a junkyard is filled with vehicles from the 1960s to the 1980s, all in varying conditions. Included in the mix is a vintage variety of third and fourth-generation Chevrolet Impalas, a 1961 Buick LeSabre, a 1958 Chevrolet Delray, and a smattering of Ford and Mopar models. Dozens of American classics - like a 1968 Chevy Chevelle SS, a 1980 Pontiac Trans Am, and a 1970 Chevy Nova SS, were filmed by drone in the US ahead of a huge sell-off. Hundreds of decaying cars have also been discovered in a New Jersey forest. A 40-year-old collection of cars went under the hammer after its owner decided to part ways with nearly 300 rusting relics . There was a lengthy discussion about using chainsaws to chop away thick oak branches piercing parts of the Chevy truck. The clip was applauded by fellow classic car enthusiasts, who enjoyed watching the difficult - but ultimately successful - mission. \"For it to have sat so long, it fired right up. It might need some transmission fluid and the brakes freed up. Great job guys! Thanks for sharing!\" posted one man. \"That old Chevy fired right up - l am glad that you and Jacob got it all freed up and ready to move out of its spot, good video,\" wrote another. \"Nice to see old trucks like that, and it still starts. Hard to find trucks like that, they almost don't exist. Love the content keep it coming,\" asked one viewer. The dad and son also recently shared an inside look at an old chicken farm that was turned into a vintage car graveyard . Some of the damaged vehicles had been sitting there for decades, with many covered in rust. One of the main highlights of this particular barn was a 1959 Chevrolet Corvette that was last on the road in 1984. Also in the U.S, a family has been busy buying and selling junk cars for nearly 70 years, establishing itself as more than just a yard in the community.",

Somehow, is in this too, after the auto-tune legend was seen dancing to \"Not Like Us.\" Debatably the biggest song of the entire back-and-forth war, the final stab to chest of Drake has continued to grow. Part of the reason for that is just how much it has been played at various artists' concerts. Not too long ago, the West Coast anthem was being spun at one of 's In the end is there really a better way to hype up a crowd than to play this brutal track? Well, the audience members at T-Pain's Las Vegas show were certainly enjoying watching him get down to the bouncy track. In fact, one fan claims that \"It was lit last night, played kdot song about 5x lol.\" Another user agrees that it was \"lit,\" saying, \"he was hittin that s*** tho😂\" This was just the second tour stop for T-Pain last night. For those who do not know, the is in the beginning stages of his . According to , this set of shows was named after the famous lyrics in the 2008 hit \"Can't Believe It\". It began on May 25 and it will run through July 3 in Miami. However, things will not be slowing after this solo trek. He will be joining for the starting on August 21. What are your thoughts on T-Pain dancing to \"Not Like Us\" at his recent show? Do you think he is siding with Kendrick Lamar over Drake? Is this still the best song from the beef, why or why not? Do you believe it is being played to shower more hate on Drizzy, or because it is popular? We would like to hear what you have to say, so be sure to leave your takes in the comments section.

        "content": "Canada’s main stock index posted a small gain Monday, helped by strength in energy and industrial stocks. The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 52.51 points at 22,373.38. With U.S. stock markets closed for the Memorial Day holiday, things were relatively quiet north of the border since Wall Street has a lot of sway over Bay Street, said Les Stelmach, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Canada. In Canada, this week will bring earnings from major banks after TD kicked off the group last week. The bank reported lower profits for the quarter as it booked costs related to U.S. investigations into its anti-money laundering program. Investors will be looking for how much money the banks are setting aside for bad loans, said Stelmach. “I think bank earnings have been resilient through most economic cycles, but there’s just a continuing theme about stress on the consumer, higher mortgage rates, rollover of mortgages, as we persist in this higher interest rate environment,” said Stelmach. Story continues below advertisement “I don’t think you’ll see anything earth-shattering in the quarterly results,” he added. The email you need for the day's top news stories from Canada and around the world. As has been the case in recent months, markets will be eyeing the banks’ outlooks for the rest of the year, said Stelmach, reflecting ongoing uncertainty after expectations for interest rate cuts have been rapidly dwindling as the year progresses.

What changes could the retailer make off public markets? Canadian MPs vote to ban replacement workers with ‘anti-scab’ bill “Inflation is still a concern in the U.S. particularly, and so that might keep (the U.S. Federal Reserve) on the sidelines longer than people think,” he said. Heading into 2024, markets were pricing in about six rate cuts by the Fed this year, said Stelmach, but that’s been pared back significantly. Now, many market watchers think it’s possible that the central bank could cut just once in 2024, after a string of stronger-than-expected economic data has dampened hopes for lower rates. Trending Now Thousands of NÜTRL tumblers recalled after dozens report illness 369 stolen vehicles from Ontario worth $33M recovered, many at Port of Montreal In Canada, the economic data is much more supportive of a rate cut, said Stelmach, but the Bank of Canada is in a tough spot because it doesn’t want to diverge too much from the Fed. Diverging too much could affect the Canadian dollar, he said, and put Canada in a difficult position if any economic surprises change the trajectory of rates in the U.S. or elsewhere. This week will also bring economic reports in the U.S. on consumer confidence, GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, which Stelmach said is another important indicator of inflation. Story continues below advertisement “The U.S. economy more broadly has been stronger than people have expected it to be,” he said. The Canadian dollar traded for 73.34 cents US compared with 73.14 cents US on Friday. Commodity markets were also closed for the U.S. holiday.",

        "content": "West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Monday said that she would not be able to attend the meeting of the INDIA alliance on June 1 as the last phase of voting in West Bengal will be held that day. Addressing an election rally in Kolkata , Banerjee said, “The INDIA bloc earlier said they would hold a meeting on June 1. I told them I wouldn’t come as we will still have polls here like a few other states. How can I go when there is a cyclone and relief operations going on the one hand and elections on the other?” Earlier, Banerjee had that the TMC would support the INDIA alliance from outside but later she changed her stand saying the coalition is her brainchild and she is very much part of it. Advertisement Pointing out that the party has so far attended all meetings of the Opposition bloc, sources in the TMC said Banerjee, party general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and other top leaders would be voting on June 1. The TMC had conveyed this to the alliance organisers, they added. Voting will take place in nine seats in West Bengal on June 1. Citing relief work in the cyclone-affected area as her priority , Banerjee on Monday said, “My focus is ensuring relief for people. I am holding a meeting here but my heart lies with the affected people.” “This time too, there has been a lot of damage in our state due to the Cyclone Remal. The loss of lives is above everything else. Fortunately due to the action of the state administration, the loss of life this time is comparatively less,” Banerjee said.",

I think , in the future, is gonna be known as one of the most important hip-hop albums of all time. That one and JAY-Z’s . But, people are hitting me and telling me their thoughts and telling me their opinions and I’m blocking all of that because I listened to the record.

        "description": "A new university program brings in Indigenous business owners to engage with students — and it's having positive results for those involved.",
        "content": "Whadjuk Ballardong woman Rebecca Barlow has learned a fair bit in the six years since she began her fashion label Deadly Denim. She's a creative person — and there are some more mundane aspects to running a business she simply doesn't have the time or the skills to cover. But when she was asked by a Perth university to take part in a course bringing together students and Indigenous business owners like herself, she was in. The Edith Cowan University unit, Retail Marketing, sees students use First Nations owned enterprises as their real-world case-study for assignments like developing a marketing strategy or redesigning their website. Ms Barlow, whose work has been shown at fashion shows across Australia, and , said it was about creating a safe space for the students to learn in an inclusive and diverse workforce. \"I often get asked, because I'm very fair [skinned], if I'm allowed to do what I do, and I've never been offended by that. I think that's really great that people ask,\" she said. Opportunities for reconciliation Lecturer Melissa Fong-Emmerson said the unit had input from Indigenous colleagues, mentors, friends and communities. \"[We are] including their views of the world in a strength-based way, and in a way to decolonise the marketing industry and higher education,\" she said. \"It's a transition from a culture of exclusion to one of inclusion. \"As educators, we are well positioned to prepare our students for multicultural, diverse workforces, while also promoting reconciliation and better outcomes by recognising the importance of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. \"We want to be able to use the power of education as a force for growth and good.\" Space for 'mob to be seen and heard' Nyikina woman and artist Molly West took part in the course last year with her small business, Bilya Djinda. \"Aboriginal people, like all First Nations people, have been educators for tens of thousands of years, with each generation responsible for passing on that knowledge to the next,\" the 18-year-old from Northam said. \"Over the last few centuries Aboriginal people's voices have been oppressed, and this really important cycle of knowledge sharing was interrupted, which meant that our stories weren't being shared and our culture not understood. \"So what we need to do now is create the new cycles of First Nation knowledge, which is exactly what's happening when we create that space for us mob to be seen and heard.\" Marketing student Jessie Barnes worked with Ms Barlow and Deadly Denim two years ago, picking up some design work for the company after completing the unit. \"It was really important to learn about the cultural differences and the backgrounds so that we could respectfully represent her business,\" she said. Another student, Olivia Warner, worked with Ms West more recently and said the opportunity had provided her with so much more than simply learning aspects related to her degree. \"I am very conscious of the fact that I don't have a network of people around me with any Indigenous culture at all,\" she said. \"I think the beauty of [this] unit, and the message behind it, is that this is the place to have those kinds of conversations. \"Teaching university students to have these kinds of conversations, empowers them to have these kinds of conversations once they leave uni and challenge that in institutions.\" As a passionate educator, Ms West – a descendant of the Stolen Generation – couldn't agree more. \"Education of our culture should be incorporated across as many fields as possible as it impacts so much whether we're discussing land management, art, history, teaching, storytelling, etc,\" she said. \"And who better to learn all this from than Aboriginal people. \"There's a saying that I really, really love: 'nothing about us, without us'. \"It's a really important concept to keep in mind that if First Nations people are being discussed, we should be included in that discussion.\" And Ms West said decolonising universities and other Western practices and institutions provided a safe space for Aboriginal people to be themselves. \"And by being ourselves, we get to excel and do some really incredible things,\" she said.

        "content": "By IAN NICHOLAS QUILLEN, Associated Press BALTIMORE (AP) — Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBIs, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Red Sox on Monday. Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston’s Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs — six earned — over four innings as the Red Sox lost their third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles’ six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. Romy Gonzalez of the Red Sox hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore’s Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore’s lineup, but made the most of his 33rd career start. After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out, and drove Criswell’s 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn’t retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore’s lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox’s Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks in his first turn in the rotation and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O’Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was “most likely” to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said. Red Sox right-hander Brayan Bello will try to earn consecutive quality starts for the first time this season on Tuesday after allowing three runs in six innings of Boston’s 8-5 win at Tampa Bay last Wednesday. The Orioles counter with right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, who tries for his first back-to-back wins since early April. Get breaking news and analysis delivered to your inbox during baseball season.

        "description": "What happened to Trista Sutter? Isi she still married or sick? Here's a timeline of her husband's posts about her being missing , where she went and where she is now.",
        "content": "Trista Sutter confirmed she's “happy and healthy” following time away from her husband, Ryan Sutter, and their two kids . The first bachelorette's whereabouts, relationship status and health were questioned after her firefighter husband posted a message about missing her and not being able to contact her. In a lengthy post on May 25, the former reality star explained her absence, writing that “an opportunity for perspective and personal growth presented itself” and she took it.However, she did not further clarify what happened and where she went. The original couple met and got engaged during the first season of \"The Bachelorette,\" the spinoff \"Bachelor\" series, in 2003. They are parents to son Maxwell, 16, and daughter Blakesley, 15. Married over 20 years, the couple previously told TODAY in 2015 that they credit their successful marriage to making time to develop their relationship. “It’s just like your job,” Trista Sutter said. “You have to put in the time and effort and energy that you do into everything else in your life. And I feel like (Ryan and I) do that. We’ve had our bumps in the road, just like anyone else, but it’s really about staying focused on each other and dedicating time to each other.” Read on for more on what happened to Trista Sutter and what Ryan Sutter posted about his wife. What happened to Trista Sutter? Trista Sutter and her husband Ryan Sutter both said she took some time away from her family. It's unclear where she went, what she did or for how long she was gone. In a May 17 post, Ryan Sutter wrote , “Trista is at a place in life where she is searching a bit.” He explained that “an opportunity presented itself that may help her on that quest. With her family’s support, she has taken it. Part of that process means that she is temporarily inaccessible to us.” Additionally, the former dancer also shared similar sentiments when she broke her silence, writing in part, “An opportunity for perspective and personal growth presented itself and with the unconditional support of my family and friends, I chose myself and betterment, knowing that my stay-at-home-mom job and my kids end-of-the-school-year needs were in the best, most capable hands.” She said she would share “the rest of the story” in due time. What did Ryan Sutter post about Trista Sutter? In mid-May, Ryan Sutter began sharing seemingly cryptic posts on Instagram about how much he missed his wife, Trista Sutter, and how he wished that he could talk to her. At the time, he didn't share her whereabouts or if something had happened to her. May 11: Ryan shares first post about missing Trista On May 11, 2024, Ryan Sutter posted a black-and-white photo of the former physical therapist looking out at the ocean. “They say that absence makes the heart grow fonder. I can think of only a handful of days I have not, at minimum, spoken to this incredible woman. She is the love of my life and my best friend,” he wrote. “I cannot imagine loving her any more or any more fondly.” He concluded the post, “But I guess we’re gonna find out.... I miss her already.” May 12: Ryan says he wishes Trista was with them for Mother's Day Ryan Sutter continued to post about his wife’s absence in a Mother’s Day post on May 12 . In it, he wrote, “I know you wish you were here for Mother’s Day. We wish you were too. But sometimes being a mom means letting go of their hands, granting independence and stimulating their courageous spirit.” He added in part, “Sometimes you have to go away so they know you’ll come back, that your love is not limited by distance or difficulty or time. Sometimes you have to do what you sometimes have to do.” At this point, he started to get comments asking if Trista Sutter was OK, while others praised his way with words. “What is going on here? Concerned...” one person commented, while another added, “Ryan, you have such a beautiful way with words. I love how you love and support your wife, while also allowing for the growth of your children while she’s away. Such a great husband and father. Cheers to you and Trista.” May 17: Ryan says he wishes he could talk to Trista By May 17, the father of two shared a selfie of him and Trista Sutter, along with a message dedicated to her. \"I really wish I could talk to you. Ask you how you’re doing? How was your day. I’d really like to hear your voice — just for a minute. So many times I’ve called without much to say, not realizing how lucky I was or how much I’d miss the opportunity if it were gone,” he began. “I want to know how you’re doing. I want to support and encourage and cheer you on. I want to be there for you. But I can’t. And that’s OK cause I know you need this time — time to discover yourself again,” he added. Ryan Sutter continued, writing how he would be there for her when she returns, “I’ll be here to listen to you, to smile with you, maybe cry with you — I’ll be here to love you... I’ll be here... forever.” May 17: Ryan says 'Trista is fine' As the fireman kept posting and receiving comments asking about his wife, he shared the first update about her. Ryan Sutter began by noting that he likes to write what is on his mind, with no intention of deceiving or misleading anyone. “Trista is fine. We are fine. We’re great. Trista is at a place in life where she is searching a bit,” he then shared . “An opportunity presented itself that may help her on that quest. With her family’s support, she has taken it. Part of that process means that she is temporarily inaccessible to us.” He concluded, “I miss her. We miss her.” May 21: Ryan explains his messages about Trista After the posts began to get media attention, Ryan Sutter attempted to explain why he was posting messages for Trista Sutter in a May 21 caption. He said he “chose to post a message\" for his wife \"for a time when she could eventually read it.\" \"She understood the context and so did I. No one else did however, and that’s where things went sideways,” he continued. He brought up rumors that she had died, that their marriage was \"in trouble\" or that she was experiencing a midlife crisis, “among many other creative ideas.” He discredited “intentionally misleading people in order to somehow benefit from it,” but decided to speak out after friends and the media started speculating about their lives. “All because I missed my wife and chose to share how that felt,\" he said. Sutter, who works as a firefighter and says he drives “a pickup to a blue collar job,” feels “pretty normal” and wasn’t expecting his posts to get pickup. But he acknowledged that 21 years ago, he was “pretty famous,” and this attention was a reminder of “how crazy life was” back then. “To be honest, it also felt good to know people still cared, and worried and wondered. It felt good to be noticed and inspired me to do better at paying attention to others — when they do good or when they need help,\" he said, ending with the hashtag #life. He reassured people that everything was OK. What did Trista Sutter say about her absence? May 25: Trista Sutter breaks her silence Weeks after Ryan Sutter's first post directed at her, the former Bachelorette shared an update and explained her absence. In a lengthy Instagram post, she joked, “Geez people. Can’t a girl have a nervous breakdown/trial separation/midlife crisis/death/divorce in peace around here?!” She then added, “In all seriousness, for those concerned, I’m safe and sound, happy and healthy, in love and grateful. For those who’d rather focus on being critical and searching way too hard for darkness, good luck with that.” At this time, the former reality star echoed her husband's words about “an opportunity for perspective and personal growth\" presenting itself and she took it. She explained that her reserved husband decided to share his love for her in messages that she would read during her travels. “We look at Instagram like a digital diary. Most of the time, the world doesn’t pay too much attention. This time, he couldn’t say anything right and just about every news outlet picked up his ‘cryptic/confusing/attention-seeking/dramatic’ pictures and captions,” she wrote. “To me, they gave me exactly what my Words of Affirmation love language needed to get me through some serious self doubt and fear...and that’s all that matters.” Noting that they don’t owe anyone an explanation, Trista Sutter did add, “If you want to know the rest of the story, I will share in due time.” For now, she would be vacationing in Mexico with her family, concluding, “After all, nervous breakdowns and separations require much needed rest and relaxation!” Ryan Sutter would go on to share a family selfie on the beach on May 26 . \"They say absence makes the heart grow fonder.... We found out it’s true. It also makes the heart more grateful, more sympathetic, more appreciative for what someone does for you, with you, alongside of you. It brings questions and wonder and worry and then answers and peace and celebration. It brought time for reflection, for projects, prayer and independence but mostly it brought joy at its conclusion. Real joy. And that’s really what it’s all about...\" he wrote.",

        "description": "The visit came as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged Ukraine's allies to rethink their restrictions on Kyiv usng Western weapons to strike inside Russia, a key demand of the Ukrainian President.",
        "content": "Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky called on Monday on the West to \"use all means\" to force Russia to peace talks during a visit to Madrid, which pledged one billion euros in military aid as a Russian offensive gained new ground. The visit came as NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urged Ukraine's allies to rethink their restrictions on Kyiv usng Western weapons to strike inside Russia, a key demand of the Ukrainian President. \"We need to intensify our joint work with our partners to achieve more. Security and tangible coercion of Russia to peace by all means,\" Mr. Zelensky told a joint press conference with Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Also read: G-7 ministers cite ‘progress’ but no done deal on Russian assets for Ukraine Russia meanwhile announced it had captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, the lastest in a series of gains in recent weeks. Ukraine said that France would soon send military instructors. On the back foot, Ukraine has been pressing its backers - especially the United States - to allow it to use longer-range weapons they supply to hit targets inside Russia. Washington and other allies have been reluctant to permit Kyiv to strike over the border out of fear that it could drag them closer to direct conflict with Moscow. Mr. Zelensky pressed home the point in Madrid. \"We need to work together and put pressure not only on Russia, but also on our partners to give us the opportunity to defend ourselves against Russia,\" Mr. Zelensky said. \"Even those partners who are afraid to give this or that advice should understand that air defence is defence, not attack,\" reiterating his call for aerial defence systems capable of intercepting the 3,000 aerial bombs hitting Ukraine each month. There are signs of a Western rethink. Mr. Stoltenberg told NATO lawmakers in Sofia on Monday that the time had come to reconsider lifting those restrictions. \"If (Ukraine) cannot attack military targets on Russian territory then it ties one hand of the Ukrainians on their back and makes it very hard for them to conduct defence.\" On Sunday, however, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposed giving Ukraine greater flexibility on Russian targets. \"I think we have to be very careful,\" she told Italian television. Earlier this month, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said during a visit to Kyiv that Ukraine had every right to use British-donated missiles to strike inside Russian terrority. Questioned on Monday, Mr. Sanchez was evasive, saying he \"had no such desire\". \"We will be at Ukraine's side for as long as it takes,\" Mr. Sanchez said, announcing a military aid package as part of a security pact \"to enable Ukraine to strengthen its defence capabilities.\" Patriots needed Ukraine is calling for U.S. Patriot air defence systems to counter Russian bombardments, arguing that it has only a quarter of the resources it needs. In Madrid, Mr. Zelensky said he needed \"seven additional Patriot systems,\" including \"at least two for Kharkiv,\" which is close to the Russian border and is being regularly shelled. Mr. Sanchez said Spain had already sent Patriot missiles to Kyiv, and is \"working with various allied countries to see exactly\" how many more launchers can be sent. In a separate effort, French military instructors would soon arrive in the war-battered country, Kyiv's army chief Oleksandr Syrsky said Monday \"I have already signed the documents that will allow the first French instructors to visit our training centres soon and get acquainted with their infrastructure and personnel,\" Mr. Syrsky said on social media. Russians take two more villages Less than three weeks before a Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland, Zelensky ruled out proposals by China and Brazil to invite Russia \"because Russia will block everything.\" Mr. Zelensky had been due to visit Madrid on May 17, but postponed his trip after Russian troops began a major assault on the Kharkiv region. Russia on Monday claimed to have captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine, where a strike on a hypermarket in Kharkiv, the country's second-largest city, killed 16 people on Saturday. A new strike on an industrial zone in the city killed a woman on Monday, authorities said. A separate Russian attack on the village of Snigurivka in the southern Ukrainian region of Mykolaiv left three dead, including two teenagers, and wounded six more, the regional governor said.

In his video, Jimmy Darts films himself asking Linda, a woman who had been living on the streets for almost a decade, for food. In response, the 76-year-old woman offers Jimmy most of her food, insisting he take it without asking for anything in return. After Linda, who lives on the streets in Costa Mesa, California , gives him a stack of food, she assures the 28-year-old that she still has something to eat 'I have $1,000 for you,' Jimmy then tells a bewildered Linda. 'I was just helping out the first person to help me.' The internet has raised more than $44,000 for homeless woman after her kind gesture for TikTok creator Jimmy Darts went viral Linda, who is seen getting emotional in the video, tearfully responds by saying she was going to use the money to sleep in a motel for the night rather than the tent she had been sleeping in - even in the stormy weather. Overwhelmed by her generosity and kindness, thousands of TikTok users donated to her cause via a GoFundMe page , initially aiming to raise more than $30,000 for her - a goal that was surpassed. Jimmy reunited with Linda to share the news, and documented her reaction in a TikTok, which has been viewed more than 7.2 million times. 'I can get a van,' she said emotionally. 'That's my next step from getting up off the street. 'I need to get a van where I can sleep, I can work, I can take care of myself, I can be mobile.' 'I know which one I'll get,' she added. 'I know which one - I've been watching one.' In a follow-up video, Jimmy added that $44,000 had been raised through the GoFundMe page in the end, which allowed Linda to move into her own place and buy a van. 'The only word I can think of - but it's not big enough - is humbled that I am in this group, that you have helped,' she gushed. Overwhelmed by her generosity and kindness, thousands of TikTok users donated to her cause via a GoFundMe page, which she said she was using to buy a new van @jimmydarts Linda is now off the streets 🥹❤️ ♬ original sound - Jimmy Darts On the GoFundMe page for Linda, Jimmy shared more of her story. 'She told me that she's been homeless since 2015 and that she became homeless so that she could help understand and help them more,' he said. 'Her mission is to help the homeless in a deeper way and help them get the real sustainable help they need.' 'I love that this is her mission and I want her to have more than enough to help the homeless,' he wrote compassionately. 'Let's make sure that she is taken care of and more and if she ever wants to stay at a hotel or get a small place of her own to go in and out of.' 'Linda is my hero,' he concluded on the GoFundMe page. According to figures from 2023's U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Annual Homeless Assessment Report, California accounted for 49 per cent of all unsheltered people in the country, which is around 123,423 people. This is nearly eight times the number of unsheltered people in Florida, the state that has the next highest number. Additionally, at 75 per cent, California had the second-highest rate of homeless people staying in unsheltered locations.

        "description": "A judge has ruled in favour of a man for injuries caused by 'ECT torture'.",
        "content": "By Jimmy Ellingham of RNZ A former patient of the child and adolescent unit at Lake Alice psychiatric hospital has won a court appeal for ACC to cover injuries suffered during electric-shock torture. The man, whose name is suppressed, was denied cover by the corporation for cognitive impairment, mental disorder and burn injuries for when he was forced to undergo electroconvulsive therapy, known as ECT, in the mid-1970s. The man was aged in his mid-teens at the time. But after a hearing late last month, Judge Denese Henare ordered ACC to cover the man for burn injuries, a brain injury and cognitive impairment caused by “ECT torture”. “While the claim seeks cover for injuries as treatment injuries the evidence shows the ECT administered at Lake Alice was not anything like treatment, it was ECT torture,” Judge Henare said in her just-released decision. She instead classed the injuries to the man as a personal injury, and ACC must fund neuropsychological testing to find its extent. The judgment did not order any sums of money but ACC must pay the man’s costs. The ECT was administered by the unit’s lead psychiatrist Dr Selwyn Leeks on a machine he modified to make the shocks more powerful. The Lake Alice unit, in Rangitīkei, closed in the late 1970s when Leeks moved to Australia. He died two years ago, having never faced justice for his actions. Shortly before his death police said there was enough evidence to charge him but he was unfit to face trial. In 2023, ACC covered the man for physical injuries - sprains, strains, contusions and a minor head injury “relating to the unconventional ECT administered”. It also accepted cover for post-traumatic stress disorder as a mental injury. The man did not think this went far enough, saying he still was not getting help for his cognitive problems and ACC was not adequately recognising the injuries he received. He had long-standing memory problems and could not even recall properly one of his children, who had died. The judge agreed with the man. The man filed a claim with ACC for cognitive impairments in 2016. ACC initially declined claims in 2018. In 2019, a reviewer upheld its decision not the provide cover for a brain injury, as no specific personal injury could be identified, and for the burn injury, due to the absence of evidence from the time. However, the man said records from Lake Alice were not accurate. Despite this, those records were relied on by psychiatrists when assessing him. The man said he was rendered unconscious by ECT many times at Lake Alice, in either planned sessions or those administered as punishment. He was also injected with painful paralysing drug, paraldehyde. ‘The events of Lake Alice cannot be forgotten’ “[He] said the effects of the abuse, cruelty and torture that he suffered were not just confined to his time at Lake Alice. They had been lifelong,” Judge Henare said. The man and his family had suffered as a consequence of what happened to him, and he might have given up if not for the support of his wife. Dr Amanda Faulkner, a consultant psychiatrist, examined the man. She said it was often overlooked that children and young people received ECT on a machine Leeks had changed, so it was not like conventional shocks which lasted for seconds. “The shocks [the man] received, as also described by multiple other Lake Alice survivors, lasted as long as 20 minutes and with no muscle relaxant or anaesthetic,” Faulkner said. “Children from as young as 4 years old, including [the man], were given these shocks to the point of rendering them unconscious, sometimes multiple times in one day.” ACC said the man’s claim was challenging. It was difficult gathering evidence as it was filed 40 years after the events. It was hard to find experts willing to talk about the effect of ECT in general, and specifically for the man. Its lawyer Fenella Becroft said ACC did not deny what happened at Lake Alice, and the judge praised her for working to achieve solutions to the case. Judge Henare said the man deserved compassion for what he had been through. His brutal treatment at the hands of Leeks was horrifying. “The dark backdrop of this claim is incredibly significant. The grim and appalling events of Lake Alice cannot be forgotten and they cannot be swept under the carpet.” The man told RNZ he was still digesting what the decision meant. “Why should it be so hard and cost so much to get what you are entitled to after being injured, and why have so many GPs shied away from supporting my claim over the years?” he asked. “None would fill the forms I needed over the last 45 years. The system is not working for the injured. “Now I have to jump through many more hoops and form-filling to claim for injury that is made so complicated, many must just give up.” Share this article",

        "content": "Two teenagers hailed as heroes after jumping on rail tracks to stop a man from killing himself have told how the train was just 45 seconds away from them. The teenage “angels” dragged the suicidal man to safety after he leapt onto the tracks at the weekend. Freddie Corbett, 15 and Harley Hollingworth, 16, sprang into action when they spotted a distressed man at Bolton upon Dearne train station in South Yorkshire. The friends were waiting for the last train home on Saturday night when they spotted the man had jumped onto the track with their train heading towards him. But the kind pals brushed aside claims they are \"heroes\" and say they just hope the man is getting help. Virgin Media offers gamers the chance to get £250 but you'll need to act quickly Freddie and Harley told The Mirror they were waiting for the last 10.30pm train home when the drama unfolded. Freddie said: “I feel like we just did what any other lad should have done. I’m very thankful for what everyone has said to us though. “We were a bit shook yesterday because it was a serious moment but we’re all right now and happy it worked out.” The teen told how when they arrived they saw a man sat on the platform in a sleeping bag. “Then he got up and got on the tracks and said ‘I’m going to kill myself tonight’. I said; ‘you’re not doing that mate’. I saw a train coming but jumped straight on and got him off. It was just natural instinct. “My grandma said later; ‘you stupid idiot you could have got squashed’. But my parents are proud. I hope he gets some help now. I’ve spoken to my mum about it and she’s a nurse and she says he will.\" His pal Harley, 16, who also jumped on the tracks to get the man to safety said: “I wasn’t worried about the train, just wanted to make sure Freddie got him off the tracks. We could see the train's headlights coming and it’s not a very long bend.\" Freddie added: “The train was there about 45 seconds after we got off. He kept saying to us ‘you’re good lads’. You could see he was struggling a lot.” Gary Robinson of Network Rail shared his own thanks and said the lads had saved the man's life. In a post on social media, Gary said: \"Called out tonight to a male with intent to self harm on the railway...these two lads were his angels. Dragged him off the railway... sat with him talking till I got there and make no mistakes saved his life! \"Kids get a bad press but with humanity like those lads shown tonight we are in safe hands! These two lads are a credit to their parents and I can’t speak highly enough about them. If you see them buy them a J20 (not old enough for pints yet).\" Freddie's dad, Billy, of Goldthorpe, said he was 'super proud' of the boys, as both parents said it was \"about time we had some good news and good press about our kids\". Billy said: \"My son and his friend jumped onto track and pulled him off the track and pinned him down. “The train did stop, the police were called and then my son and Harley sat and talked to the man until they arrived.\" Harley's dad Dale Hollingworth also praised the boys' actions, saying they had shown “bravery and quick thinking” and said he was as “proud as punch”. Dale, 39, a double glazing fitter from Rotherham, said: “I was buzzing. I’m bursting with pride. He’s just a typical grumpy teenager but clearly you can see he has a heart of gold. “He came home with the Network Rail guy on Saturday night about midnight, who told us they’d been unbelievable. I’m still overwhelmed to be honest.” Anyone who is struggling or needs someone to talk to can call Samaritans 24 hours a day, seven days a week on 116 123.",

        "content": "Police say a man has been charged with attempted murder and other offences after he allegedly used a knife to slash cars, then attacked a motorcyclist riding in North Vancouver, B.C., over the weekend. RCMP say they received several reports Saturday afternoon about a man with a knife near an intersection south of the Deep Cove neighbourhood. A statement issued Monday by police spokesman Const. Mansoor Sahak says the man damaged a number of cars before striking the motorcyclist's helmet and causing him to fall off his bike near Mount Seymour Parkway and Deep Cove Road. District of North Vancouver Mayor Mike Little said Saturday that, based on his conversations with witnesses, the attacker appeared to be in \"distress\" and began assaulting a motorcyclist. He was told the situation could have been far worse if not for the motorcyclist's safety gear and quick actions of a bystander. \"When the motorcyclist retreated from the attacker, a quick-thinking individual opened his car door, allowing the motorcyclist to take refuge while the attacker continued banging on the vehicle,\" Little recounted. Sahak said in the statement that the motorcyclist suffered minor injuries. The statement says numerous officers arrived on the scene within minutes and took the suspect into custody, where the man allegedly assaulted an officer. Police say the man from North Vancouver has been charged with attempted murder, assault with a weapon, uttering threats, mischief, assaulting a police officer, and weapon possession.",

        "description": "Boston is 27-27 a third of the way through the season. “We’ve had a lot of injuries. Guys have really fought to be .500.”",
        "content": "BALTIMORE — The Red Sox’ 11-3 loss to the Orioles here at Camden Yards Monday marked their 54th game of 2024. That means Boston (27-27) already is a third of the way through its regular season. “We’ve had a lot of injuries,” Rob Refsnyder said. “Guys have really fought to be .500.” The Red Sox sit in third place in the AL East, 9 1⁄2 games behind the first-place Yankees and eight games behind the Orioles. Boston has dealt with an overwhelming number of injuries. To be exact, 16 players have combined for 16 IL stints. Trevor Story suffered a season-ending shoulder subluxation eight games into the season. Triston Casas hasn’t played since April 20 because of some fractured cartilage which connects his ribcage to his sternum . The slugger is on the 60-day IL and won’t return until June 21 at the earliest. DH Masataka Yoshida, meanwhile, hasn’t played since April 28 because of a left thumb strain . Lucas Giolito, Boston’s most expensive free agent addition, underwent a season-ending internal brace procedure on the partially torn ligament in his pitching elbow during spring training. Starter Garrett Whitlock also is done for the season. He’s possibly headed for the same surgery after suffering a tear in his elbow ligament . “Obviously we’re missing three big bats in the lineup but the guys that are playing are doing an outstanding job,” manager Alex Cora said. “Romy (Gonzalez) had a good game today. Ref did the same thing. Dom (Smith) put good at-bats. So we feel good where we’re at. Obviously it’s not enough. But I feel really good with the group and what we were able to do in this first part.” Boston is 2 1⁄2 games behind the Twins for the third and final Wild Card spot. “Right there in the Wild Card,” Refsnyder said. “I think all of us can agree that we’d like to be playing better. Offensively, we just need to catch some breaks, just (have) better at-bats honestly. Probably with guys in scoring position we need to do a better job capitalizing on that. We all know that.” The Red Sox rank 14th in runs scored (235) and batting average (.243). They are tied for 12th in on-base percentage (.313). They are 10th in slugging percentage (.402) and ninth in OPS (.715). They rank 21st in the majors in batting average with runners in scoring position (.239). They also are 20th in OBP (.321) and 21st in slugging percentage (.388) in that category. “We’re working behind the scenes and trying to get better at it,” Refsnyder said. “I think a breakthrough is coming honestly. So just keep going. I doubt a lot of people would think that we’d be .500 with this many injuries, especially to our key players like Triston and Trevor. And Lucas in spring training. But the young guys are figuring it out. I like where we’re at. Honestly I think we’ve got some really good baseball ahead of us.” Pitching has been the bright spot. Behind new pitching coach Andrew Bailey , the Red Sox rank third in team ERA (3.22) and fifth in starter ERA (3.10). “They’ve been so, so good,” Refsnyder said. “I think they’re the reason we’re at .500, 27-27. Yeah, they’ve been working really, really hard. ... They keep us, it seems like, in every game. So as an offense we’ve got to step it up.” Cora added, “We’ve got to continue to pitch. We’ve got to be better defensively. I think the other aspects of the game are going to be fine.”",

        "content": "ANN/ THE STRAITS TIME – Factory output in Singapore continued to slide in April, but the decline rate was significantly lower than the previous month, despite being worse than analysts’ forecasts. Manufacturing production fell 1.6 per cent in April compared to the same month in 2023, a notable improvement from the 9.2 per cent drop recorded in March. The sector has experienced a turbulent period, with 12 consecutive months of decline up to October 2023 and only four months of gains since then. Excluding the biomedical cluster, output in April actually rose 1.7 per cent year on year, according to Economic Development Board data released on May 24. The biomedical cluster saw the most significant decline, shrinking 29.1 per cent in April, primarily due to the pharmaceuticals segment, which plunged 54.6 per cent because of lower output for products and a different mix of active pharmaceutical ingredients. The cluster’s decline came despite a 13.6 per cent increase in the medical technology segment on the back of higher export demand for devices. The electronics cluster slid 1.1 per cent year on year. While parts of the cluster expanded, they were unable to offset the 2.6 per cent contraction in semiconductors, which account for the bulk of Singapore’s electronics output. On the flip side, all the remaining sectors expanded, led by transport engineering, which appeared to fire on all cylinders, with output climbing 10.6 per cent. The marine and offshore engineering segment stood out in the transport engineering sector with production surging 18.8 per cent, supported by improved activity in the shipyards, as well as increased output in oil and gas field equipment. Aerospace fared well too, with output up 8.2 per cent amid higher demand from commercial airlines as travel demand worldwide continued to recover strongly. Only the land segment contracted, down three per cent. Output also expanded in general industries, which grew 7.3 per cent; chemicals, up 3.1 per cent and precision engineering, ahead 2.9 per cent. Economists told The Straits Times that the weakness in semiconductor manufacturing was unexpected.Essec Business School’s Associate Professor Jamus Lim said, “Indeed, I am a little surprised by the downturn in electronics.",

        "content": "CHICAGO — George Springer, Bo Bichette and David Schneider homered, and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the lowly Chicago White Sox 5-1 on Monday. Chris Bassitt struck out seven in five scoreless innings as Toronto stopped a three-game slide. Bassitt (5-6) allowed five hits and walked none against his first major league team. Springer connected in the second inning after Daulton Varsho reached on a two-out walk against Nick Nastrini. It was Springer's fourth homer of the season. Bichette led off the fourth with his fourth homer, a 419-foot drive to center. Nastrini (0-4) allowed three hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked four. Last-place Chicago lost its sixth consecutive game. It dropped to 15-40 for the worst 55-game start in franchise history. Gavin Sheets homered in the eighth against Erik Swanson for the only run for the White Sox, who went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position and left 11 runners on base. Chicago trailed 3-1 before Schneider hit a two-run shot off John Brebbia with two out in the ninth. Schneider's drive to left drove in Springer, who led off with a single. Andrew Benintendi had three of Chicago's 10 hits. Sheets and Corey Julks each had two hits. The White Sox loaded the bases in the first but failed to score. Paul DeJong flied to right for the final out. TRAINER'S ROOM Blue Jays: RHP Chad Green (right teres major strain) joined the team in Chicago on Monday following his rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo. Manager John Schneider said he could be activated as early as Tuesday. ... RHP Bowden Francis (right forearm) will pitch Tuesday for Buffalo in what likely will be his final rehab appearance before he is activated from the injured list. UP NEXT Toronto's Kevin Gausman (3-3, 4.47 ERA) will face fellow right-hander Mike Clevinger (0-3, 6.75 ERA) on Tuesday. Gausman struck out 10 in six innings in a 9-1 win at Detroit on Thursday. Clevinger has lost each of his last two starts. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

        "content": "Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBIs, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday. Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston's Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs — six earned — over four innings as Boston lost its third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles' six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore's Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore’s lineup, but made the most of his 33rd career start. After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out, and drove Criswell's 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn't retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore's lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox's Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks in his first turn in the rotation and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. TRAINER'S ROOM Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O'Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was “most likely” to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said. UP NEXT Red Sox right-hander Brayan Bello will try to earn consecutive quality starts for the first time this season on Tuesday after allowing three runs in six innings of Boston's 8-5 win at Tampa Bay last Wednesday. The Orioles counter with right-hander Grayson Rodriguez, who tries for his first back-to-back wins since early April.",

Paddling enthusiasts Lynn and Robert Diebel have also published a popular guidebook, “Paddling Southern Minnesota’’ (2007, Trail Press of Madison, Wis.) It offers narrative accounts of possible routes, put-in locations and maps. Here’s your abbreviated guide to some of the best: Middle Fork Little Crow River An easy afternoon paddle starts in New London and leads to the sparkling waters of Nest Lake. The scenic Mill Pond in New London is the perfect launching point for this fun and easy paddle. Minnesota River There are more than 330 miles of waterway to explore, starting at Big Stone Lake and reaching the Mississippi River at Fort Snelling. Of course, there’s ample opportunity to make two- or three-hour excursions to discover short but exciting segments of the river. The Minnesota River meanders through an oversized valley carved by the Glacial River Warren. The glacial waterway carved a path some 200 feet deep and two miles wide. It offers the modern explorer scenic vistas of wooded blufflands, towering granite outcrops and tree-lined shore lines. There is no portion of the river lacking scenery, but arguably the most scenic portion of the river runs from the Upper Sioux Agency State Park south of Granite Falls to Redwood Falls. This portion of the river offers some of the most dramatic examples of the granite outcrops. Chippewa River Officially designated as a state canoe route, the Chippewa River offers gentle paddling during normal water conditions and surprising scenery of islands, woodlands and steep bluffs. The best paddling is found above the Watson Lion’s Park. Starting points for adventure include Ambush Park in the city of Benson, Big Bend and the Lentz Landing at the Minnesota Highway 40 bridge east of Milan. Lac qui Parle River The Lac qui Parle River offers an opportunity to surprise an incredible array of wildlife, from eagles and owls to softshell turtles the size of wheel covers. The river’s sharp bends, towering cut banks and occasional whitewater makes every outing an adventure. The most popular route is an approximate three-hour paddle from Lac qui Parle County Park to Lac qui Parle State Park near the confluence with the Minnesota River. Pomme de Terre River The fast-moving Pomme de Terre offers opportunities to surprise otters and an astonishing variety of birds, while viewing the changing prairie and woodland landscape. The Pomme de Terre also offers some of the area’s best angling opportunities for walleye. Popular trips include runs from the Swift County Park on U.S. Highway 12 north of Appleton to the city of Appleton, and from Appleton to Marsh Lake. Hawk Creek/Yellow Medicine River When water conditions are right, Hawk Creek and the Yellow Medicine River offer some of the state’s very best whitewater paddling opportunities. Each spring, the two waterways attract whitewater enthusiasts from around the state. On both waterways, be prepared to be on your own. There are very few intersecting bridges or signs of civilization as the waters race toward the Minnesota River. Trips on Hawk Creek often start near or upstream of U.S. Highway 212 and continue to Renville County’s Skalbekken Park at the confluence with the Minnesota River. Trips on the Yellow Medicine River often start at the Minnesota Highway 274 (Wood Lake Road) bridge and continue to the Minnesota River where paddlers can continue to Renville County's Skalbekken Park for their take out location. It’s advisable to scout out water conditions before attempting a trip, or contact Clean Up the River Environment at 320-269-2984 for information on water levels. Real-time data on water flows on Hawk Creek are also available online at www.dnr.state. mn.us/waters/csg/index Little Crow River It gets its start in Pope County, but the North Fork of the Little Crow River is best for canoeing as it leaves the Lake Koronis Spillway near Paynesville. There are rapids and hidden snags to watch for, but much of the river is well-suited for family canoeing.",

        "content": "ANN/THE STAR – Malaysia has overtaken Thailand as Southeast Asia’s second-largest auto market, following Indonesia. This shift marks a significant change in the region, a crucial area for Asian automakers. Nikkei Asia analysed sales data from industry groups in Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The data revealed Malaysia’s auto sales, which had long been third, surpassed Thailand’s for three consecutive quarters through January to March 2024. The Malaysian Automotive Association reported a five per cent increase in auto sales in the first quarter compared to the previous year, reaching 202,245 vehicles. This followed with an 11 per cent increase in 2023, resulting in a record 799,731 vehicles sold. Sales tax exemptions for domestically produced vehicles – part of the government’s economic stimulus package – provided a tailwind for the national car brands Perodua and Proton, which held about 60 per cent of the market share. The tax exemptions started during the pandemic year of 2020, and although they ceased in mid-2022, the fulfillment of tax-free bookings continued to boost figures in 2023, according to the association. “Many new model launches including electric vehicles (EVs) with very competitive prices helped to spur sales,” it said in a statement. Toyota sales agent Ivan Khoo told Nikkei Asia that sales in the first two months of 2024 were better than expected and that the Vios was the most popular model, as it is priced below MYR100,000. “I see both segments, for Toyota’s ICE (internal combustion engine) and hybrid cars, will continue to do well,” Khoo said.",

        "description": "Fourteen-time Roland Garros champion Rafael Nadal once again refuses to rule out a return to the Paris clay, but tears and cheers flow as he loses his opening match to Alexander Zverev.",
        "content": "The tennis career of the greatest clay court player the sport has seen may well be over after Rafael Nadal was beaten by Alexander Zverev in the first round at the French Open. The 6-3, 7-6(7/5), 6-3 loss to the fourth seed was only the second time in 19 attempts that Nadal lost a match at Roland Garros before the quarterfinals. The 14-time champion was watched on Court Philippe Chatrier by fans from around the world and tennis royalty including Novak Djokovic, Iga Świątek and Carlos Alcaraz, waving goodbye for what is likely the final time. \"If it's the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself,\" Nadal said. The noise on the court was loud and relentless, a chorus of thousands of belting out \"Ra-fa! Ra-fa!\" whenever he found the occasional moment of brilliance to remind them of any of his 14 runs to the crown in Paris. The 15,000 or so on hand roared their support when Nadal stepped out onto the court and continued to do so for every act thereafter, no matter how mundane or regulation. It is the first time in his long and illustrious career that Nadal has been beaten in two consecutive matches on clay courts — he lost to Hubert Hurkacz at the Italian Open on May 11 — and the first time he has dropped a match earlier than the fourth round at the French Open (he exited in the third round due to walkover in 2016). He had indicated 2024 likely would be his last season before retirement, but . And he reiterated that after Monday's defeat, only his fourth in 116 career matches at the place. \"It's difficult for me to talk,\" said the Spaniard, whose young son, Rafael Jr, sat on his mother's lap in the stands. \"I don't know (if) it's going to be the last time I am here. I am not 100 per cent sure.\" ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that’s making headlines. While Nadal said it is doubtful he will enter Wimbledon, which he won twice and starts on July 1, he did note that he hopes to return to Roland Garros later that month, when the Paris Olympics' tennis competition will be held at the French Open's site. The 22-time grand slam champion was simply unable to play at his usual level after 18 months of hip and abdominal injuries as evidenced by the match ending, in anticlimactic fashion, with a trademark lasso forehand flying wide and long. \"I tried everything to be ready for this this tournament for almost 20 years and today,\" he said. \"The last two years I have been going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here and at least I did. \"I mean, I lost, but that's part of the business.\" That has historically not been the case for Nadal in France, but on this day it was.",

        "content": "The battle over Elon Musk’s compensation package is heating up as a big advisory firm is recommending shareholders vote against it, and Musk fans are resorting to scare tactics. Over the last few weeks, Tesla shareholders have been voting on several new proposals put forward by the board. The two main proposals that the board is trying to get through are a new vote on Musk’s 2018 CEO compensation package and moving Tesla’s state of incorporation to Texas. The two are closely related as Tesla’s board and Musk have blamed the fact that they lost a lawsuit invalidating the 2018 compensation package on the fact that the lawsuit happened in Delware, where Tesla is incorporated. Tesla incorporated in Delaware, like many other American companies, because the states has laws extremely favorable to corporations. However, Musk believes, without any evidence, that the judge’s decision was politically motivated and believes that Tesla would have better luck in Texas. And Tesla will need better luck because the new shareholder’s vote on the compensation package doesn’t automatically invalidate the judge’s decision to rescind the package and more legal challenges are expected. Tesla’s own lawyers admit it’s basically a poll. Regardless, Tesla has been pushing hard for shareholders to revote in favor the package and the move to Texas. As we previously reported, and even started . The shareholder battle is starting to heat up. We recently reported on and encouraged other shareholders to do the same. Now Glass Lewis, a major shareholder advisory firm whose clients include a significant part of major institutional investors, announced that they are also recommending to vote against it, which they also did in 2018, and shareholders still approved the move. On the other hand, Musk’s army of fans are resorting to scare tactics to push the vote in his direction. We recently reported on Musk’s unless he has 25% control over the company. It was confirmed today that Musk’s new AI startup, xAI, has raised $6 billion a new series B round at a $24 billion valuation. Some of his biggest sycophants, like unofficial chief propagandist Omar Qazi, are now pushing the idea that if they don’t decide to give Musk everything he wants, he will go after Tesla’s AI efforts through its newly funded xAI: Tell me you have Stockholm syndrome without telling me you have Stockholm syndrome: This is basically suggesting that shareholders should fold to Musk’s threat. During the litigation over the compensation package, Musk was directly asked if the package being voted down by shareholders would make him leave Tesla and he said no. However, things could have changed since, but the CEO is conveniently not commenting on this now – seemingly preferring to let his sycophants spread the fear that he would leave Tesla if they don’t vote for his pay package again. I have a hard time believing that Elon would leave Tesla if the package doesn’t go through. That would be giving up and that’s not his type. Also, I haven’t seen many Tesla shareholders argue that he shouldn’t get paid. I think the vast majority of shareholders agree that Elon should get paid, but they want Tesla to address the clear governance issues that led the package to be revoked in the first place and that re now more evident than ever as the board is letting the CEO openly making threats to shareholders. In my opinion, Tesla needs stronger governance because Elon simply doesn’t have the right temperament to lead a public company. Like Leo Koguan, Tesla’s largest retail investor, said, . We are now seeing the repercussions with the threats, the way he fired the entire Supercharger teams to set an example to other execs, and this pay package being rescinded. and subscribe to the .

        "description": "Nurses are better off after a pay equity settlement.",
        "content": "By Susan Edmunds of RNZ Police and teachers are being paid their lowest rates compared with the minimum or average wage in at least 20 years. Infometrics economists crunched the numbers on pay for teachers, nurses and police. Chief forecaster Gareth Kiernan this year had noted MPs were being paid their lowest salary compared with the average wage since the 1970s, before their latest pay increase. The data shows all three sectors’ pay was comparatively lower on a range of measures too. “Compared to historical norms, police pay looks particularly poor, and teachers don’t look that good either,” Kiernan said. “Nurses don’t appear to be quite so bad, although the recent figures are inflated by the pay equity settlement. If you exclude that from the figures, on the basis that nurses were previously being underpaid because it was a female-dominated profession, then their pay isn’t great either.” For police, the lowest pay rate for a sworn officer was $75,063 — the lowest level since 2007, compared with CPI. Compared with average wages, it was at the lowest point of any time since 2003, and possibly since 1969. It was 41 per cent lower than the high point in 1981. Compared with the minimum wage, it was lower than at any time since 2003, and possibly since 1967. It was 63 per cent lower than in 1981. Police officers are involved in a pay dispute, but were expected to have a new pay offer confirmed by the end of August. Kiernan said secondary school teachers’ income relative to the CPI was the lowest in June last year — shortly before their latest pay increase — since 2006. The Post-Primary Teachers’ Association (PPTA) said most of its members were paid at the top of the pay scale, which was $99,216 a year, going up to $103,085 in December. “Over the longer term, teachers’ pay has been reasonably stable compared to the CPI, and the pay increase set to come into effect from December this year should push inflation-adjusted pay up to a level that is higher than was seen at any time between December 1986 and June 2020,” Kiernan said. “That outcome sounds great for teachers, but if we compare teachers’ pay to either the average wage or the minimum wage, it’s a different story. In June 2023, teachers’ pay relative to either of these variables was at its lowest on record, since 1980. Even with the subsequent pay increases that have occurred and/or will occur in December this year, teachers’ pay relative to the average wage or the minimum wage will still be lower than at any time before June 2019.” He said the teacher pay situation could be leading to wider problems. “New Zealand’s poor educational outcomes and persistently poor productivity results, in combination with pay rates that are continuing to decline relative to other wages and salary, potentially become something of a chicken-and-egg problem. “One can’t expect good educational outcomes without good teachers, but good people won’t be attracted to the profession or retained as teachers without good pay either — and primary and secondary education doesn’t seem to be an area where investment in capital equipment, automation, or economies of scale are going to make a significant positive impact. Of course, there are other big issues as well such as the curriculum, assessment methods, and the incentives to teach to the median student’s ability rather than taking a more tailored approach to student needs.” Kiernan said before the pay equity boost that started in 2021, nurses’ pay was at its lowest level compared with the minimum wage in all the available data. “The pay equity boost pushed nurses’ pay in 2022 up to its highest level, relative to the average wage, on record. However, relative to the minimum wage, it was only at its highest level since 2016.” The nurse pay cited was $75,773. “I wonder whether one of the key aspects of each of these professions is that there is limited scope for improved labour productivity and/or greater capital intensiveness,” Kiernan said. “At its simplest, a teacher can only achieve significant ‘productivity’ improvements by having more students per class; a nurse by having more patients under their care; a police officer by covering a wider area. I can think of how technological advances might have made some of these changes possible — electronic monitoring of patients would require less human supervision of patients in hospital, for example. “But my impression is that the advances will have been more constrained than across many other occupations where computers have had a significant effect on people’s output over the last 40 years,” he said. “As a result, average wages at an economy-wide level might have been able to lift faster because people have been more productive, and the mix of jobs in the economy has also changed towards higher-skilled and higher-paid ones. This trend might have meant that specific occupations with a high human element to them have been left behind a bit, relatively speaking, in terms of their pay rates. “It’s a difficult situation because, as we saw during Covid-19 , people seem to implicitly value the human nature of those roles when the going gets tough — but the pay rates don’t necessarily reflect that.” Share this article",

        "content": "close Video Plastic bag ban backfiring? Study: Food-borne illness on the rise California lawmakers have voted to do away with reusable plastic bags after the elimination of single-use plastic bags failed to reduce plastic pollution. \"California’s original ban on plastic bags hasn’t worked out as planned, and sadly, the state’s plastic bag waste has increased dramatically since it went into effect,\" said Sen. Catherine Blakespear, the bill’s author , in a statement . \"California must do its part to eliminate this scourge that is contaminating our environment.\" On Tuesday, California lawmakers in the State Senate and the State Assembly voted to approve two identical bills which would restrict grocery stores and retailers from offering thicker, \"reusable\" bags made out of plastic film to customers. California lawmakers voted to approve two identical bills which would restrict grocery stores from offering thicker, \"reusable\" bags made out of plastic film to customers. (Jeff Greenberg / Contributor) BLUE STATE’S BAG BAN MEANT TO PROTECT ENVIRONMENT BACKFIRES AT STAGGERING RATE: STUDY SB 1053 and AB 2236 would permit grocery stores to sell other types of reusable bags made of cloth, woven textile or other washable textile that can carry at least 22 pounds for at least 300 uses. It also allows for paper bags with at least 50% recycled paper content to be sold for at least 10 cents apiece to customers. California implemented a ban on single-use plastic bags in 2016, but the law included an exception that allowed retailers to use plastic bags with a slightly thicker film coating, able to have more than 125 uses and carry a weight of up to 22 pounds over a distance of 175 feet. However, the move to reduce plastic pollution failed, as customers treated the thicker \"reusable\" plastic bags as disposable. California Public Interest Research Group (CALPIRG) reported a roughly 47% jump in plastic bag waste tonnage since 2014, despite the ban on single-use shopping bags. CalRecycle has observed a roughly 47% jump in plastic bag waste tonnage since 2014, despite the ban on single-use shopping bags. (Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"California’s current bag ban law, which allows businesses to replace thin plastic bags with supposedly reusable ones at checkout, clearly is not working,\" Jenn Engstrom, state director of CALPIRG, said in a statement on Tuesday . \"Plastic companies mass-producing thicker bags circumvent the law’s intent,\" she continued. \"Then, inevitably, discarded bags pollute our communities and environment. We’re thankful the state legislature is taking action to finally ban plastic grocery bags once and for all.\" The bills will be reconciled between the houses and then sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk. If signed, the reusable plastic bag ban would go into effect Jan. 1, 2026. Teny Sahakian is an Associate Producer/Writer for Fox News. Follow Teny on Twitter at @tenysahakian.",

Last-place Chicago lost its sixth consecutive game. It dropped to 15-40 for the worst 55-game start in franchise history. Gavin Sheets homered in the eighth against Erik Swanson for the only run for the White Sox, who went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position and left 11 runners on base. Chicago trailed 3-1 before Schneider hit a two-run shot off John Brebbia with two out in the ninth. Schneider’s drive to left drove in Springer, who led off with a single. Andrew Benintendi had three of Chicago’s 10 hits. Sheets and Corey Julks each had two hits. The White Sox loaded the bases in the first but failed to score. Paul DeJong flied to right for the final out. TRAINER’S ROOM Blue Jays: RHP Chad Green (right teres major strain) joined the team in Chicago on Monday following his rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo. Manager John Schneider said he could be activated as early as Tuesday. ... RHP Bowden Francis (right forearm) will pitch Tuesday for Buffalo in what likely will be his final rehab appearance before he is activated from the injured list. UP NEXT Toronto’s Kevin Gausman (3-3, 4.47 ERA) will face fellow right-hander Mike Clevinger (0-3, 6.75 ERA) on Tuesday. Gausman struck out 10 in six innings in a 9-1 win at Detroit on Thursday. Clevinger has lost each of his last two starts. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB",

We know that not everything goes quite to plan as, later, the Captain is in prison, having been captured by his own side – his real side, not his fake side, though the boundaries do become increasingly blurred. In captivity, he is repeatedly told to report everything that has happened to him. As he writes it all down, again and again, details and memories and decisions shape-shift and are reinforced or remade. A draft is rejected for having a Hollywood ending. What story is he supposed to tell? The unreliable narrator isn’t so much introduced as sprinkled all over the series with a flamboyant flourish. Early on, a scene is rewound and replayed, with Downey Jr delivering the same line in a slightly different register. Memory is unreliable, and we cannot fully trust what we are seeing. This is stuffed with stylistic tics and the visual flair you’d expect from a director who is known for it. Images repeat themselves, becoming bookmarks in memories. A man’s head turns into an egg wearing glasses, which foreshadows a gruesome death. Scenes are cut abruptly and aggressively between locations and time periods. You might not want to know what happens to the squid until you’re right there in the moment, hearing all about it. It begins in Vietnam, where, before Saigon falls, we see the duality of the Captain’s life there, as he tracks and interrogates spies with whom he is also collaborating. After an off-the-books flight out, set up by the CIA in order to allow the General to flee the country, the action moves to Los Angeles, while darting back and forth and all over the place, in time and location. The old-fashioned spycraft provides lots of old-fashioned fun. There are miniature cameras, there’s invisible ink made from household items, a secret code used to send messages back home. There are elements of war, particularly in the harrowing escape from the airfields near Saigon, and this is all perked up with moments of wit and levity. In the US, the Captain, who had been a postgraduate in the US 10 years earlier, returns to university and meets Sandra Oh’s Sofia, who rivals Downey Jr for big-star charisma, and with whom he has a steamy affair. It expands into postcolonial theory and academia, dips into a parodic take on an Apocalypse Now-style Hollywood blockbuster, and generally feels like big and ambitious storytelling that is able to balance its tonal lurches well. It is often darkly funny, often gravely serious, violent, emotional and even silly, and it poses grand questions and leaves them to linger, uncomfortably, without serving you the answers on a plate. The only downside to all this is that, on occasion, it feels like it has blown all of its emotional budget on style rather than substance. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that – it’s a good-looking show, performed brilliantly, and it is fantastically ambitious – but sometimes that leaves it having to explain what’s happening with a poetic voiceover, rather than letting it play out seamlessly, for example. You can see this in the Robert Downey Jr conceit, which I admit I found distracting, as good as he is in the roles. For the most part, though, The Sympathizer is exciting, meaty and a reminder that drama that demands your full and complete attention can be well worth the effort. The Sympathizer is on Sky Atlantic and Now.",

BEIRUT (AP) — International donors meeting in Brussels said Monday they will commit 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in both grants and loans to support Syrians battered by war, poverty, and hunger for the rest of this year and beyond. The pledges surpassed the modest $4.07 billion that the United Nations had appealed for, but was also a significant drop from amounts pledged last year and previously — an indication of persisting donor fatigue as the world’s attention is focused on conflicts elsewhere, including the wars in Ukraine and Sudan, and most recently Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. At last year’s conference, donors pledged $10.3 billion, just months after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and much of northern Syria, killing over 59,000 people, including 6,000 in Syria. This year’s amount is meant both for Syrians inside the war-torn country and for some 5.7 million Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which struggle with economic crises of their own and have been frustrated by the ever-shrinking aid. This year’s pledged total includes 5 billion euros in grants — about 3.8 billion euros for 2024 and 1.2 billion euros for the next year and beyond — and 2.5 billion euros in loans. U.N. agencies and international aid organizations in recent years have struggled with shrinking budgets, and humanitarian officials have decried the budget cuts that have forced the downsizing of aid programs despite skyrocketing poverty. Syria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011, has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of of 23 million. For several years now, the conflict has remained largely frozen, along with efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Meanwhile, millions of Syrians have been pulled into poverty, and struggle with accessing food and health care as the economy deteriorates. The conference brought back the urgency of trying to revitalize a gridlocked U.N.-led roadmap to end the conflict even as the mood in host countries turns increasingly hostile towards Syrian refugees. Officials in tiny Lebanon, which hosts almost 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of others who are undocumented, have been demanding that refugees return to alleged “safe zones” in Syria, even before a political solution is in place to end the war. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Aid organizations and most Western countries believe such places don’t exist and that conditions in Syria are not yet conducive to safe returns. In Brussels, eight EU member states who have called for the reassessment of conditions in Syria to allow refugee returns, reiterated those calls at the conference. Cyprus, which says it has been struggling to cope with surging Syrian migration, was among them, and Hungary echoed similar sentiments. Aid groups have insisted that more sustainable solutions, notably through boosting early recovery efforts to fix infrastructure and help create jobs in Syria is a crucial condition for people to go back. “The more that people that will be lacking essential services, safety, and basic commodities, the more difficult it will be to pave the way towards stability, reconciliation and returns,” Stephan Sakalian, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, told The Associated Press. “If we want to be able to ensure sustainable refugee returns, we have give to the people the possibility to come back voluntarily, safely, and in a sustainable environment,” he added. “Otherwise we risk seeing the reverse trend of people wanting to continue leaving Syria.” Advertisement Advertisement",

        "content": "BEIRUT (AP) — International donors meeting in Brussels said Monday they will commit 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in both grants and loans to support Syrians battered by war, poverty, and hunger for the rest of this year and beyond. The pledges surpassed the modest $4.07 billion that the United Nations had appealed for, but was also a significant drop from amounts pledged last year and previously — an indication of persisting donor fatigue as the world’s attention is focused on conflicts elsewhere, including the and Sudan, and most recently in Gaza. At last year’s conference, , just months after a 7.8 magnitude , killing over 59,000 people, including 6,000 in Syria. This year’s amount is meant both for Syrians inside the war-torn country and for some 5.7 million Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which struggle with economic crises of their own and have been frustrated by the ever-shrinking aid. This year’s pledged total includes 5 billion euros in grants — about 3.8 billion euros for 2024 and 1.2 billion euros for the next year and beyond — and 2.5 billion euros in loans. U.N. agencies and international aid organizations in recent years have , and humanitarian that have forced the downsizing of aid programs despite skyrocketing poverty. Syria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011, has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of of 23 million. For several years now, the conflict has remained largely frozen, along with efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Meanwhile, millions of Syrians have been pulled into poverty, and struggle with accessing food and health care as the economy deteriorates. The conference brought back the urgency of trying to revitalize a gridlocked U.N.-led roadmap to end the conflict even as the mood in host countries turns increasingly hostile towards Syrian refugees. Officials in tiny Lebanon, which hosts almost 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of others who are undocumented, have been demanding that refugees return to alleged “safe zones” in Syria, even before a political solution is in place to end the war. Aid organizations and most Western countries believe such places don’t exist and that conditions in Syria are not yet conducive to safe returns. In Brussels, eight EU member states who have to allow refugee returns, reiterated those calls at the conference. Cyprus, which says it has been struggling to cope with surging Syrian migration, was among them, and Hungary echoed similar sentiments. Aid groups have insisted that more sustainable solutions, notably through boosting early recovery efforts to fix infrastructure and help create jobs in Syria is a crucial condition for people to go back. “The more that people that will be lacking essential services, safety, and basic commodities, the more difficult it will be to pave the way towards stability, reconciliation and returns,” Stephan Sakalian, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, told The Associated Press. “If we want to be able to ensure sustainable refugee returns, we have give to the people the possibility to come back voluntarily, safely, and in a sustainable environment,” he added. “Otherwise we risk seeing the reverse trend of people wanting to continue leaving Syria.” Kareem Chehayeb, The Associated Press",

        "content": "A﻿fter 18 long months, sidelined Dragons speedster Cody Ramsey has taken a massive step towards returning to rugby league. With the world at his feet at St George Illawarra two years ago, the 24-year-old ﻿has been sidelined since being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis - a chronic illness that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. Ramsey has remained part of the club, despite being limited physically, with the Red V splitting his contract up over two years in order to support his road to recovery.

He is a long way off being able to play in the NRL, but the fact that he was out there running around, catching balls and doing a ball session, it's a significant moment for him. \"I spoke to Shane Flanagan about it and he said that he was quite happy to back on the field. They're not talking about a map back to the NRL yet, this is a very early stage. \"He has lost a lot of weight and he has been really sick - but it's great news for Cody Ramsey. His dream is to get back to the NRL and it was a significant step today.\" Ramsey scored 14 tries in 36 first grade appearances for the Dragons after moving from the small town of Molong as a teenager to further his career. Watch the 2024 NRL premiership live and free on Nine and 9Now . He was diagnosed with the illness prior to the 2023 season and was ruled out for 12 months, before the club confirmed Ramsey would take no part in the 2024 campaign.﻿﻿ In other potential boost for the Dragons, captain and halfback Ben Hunt is ﻿reportedly closing in on a new deal to remain with the club, less than a year after he formally requested a release to move home to Queensland. \"Ben Hunt's manager has spoken to the Dragons and they have had some conversations about an extension in 2026,\" Chammas said. \"They've agreed to park those discussions until after the Origin series, but every indication so far is that Ben Hunt is going to extend for one more season. \"He is really happy after a period at the club that he wasn't pleased ... but under Shane Flanagan, they are now talking about a 2026 extension. \"Look for that to be finalised during the Origin series or straight after.\" Hunt was selected at hooker for the Maroons ahead of the June 5 opener. ﻿",

According to the city's Water and Wastewater Cost of Service and Rate Design Study, this could amount to as much as $34 per month for some residents in the Northern California community. The water rate hike includes a 20 percent increase the second year, then the hike drops to 13 percent in year three. Wastewater rates will increase 18 percent in the first two years and 15 percent by year three.

The city said the revenue will help improve and maintain its water system, including fixing bursting pipes. Monthly average bills for single-family homes in Healdsburg are $61.01 for water and $92.55 for wastewater services, according to the Water and Wastewater Cost of Service and Rate Design Study.

The city currently gets about 80 percent of its water from the Russian River. Officials are concerned about the looming elimination of the Potter Valley Project's dams, which would impact flow along the Russian River, the second-largest river in the nine-county Greater San Francisco Bay Area. \"We would see more often the curtailment of our water rights along the Russian River,\" Crowley said to the City Council during a meeting on March 28, as reported by the .

        "description": "At his first major campaign speech following Rishi Sunak's decision to announce a general election, Labour leader Keir Starmer contrasted his leadership against the chaos and instability of Tory rule",
        "content": "Keir Starmer has urged voters to end years of disastrous Tory rule and choose stability under Labour . Starmer said the election was a question of: “Who’s side are you on?” and promised to put the needs of working people at the heart of every decision after Labour win power on July 4. In his first major campaign speech, the Labour leader vowed to stand up for working people, promising he could be trusted on the economy and on national security. Speaking in Lancing Parish Hall, West Sussex, Mr Starmer made an appeal to undecided voters. He said: “The choice is yours. You can stop the chaos, you can turn the page, you can join with us, and together we can rebuild our country.” Voters faced a choice between “service or self-interest, stability or chaos, a Labour Party that has changed, or a Tory Party that has run away from the mainstream”. Mr Starmer said he had “dragged” the Labour Party back to service. He said: “I will do exactly the same for Westminster.” Outlining his plans for government, Mr Starmer said he would cut NHS waiting lists by offering 40,000 extra appointments, tackle anti-social behaviour with 13,000 more neighbourhood police and support officers, and deliver a publicly owned energy company, Great British Energy. Tory minister accused of giving up after jetting off to Greece on holiday Starmer made his first major campaign speech in West Sussex ( Image: PA) But he said: “Elections are about more than individual changes and policies, but about values, temperament, character and a bigger question – whose side are you on? Who do you hold in your mind’s eye when you are making decisions? Everything I have fought for has been shaped by my life. Every change I have made to this party has been about a cause, the answer to that question, the only answer: The working people of this country, delivering on their aspirations, earning their respect, serving their interests.” As he campaigned in the East Worthing and Shoreham constituency, Mr Starmer said his party could overturn the Tories’ 7,000 majority and said Rishi Sunak had no fight left in him to stand up to his party, accusing the Tories of “desperate” campaign tactics. Starmer poses with supporters in Lancing Parish Hall ( Image: PA) At the weekend, the Tories tried to copy Donald Trump ’s playbook with insults, calling Mr Starmer “sleepy” and “weary”. Trump, 77, calls his opponent Joe Biden , 81, “Sleepy Joe”. A defiant Mr Starmer said: “You’ve seen the energy that not only I, but the whole team, are putting into this election. We’ve been waiting for this for four years. I’ve had a smile on my face since January 1, 2024 because I knew this was to be an election year. I’ve wasted nine years of my life in opposition. I’ve worked four and half years to change this Labour Party and now I have the chance to take that to the country. We’re doing that not only with energy, but also with a smile, with positivity.” Sir Keir with candidate Tom Rutland ( Image: PA) Mr Sunak was last night forced to distance himself from the attacks on Mr Starmer. He said: “Substance is what matters in this election.” Mr Starmer mocked the Tories’ chaotic plan for mandatory National Service for 18-year-olds, saying it amounted to a “teenage dad’s army”. He said the policy would be funded by cancelling levelling-up funding, and money from tax avoidance that Labour would invest in the NHS. Mr Starmer said: “All elections are a choice and this is a clear one: levelling up and the NHS with Labour. Or more desperate chaos with the Tories. That is the choice.” Starmer attacked the instability of Tory government, especially under Liz Truss ( Image: Jonathan Buckmaster) And he hit out at Mr Sunak for claiming the economy had turned a corner, accusing him of disrespecting voters who were struggling with sky-high bills and mortgages. The Labour leader said working people had paid the price for Liz Truss ’s time as PM. Mr Starmer told how he had met a couple in Wolverhampton with a three-year-old who wanted a second child. He said: “They found a new house that they could move into. They got a mortgage offer they could afford. They were looking forward to the next step in their life. Liz Truss crashed the economy, their mortgage offer went through the roof, they had to pull out of the sale. “But they also took a more profound decision. They decided they could no longer afford a second child. They will live with the consequences of that for the rest of their lives. That is the price that they paid. How do you think working people feel when the Prime Minister says we’ve turned a corner?” Rishi Sunak ( Image: Getty Images) Secret Tory papers Rishi Sunak has been ordered to publish secret papers showing the impact of his Universal Credit cut. As Chancellor he ignored pleas from activists, including Marcus Rashford , by axing the £20-per-week uplift brought in during the pandemic in 2020. The government had refused to release an analysis examining the impact of not extending the support in 2021. It said it would “not be in the public interest due to the harm it would cause to policy development and delivering for welfare benefit claimants”. In a Mirror victory, the Information Commissioners’ Office has now ordered the Treasury to disclose the details by June 21 – two weeks before the election. The support was axed despite warnings that removing it may plunge 800,000 people into poverty. Six ex-Tory Work and Pensions Secretaries wrote to Mr Sunak urging him to make the Universal Credit rise permanent. Lib Dem Wendy Chamberlain said: “This is a shocking cover-up and proof Ministers are hiding the truth.” The Treasury did not comment due to the pre-election period. New voting rules with tested this election ( Image: PA) Voting IDs Keir Starmer said Labour will “look again” at controversial photo ID rules but hinted it is not a priority. Introduced by the Tories in 2022, the policy means voters must show ID at the ballot box or risk being turned away from polling stations. Concerns have been raised that thousands could be denied a vote at the General Election – the first nationwide test of the rules. Asked by The Mirror whether he would repeal the policy, Mr Starmer said: “We will look at this.” But the Labour leader conceded he had no “great plans” and warned his priority would be fixing the crisis-hit NHS and growing the economy. Mr Starmer also ruled out giving EU citizens the right to vote in general elections. Last year Mr Starmer said it felt “wrong” not to allow those who live and pay taxes in the UK to cast their ballot, but insisted it was “no settled policy”. Asked whether he could rule it out yesterday, he replied: “Yes.” Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves ( Image: PA) Reeves hits out Rachel Reeves will today accuse Rishi Sunak of gambling on an early General Election because his economic plan is failing. In her first major speech of the campaign, the Shadow Chancellor will say: “If we can bring business back to Labour, I know we can bring business back to Britain.” She will accuse the Tories of having let national debt more than double, with the average mortgage holder now paying £240 more a month. The 45-year-old will say: “The Conservatives have failed the economy. The plan isn’t working. And Rishi Sunak’s decision to call an early election is the clearest sign of that. If he doesn’t believe his plan is working, why should you?” Last week, it was reported the PM decided to call the surprise vote on July 4 after he was told there was no room for major tax cuts in the autumn months. One Whitehall source said: “There wouldn’t have been any money left for a people-pleasing budget with meaningful tax cuts.” Ms Reeves will urge voters to use the General Election to “pass judgement on 14 years of chaos”. Furious Tories say Rishi Sunak 'must be stopped' over National Service",

        "content": "Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, Lagos state Governor has assured that his administration would ensure that no child is left behind, as the government will always advocate for their growth. Sanwo-Olu gave the assurance on Monday while speaking at the Y2024 Children’s Day Celebration, themed “Advocate for Children: Advocate for Policies and Actions that Protect and Support Children’s Well-Being,” held at the Police College Ground, Ikeja. The Governor who was represented by Dr. Kadri Obafemi Hamzat, his Deputy reassured that the state government is fully committed to providing children in the state with an enabling environment, skills, and opportunities needed to achieve their dreams and aspirations. He said that as Lagos rises, a future filled with abundant opportunities is unfolding and children should continue to dream big, strive for their goals, and they will surpass their imagination. “As Lagos rises, a future filled with abundant opportunities is unfolding. Continue to dream big, strive for your goals, and you will surpass your imagination. We will always advocate for your growth and ensure no child is left behind.” The Governor pointed out that the government is committed to helping the children develop skills for their future and providing paths to success based on what they are good at. According to him, “Our work is ongoing, and we are committed to giving you the tools and knowledge you need to succeed.” Sanwo-Olu, while acknowledging the roles of the private sector in his administration, stressed that these partnerships have helped the state ensure that the children get the best. He specifically acknowledged companies like Nigerdock and Port and Terminal Multiservices Limited who have generously donated classrooms and other resources to schools in the state. Speaking further, he noted that to help more children go to school, the government has added nine new schools in busy and remote areas. These new schools, according to the him, now have 4,588 students, with 2,310 girls and 2,278 boys, with additional improvement in many existing schools, where over 1,500 projects that include building, renovating, and providing new furniture. Besides, he said through the Project Zero Program, the government has helped 11,957 children who were out of school get back to their studies with all the supplies they needed. “Our new digital Situation Room helps us keep track of how well schools are doing and make sure everything is running smoothly, with security gadget-minded in some of the schools Jamiu Ali-Balogun, the Commissioner for Basic and Secondary Education, earlier in his welcome address, said that children are the future of the State and Nation. He implored them to continue to challenge themselves and excel both in academic and co-curricular activities as the State Government has put a lot of facilities at their disposal to effectively use to their advantage. While commending the teachers for mentoring the children, he stated that they are indeed nation builders and salute their commitment, diligence, and dedication. He, also, commended the parents/guardians for always being a good role model to their children. The commissioner therefore appreciated the Governor and Deputy Governor for their passion and investment in the future of all the children of Lagos State.",

        "content": "A Cedar Lake man was arrested after he left his boat when he crossed the Cedar Lake dredge pipe. Around 1:21 a.m. Friday, Cedar Lake Police were called to the 13400 block of Cedar Street on the lake for a boat ran aground, Police Chief Carl Brittingham said in a release. They saw the boat — a 2003 Baja — sinking and were told someone picked up that boat’s driver on a personal watercraft, Brittingham said. Police found the 43-year-old man and noticed a strong smell of alcohol on his breath, Brittingham said. The man admitted to “operating the boat and speeding while crossing the dredge pipe and striking it,” he said. The suspect was taken to the Lake County Jail and refused to submit to a chemical test, Brittingham said. The Post-Tribune isn’t naming the suspect until he is formally charged. The boat, which didn’t leak any fluid and was therefore deemed a non-hazard, was removed from the lake, Brittingham said. This isn’t the first instance of the dredge pipe being crashed into — or used as a launching pad. Last June, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources issued a temporary rule restricting the speed of watercraft within 220 feet of the dredge pipe. The rule lasted until the end of 2023 boating season; the DNR hasn’t reinstated the rule for 2024. Last May, a boat hit the dredge pipe at high speed, lodging the boat’s propeller into the pipe, the Post-Tribune reported previously, and several people were warned after launching their jet skis off the pipe on June 7, 2023. “If you are caught intentionally jumping the dredge pipe you could be charged and even taken into custody for a misdemeanor,” according to a 2023 statement from the Cedar Lake Police Department. “If you are jumping the pipe, you are likely causing damage to the pipe and the dredging operation in general. “In addition to criminal charges, you could be held liable for damages, including delays in the dredging operation.”",

The owner slowly backed away from his dog and asked it to \"wait\"—a common owners often teach their canines to stay in a designated spot—and showed how six months of training can go down the drain. Instead of listening and staying in one spot, the pup was off as soon as its owner stepped back. The dog didn't just move from the spot—it bolted. When the owner realized what was happening, he flipped the camera to show his dog running off. The dog was clearly done with trying to please his owner and instead wanted to continue on his adventure in the great outdoors. One can't blame the dog for losing focus. The American Kennel Club states that dogs will have problems executing tricks that they do not enjoy or if they see no purpose. Since owners cannot make \"stay\" exciting for a dog, they can instead stress the importance of the trick. reached out to @kevinpickles81 via TikTok for comment. The video left viewers in stitches, as plenty have been put in the same position, hoping the training worked only to be let down. As of Monday, the clip had amassed over 487,900 views, 46,400 likes, and 863 comments since being posted early last month. One TikTok user commented: \"My black Lab only listens when nobody else is around. I'm fully convinced he loves making a fool of me.\" \"I have a brown Lab. I swear he can flip me the finger when I tell him to do something,\" said another viewer. \"Me: watching this hoping for some tips. Also me: oh we're in the same boat,\" one comment reads, with a TikToker joking, \"Ahh you've been to the same training school as us.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "description": "A developer has proposed a 56-apartment complex at 519 Fourth St. that would include 28 dwellings for formerly homeless residents.",
        "content": "An affordable-housing developer is proposing to construct a six-story complex with 56 apartments on a city-owned lot in downtown San Rafael. Half of the dwellings would be reserved as supportive housing for formerly homeless residents, according to the preliminary application from Abode Housing Development. The quarter-acre site at 519 Fourth St. between Irwin Street and Grand Avenue is developed with an L-shaped building that is used for storage by the city’s police and fire departments. City officials want to declare the property as surplus, and by law must prioritize its use for affordable housing development before seeking to sell or lease the land for another purpose. Abode’s application was submitted in response to the city’s solicitation. Last week, the City Council authorized staffers to begin negotiating an agreement with the developer and to declare the property as surplus, enabling the potential development to proceed. Mayor Kate Colin said it is a unique opportunity for the city. “With few sites available, transforming this city-owned warehouse into affordable housing aligns with the City Council’s ambitious affordable housing goals,” Colin said. “We look forward to partnering with Abode, whose experience and commitment to community engagement make them the right partner to bring this project to fruition.” Abode is a nonprofit organization in Fremont that has completed affordable housing complexes with portions of residences reserved for formerly homeless people in Fremont, Santa Clara and Hayward. The developer was selected from a pool of three applicants. The others were Satellite Affordable Housing Associates in Berkeley and the Urban Coalition in Desert Hot Springs. “This project utilizes a key city property near our future transit center and demonstrates the City’s commitment to creating homes for low-income residents in the City,” Chris Hess, assistant director of community development, said in an email. “Partnering with Abode, with its vast experience working with neighborhoods and communities, ensures we’ll deliver significant public value and create a lasting community resource.” The city began soliciting plans in December. In its request for proposals, officials stated that the site is being evaluated as a possible location for a temporary shelter for people experiencing homelessness. “If development timelines permit, the City may seek an interim use as a temporary shelter for unhoused residents,” the document states. The city recently received nearly $6 million in grant funding to assist in its effort to house homeless residents. In an email, John Stefanski, assistant city manager, said staffers are still considering sites for a temporary shelter, a project that would be supporting by the grant. The city has not asked Abode to commit to any interim use, he said. Any such interim use would be negotiated as part of the disposition and development agreement, or DDA, he said. “Whether the land is sold, donated, or leased to the developer will be negotiated as a part of the DDA,” Stefanski said. In its preliminary application, Abode states that the project would provide 55 households. One apartment would be reserved for an on-site manager. Abode proposes on-site supportive services with a full-time equivalent resident services coordinator and a part-time program manager. Although not all homes will be reserved for formerly homeless people, the services will be available to all residents, Abode says in its application. As for the affordability of the homes, 29 apartments will be restricted for households with 20% to 30% of the area-median income. Fourteen will be reserved at 50% AMI, and 12 at 60% AMI. Given the affordability levels, the project would be exempt from provisions of the state of California’s Surplus Land Act, relieving some of the procedural requirements and making it easier to build. Bronwyn Hogan, spokesperson for Abode, said the organization is excited about the opportunity to expand its presence into Marin County. “We prefer to partner with cities that recognize the need for homes that are affordable to low-income households, and who want to work creatively with Abode Housing Development to deliver high-quality homes that meet the needs of the community,” Hogan said. “We believe that the city of San Rafael is such a partner, and we look forward to working closely with city representatives over the next few years as we develop this city-owned property on Fourth Street.” Predevelopment expenses related to the housing project are estimated to be approximately $70,000 in legal fees, title and transaction expenses, background documentation and consultants, according to the city.

        "content": "XINHUA – Thailand’s employment edged down in the first quarter of this year due to a drop in agricultural jobs, the country’s economic planning agency said yesterday. The Southeast Asian country’s labour force amounted to 39.6 million individuals in the January-March period, representing a 0.1 per cent year-on-year decrease, easing from 1.7-per-cent growth in the final quarter of 2023, according to the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC). The slight decline was attributed to a contraction of more than 5.7 per cent year-on-year in agricultural employment during the off-season, while non-farm jobs grew 2.2 per cent, driven by a rebound in tourism, the NESDC said in a statement. Employment in the hotel and restaurant sector expanded 10.6 per cent from a year earlier, thanks to over 9.3 million foreign tourist arrivals in the first three months of 2024, the agency said. The country’s unemployment rate was registered at 1.01 per cent in the March quarter, up from 0.81 per cent in the previous three months, according to the NESDC.",

        "description": "International donors meeting in Brussels said Monday they will commit 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in both grants and loans to support Syrians battered by war, poverty, and hunger for the rest of this year and beyond.",
        "content": "BEIRUT — International donors meeting in Brussels said Monday they will commit 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in both grants and loans to support Syrians battered by war, poverty, and hunger for the rest of this year and beyond. The pledges surpassed the modest $4.07 billion that the United Nations had appealed for, but was also a significant drop from amounts pledged last year and previously — an indication of persisting donor fatigue as the world's attention is focused on conflicts elsewhere, including the wars in Ukraine and Sudan, and most recently Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza. At last year's conference, donors pledged $10.3 billion, just months after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and much of northern Syria, killing over 59,000 people, including 6,000 in Syria. This year's amount is meant both for Syrians inside the war-torn country and for some 5.7 million Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which struggle with economic crises of their own and have been frustrated by the ever-shrinking aid. This year's pledged total includes 5 billion euros in grants — about 3.8 billion euros for 2024 and 1.2 billion euros for the next year and beyond — and 2.5 billion euros in loans. U.N. agencies and international aid organizations in recent years have struggled with shrinking budgets, and humanitarian officials have decried the budget cuts that have forced the downsizing of aid programs despite skyrocketing poverty. Syria's civil war, which erupted in 2011, has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country's pre-war population of of 23 million. For several years now, the conflict has remained largely frozen, along with efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Meanwhile, millions of Syrians have been pulled into poverty, and struggle with accessing food and health care as the economy deteriorates. The conference brought back the urgency of trying to revitalize a gridlocked U.N.-led roadmap to end the conflict even as the mood in host countries turns increasingly hostile towards Syrian refugees. Officials in tiny Lebanon, which hosts almost 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of others who are undocumented, have been demanding that refugees return to alleged ''safe zones'' in Syria, even before a political solution is in place to end the war. Aid organizations and most Western countries believe such places don't exist and that conditions in Syria are not yet conducive to safe returns. In Brussels, eight EU member states who have called for the reassessment of conditions in Syria to allow refugee returns, reiterated those calls at the conference. Cyprus, which says it has been struggling to cope with surging Syrian migration, was among them, and Hungary echoed similar sentiments. Aid groups have insisted that more sustainable solutions, notably through boosting early recovery efforts to fix infrastructure and help create jobs in Syria is a crucial condition for people to go back. ''The more that people that will be lacking essential services, safety, and basic commodities, the more difficult it will be to pave the way towards stability, reconciliation and returns,\" Stephan Sakalian, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, told The Associated Press. ''If we want to be able to ensure sustainable refugee returns, we have give to the people the possibility to come back voluntarily, safely, and in a sustainable environment,\" he added. \"Otherwise we risk seeing the reverse trend of people wanting to continue leaving Syria.''",

        "content": "JUMP down the rabbit hole of brainteasers with this rabbit-themed illusion. Put your observation skills to the test and see if you can find the odd one out in this bunny -filled puzzle . But here is the catch, you have just 20 seconds to spot the unique rabbit in the crowd. At first, you might feel overwhelmed, but take a closer look and you’ll notice one rabbit that stands out from the rest. The brainteaser features 29 cheerful bunnies, all with similar ears, faces, and bellies. Some bunnies are wearing top hats, others are holding things like apples and carrots, and a few even have distinctive fur patterns. However, there’s one rabbit that doesn’t match any other in the picture. Many social media users were left stumped trying to figure out which one of the rabbits was different, while others were simply too distracted by their cuteness to play. But out of the 14 pairs, one lonely rabbit just slightly separates itself from the rest, creating a tough challenge for this illusion. If you couldn't figure it out, here is some help. The rabbit that is not like the others is towards the bottom right of the picture. Still can't get it? the bunny you're looking for is in the fourth row, the fifth one from the left, or second to last in that row. It may be hard to tell, but this bunny rocks a darker yellow pattern on its ears and around its nose, making it difficult to spot. If you're looking for more challenging brainteasers, check out this one where you have to find the differences between the two photos of crowded parking lots. You have a little under one minute to put your attention skills to the test, and spot all ten differences. Another one , created by Bingo company, PlayOJO , tests a player's IQ and vision with an airport-themed brainteaser. Players are looking at a picture of a bustling airport, where you can easily see taxis, buses, planes, and vehicles all around. However, within the crowd of people, there is an important person missing from the plane - the pilot. With the hustle and bustle of the airport present on the scene, it's almost impossible to find him in the chaos. In fact, 76% of people were not able to solve this puzzle, according to PlayOJO. However, if you can crack this challenging puzzle within 10 seconds or less, as well as the others, it could prove that your IQ is much higher than the average person's. Researchers have developed many tests to show how various brain regions react to brainteasers and optical illusions. There are many benefits.",

        "content": "Bob Dylan guitarist Robbie Robertson's kids sue his widow for 'elder abuse' in ugly spat over inheritance The adult kids of Robbie Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, It names Janet Zuccarini, Robertson's 58-year-old widow, as the sole defendant She wed Robertson months before his August death, making him sign a prenup By Alex Hammer For Dailymail.Com Published: 17:08 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 17:12 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments The children of a late guitarist who played lead for Bob Dylan in the mid-late 1960s have sued his widow over allegations of alleged elder abuse. The adult offspring of the renowned Robbie Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, naming Janet Zuccarini, a well-known Toronto restaurateur, as a defendant. She wed Robertson months before his death this past August at age 80, and now the late musician's kid claims she was taking advantage of him in his waning years, especially when it came to the ownership of a Beverly Hills 'trophy home'. That residence once belonged to the producer of Little Shop of Horrors David Geffen, and was purchased by the pair based on an agreement that they would share ownership of the home equally However, the lawsuit claims Robertson - one the founding members of famed Americana group The Band - covered the $1.8 million down payment in full, and cites how within two years, Xuccarini allegedly convinced him to elope. The children of Robbie Robertson, a renowned guitarist who played lead for Bob Dylan in the mid-late 1960s before dying last year, have sued his widow - 58-year-old Janet Zuccarini (seen with the guitarist in 2019) over allegations of 'elder abuse' Delphine, Alexandra and Sebastian Robertson filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior Court, naming Zuccarini, a well-known Toronto restaurateur, as a defendant This, the suit states, happened in a private ceremony 'kept secret' from the artist's kids, while Robertson's health and mental capacity was in decline. Prior to the 2023 wedding, Zuccarini, 58, allegedly had Robertson sign a prenup, as well an amended Tenant In Common agreement that stated if one of them died, the estate of the deceased would continue to pay half of the mortgage. This left the guitarist's estate and trust, Adriane Hibbert and David Jackel, on the hook, and led them to wage the current case against Zuccarini. Robertson's three kids, fellow musician Sebastian, Delphine, and Alexandra, are now part of the suit, which alleges Zuccarini financially abused their father to inherit part of his estate. 'A great time for marriage,' the suit states of Zuccarini's alleged mindset at the time, arranging a private wedding away from the musician's family in March 2023 She then had Robertson, who played with The Band from their inception until 1978, sign the prenuptial agreement, knowing he 'was no longer able to read and would not comprehend the true import of what he was signing.' She then saw an 'opportunity to embark on a marriage with a sick and dying man,' before getting Robinson to spend some $175,957 on renovations and $3,381.31 on 'furniture and furnishings' on the Beverly Hills three-bedroom. A five-time Grammy nominee who was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Robbie is seen here shredding with Dylan back in 1972, before he went on to become one of the founding members of The Band The suit centers around the pair's purchase of this Beverly Hills home, which they said was Zuccarini's handiwork. The home was bought less than two years before Zuccarini wed Robertson in March 2023, a ceremony held months before his death this past August The late musician's kids claim she was taking advantage of him in his waning years, unbeknownst to them, old friends like Dylan, and the guitarist's ex-wife Dominique Bourgeois. The trio are seen together in 2022 The suit slams this as 'financial elder abuse' and 'tortious interference with inheritance', citing how Zuccarini pursued the prenup and wedding in secret so that neither they nor his ex-wife, Dominique Bourgeois, would 'be able to review' it. They claim they only learned about the marriage - allegedly only attended by Zuccarini's sister and brother-in-law - hours after it happened, showing up to the new house for what they assumed was an anniversary party. The trio went on to discern it was a wedding party, after which Robertson’s children said they were told, straight from their father, that 'nothing in his estate plan had changed'. They were further told that they would 'receive all of his property upon death' - a promise that did not pan out following the five-time Grammy nominee's death. The suit, which seeks to cancel the amended Tenancy In Common agreement while also seeking unspecified damages, is currently grinding its way through the California courts. Robertson, who had a professional and personal bond with Dylan that stretched back more than half a century, died of complications created by pancreatic cancer on August 9. When Dylan controversially went electric in the mid-1960s , it was his The Band that provided his onstage backing. Two days after Robertson's death, Dylan told Billboard : ' This is shocking news. Robbie was a lifelong friend. His passing leaves a vacancy in the world.'

        "content": "GLASNEVIN FC skipper Leo Jensen lifted the League Cup for his side at the DDSL Q102 finals over the weekend. Some 4,000 young people took to the pitches at the AUL Complex in Dublin cheered on by almost 20,000 fans. Glasnevin U-11 gaffer Mike O’Sullivan said: “Great memories for all the kids involved.\" It comes after Barry Ferguson, father of Ireland striker Evan Ferguson called for an increase in funding for grassroots facilities so this next generation of Ireland players does not slip through the net. Barry became the DDSL’s Director of Football last year. The FAI unveiled plans to invest €426million towards grassroots projects last June as part of its 15-year Facilities Investment Strategy. The initiative was mentioned in the Association’s Football Pathways Plan, which also proposed that the domestic schedule should be moved to a calendar-year format at all levels. A similar model was pitched by former High Performance Director Ruud Dokter in 2019, only for it to fall by the wayside. The DDSL operated under that format on a two-year trial but has since opted to return to the traditional May to September schedule. But Ferguson remained coy when asked about the proposed revamp at the launch of Q102’s Feel Good Football partnership with the DDSL. He told SunSport in March: “There is a vision document out there and we are looking forward to seeing what comes with the information. “It is an aspirational document and we hope to get a bit more information now over the coming months and we will see how it goes. “At the minute, there probably isn’t that much information available. It happened almost six years ago and didn’t work for several reasons. “We are waiting to see what information comes from it and see what way we can look at things. “It is really difficult to give an opinion without that much information out there.” But the two-time FAI Cup-winning captain with Longford Town reckons that investment in facilities should take precedent. That €426m is part of an overall €863m Facilities Investment Strategy, €517m of which the FAI is hoping to acquire from the Government. Ferguson — who also lined out for Bohemians and Shamrock Rovers — added: “I think that the biggest challenge is facilities. “The weather is constantly getting more erratic at different times of the year. We have had games called off in April, June and July due to rainstorms. “It is getting more and more erratic and it is probably the facilities that need looking at before we look at anything else. “Unfortunately, facilities take time and money. That is where we are. “Football is the most-played sport in the country and everybody is looking to grow the game. “But when you are talking to a lot of our clubs, they are full. “They have got waiting lists so we can’t grow the game if clubs are full. “We need to grow the game and to do that with the weather and climate that we have, we need better facilities. “We need more facilities that are available all year round to cater for kids playing football.” There are currently 1,100 clubs in Ireland. There are 80,000 volunteers, 225,000 registered players and more than 100,000 unregistered players.",

(AP) — Carter Verhaeghe pulled his vehicle out of the players’ parking lot after leaving the Florida Panthers’ practice facility on Monday afternoon, only to notice about 50 fans standing on the side of the road clamoring for autographs. So, he stopped and signed for a while. Brandon Montour did the same. More players, like captain Aleksander Barkov, followed suit a few minutes later. The fans — some kids, some adults, some carrying signs, some wearing jerseys — were, as would be expected, thrilled. Down 2-1 in the Eastern Conference final to the New York Rangers, the Panthers — seeking a second consecutive trip to the Stanley Cup Final — still believe going into Game 4 on their home ice Tuesday night. Evidently, so do their fans. “You wake up, the sun is shining, everything’s good here,” Panthers forward Sam Bennett said. “It’s not too difficult.” If only beating the Rangers were so easy. New York grabbed home-ice back in the series with a 5-4 overtime win on Sunday, a game where the Panthers fired off more than 100 shot attempts — more than doubling what the Rangers tried during the contest. Florida created chance after chance after chance in the third period, especially late. And it didn’t matter; the Rangers’ Igor Shesterkin came up with big stops every time he needed to, Alex Wennberg got a deflection past the Panthers’ Sergei Bobrovsky to win the game, and the team with the best record in the regular season moved two wins away from claiming the East. “The third was probably our toughest go in the series so far,” Rangers coach Peter Laviolette said of the Florida onslaught in the third period of Game 3, when the Panthers erased a 4-2 deficit but never reclaimed the lead. Panthers coach Paul Maurice said he believes his team left work on Monday with a firm understanding of what needs to be adjusted for Game 4. “At no point will our game plan be, ‘Hey, let’s shoot fewer pucks for better opportunities,’” Maurice said. “What we’re trying to create is certainly goals, but we scored three in Game 1 and four in Game 3. It’s not goals. We have to defend. ... We have a pretty good idea of where we can be marginally better with the puck — I say marginally because we can make slight improvements with it — but we’re pretty good with the puck.” TROUBA FINED Rangers defenseman Jacob Trouba was fined $5,000 on Monday by the league for elbowing Florida forward Evan Rodrigues in the head and neck area on Sunday. The total was the maximum allowed under league rules. Trouba was assessed a minor penalty for elbowing. The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia. The Rangers won that game 5-4, just as they did Sunday. Perhaps a good omen for the Panthers: the Flyers won the next three games of that series and went to the Stanley Cup Final. THIRD-PERIOD CATS Florida led the NHL in third-period goal differential during the regular season, outscoring opponents 99-63 in the final 20 minutes of regulation. Form is holding in the playoffs. The Panthers outscored the Rangers 2-0 in the third of Game 3 and are now plus-13 in that period in the playoffs. Florida has 21 third-period goals in this playoff run, allowing only eight. The Rangers haven’t been great in the third, outscored 13-11 in that period in the playoffs. But New York has been perfect in overtimes in the postseason; the Game 3 win improved the Rangers’ OT record this spring to 4-0. ___ AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL Advertisement Advertisement",

The Panthers felt it was worthy of a 5-minute major. “Take the hat, pass it around,” Maurice said when told of the fine. 4 WASN’T ENOUGH Teams that score four goals on the Rangers in the playoffs win 91% of the time. The odds were bucked in Game 3. Sunday marked the 17th time — in 175 such games — that an opponent scored four or more goals against the Rangers and didn’t win. New York is now 16-158-1 in such games, and Sunday’s win snapped a 42-game playoff losing streak for the Rangers in that scenario going back to Game 2 of the 1997 East final against Philadelphia. The Rangers won that game 5-4, just as they did Sunday. Perhaps a good omen for the Panthers: the Flyers won the next three games of that series and went to the Stanley Cup Final. THIRD-PERIOD CATS Florida led the NHL in third-period goal differential during the regular season, outscoring opponents 99-63 in the final 20 minutes of regulation. Form is holding in the playoffs. The Panthers outscored the Rangers 2-0 in the third of Game 3 and are now plus-13 in that period in the playoffs. Florida has 21 third-period goals in this playoff run, allowing only eight. The Rangers haven’t been great in the third, outscored 13-11 in that period in the playoffs. But New York has been perfect in overtimes in the postseason; the Game 3 win improved the Rangers’ OT record this spring to 4-0. ___ AP Sports Writer Josh Dubow contributed to this report. ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

        "description": "The new bike and ski shop is located on Grand Avenue in Duluth, near the paved Willard Munger State Trail and nearby Spirit Mountain.",
        "content": "DULUTH — Ski Hut Adventure Center was bustling with activity throughout its grand opening weekend, which began with a ribbon-cutting event on Friday. The new ski and bike shop is located directly across from the Spirit Mountain Grand Avenue Chalet. Hours are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturdays through Mondays, and until 7 p.m. through Fridays. According to general manager Logan Nelson, the Adventure Center aims to provide patrons with an elevated experience of Duluth’s outdoor recreational opportunities within close proximity to the trails and slopes. “We have the Munger trail right behind us that goes down to Hinckley,” Nelson said. “Eventually, we’ll have a paved trail (not on the highway) connecting Hinckley to Grand Marais — right through our backyard.” Ski Hut has been owned and operated by the Neustel family since 1955. Three generations of the company began with Wes Neustel, followed by Scott Neustel and now, Dave Neustel has taken the reins. ADVERTISEMENT The flagship store, Ski Hut East at 1032 E. Fourth St., offers more room for backstop items, while the new Grand Avenue location is focused on bike rentals, bike service and retail until winter. Ski Hut’s Spirit Valley location closed in 2020 due to difficulty stocking enough inventory for both stores. It’s where Nelson got his start with the company in 2013. With the new Grand Avenue shop already under construction, the company decided to end its lease for the empty Spirit Valley location. “A lot of people are happy to have us back on this side of town,” Nelson said. The estimated 4,500-square-foot space occupied by the Adventure Center features an open layout with three service kiosks. The shop is operated by a team of eight. It offers various bike gear, clothing, shoes, sunglasses, accessories and equipment. Types of rentals offered at the shop include fat tire bikes, e-bikes, full suspension mountain bikes, electric mountain bikes, kids' bikes and hybrid bikes, as well as skis, snowshoes and snowboards in the winter. “Most of our rental fleets currently are Trek. We also have some Santa Cruz bikes,” Nelson said. “The best-renting bike has been the e-hybrids for the Munger Trail. That’s by far and away the most popular. That’s the largest portion of our fleet right now.” ADVERTISEMENT Pending the installation of nearby kayak launches, the Adventure Center may also get into renting out paddlesports equipment in the future. “If you don't own paddlesports equipment, you probably don't have the roof racks, the cradles, or the carriers that mount all these things to the roof,” Nelson said. “We're looking for that turnkey experience where we can haul it down to the water for you, get you acclimated, put you in a boat and just send you off for the fun part, not the loading and unloading,” he continued. On the opposite end of the building, Burnett Dairy Cheese Store is anticipated to open by late summer, Nelson said. Burnett Dairy Cooperative is based near Grantsburg, Wisconsin. Its cheese products are sold wholesale, online and at two Wisconsin locations. The new Duluth cheese store is roughly 6,000 square feet and will feature seating in a small cafe area. It will also include a liquor store. The two businesses will buy out their respective spaces while sharing an entry and restroom area. There are also several ideas to collaborate in the works, such as picnic baskets as an add-on option to bike rentals. “We’re obviously very excited to get Burnett’s in here,” Nelson said.

        "content": "AFP – German business sentiment stagnated in May after several months of improvement, a survey showed yesterday, denting hopes that Europe’s biggest economy is on course for a strong recovery. The Ifo institute’s closely-watched confidence barometer, based on a survey of around 9,000 companies, came in at 89.3 points. It was the same reading as in April, and lower than a forecast of 90.3 from analysts surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. Prior to May, the survey had risen for three consecutive months, fuelling hopes the economy would stage a strong rebound after shrinking last year as it faced myriad headwinds. Despite the unchanged reading, Ifo president Clemens Fuest struck an upbeat note. “Germany’s economy is working its way out of the crisis step by step,” he said in a statement. Companies were less satisfied with their current business situation but expectations improved, the survey showed. It pointed to improvements in the manufacturing, trade and construction sectors but the picture in the service sector worsened. ING economist Carsten Brzeski said the latest reading represented a “cold shower to optimists”. “It suggests that the bottoming out of the German economy is not yet being followed by a strong recovery,” he said. But Chief Economist at public lender KfW Fritzi Koehler-Geib said there was still a “little more confidence” in German companies than just a few months earlier. “Although the business climate stagnated in May, it remains at a significantly higher level than at the beginning of the year. All in all, the economic trough should be largely over.” The German economy was hit hard after Ukraine’s invasion in 2022 sent energy costs soaring, with the crisis compounded by a manufacturing slowdown and weakness in key trading partners. Recovery hopes had been driven in recent months by a string of improving indicators. The German government also nudged up its 2024 growth forecast last month to 0.3 per cent, from 0.2 per cent previously.",

Nadal, yang akan berusia 38 tahun pada 3 Juni, kalah 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), dan 6-3 dari Zverev, yang berperingkat empat dunia. Kekalahan tersebut adalah yang keempat dalam 116 pertandingan yang ia jalani di Roland Garros sejak meraih gelar dalam debutnya pada 2005. Ini adalah pertama kalinya Nadal dikalahkan di Paris di putaran pertama dan akan kembali menimbulkan pertanyaan mengenai masa depannya dalam . -- \"Saya tidak tahu apakah ini terakhir kalinya saya berada di sini, saya tidak yakin 100%, tetapi jika ini yang terakhir maka saya menikmatinya,\" kata Nadal. \"Saat ini perasaan saya sulit digambarkan dengan kata-kata,\" lanjutnya. Terhalang oleh cedera, yang membuatnya hanya tampil empat kali sejak Januari tahun lalu, mantan peringkat satu dunia itu kini berada di peringkat 275 dan menjadi non-unggulan di Paris. Namun, menjelang turnamen Grand Slam itu, Nadal bersikeras untuk menjaga kemungkinan 100% tentang masa depannya dalam olahraga yang telah memberinya 22 gelar Grand Slam itu. Dalam ulangan semifinal 2022, yang dimenangi Nadal ketika Zverev mundur karena cedera ligamen pergelangan kaki, petenis Spanyol itu punya peluang. Ia mematahkan servis pada set kedua dan ketiga, namun pada kedua kesempatan tersebut ia ditepis oleh lawannya yang berusia 27 tahun. Teriakan 'Rafa, Rafa' bergema keras di bawah atap Lapangan Philippe Chatrier yang ditutup rapat karena hujan deras yang menyapu lapangan. Keramaian mereda ketika servis Nadal dipatahkan pada gim pembuka, dan dia menyesali ketidakmampuannya mengonversi dua break point pada gim keempat. Nadal menyelamatkan dua set point pada gim kesembilan namun menyerah pada set pembuka pada menit ke-50 ketika ia melepaskan pukulan forehand yang mengenai net. Nadal melakukan break untuk pertama kalinya dalam pertandingan tersebut untuk memimpin 3-2 pada set kedua tetapi tidak dapat mempertahankan keunggulan, dan menyerahkan break tersebut kembali kepada semifinalis tiga kali Zverev. Sebuah tie-break yang menegangkan mampu ditaklukkan petenis Jerman itu untuk akhirnya mengklaim set kedua. Nadal berusaha keras dengan mematahkan servis dan bertahan untuk kedudukan 2-0 pada set ketiga. Namun, Zverev kembali bangkit untuk menyamakan kedudukan menjadi 2-2 sebelum Nadal yang terus mendapatkan tekanan harus menyelamatkan empat break point pada gim kelima yang berlangsung selama 13 menit agar tetap dapat bersaing. Zverev, yang tenang, segera unggul 4-3, dan pertandingan usai ketika Nadal melepaskan pukulan forehand yang panjang dan melebar. (Ant/Z-1)",

Ministers meet Monday for the eighth Brussels Conference on “Supporting the future of Syria and the region”. (AP Photo/Geert Vanden Wijngaert) BEIRUT (AP) — International donors meeting in Brussels said Monday they will commit 7.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion) in both grants and loans to support Syrians battered by war, poverty, and hunger for the rest of this year and beyond. The pledges surpassed the modest $4.07 billion that the United Nations had appealed for, but was also a significant drop from amounts pledged last year and previously — an indication of persisting donor fatigue as the world’s attention is focused on conflicts elsewhere, including the wars in Ukraine and Sudan, and most recently Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza. At last year’s conference, donors pledged $10.3 billion , just months after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and much of northern Syria , killing over 59,000 people, including 6,000 in Syria. This year’s amount is meant both for Syrians inside the war-torn country and for some 5.7 million Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which struggle with economic crises of their own and have been frustrated by the ever-shrinking aid. This year’s pledged total includes 5 billion euros in grants — about 3.8 billion euros for 2024 and 1.2 billion euros for the next year and beyond — and 2.5 billion euros in loans. U.N. agencies and international aid organizations in recent years have struggled with shrinking budgets , and humanitarian officials have decried the budget cuts that have forced the downsizing of aid programs despite skyrocketing poverty. Syria’s civil war, which erupted in 2011, has killed nearly half a million people and displaced half the country’s pre-war population of of 23 million. For several years now, the conflict has remained largely frozen, along with efforts to find a viable political solution to end it. Meanwhile, millions of Syrians have been pulled into poverty, and struggle with accessing food and health care as the economy deteriorates. The conference brought back the urgency of trying to revitalize a gridlocked U.N.-led roadmap to end the conflict even as the mood in host countries turns increasingly hostile towards Syrian refugees. Officials in tiny Lebanon, which hosts almost 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands of others who are undocumented, have been demanding that refugees return to alleged “safe zones” in Syria, even before a political solution is in place to end the war. Aid organizations and most Western countries believe such places don’t exist and that conditions in Syria are not yet conducive to safe returns. In Brussels, eight EU member states who have called for the reassessment of conditions in Syria to allow refugee returns, reiterated those calls at the conference. Cyprus, which says it has been struggling to cope with surging Syrian migration, was among them, and Hungary echoed similar sentiments. Aid groups have insisted that more sustainable solutions, notably through boosting early recovery efforts to fix infrastructure and help create jobs in Syria is a crucial condition for people to go back. “The more that people that will be lacking essential services, safety, and basic commodities, the more difficult it will be to pave the way towards stability, reconciliation and returns,” Stephan Sakalian, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, told The Associated Press. “If we want to be able to ensure sustainable refugee returns, we have give to the people the possibility to come back voluntarily, safely, and in a sustainable environment,” he added. “Otherwise we risk seeing the reverse trend of people wanting to continue leaving Syria.”",

        "description": "Less than one in three schools around the world provide bins for menstrual waste in girls’ bathrooms, a new report from the UN has revealed.The post Less than a third of schools worldwide have sanitary bins in girls’ toilets, new report shows appeared first on Women's Agenda.",
        "content": "Less than one in three schools around the world provide bins for menstrual waste in girls’ bathrooms, a new report from the UN has revealed. Today is Menstrual Hygiene Day, and to underscore the importance of menstrual health and hygiene, the United Nations Children’s Fund ( ) and the World Health Organisation ( ) released their report, . The report highlights some major gaps that exist in menstrual health, especially for school-aged girls in developing countries; there is significantly limited education, information, products, services and facilities that exacerbate the menstrual health gaps. Globally, just two out of five schools (39 per cent) provide education on menstrual health, while less than a third (31 per cent) have menstrual waste bins in bathrooms. In less developed countries, this goes down to just one in five schools providing menstrual waste bins; meanwhile, that figure sits at one in 10 in sub-Saharan Africa. Millions of adolescent girls cannot access adequate water and soap, with girls who attend private and girls-only schools, as well as those living in urban areas, more likely to have access to a private space with water and soap to change menstrual products at school. Studies have also identified the prevalence of widespread stigmas associated with menstruation, with many young people feeling ashamed about it. This shame can impact their attendance at school, and their mental health. Workalem, a 16-year-old student in Ethiopia, said her education was significantly affected not only because of the difficulty in accessing water and a functioning bathroom, but also because of the shame around menstruation she felt. “I used to stay home for up to 7 days and miss classes and exams because of menstruation and the culture of not mentioning menstruation in public,” Workalem said. “The lack of access to menstrual products and school bathrooms with no water were the reasons I missed school.” Education is one of the best ways to improve menstrual health and hygiene, and teachers in schools are the key to this. It is unclear how many teachers are properly trained to educate young people about menstrual hygiene, as there are no national datasets on this. UNICEF and WHO say this highlights a major gap in educational support for menstruation. When Workalem joined her school’s gender club, she developed a much better understanding and awareness of menstruation. Sixteen-year-old Bilen shares a similar confidence about menstruation, thanks to the education she received from her mother, her teacher and herself, reading about it independently. Her school in the Gambella region also provides its students with period products. “I think (menstrual health) is very important for women,” Bilen said. “My friends also use pads, and we see it as a natural thing. I’m not afraid of it, especially knowing I can get pads in school.” UNICEF and WHO’s report also highlights broader gaps in children accessing water, sanitation and hygiene across the globe. There are 447 million children – one in five children globally – who still do not have basic drinking water services at school. About one in five children (427 million) also lack basic sanitation services, while one in three children (646 million) lack basic hygiene services.",

        "content": "Market concentration, higher prices and a mounting tally of customer complaints are fuelling a Competition Bureau study into Canada’s airline industry. In a release Monday, the regulator said two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. Domestic fares also appear “relatively high” and more and more passengers are filing complaints, it said. The backlog of customer complaints about airlines has hit a record high topping 72,000, according to the Canadian Transportation Agency. The bureau’s review, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, looks to pave the way for recommendations to government that would “make it easier for new businesses to compete and easier for consumers to make informed choices.” First announced on May 9, the market study is the bureau’s first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies. Matthew Boswell, the competition commissioner, stressed the importance of the airline industry to residents and the economy. “Since the Canadian population is spread out over vast distances, other modes of transportation may not be feasible replacements for air travel. More competition in the industry will mean lower prices, better services, and improved productivity,” Boswell said in the release. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines. The latter two made up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau. Meanwhile, Air Canada and WestJet have strengthened their grip on the domestic market over the past year, even as rival Porter Airlines rapidly expands in a bid to become the country’s third major airline. Canada’s two largest carriers commanded 82 per cent of domestic traffic among national carriers last month versus 74 per cent in April 2023, statistics from aviation data firm Cirium show. The diminishing set of operators coincides with a six per cent decrease in domestic flight volume between April 2023 and this month, though that may be due in part to a renewed focus on international trips. While big cities remain amply served, smaller ones have fewer options, which can also result in higher prices and, when things go awry, stranded passengers. Over the past five years, the Competition Bureau has raised concerns about the merger of Canadian North and First Air and the would-be acquisition of Transat by Air Canada, which scrapped the plan in 2021 amid regulatory hurdles in Europe. The latest study is not an investigation into specific allegations of wrongdoing, the Competition Bureau noted Monday. “However, if the bureau finds evidence that someone may be doing something against the law, we will investigate and take appropriate action,” the regulator said. John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University, said the review should consider service levels to various parts of the country as well as rules around flight changes by airlines after the ticket was purchased. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

The Irish scored the first five goals of the second quarter to go up 10-3 before Maryland scored an extra-man goal to make it 10-4 at the half. Chris Kavanagh, who was named the most outstanding player, scored three straight in the second quarter for a hat trick in a span of six minutes. Notre Dame had six goals from midfielders in the first half — to help reach double-digit scoring in every game this season. The Irish continued their dominance in the second half, scoring the first four goals to push it to 14-4 when Fisher Finley became the 10th different Notre Dame goal scorer.

        "description": "Singer, who was friends with the late actor, has previously claimed Fisher’s daughter Billie Lourd partly blames him for her mother’s death",
        "content": "James Blunt has claimed that Carrie Fisher was “mistreating her body” before her death in 2016, due to Star Wars bosses putting “pressure on her to be thin”. The “You’re Beautiful” singer , 50, was discussing his memoir Loosely Based on a Made-Up Story at Hay Festival , when he reminisced about his late friend Fisher, who died suddenly aged 60 in 2016. Blunt and Fisher met through mutual friends in the Noughties and struck up an unlikely bond. He ended up moving into her Los Angeles home – where she and her mother, the actor and singer Debbie Reynolds, also lived – and he recorded his first album, 2004’s Back to Bedlam , while staying there. Blunt has previously revealed he was with the Princess Leia actor the night before she was found unresponsive on a flight from London to Los Angeles. She died days later, and a toxicology report found she had cocaine, heroin, MDMA and methadone in her system. “I was with her the day before she died, when she came down to my house,” he told audiences at Hay. “And she’d been really mistreating her body, and she’d just got the job again of being Princess Leia in a new Star Wars movie. “So she was really on a high and a positive, but they had applied a lot of pressure on her to be thin. She spoke about the difficulties that women have in the industry, how men are allowed to grow old, and women are certainly not in film and TV.\" He added: “And she really put a lot of pressure on herself, started using drugs again and by the time she got on the plane, she had effectively killed herself. “They say it was heart failure of some kind, but she had taken enough drugs to have a really good party.” The Independent has contacted Rian Johnson, who directed the 2017 film Star Wars: The Last Jedi , for comment. Lucasfilm has also been contacted. Fisher had completed filming her role as Leia in the The Last Jedi shortly before her death. In Blunt’s memoir, he previously wrote about how Fisher’s daughter, Billie Lourd , “blames” him, in part, for her mother’s death. “Charlie, her best friend, confronted her more directly and told her she needed to quit drugs,” he wrote. “I took a different approach and did them with her, pretending to myself that I would guide her to redemption one day – just not today. As a result, her daughter Billie blames me in part for her death, and no longer speaks to me.” During the talk, Blunt also discussed his treatment by the tabloid press, his phone being hacked, his experience of being a British soldier in Kosovo, and the backlash to his 2004 song “You’re Beautiful”. Fisher was the daughter of a Hollywood power couple, movie star Reynolds and entertainer Eddie Fisher, but achieved her own fame portraying Princess Leia in the cinematic space saga from 1977. Apart from the Star Wars movies, she also appeared in When Harry Met Sally, Drop Dead Fred, and the TV comedy Catastrophe , to name just a few of her screen credits. When Fisher died, Star Wars director Lucas said that he and the actor had been “friends most of our adult lives”. “She was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colourful personality that everyone loved,” he said in a statement. “In Star Wars she was our great and powerful princess – feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think.” Hay Festival runs from 23 May to 2 June in Hay-on-Wye; hayfestival.com If you or someone you know is suffering from drug addiction, you can seek confidential help and support 24-7 from Frank, by calling 0300 123 6600, texting 82111, sending an email or visiting their website here .

The country’s tra fish export has roared back to growth after a significant drop recorded earlier this year as countries have scaled up their imports, the agency cited insiders. The United States remained the largest buyer, followed by China, Europe and several South American markets, according to the Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers. It is forecast that Vietnam’s tra fish export will expand 10 per cent in Q3 with fuel and logistics costs as well as interest rates cooling down.",

        "description": "Bill Walton, the legendary basketball player and sportscaster, has died after a prolonged battle with cancer.",
        "content": "Bill Walton, the dominant college big man who won two NBA championships and later enjoyed a successful career as a colorful sports broadcaster, has died , the NBA announced on Monday . He was 71. Walton died after a prolonged battle with cancer , the league said. He was surrounded by his family. \"Bill Walton was truly one of a kind,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. \"As a Hall of Fame player, he redefined the center position. His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" Walton was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 draft by the Portland Trail Blazers, and he led the team to its only NBA title in 1977. Named the league MVP in 1978, the 6-foot-11 Walton won another title as a member of the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he earned the Sixth Man of the Year award. That season proved to be his last hurrah. Walton, who battled injuries throughout his career, would play just 22 more games between the regular season and playoffs before retiring in 1988, according to CBS Sports . Before his pro career, Walton earned a legendary status at UCLA, leading the Bruins to titles in 1972 and 1973 and an 88-game winning streak. His 44 points in the national championship game in 1973 remain a record. Walton was also a three-time national player of the year at UCLA while playing for iconic coach John Wooden. \"On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men's basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton's passing,\" UCLA head coach Mick Cronin said in a statement , adding: \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it's his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality.\" After his playing career, Walton overcame a pronounced stutter to become a successful sportscaster known for his colorful language, which often included catchphrases and hyperbole. \"In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can't talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,\" Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. \"Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It's become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else's biggest nightmare.\" A self-professed \"Deadhead,\" Walton sometimes appeared on TV wearing Grateful Dead T-shirts. He was also known to wear tie-dyed T-shirts while delivering his tangent-filled commentary, which could be equal parts entertaining and bewildering. Dave Pasch, who handled play-by-play duties alongside Walton for ESPN and ABC and was often the butt of Walton's jokes, said Monday that the two of them had a \"special friendship.\" \"He used to tell me a lot, he'd take the headset off during a commercial break and just say to me, 'I love you, but don't tell anybody,'\" Pasch said on ESPN. \"Because he just enjoyed the fact that I was a sparring partner and that he could have fun with me and just take shots at me. I knew that it was all part of the game and that, off the air, we had a great friendship.\" Walton was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993. \"What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,\" Silver said. \"He was a regular presence at league events - always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.\" He is survived by his wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke, a former NBA player and now an assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers. -- Originally published by CBS News, written by Stephen Smith .

Hundreds of students and community members gathered in a snap lockdown at the camp to protest the university's removal order. Protesters at the camp at ANU on May 27.

        "content": "The plantation industry yesterday raised vehement objections to the Government’s unilateral decision to increase minimum wages for tea and rubber sector workers by an unprecedented 70%. Holding a collective media briefing, the Planters’ Association of Ceylon (PA), Colombo Rubber Traders Association (CRTA), Ceylon Tea Traders Association (CTTA) and tea exporters voiced their concerns about the potential devastating impact on the sector. They warned that without linking wages to productivity, the industry will face further market losses and declining production quality, ultimately harming the very workers the wage increase aims to benefit. They also urged the policymakers to prioritise long-term economic stability over short-sighted decisions and to consider the industry’s proposals for a productivity-linked wage model. Planters’ Association of Ceylon said the Government’s decision threatens to cripple every segment of the tea and rubber industry, putting at risk the livelihoods of over 3 million peopledependenton the sectors. Pix by Lasantha Kumara Plantation... PA Chairman SenakaAlawattegama revealed that the association had proposed two alternatives as a solution, offering an allowance of Rs. 5,000 for 25 days of work, similar to what is offered to public sector workers by the Government and implementing a productivity-linked wage structure. According to him, minimum daily wage increase they have proposed is Rs. 1,380 with a 50% increase for an over kilo wage hike. “However, three rounds of discussions with President Ranil Wickremesinghe along with Labour Minister ManushaNanayakkara ended in failure,” he said. “Despite insisting on the significant challenges due to rising cost of production and to be competitive in the global market, the discussions with the Government failed,”Alawattegama added. Planters’ Association Media Spokesman Dr.RoshanRajadurai stressed on the financial strain the wage hike would impose on the industry. “The cost of production for tea and rubber is set to rise sharply, with estimates indicating a minimum 45% increase in the cost per kilogram of tea. This will render Sri Lanka’s tea and rubber industries uncompetitive in the global market,” he said. He noted that the wage hike will also place an enormous burden on RPCs, which will face an annual increase in excess of Rs. 35 billion, inclusive of EPF/ETF and gratuity payments. Dr.Rajadurai reiterated that they will take steps to look after their interests if they are forced, implying plans to take legal action against the Government decision. “The Government cannot hold us accountable when it is forced on us. We have to safeguard our legal rights. We will seek legal advice and take necessary action in the time to come,” he affirmed. He also said that even prior to the recent wage hike, the tea and rubber sector workers were already paid the single highest minimum wage across all 48 regulated by the Wages Board, including; tea smallholders, garments, tea export trade, manufacturing industry, nursing, pre-school teachers and security services. “With the latest minimum wage hike being compelled from the industry, tea and rubber wages will now be 2.4 to four times greater than any of the other sectors regulated by the Wages Board,” he pointed out. Dr.Rajaduraialso noted that RPCs are listed companies on the Colombo Stock Exchange and any attempt at expropriation by the Government would contravene Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules, the Companies Act and other related statutory provisions. For over a decade, the Planters’ Association has advocated for a productivity-linked wage model or a revenue share model, which aligns worker compensation with productivity and revenue earned at auction. This approach incentivises productivity while ensuring a fair and sustainable wage system. “Under the previous wage structure, workers on a revenue share model earned more than the newly gazetted minimum wage. Already around 30-40% crop comes in based on the revenue-share model,” he added. The proposed wage increase threatens to push the cost of production in the RPC sector to a minimum of Rs. 1,400 per kilogram, while the current average sale price is below Rs. 1,200 per kilogram. This imbalance jeopardises the financial viability of the industry, which is already struggling to break even. “Despite our best efforts to advocate for a more sustainable wage system, we are forced to operate under economically impractical conditions,” he lamented. “This not only threatens the survival of the industry but also the livelihoods of millions who depend on it,” he said, adding the current daily attendance-based minimum wage model is outdated and does not reflect the realities of the modern plantation industry. He warned that any disruption to production or quality standards could harm export markets, diminishing export revenues and competitiveness. Highlighting the high costs of fertiliser, energy and other inputs, which have further strained the industry, Dr.Rajadurei explained productivity per worker is significantly lower than in countries like India and Kenya where they pluck 34 kilos and 60 kilos per day making it difficult to compete. Citing previous similar ad-hoc decisions taken by successive Governments on matters such as the glyphosate ban and the fertiliser ban, he said they have already had detrimental effects on the industry, leading to substantial production as well as market losses. “We warned the Government about the negative impacts, but our concerns were not heeded,”Dr.Rajadurai recalled. He pointed out that these arbitrary decisions resulted in a sharp decline in tea production from 340 million kilos to 250 million kilos last year. Given the current statistics, it seems the crop will decline further this year. “We are being punished for doing well for the industry, economy and people,” he said. The industry stakeholders insisted on the importance of sustainable economic policies to ensure the plantation industry’s survival and the country’s overall economic stability. The PA also noted that the current approach of the Government in attempting to coercively set wages for the private sector, and interfere in management of the sector from key Government figures represent a stark violation of the terms of the IMF agreement, which is crucial for Sri Lanka's economic recovery. This decision is very clearly driven by short-term populist politics aimed at securing electoral victories rather than fostering long-term economic health of the industry, and securing the interests of workers. The IMF's $3 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Sri Lanka is contingent on several stringent conditions aimed at ensuring fiscal consolidation including reduced intervention in state-owned enterprises (SOE). Historically, state control over enterprises has led to inefficiencies and financial burdens, as evidenced by the failures of numerous state-run businesses in Sri Lanka. Historically, the Government has consistently failed to manage State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) effectively, leading to steep losses and in many instances, near total collapse. By the time of privatisation in 1992, State-owned plantations made continuous losses that had to be heavily subsidised by the Government up to Rs. 5 billion per year which was borne by the Treasury. A further Rs. 8 billion was owed by the JEDB and SLSPC to the Bank of Ceylon and Peoples’ Bank as a result of a $ 300 million lending facility which was extended to the state plantations by the World Bank. While these funds were intended for the improvement of the plantations industry, there were no significant improvements and the plantations did not have the ability to repay the debts, and the Government was eventually compelled to absorb this debt.",

        "content": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will visit Belgium on Tuesday and sign a security pact with Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, the Belgian government said. The Ukrainian leader is seeking more military aid from his Western allies as his troops struggle to hold back Russia's invasion forces. On Monday, he visited Spain, which pledged military support worth 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) this year under a security pact between Zelenskiy and the government of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Ukraine has signed a series of such agreements with its Western partners, pledging long-term security assistance in the form of arms supplies and training for Kyiv's forces. Zelenskiy and De Croo will also hold a press conference in Brussels, the Belgian government said in a written statement on Monday announcing the Ukrainian president's visit.

        "content": "A string of powerline thefts and tampering has police appealing for information, and warning that thieves are putting themselves and others at “extreme risk of electrocution”. Over the past 10 days reports of power line thefts have been increasing across Christchurch, including at Disraeli St in Addingto n, Hillview Rd area, Phillips Rd in Phillipstown and Brougham St. There have also been reports as far as West Melton, Halswell, and Marshlands. On multiple occasions, residents have been left without power due to the theft of copper from the lines, police said. Police have informed community control and frontline units on what to look out for. Businesses and locals in the affected neighbourhoods have also been alerted. The offenders leave the power lines dangerous and exposed once they get what they want, police said. On one occasion a set was left broken outside Phillip St preschool. “Our message to offenders is to stop this behaviour before someone, including yourself, gets hurt,” said Senior Sergeant Roy Appley. “You are putting yourselves and others at extreme risk of electrocution, for such a small return.” Police are appealing to the public for any information that could assist in identifying those involved. They are urging residents to ring 111 immediately if anyone is seen acting suspiciously around power poles or lines. “If you hear anything out of the ordinary overnight, do not think nothing of it,” Appley said. “We need Christchurch residents to be aware of the risk of exposed or damaged wires – do not touch them and call Orion on 0800 363 9898 straight away.” Share this article",

        "description": "The Red Sox were thoroughly outplayed in Monday's Memorial Day matinee.",
        "content": "BALTIMORE, Md. — Monday afternoon the Boston Red Sox looked like a team that had enjoyed its long Memorial Day weekend and wasn’t quite dialed in. There was a routine double play ball that wasn’t turned because the middle infielders were lined up too deep. There was a shallow fly ball that wasn’t thrown in quickly or accurately, allowing a runner to score from third on a sacrifice fly. Then there was the bases-loaded, one-out opportunity that the Red Sox let slip away. These weren’t catastrophic errors, but all proved costly, especially against a Baltimore Orioles team that pounced on every inch the Red Sox gave away. The Red Sox dropped Monday’s series opener in Baltimore 11-3, with the Orioles seizing control with a five-run fourth inning in which they loaded the bases with no outs and cashed in with back-to-back extra-base hits to deep left field. Kyle Stowers ripped a two-run double before Cedric Mullins broke things open with a two-run triple, and the Orioles kept piling on from there. “They drove the ball all over the place,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. “That’s what they do, it’s like a fast break offense, they get into swing mode and they hit the ball hard and it was a tough one today.” With the loss, the Red Sox fell to 0-4 against their division rival on the season. Baltimore took an early lead in the second inning after Jordan Westburg drove in Colton Cowser with an RBI double. Cowser had just grounded into what should have been a routine double play, but Romy Gonzalez and Vaughn Grissom couldn’t turn the play, putting Cowser at first and in position to score when Westburg lined one into the left-center gap. Then in the third Adley Rutschman hit a fly ball to center that probably shouldn’t have been deep enough to score the runner from third but Ceddanne Rafaela seemed caught off guard and wasn’t able to get the ball in fast enough, allowing Jorge Mateo to score on the sacrifice fly to make it 2-0. The Red Sox had a golden opportunity in the fourth, loading the bases with one out, but Dominic Smith and Rafaela struck out to end the threat. Both strikeouts were tough breaks for Boston, with Smith getting rung up on a called strike three that appeared to be out of the zone for ball four while Rafaela argued he made contact on his swinging third strike, which ended up in the dirt and could have been ruled a foul ball. Compared to how the Orioles handled a similar situation moments later, the contrast was striking. Immediately after the Red Sox squandered their opportunity, Baltimore loaded the bases after Ryan Mountcastle doubled, Cowser reached on an error by Grissom and Westburg walked. That quickly led to Stowers’ and Mullins’ big hits, and Mateo added a sacrifice fly to make it 7-0. Red Sox starter Cooper Criswell, who came into the game with a 2.86 ERA, ultimately endured his worst start of the season with seven runs (six earned) allowed over four innings. He gave up six hits and one walk while recording just two strikeouts. Right-hander Brad Keller, who signed with the Red Sox over the weekend after being designated for assignment last week by the Chicago White Sox, made his team debut and allowed four runs over four innings. All four runs came in the seventh inning thanks to an RBI double by Rutschman, an RBI single by Mountcastle, and a two-run single by Stowers. Stowers finished 3 for 4 with four RBI and a run, and Mountcastle was 3 for 5 with an RBI and two runs scored. Boston’s bats eventually got going in the eighth, but it was too late. The Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs after Orioles reliever Thyago Vieira walked three straight batters before Gonzalez cleared the bases with a three-run triple. Viera then walked a fourth batter before the Orioles went to left-hander Cionel Perez to get things back under control. He recorded three quick outs and the Red Sox never threatened again. The Red Sox (27-27) will look to bounce back Tuesday night, with Brayan Bello (5-2, 4.04) set to face off against Grayson Rodriguez (5-1, 3.20). First pitch is scheduled for 6:35 p.m.",

Mike Morgan was feeding his cattle from a trailer when he was struck. He died on the scene after emergency responders tried to resuscitate him, the Jackson County Sheriff's Office said. Morgan's wife, Niki, was approximately 200 feet away from Morgan when the lightning bolt struck and it was strong enough to knock her off her horse, according to a Facebook post from His Cavvy Foundation , a nonprofit helping ranchers with serious medical issues. Morgan's father-in-law was also reportedly near the blast but survived. The strike bowled over around 100 head of cattle that had crowded around the trailer that Morgan was feeding them out of, county coroner George Crocket said. Mike Morgan was killed in a freak lightning strike over the weekend, Jackson County officials revealed Monday Morgan, 51, was a rancher in the town of Walden, Colorado, a tight-knit community outside of Denver Morgan's family was recently able to afford 300 cattle of their own, and it was their dream to own their own animals 'All but the 34 got up,' Crocket added. The lightning bolt struck a pasture outside the town of Rand, which is about 80 miles northwest of Denver, NBC reported. Morgan is survived by his wife Niki and his 17-year-old daughter, Dallas, both of whom are involved in the ranching occupation as well. The His Cavvy Foundation described Morgan and his family as 'an upstanding pillar' in the town of Walden, Colorado. The foundation's post explained that Morgan had always been working on a local ranch, which recently afforded the family the opportunity to purchase 300 pairs. Pairs refer to a cow and her calf. 'Mike’s wife, Niki, has spent all winter calving these pairs out while Mike held down a job at Silver Spur Ranches,' the post said. 'They do what we all do, whatever it takes to make a living, and they do it by doing what we are all passionate about. Ranching...' The His Cavvy Foundation wrote that Morgan's family has donated time, resources and finances to its various causes throughout the years. 'Mike was a loving father and a tender, intentional husband,' the post said. 'We will all miss that big ole smile he always carried.'

        "content": "A rare rule was called during an SEC Tournament semifinal game between LSU and South Carolina on Saturday. LSU won the game 12-11 to reach the tournament final against Tennessee at Hoover Metropolitan Complex in Hoover, Alabama. But the Tigers fell behind in the 10th on an odd ruling. South Carolina had runners on the corners with two outs in the top of the 10th inning with the game tied at 10. The Gamecocks attempted a steal, so LSU catcher Alex Milazzo moved forward in front of the plate to receive the pitch from Griffin Herring. Milazzo tagged out Blake Jackson for what looked like an inning-ending out. Strange rule came into play during the LSU vs. South Carolina SEC Tournament game Umpires determined that the catcher stepped on or in front of home plate before receiving the ball. It was ruled a balk and a catcher's interference. So the run scored and the batter was awarded... pic.twitter.com/Rbw5oFnLvX — Jomboy Media (@JomboyMedia) May 26, 2024 The umpires initially called it an out but then reversed their call upon a review. They called Milazzo for interference since catchers are supposed to allow the runner a path to home on a squeeze play or attempted steal of home. Batter Parker Noland was granted first base. The next batter grounded out to end the inning, but not before South Carolina had taken the lead and LSU coach Jay Johnson had gotten ejected. LSU still wound up winning the game on a walk-off 2-run home run by Steven Milam. But things did get tricky in that half-inning. LSU lost in the final 4-3 to top-seed Tennessee.

        "content": "In XDefiant, it’s not just the primary weapons that you need to pay attention to, but also the secondary options like the D50 that can provide solid damage output when you have to switch. Usually, you won’t be using your sidearm unless you run out of ammo in the middle of a fight, yet this pistol can take out enemies in a matter of seconds thanks to its low recoil and power. However, it needs to be kitted out properly, which is why we have compiled the best loadouts for the D50 in XDefiant. Recommended Faction There are to choose from in XDefiant, though only one can bring out the best of the D50 and that is Echelon. These Splinter Cell-inspired characters are all about stealth and even come with an . This is crucial for getting close to a target and pulling off a headshot. Headshots with the D50 are a one-shot kill, so the ability to close in and line up is a huge help. Best loadout for damage You will want to use the following attachments to maximize the damage for the D50: This includes using the to increase the effective range of the gun to make it even more viable. In addition, you can rely on the to help aim from afar. You will use the for better recoil, so you won’t lose control of the D50. Finally, the will give you a few more shots in each clip, which is one of the weapon’s initial shortcomings. Now, you have more wiggle room if you miss a couple of shots. Best loadout for recoil If you are looking to have more of a focus on recoil rather than damage, you can use the following attachments: The first attachment on this list is the , which will give you greater recoil control at the cost of some drop in effective range. Next up, the will ensure you move around faster and can quickly aim down the sights. Reducing recoil will help with speed in a fight and this mag will add to that. Related: The is included to provide better recoil recovery and control, with the rounding it out and offering an easy-to-use optic for better aiming. How to unlock the D50 To unlock the D50, you must in the game. This can be done with any secondary weapon that is available to you.

        "content": "Market concentration, higher prices and a mounting tally of customer complaints are fuelling a Competition Bureau study into Canada's airline industry. In a release Monday, the regulator said two carriers continue to dominate the skies while new airlines seem to struggle to enter the market. Domestic fares also appear \"relatively high\" and more and more passengers are filing complaints, it said. The backlog of customer complaints about airlines has hit a record high topping 72,000, according to the Canadian Transportation Agency. The bureau's review, which will draw on feedback from the public and interested parties, looks to pave the way for recommendations to government that would \"make it easier for new businesses to compete and easier for consumers to make informed choices.\" First announced on May 9, the market study is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December that include the ability to compel information from companies. Matthew Boswell, the competition commissioner, stressed the importance of the airline industry to residents and the economy. \"Since the Canadian population is spread out over vast distances, other modes of transportation may not be feasible replacements for air travel. More competition in the industry will mean lower prices, better services, and improved productivity,\" Boswell said in the release. Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines. The latter two made up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau. Meanwhile, Air Canada and WestJet have strengthened their grip on the domestic market over the past year, even as rival Porter Airlines rapidly expands in a bid to become the country's third major airline. Canada's two largest carriers commanded 82 per cent of domestic traffic among national carriers last month versus 74 per cent in April 2023, statistics from aviation data firm Cirium show. The diminishing set of operators coincides with a six per cent decrease in domestic flight volume between April 2023 and this month, though that may be due in part to a renewed focus on international trips. While big cities remain amply served, smaller ones have fewer options, which can also result in higher prices and, when things go awry, stranded passengers. Over the past five years, the Competition Bureau has raised concerns about the merger of Canadian North and First Air and the would-be acquisition of Transat by Air Canada, which scrapped the plan in 2021 amid regulatory hurdles in Europe. The latest study is not an investigation into specific allegations of wrongdoing, the Competition Bureau noted Monday. \"However, if the bureau finds evidence that someone may be doing something against the law, we will investigate and take appropriate action,\" the regulator said. John Gradek, who teaches aviation management at McGill University, said the review should consider service levels to various parts of the country as well as rules around flight changes by airlines after the ticket was purchased.

Bikoon, a rather bizarre act that sees a moving bag complete tricks, left fans rather bored, especially when some of the tricks appeared to go wrong. A number of viewers took to X, previously known as Twitter, to share their thoughts. One wrote: \"How much longer has this show got left? They've resorted us to watching a bag attempting to jump through a hoop five times #bgt #BritainsGotTalent.\" \"WTAF have I just watched. Is this meant to be talent. A man and a bag. Was it meant to be funny? It was as appealing as cold custard. Appalling. #BGT #BritainsGotTalent #Bikoon,\" added another. While a third penned: \"Nah why hasnt the judges pressed the buzzers?! Bikoon is awful. Its just a guy in the bag. I could do it. #britainsgottalent #bgt.\" The first live semi-final also saw host return to work two weeks ago. The TV personality, , beamed from ear to ear as he returned to his Britain’s Got Talent presenting duties alongside close pal and co-host Declan Donnelly. Fans at home welcomed 48 year old Ant’s return to work with open arms and many took to X to praise the TV presenter’s appearance on the ITV show. One wrote: \"Simon congratulating Ant becoming a dad and the birth of his baby boy and he’s happy for him #BGT #Britainsgottalent.\" \"Ant's first time on live TV since the birth of his child and he's happier than ever #BGT,\" added another. While a third penned: \"Simon saying congrats to ant and him having the biggest smile my heart #bgt.\" The semi-finals have kicked off following reports that next year's edition of the talent show could take a somewhat different format to this series, with - rumoured to be worth around £100 million. They are also reportedly planning to make the series longer. In recent years, the show has run for around six to seven weeks from mid-April to the beginning of June, but the new plan is for BGT to start in February and be on air for three months. This would fill the gap left by the , and the cash injection would be used to make the show bigger and possibly even better than their competitor .",

        "content": "Nigeria’s representative at the ongoing 2024 Basketball Africa League (BAL), Rivers Hoopers BC, achieved the historic feat of reaching their first ever semi-final at the tournament after earning a tough 92-88 victory over former BAL Champions US Monastir of Tunisia in the quarter-final. Rivers Hoopers went into the quarterfinal encounter on the back of consecutive defeats; against US Monastir in the final game of the Sahara Conference, and AS Douanes (Senegal) during the classification round at the BAL Playoffs in Kigali, Rwanda. On the other hand, US Monastir were riding the wave of four straight wins. However, it was the KingsMen, Rivers Hoopers, who started brighter and looked on the front foot until late in the opening quarter, when US Monastir rallied to take a slim one-point advantage as the first quarter ended 21-20 in favour of the Tunisians. Rivers Hoopers increased the intensity in the second quarter and enjoyed a brilliant scoring run to end the quarter 25-19 for a five-point lead at halftime, with the scores at 45-40 in favour of the Hoopers. Both Rivers Hoopers and US Monastir had met on three separate occasions prior to the quarter-final encounter. US Monastir defeated Rivers Hoopers during the maiden edition of the BAL, while both teams recorded one win each from their meetings at this year’s Sahara Conference. The third quarter showed the competitive nature of both teams as they battled for every possession, with Rivers Hoopers edging their Tunisian opponents 23-22 to take a 6-point lead into the fourth quarter, with the scoreboard reading 68-62 in favour of the KingsMen. A tense fourth quarter saw US Monastir edge Rivers Hoopers by two points, with scores of 26–24 in favour of the Tunisians. But it was the Hoopers who roared loudest at the final buzzer as they held on for a nervy 4-point win, as the final result stood at 92-88 in favour of the KingsMen. Will Perry, who played every second of the contest, was named the game’s top performer as he put up a game-high 33 points along with 5 rebounds, 5 assists, and 4 steals. Three players hit double-doubles for the Rivers Hoopers, as Kelvin Amayo finished with 18 points and 10 assists, Peter Olisemeka had 18 points and 12 rebounds, while Devine Eke put up 16 points and 12 rebounds. The result means Rivers Hoopers are the first Nigerian side to reach the last four at Africa’s biggest club basketball championship. Up next for the KingsMen is a date with Libya’s Al Ahly for a place in the championship game. The game will take place on Wednesday, May 29, 2024 at the BK Arena, Kigali, Rwanda.",

        "content": "Embattled Professor Gregory Akenzua, one of the suspended Enigie (duke) on Monday got a second suspension, this time from the Benin Royal Family who wielded the big stick on him for taking the Oba of Benin to court to challenge their suspension as Enigie in the kingdom. Professor Gregory Akenzua, a professor of Gynecology, former Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University of Benin and former chairman Governing Council of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma is a younger brother to Oba Erediauwa, the father of Oba Ewuare II. Addressing a press conference in Benin, members of the royal family including descendants of Oba Ovonramwen, Oba Eweka, Oba Akenzua II, Oba Erediauwa and others said, Professor Akenzua against all entreaties have chosen to challenge the Benin Traditional Institution through his acts “that are utterly at variance with the customs and tradition of the Benin people, and the core values of the Benin Royal Family.” When contacted for his reaction, Professor Akenzua said he was in Lagos “for an engagement” and requested time to respond. Reading from a press statement on behalf of the royal family, Prince George Eweka said “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua, has betrayed the core values of respect for the Benin Customs and Tradition, devotion and submission to the customary hierarchy of the Benin Kingdom; and respect for customary arbitration process. Instead, he has chosen the path of rebellion; “For the avoidance of doubt, the Royal Family wishes to emphasize that His Royal Majesty, the Oba of Benin occupies a unique position as the father of every member of the Benin Royal Family irrespective of age. “Hence the Royal family does not have an Okaegbe, like other families in Benin Kingdom but Odion Egbe who is required by tradition to defer to His Royal Majesty; “The Royal Family also notes that in utter violation of the hierarchy of succession to the Odion-Egbe position of the Benin Royal Family, Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua has been parading himself as the Odion-Egbe of the Royal Family, and has held meetings to assert himself as such when he knows that he is not rightfully entitled to the position being far lower in the hierarchy of seniority in the Benin Royal Family; “The Benin Royal Family has given ample opportunities to Prof.Gregory Idurobo Akenzua to retrace his steps and return to the path of honour and dignity; “Prof. Gregory Idurobo Akenzua has snubbed and rejected the opportunities provided by the Royal Family for him to retrace his wrongful steps. “After a careful review of the facts, the Benin Royal Family has decided as follows: “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua is hereby suspended from the Benin Royal Family for his acts of rebellion against the Benin Traditional Institution; “Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua is no longer to participate in any activity connected with the Benin Royal Family; “All members of the Benin Royal Family are strongly directed not to relate, associate, or engage with Professor Gregory Idurobo Akenzua for as long as he remains suspended from the Benin Royal Family.”",

        "content": "New York Giants pass-rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux is aiming as high as possible heading into the 2024 season. Thibodeaux had four sacks as a rookie in 2022 after the Giants drafted him with the No. 5 overall pick. He then took a big step forward with 11.5 sacks last season, and he is hoping to double that total this year. On Thursday, Thibodeaux began his press conference at OTAs by telling reporters he is eyeing the single-season record of 22.5 sacks that is shared by Giants legend Michael Strahan and Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt. “In case y’all wondering, I’m going for the record, so don’t ask,” Thibodeaux said. “Every year I’m here, I’m going for Michael Strahan’s record.” \"In case y'all wondering, I'm going for the record, so don't ask.\" Kayvon Thibodeaux began his media availability by telling everyone he's coming for Michael Strahan's sack record pic.twitter.com/D5ra74funP — Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) May 23, 2024 Thibodeaux made the comment in a joking tone, but he is very serious. He later mentioned how he should have more opportunities to rush than passer than Strahan and other defenders did, as the NFL is more pass-heavy than ever. “He didn’t have as many rush opportunities as I’m gonna have. The game wasn’t as much pass as it was before, so it’s like I have an opportunity that people would wish they could be in,” Thibodeaux said. Giants DE Kayvon Thibodeaux opened up his press conference by saying “Every year I’m here I’m going for @michaelstrahan ’s (sack) record.” He was kidding. ... Or was he? Here he is explaining why he sets his goals so high. pic.twitter.com/cpdKm3qcWf — Ralph Vacchiano (@RalphVacchiano) May 23, 2024 Giants fans have to admire the ambition. Watt showed that Strahan’s record is not untouchable, and Thibodeaux is a player who holds himself to a very high standard. We learned that with the assessment he had of his own play after his rookie season . It goes without saying that Giants fans would be thrilled if one of their own broke Strahan’s record.

        "content": "KEIR Starmer insisted he had plenty of energy for the election trail as Tories branded him “Sir Sleepy”. The Labour chief rubbished claims of weariness as “desperate” — and said he had been working flat out on election plans since January. In Lancing, West Sussex , Sir Keir said: “I’ve had a smile on my face since January 1 because I knew this was an election year. “I’ve wasted nine years in opposition. \"I’ve worked four-and-a-half years to change this Labour Party, and now I’ve got the chance to take that to the country. “So we’re doing that not only with energy, but with a smile, with positivity across our candidates as we go into this election.” Tories coined the “Sir Sleepy” nickname when Starmer, 61, who is 17 years older than PM Rishi Sunak, 44, disappeared from the campaign trail on Sunday. Conservative sources appeared to take issue with his age, adding: “It’s understandable he may be weary. On the claims, Sir Keir said: “They are just so desperate. \"They are rummaging in the toy box.” Starmer also refused to rule out raising tuition fees from £9,000 a year. He said he considered himself a “socialist” despite ditching all 10 of the pledges he made in his bid to replace Jeremy Corbyn .",

        "content": "(Pemprov) Sumatera Utara ( ) berhasil meraih opini Wajar Tanpa Pengecualian (WTP) untuk Pemerintah Daerah (LKPD) 2023. Ini merupakan Opini WTP ke-10 berturut-turut yang diperoleh Pemprov Sumut sejak 2015. Menurut Penjabat (Pj) Gubernur Sumut, Hassanudin, Opini WTP merupakan sebuah kewajiban bagi pemerintah sebagai bentuk standarisasi laporan keuangan, akuntabilitas, dan kepatuhan pada undang-undang. Dia berharap, ini menjadi budaya bagi Pemprov Sumut dan menjadi motivasi untuk meningkatkan kinerja. \"Ini bukan prestasi, ini merupakan keharusan bagi pemerintah sebagai bentuk tanggung jawab kita mengelola uang rakyat. Saya harap ini menjadi budaya di Pemprov Sumut dan meningkatkan motivasi kerja. \" kata Hassanudin, seusai penyerahan Laporan Hasil Pemeriksaan (LHP) RI di Ruang Rapat Paripurna DPRD Sumut, Jalan Imam Bonjol Nomor 5, Medan, Senin (27/5). Hassanudin juga menegaskan, Opini WTP merupakan hasil kerja keras Pemprov Sumut dalam pengelolaan keuangan daerah. Walau begitu, hal yang lebih penting, menurutnya, adalah kehadiran pemerintah di tengah-tengah masyarakat. “WTP merupakan hasil kerja keras kita bersama, namun yang lebih penting lagi adalah bagaimana kita bisa meningkatkan kualitas hidup masyarakat, lewat peningkatan kesehatan, pendidikan, lapangan kerja, infrastruktur dan lainnya,” kata Hassanudin. Anggota V BPK RI Ahmadi Noor Supit mengapresiasi capaian Pemprov Sumut yang berhasil meraih WTP ke-10 berturut-turut. Ahmadi mendorong agar Pemprov Sumut mengambil langkah lebih konkret untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan masyarakat. “Tidak hanya fokus WTP, tetapi juga meningkatkan kesejahteraan rakyat terutama stunting, 18,9% masih lebih rendah dari nasional tetapi perlu dikejar hingga 14%, infrastruktur jalan, tuan rumah PON 2024 dan Pilkada serentak,” kata Ahmadi. Dia juga berharap Pemprov Sumut segera menyelesaikan rekomendasi BPK RI untuk LPKD 2023. Sampai saat ini pemprov Sumut telah menyelesaikan 81,72% rekomendasi BPK RI, melebihi target nasional yang sebesar 75%. “Sudah melebihi target nasional 75%, tetapi kita harap segera diselesaikan rekomendasi tersebut agar tidak menjadi beban pada Gubernur selanjutnya,” kata Ahmadi. Hadir pada penyerahan LHP BPK RI ini Ketua DPRD Sumut Sutarto, Auditor Utama Keuangan Negara BPK RI Slamet Kurniawan, Sekda Pemprov Sumut serta Forkopimda Sumut. Hadir juga anggota dewan DPRD Sumut dan seluruh OPD Pemprov Sumut. (S-1)",
