And that prompted rivals last night to insist the SNP ’s NHS pledges “are not worth the paper they’re written on”. 2 Neil Gray refused to commit to meeting A&E wait targets Credit: Alamy 2 But he said 'We’ve got better A&E waiting times than England and Wales' Credit: Alamy The Nats Government’s aim of 95 per cent of A&E patients being admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours has not been met since July 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic .

        "content": "Jo Aleh and Molly Meech competing in Marseille last year. Photo: Getty Images By Dana Johannsen Yachting NZ is accused of mishandling its Olympic selections after one of its star crews was picked for the Paris Games, despite failing to meet the required performance standard. Jo Aleh and Molly Meech, who paired up in the 49erFX class at the beginning of 2022, headlined the announcement of the New Zealand sailing team for the Games last month. With five previous Games appearances and three Olympic medals between them, the pair are the most experienced of the nine-strong team named thus far. But according to Yachting NZ's selection documents, the duo were not eligible to be considered for nomination, having failed to achieve a top 10 placing at one of the designated selection regattas. The selection was signed off by the New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC). Both organisations are adamant proper process was followed in the nomination and selection of the pair. However, Yachting NZ's apparent willingness to contort its criteria for Aleh and Meech, along with a perceived inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\" clause, has led to several disputes over its handling of selections and allegations of bias. Secret selection criteria leaked Yachting NZ has long maintained a cloak of secrecy around how it selects its athletes for the Olympic Games. It is the only national body that does not publicly share its nomination criteria - contravening the NZOC's nomination and selection regulation - and sailors wishing to be considered for the pinnacle event must agree to keep it confidential. However, RNZ has obtained a copy of the selection documents. New Zealand's sailors must clear an even higher bar than the NZOC's already lofty \"top 16\" criteria to be nominated for selection. Under its primary selection criteria, Yachting NZ selectors will only nominate athletes deemed capable of winning a medal. To be eligible, sailors and crews must have, as a baseline, achieved a top 10 placing in at least one selection regatta, or have medalled at a world championships during that Olympic cycle. There is a second pathway for sailors or crews that Yachting NZ selectors consider to be \"emerging talent\" and have the potential to medal at the next Olympics in Los Angeles in 2028. Under these criteria, sailors need to finish in the top 16 nations at one of the selection regattas to be eligible. Aleh and former sailing partner Polly Powrie, affectionately known as Team Jolly, won gold in the women's 470 in London and silver in Rio. Meech was also a silver medallist in Rio, alongside teammate Alex Maloney in the 49erFX class. The popular duo went their separate ways following a disappointing 12th place finish in Tokyo. Meech then linked up with Aleh at the beginning of 2022 to form Team Jolly 2.0. Despite their credentials, the new pairing have produced mixed results on the international circuit. In the first of two selection regattas, Aleh and Meech placed 34th at the European Championships in Portugal last year - well outside the top 10 benchmark - before recording a 12th at the World Championships earlier this year. Prior to being named in the Games team last month, the duo had recorded just one top 10 result at a major international regatta in two-and-a-half seasons - a sixth placing at the 2023 world championships. It is understood selectors relied heavily on this result, despite it not being an official selection regatta. Under the criteria, selectors can also consider \"a sailor or crew's track record of success at past Olympic Games\". However, those familiar with the policy say these factors only come into play in final deliberations once sailors have met the underlying eligibility criteria. RNZ has spoken with several past and present members of the NZL sailing team, who expressed concern about Yachting NZ's handling of this year's selections. None wanted to go on the record for fear of being seen to diminish Aleh and Meech. All made a point of saying they would not have wanted to see the 49erFX pair left out of the Olympic team, but a recurring theme of the conversations was that Yachting NZ's perceived inconsistent approach to its selections has created distrust in the system. Aleh did not want to be drawn into the debate over the merits of her inclusion in the team, but told RNZ via text message that she is \"very pro-selection, having had close friends impacted by selection policies in the past\". \"In terms of the YNZ policy we were happy to be selected and for us it was just a little step on the way to what we are trying to do in Paris. So our focus is very much on making sure we are doing everything we can over the next few months,\" she wrote. Since being named in the Olympic team, Aleh and Meech had a breakthrough result last month at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, claiming the bronze medal - a promising sign the pair are beginning to perfect their partnership. But it is clear on anyone's reading of the criteria that Yachting NZ have applied an extraordinary amount of discretion to include Aleh and Meech in the team. In a brief statement provided to RNZ, Yachting NZ boss David Abercrombie said the organisation does not publicly comment on individual nominations, but all sailors and crews were selected in line with its policies. The nomination of athletes \"follows a rigorous process led by an independent panel with a wealth of sailing expertise and experience\". NZOC secretary general Nicki Nicol also asserted proper process was followed. \"All selections are made by an experienced selection panel. Decisions are evidence based and athletes nominated by [national sports organisations] are assessed by the NZOC selectors against the agreed nomination criteria and the NZOC selection policy,\" she said in a statement. Selection discretion: Pedigree vs potential The discretion used to pick Aleh and Meech appears not to have been as readily available to others. RNZ understands at least one sailor - kitefoiler Lukas Walton-Keim - has lodged a formal appeal with the Sports Tribunal over his non-nomination in the new Olympic class. Walton-Keim is the partner of Olympic pole vaulter Eliza McCartney, who last weekend spoke out about the NZOC's controversial \"top 16\" selection policy, arguing qualified athletes should not be denied entry to the Olympics. It is understood Walton-Keim's case will be heard this week, unless a resolution can be reached in the meantime. All parties agree to confidentiality when a case is before the tribunal, but it is understood Walton-Keim is seeking nomination under the \"emerging talent\" clause. Two athletes have been selected under this criteria - boardsailor Veerle ten Have in the women's IQ foil, and Greta Pilkington, who is expected to be confirmed in Ilca 6 at an official announcement on Tuesday morning. Ten Have finished 22nd and 21st overall at her two selection events, but was easily inside the top 16 nations for both events. Pilkington had a shaky start to her campaign, recording 53rd and 44th placings in the first two selection events earlier this year, before pulling it out of the bag in the final event in Hyeres last month. There the 20 year-old finished 16th, and 14th nation. It is expected Walton-Keim's case will focus on the inconsistent application of the \"emerging talent\" clause. Walton-Keim finished 28th, 17th, and 27th at his three selection regattas. His 17th placing at the European Championships last year put him inside the top 16 nations. While not official selection regattas, the 28 year-old is also tracking strongly at recent events. He finished 11th at French Olympic Week in Hyeres, or ninth nation, and 17th at the Formula Kite world championships (15th nation) earlier this week. Following the event, Walton-Keim posted on Instagram: \"I'm not sure what's next, I'd like to do some more racing in 2024 ... let's see.\" 'Rigid' with rules 'when it suits them' One former international sailor said the governing body's flexibility is at odds with its \"rigid\" approach in the past to not only Olympic nomination, but also funding decisions and selection to its \"Fast Track\" development programme. \"YNZ will follow the rules to the absolute letter when it suits them. We're always being told, 'Well, the policy is very clear,' but then when they want to get someone in the team, suddenly there is all this grey area,\" they said. Abercrombie did not directly address questions related to whether he has concerns about perceptions of bias and growing distrust in the system. But in a statement, he said Yachting NZ's policies are \"transparent and available to every athlete throughout their campaigns\". The long-serving chief executive of the organisation also said the current policy was \"developed after an athlete-led review following the Tokyo Olympic Games\" and athletes will continue to be involved in refining the policy for future cycles. Nicol also ignored questions about whether the NZOC had any concerns about Yachting NZ's handling of selections. \"While we are not able to comment on individual cases, we do understand how tough it is for athletes that may not have been nominated by their sport for selection to an NZ Team.\" It is not the first time questions have been raised about Yachting NZ's approach to selections for pinnacle events. In 2016 Sara Winther (laser radial) and Natalia Kosinska (RS:X) took cases to the Sports Tribunal over their non-nomination for the Rio Games. While the tribunal ultimately ruled in favour of Yachting NZ, the then-chair of the arbitration body Sir Bruce Robertson was highly critical of the sport's handling of selections. \"I have concerns about the inadequacy of communication by YNZ to both athletes. While the selection policy is drafted to provide huge discretion to YNZ, this does not obviate its obligations to abide by the rules of natural justice and to ensure basic fairness in its implementation,\" Sir Bruce wrote in his decision.",

        "content": "As the Trudeau government desperately seeks to improve its polling numbers heading into an election next year, Canadians are increasingly confronted with the reality that many of its signature policies don’t make sense. Not only that but, even worse, they often work against each other. A case in point is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s simultaneous goals of significantly increasing Canada’s annual immigration levels, creating more affordable housing and lowering Canada’s industrial greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared to 2005 levels by 2020. The problem is that higher immigration lowers the availability and raises the cost of housing, as well as increasing greenhouse gases. When the Trudeau government came to power in 2015, 271,845 immigrants became permanent residents of Canada. Its current plan boosts that number to 465,000 this year, 485,000 in 2024, 500,000 in 2025 and “stabilizes” it at 500,000 in 2026. In 2022, while the Trudeau government was developing its plans, its own public service warned it that this would exacerbate Canada’s housing shortage, raise prices and adversely affect other government services. As the Canadian Press reported earlier this year, documents obtained through an access-to-information request revealed that in 2022, public servants in the immigration ministry warned the government that, “In Canada, population growth has exceeded the growth in available housing units ... As the federal authority charged with managing immigration ... policy-makers must understand the misalignment between population growth and housing supply, and how permanent and temporary immigration shapes population growth ... “Rapid increases put pressure on health care and affordable housing.” Then there’s the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Herbert Grubel, a former federal MP and emeritus professor of economics at Simon Fraser University and Patrick Grady, a former senior official in the federal finance department, estimated in a 2021 Financial Post article that based on higher immigration levels, “greenhouse gas emissions will be 7.5% above what they would have been otherwise” in 2030 and “this gap will be much larger by 2050, the year the government has promised to reduce emissions to net-zero as required by the Paris accord.” As Canadians for a Sustainable Society notes on its website, “there is a direct link between immigration and sustainability.” One would think this would be obvious to everyone, including the Trudeau Liberals. Apparently not.",

        "content": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (KNWA/KFTA) — The National Weather Service confirms that one of the tornadoes that hit Centerton was an EF2 and one of the tornadoes that hit Decatur was an EF3. NWS has been surveying damage after severe storms made their way through Northeast Oklahoma and Northwest Arkansas late Saturday evening and early Sunday morning. A in Tulsa was released on Monday detailing the early damage surveys. NWS says it believes two tornadoes touched down in Decatur and EF3 damage was found northwest of town. It said the tornado likely started in eastern Delaware County in Oklahoma. Damage west of Centeron was also surveyed. NWS said that based on damage patterns and radar data, two tornadoes likely took place in that area, one producing EF2 damage. There was extensive straight-line wind damage in Bentonville, Rogers, War Eagle and other areas of Benton County. Tornadoes also occurred at times in those areas. Based on Sunday’s survey, NWS believes the fatality at a mobile home near Beaver Lake was from straight-line wind damage. The National Weather Service in Little Rock also released a on Monday detailing damage from the storms in Boone and Marion counties. An EF3 tornado went through Boone and Marion County. NWS said the tornado started at 3:27 a.m. two miles south of Bellefonte. The tornado caused minor damage to the Boone County Sheriff`s Department building and an Arkansas State Police Troop Center. The report said BCSD confirmed one fatality inside a mobile home in Olvey, about 12 miles southeast of Harrison. Three other fatalities were reported in Marion County, according to NWS. The tornado lifted two miles northwest of Summit in Marion County and was on the ground for 34 minutes. NWS said this tornado was extremely wide at 1,500 yards or 0.85 miles. NWS said final assessments and results from the damage surveys will be released on Monday evening. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a press conference on Sunday there have been related to the recent severe weather outbreak.",

        "content": "A HEALTH Maintenance Organisation, AVON Healthcare Limited, has reinforced its commitment to promoting healthy living by donating sanitary products to 500 underprivileged schoolgirls in Lagos in honour of World Menstrual Hygiene Day, celebrated globally today. This initiative was part of a community outreach programme held at Bright Achiever’s School in Bariga, Lagos, and also marked the end of their #PurpleLipsChallenge, a campaign celebrating women and raising awareness about menstrual hygiene. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Avon HMO, Adesimbo Ukiri, while highlighting the significance of the initiative, cited economic challenges and rising costs that make essential goods inaccessible for many Nigerians. She said: “The inability to afford personal hygiene products can significantly hinder a girl’s education and overall well-being, affecting their long-term development and potential to make meaningful contributions to the society. Through this initiative, we aim to ensure that girls can remain in school throughout the academic year, helping to create a future where women and men can equally contribute to the society. “By fostering partnership between the private sector and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), more girls can stay in school year-round, attaining the same educational opportunities as boys. Empowered girls become empowered women, and when both women and men have the necessary tools, they can actively contribute to building a more inclusive and thriving society. Launched in 2019, the #PurpleLipsChallenge encouraged women to share photos of themselves wearing purple lipstick on social media. For every photo posted, Avon HMO pledged to provide a schoolgirl with reusable sanitary products. This year’s campaign, like the one in 2019, gained local and international support, attracting participants from Nigeria, London, Texas, Abu Dhabi & Ontario. A key driver of this success was Avon HMO’s collaboration with Safety for Every Girl, an NGO focused on eradicating period poverty and advancing menstrual equity in Nigeria. Additionally, leading organizations such as Heirs Energies, United Capital Plc., Afriland Properties, and Avon Medical Practice lent their support. Beyond providing sanitary kits, Avon HMO empowered the girls by providing education on managing menstrual hygiene with dignity. This was done through health talks and practical demonstrations where they showed the girls how to properly use the sanitary kits. Period poverty remains a substantial barrier to education for many girls in Nigeria. According to UNESCO, one in ten girls in Sub-Saharan Africa misses school during their menstrual cycle, potentially losing up to 20% of the school year. This interruption not only hampers their academic progress but also limits their future prospects. You must be logged in to post a comment. Why are you flagging this comment?

        "content": "OTTAWA, Ontario — Federal anti-scab legislation passed 3rd reading today, clearing its final hurdle in the House of Commons, and significantly levelling the playing field for workers’ rights in federally-regulated sectors like communications and transportation. “This is a long-awaited victory for workers’ bargaining rights in Canada,” said CUPE’s National President Mark Hancock. “And let’s not forget, this is what happens when the NDP – backed by the labour movement – put the rights of workers front and centre in the House of Commons. Let’s also not forget that Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has voted against anti-scab legislation not once, not twice, but eight times in the past. The Conservatives only voted for it this time because they knew better than to pick a fight with the labour movement as we approach the next election.” Currently, employers are able to hire scabs in order to break the morale and bank accounts of striking and locked out workers, as is the case with members of CUPE 2614 at the Port of Quebec, who have been locked out and replaced with scabs since September 2022. Employers also use scab labour to ship jobs out of the country, as is the case with members of CUPE 2815 who have been locked out from their jobs at Videotron in Gatineau, Quebec since October 2023. While these workers have gone seven months without a paycheque, Videotron is able to continue business as usual, while paying bottom-dollar to ship jobs out of the country. Anti-scab legislation will make all of this illegal. Employers will no longer be allowed to hire replacement workers (scabs) during strikes and lockouts, thereby balancing the scales and giving more power back to workers to fight for better wages and a better life. “Today we have climbed another rung on the ladder toward justice and fairness for workers,” said CUPE’s National Secretary-Treasurer Candace Rennick. “This marks an extraordinary milestone in the fight for workers’ rights in Canada, and a profound testament to the power of workers when we organize and join with our allies in Parliament to fight for what is right. We never gave up on the fight for anti-scab legislation for federally-regulated industries, and we won’t stop until it’s in effect in all jurisdictions across Canada.” Anti-scab legislation has already been shown to reduce the length and frequency of strikes and lockouts in Quebec and British Columbia where anti-scab laws are already in effect provincially. The Kinew NDP government in Manitoba has also promised anti-scab legislation. The federal legislation must now be confirmed by the Senate before receiving Royal Assent.

        "description": "Hearing takes place Friday for Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer",
        "content": "Two animal activists who were convicted for their role in a 2019 protest at an Abbotsford hog farm will have an appeal of their sentences heard on Friday (May 31) in Vancouver. Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer of Kelowna are hoping to have the B.C. Court of Appeal set aside their 30-day jail sentences and re-sentence them to either a conditional discharge or a conditional sentence, which could include house arrest. The pair were among four people initially charged in relation to a protest on April 28, 2019 at the Excelsior Hog Farm. The group – who dubbed themselves the “Excelsior 4” – faced a total of 21 charges. Charges against Geoff Regier were later stayed, and Roy Sasano was acquitted at trial. Soranno and Schafer, who are spouses, were convicted in July 2022 of one count each of break-and-enter and sentenced in October 2022. They appealed their convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred when he wouldn’t allow the jury to see video footage obtained from hidden cameras that showed the alleged mistreatment of animals on the hog farm. The cameras had been placed by members of the Meat the Victims group, to which Soranno and Schafer belonged. The B.C. Court of Appeal in January of this year upheld the convictions. Soranno and Schaffer have since filed an application with the Supreme Court of Canada to appeal that decision. Meanwhile, they are appealing their sentences. RELATED: Two Abbotsford hog-farm protesters sentenced to 30 days in jail In a press release issued Monday (May 27), the pair alleged that Soranno was “unceremoniously cut off” during her 2022 sentencing hearing and told by Justice Frits Verhoeven that “this is not the platform for you.” “According to the appeal brief, Verhoeven denied Soranno her ‘well-entrenched right to speak before being sentenced’ and additionally deprived the court of information relevant to her sentencing,” the press release states. The appeal brief states that the judge’s actions were “condescending, dismissive and illegal.” “Soranno and Schafer argue that Justice Verhoeven also erred by deciding their beliefs and morals were irrelevant to their culpability, a claim underscored by Verhoeven’s decision to use their political goals as a reason to impose a custodial sentence, basing it on denunciation and deterrence,” the release states. Soranno states that the judge “can’t have it both ways.” “Our reasons for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience is either relevant to our case or it’s not. We believe that exposing animal cruelty is a social imperative and highly relevant to our sentencing,” she said. Soranno and Schafer are planning to hold a press conference and rally outside of the B.C. Court of Appeal on Friday at 9 a.m. The hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. RELATED: Guilty verdicts stand for 2 Abbotsford hog-farm protesters",

The Gone Girl actress, 32, wore a tiny bikini printed all over with different photographs of women wearing bikinis and lingerie, which she teamed with a skirt in the same print. From a distance, the swimsuit looked like it was a red, white, and blue print. The My Body author wore a cute big floppy black bucket hat that obscured her face in some shots. EmRata – who attended F1 in Miami last week – captioned the post in her usual minimalistic way, writing: 'monaco!'

Earlier this month, the busy mom sat down for an interview with the New York Times Modern Love podcast and revealed she's not focused on finding a romantic relationship right now. Emily – who shares three-year-old son Sylvester with ex-husband Sebastian Bear-McClard – said: 'I take care of so much in my life. 'I take care of my son, I take care of my home, I take care of my schedule, his schedule, my career. The burden of the finances is on me and I don't have a family supporting me financially or any of that,' she said. She continued: 'I often think about how much I want to be taken care of and I experience that with my female friendships in different ways.

        "content": "after a battle with cancer at the age of 71, and the . The tributes and memories fans, players, and media members shared of Walton offered a terrific example of how he had such a lasting impact on the game. From his time at UCLA to Portland to San Diego to Boston, people posted stories of Walton’s on-court prowess and anecdotes from his career. Others remembered Walton’s time calling the NBA on NBC, providing the soundtrack to the biggest games of the 90s. Many younger fans remember Walton’s most recent chapter as a broadcaster, calling college basketball games (mostly in the Pac-12) for ESPN. His partner for the majority of those games was Dave Pasch, who had an incredible chemistry with Walton, playing the straight man trying to call games while Walton wandered about, going down whatever path his mind presented to often discuss anything and everything but the game. They were a joy to watch, and on Monday, Pasch called in to to offer a remembrance of his longtime partner and share a touching anecdote about Walton, the person. \"I love you, but don't tell anybody.\" Bill Walton's longtime broadcast partner reflects on one of his favorite memories of his friend ❤️ — SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) He also offered up an incredibly funny story of how they made up a bit about George Lucas creating Chewbacca in Walton’s image and then it got picked up by big entertainment outlets. Dave Pasch talks about the Chewbacca audition story that Bill made up on air in February, their last game together and the last time Dave saw him — CJ Fogler account may or may not be notable (@cjzero) It is a perfect tribute to Walton by someone who knew him like few do, and a glimpse into the man who was a truly unique force. Another of Walton’s play-by-play partners, Jason Benetti, who called games with him on ESPN and later joined Walton for the always bizarre Throw It Down simulcast on NBA League Pass, posted a similarly fitting tribute to the legend. You sent me an email in 2020 that said: ————- PUT THE MUSIC ON, as soon as it doesn’t seem right, change the music/station, but don’t turn it off ————— I promise, the music will always be on.

        "content": "It seems only yesterday the eternally fresh-faced Alex de Minaur was one of the much-touted NextGen hotshots, but now it's a new breed of teen tennis guns who are on his trail. \"He's a tall American, dangerous and with powerful groundstrokes,\" is de Minaur's verdict on his latest young hitman at the French Open, 19-year-old Alex Michelsen, who's already shot down the Australian No.1 once this season on a Mexican hard court. De Minaur is counting on the stocky, 1.93m Californian being a bit greener on the red clay but can't rely on it, with Michelsen, who's up to No.60 and will surely soon join his seven compatriots in the top 50, having downed fellow American world No.12 Taylor Fritz in Geneva last week. \"It should be a tough battle, and hopefully I can get my revenge,\" added de Minaur. Journalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion. Australian tennis is counting on it, a mite desperate for its main man to prevail after a wretched start to the tournament with five players already out, one withdrawn though injury and not a winner on the board. De Minaur has got used to the responsibility of being the spearhead, and isn't talking down his expectations any more. At a mature 25 and having tasted life in the top 10 this year, he feels a quarter-final place, at least, in every slam should be achievable for him now. On clay, the world No.11 is adamant he's become a different player this year. \"I'm yet to go past the second round here in Paris, so that definitely has to be the first step, but I don't see why I can't play well,\" he told AAP. \"Adapting to clay has been a learning process. A lot of my improvement has probably had to do with me growing into my body a little bit more, getting a little bit stronger. \"My groundstrokes aren't probably as effective on the clay as they would be on other surfaces, so I've got to make sure that I'm nice and strong and physical with it. \"Getting that strength and power to help me out on the clay has been very important and, also understanding the type of tennis that I want to play on the surface and using a little bit more creativity, movement, speed to create more variety. \"It's all clicked together and I've gained a lot of confidence on the surface. And, mentally too, I've told myself that there's no reason why I can't play well on this surface.\" Should calamity befall de Minaur, there's at least one bit of good news on the horizon with one Aussie guaranteed for the second round from the Alexei Popyrin-Thanasi Kokkinakis clash. The shame, as their colleague Max Purcell noted, is that they're both playing well enough to have both gone on a good run. \"I'll be watching though,\" smiled Purcell. \"It's a popcorn match, definitely.\" \"He's one of my better mates on tour,\" says Kokkinakis, revealing that he and Popyrin had decided radio silence between each other might be the best bet before their clash. \"We practise a lot together. It is tricky - but it should be a fun one.\" AUSTRALIANS IN ACTION ON DAY THREE OF THE FRENCH OPEN (PREFIX DENOTES SEEDING): Men's singles Alexei Popyrin v Thanasi Kokkinakis 11-Alex de Minaur v Alex Michelsen (USA) Adam Walton v Arthur Rinderknech (FRA) Rinky Hijikata v Luciano Darderi (ITA)",

        "description": "The former Jaguars kicker was sued and accused of sexual assault following an incident that allegedly occurred during the team's trip to London in 2023.",
        "content": "A pair of flight attendants who were on the Jaguars’ Sept. 28 Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings flight to London last season have sued former Jacksonville kicker Brandon McManus and alleged that he sexually assaulted them during the trip, according to ESPN . McManus, who now plays for the Commanders, allegedly attempted to grind against the women, and when one of them addressed McManus, he “smirked and walked away.” The lawsuit, filed in Duval County Circuit Civil Court on Friday, reportedly is for more than $1 million in damages — with the two women experiencing “severe mental anguish, anxiety, psychological and emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation,” according to ESPN. The Jaguars declined to comment, according to ESPN, while McManus, 32, hadn’t released a statement as of Monday afternoon. “Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus,” the Commanders said in a statement Monday . “We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon’s representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.” The lawsuit reportedly alleged that the Jaguars were responsible for “failing to supervise McManus and failing to create a safe environment for staff serving the team.” ESPN reported that the flight — transporting the Jaguars to London for an Oct. 1 game against the Falcons and an Oct. 8 game against the Bills — allegedly “quickly turned into a party,” and McManus allegedly “recruited three other flight attendants to the party and passed out $100 bills to encourage them to drink and dance inappropriately for him,” according to the outlet. One of the women accused McManus of sexually assaulting her while she was seated during the flight — when McManus allegedly attempted to kiss her — and while serving meals on two different occasions, per the outlet. The second woman was also allegedly sexually assaulted when the second meal was being served, and she reportedly stayed away from McManus during the Jaguars’ flight from London to Jacksonville two weeks later, following the Oct. 8 game, by remaining on the second floor of the plane. McManus will enter his 11th season in the NFL in 2024. He spent the first nine years of his career in Denver before signing with the Jaguars in 2023, when he made 81.1 percent of his kicks and all 35 of his extra-point attempts. The one-year deal that McManus signed with the Commanders is worth $3.6 million. If you have been sexually assaulted and live in New York, you can call 1-800-942-6906 for free and confidential crisis counseling. If you live outside the state, you can dial the 24/7 National Sexual Assault hotline at 1-800-656-4673.",

        "content": "Abha were undoubtedly in high spirits heading into the clash after moving out the relegation zone last Thursday with a vital win over Al Khaleej. Mosimane did not tinker with the starting line-up that much, as Fahad Jumayah made way for Meshal Al Mutain at right-back as the only change from Thursday's win. Al-Hazm, who were already relegated, had most of the possession in the first half but were unable to find a way past the Abha defence. After a goalless period, Abha came out firing in the second half and were rewarded two minutes in Ahmed Abdu Jaber found the back of the net. Mosimane's side suffered a set-back just before the hour mark when Al-Hazm levelled matters via the boot of Muhammed Badamosi to set up a tense final 30 minutes in the second half. However, Abha's fate was sealed with ten minutes to play after Mohammed Al-Thani secured the winning goal for the home side. Following the defeat, Mosimane's side dropped to 16th spot after fellow relegation rivals Al Akhdoud beat Al-Tai to save their top-flight status.",

        "content": "We are less than three weeks away until kick off their Euro 2024 campaign against Serbia in Germany. Having come so close to victory three years ago, 's men will be desperate to go that one step further on enemy territory to lift their first ever European Championship. We know the 33 players that could lead England to glory, with household names such as Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson missing out on the provisional squad. However, with the final squad needing to be trimmed down to 26, the identities of which seven gut cut remains a mystery. That doesn't mean it's impossible to speculate who these could be, though. With some players more likely to be on the plane than others, the Three Lions' provisional squad have been ranked based on who is most likely to be presenting their country, and who is expected to depart from their holidays. Players have been sorted into five categories, which are: Must start Jordan Pickford, Kyle Walker, John Stones, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, Harry Kane Definitely in the squad Aaron Ramsdale, Harry Maguire, Kieran Trippier, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Kobbie Mainoo, Cole Palmer Useful option Dean Henderson, Marc Guehi, Jarrad Branthwaite, Eberechi Eze, Anthony Gordon, Ollie Watkins, Ivan Toney 50/50 chance Luke Shaw, Ezri Konsa, Lewis Dunk, Joe Gomez, Conor Gallagher, James Madison, Jack Grealish, Jarrod Bowen No hope of going James Trafford, Jarell Quansah, Curtis Jones, Adam Wharton Most of England's starting XI is fairly predictable, but that's thanks to the level of talent these names have. has been the undisputed number one for years and this season has seen his international form finally translate for Everton. He finished the Premier League season with 13 clean sheets, second to only David Raya. In front of him, Manchester City duo and are expected to continue their partnership on the right side of defence. The midfield is likely going to be anchored by and following exceptional seasons at their respective new clubs. Many are clamouring for them to be joined by . If that's not the case, the FWA's Player of the Year will most certainly be a part of the attacking trio which will also include and . The two men who made a name for themselves in North London will line up in their third straight tournament together and be the country's biggest goal threats. With Nick Pope missing out through injury, it seems that will take up a familiar role as back-up goalkeeper this summer, with the Arsenal shot-stopper officially losing his battle to be his country's number one over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, has done himself justice this season. Having endured some difficult campaigns in recent times, his improved form will probably be enough for him to line-up alongside Stones in the heart of a back four. The left side of that defence is where most eyebrows have been raised. With Luke Shaw's status up in the air, could be needed to deputise at left-back, hence his inclusion. Versatility is also the name of the game when it comes to with the Liverpudlian defender even when it comes to his ability in the middle of the park Finally, two young men who last summer wouldn't have been anywhere near the squad now look near certainties to go. and have been pivotal since their emergences. The former scored what turned out to be the decisive goal in the FA Cup final, whereas the latter single-handedly dragged Chelsea into Europe next season. Both are more than worth additions. Cole Palmer finished with 33 goal contributions in 34 Premier League games, more than any other player. The third and final goalkeeping slot is 's for the taking. As the more experienced of the remaining two 'keepers, the former Manchester United man is expected to get the call-up and would be a good hand should catastrophe strike either Pickford or Ramsdale. The two central defenders who are most likely to support Stones are Maguire are and . Both have become key men for Crystal Palace and Everton and the experience of a major tournament will be important in their development to becoming international regulars in the future. , and both provide something a little different should Southgate need some inspiration on the bench. The increased squad size also means that both and can be included as back-ups to main man Kane. Although Watkins has been more potent throughout the season, it was Toney who impressed the most during March's internation friendlies. If it weren't for his injury, would be in the must start category. When fit, he is the best left-back in the country. However, with Southgate himself saying Shaw is in a losing battle against time, his chances of making the final 26 are 50/50 at best. This could make room for as a left-back option, but given that he has featured just twice for England in four years, his place is far from guaranteed. A question mark does hang over . It's not unfathomable to imagine the 32-year-old taking up a similar role in the squad that the likes of Conor Coady has done in the past, tasked with keeping the spirits high rather than being gifted any minutes. But with likely ahead of him, his spot is still up for grabs. In midfield, Mainoo and Palmer's impressive form has cast doubt on and 's roles this summer. Further forward, 's excellent season for West Ham could go unrewarded due to the strength in depth England have, whilst 's stop-start season on the sidelines has made him vulnerable for both his country and It's safe to assume that three out of the four men in this section are nailed on to miss out. , and Adam Wharton are all players who have the potential to represent the Three Lions at some point in the future. However, these uncapped youngsters all happen to play in areas where England have incredible strength in numbers, so forcing their way into this tournament seems near impossible. The fourth man, Jarell Quansah, may have an outside chance though. Despite strong competition in defence, no one outside of the starting duo has definitely got their passport stamped. Could the youthful defender's experience alongside Virgil Van Dijk this season see him become a rogue pick for the final squad?",

        "content": "Jason Kelce had something to say to hecklers who were angry that he distanced himself from the \"homemaker\" dialogue in the NFL world. The Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, recently took to their podcast to discuss controversial comments made by Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, who told a graduating class that women should endeavor to be \"homemakers\" over focusing on a career. Butker found himself in hot water for his comments and for quoting popstar Taylor Swift, who is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in his commencement speech at Benedictine College. Nuns affiliated with the college denounced Butker's speech, and the NFL distanced itself from his comments. Related stories On the \"New Heights\" podcast, Travis Kelce said he didn't agree with \"just about any of\" Butker's comments. Jason Kelce, who retired earlier this year from the Philadelphia Eagles, similarly said he did not \"align\" with Butker's views. But Jason Kelce was much more vocal when someone on X, formerly Twitter, made a comment about his wife, Kylie . \"Your wife is a homemaker. But you can't support Butker,\" an X user tweeted at Kelce. \"And your wife is a homemaker whose home is a mess. I'm sorry, but it is dirty and messy on television. It seems you're a bit hypocritical.\" Early Monday morning, Jason Kelce gave a response after having \"seen a number of people say\" similar things. \"I don't think of Kylie as a homemaker, I think of her as my wife. I think of her as a mother. She has an occupation, as do I, and we keep our house the best we can. Our marriage is a partnership, we are equals who are figuring it out on the daily,\" Kelce wrote on X . \"The only expectation is that we love each other, support one another, and are committed to our family, that comes first.\" As for their home, Kelce said it is \"both our faults it is messy,\" attributing it to the chaos of mixed schedules and raising three kids. \"We both raise our kids, we both work, We both keep our home,\" he wrote. \"If being a homemaker, works for some, and that's what they want, then hell yea, that's awesome, more power to you. I want to be clear, I'm not downplaying that at all, but that is not our family dynamic.\"",

        "content": "Leonardo DiCaprio treats his niece Normandie, 16, to a lavish shopping spree in Beverly Hills - 10 years after she was 'abducted' by parents amid family turmoil By Deirdre Durkan-simonds and Sameer Suri For Dailymail.com Published: 21:47, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:54, 27 May 2024 e-mail 11 shares 9 View comments Leonardo DiCaprio treated his niece Normandie Farrar, 16, to a lavish shopping spree in Beverly Hills over Memorial Day weekend . While out with his father, George DiCaprio, and stepmother, Peggy Farrar, the 49-year-old Oscar winner was seen spoiling his niece as he took her to various upscale boutiques as well as Tiffany & Co. and Prada. The teenager, who was notoriously 'abducted' at the age of six by her own father, appeared happy as she walked down the sidewalk, alongside her family, with two large shopping bags on her shoulder. DiCaprio attempted to keep a low profile during the outing as he sported a black Dodgers baseball cap, blue face mask, black puffer jacket and a grey t-shirt. After indulging in some retail therapy, the group reportedly enjoyed some quality time together at South Beverly Grill. Leonardo DiCaprio treated his niece Normandie, 16, to a lavish shopping spree in Beverly Hills over the weekend The family's sighting comes two months after he and his loved ones enjoyed a rare meal together at Cipriani in Beverly Hills. Normandie's parents, Charity Moore, and Adam Farrar, who is Leo's older stepbrother, were not present on either outing. Charity and Adam have whirled through their share of headline-grabbing legal problems over the years, including a 2016 arrest for alleged petty theft. The 'kidnapping' scandal unfolded in January 2014, when both Adam and Charity were separately arrested on drug charges. Adam was apprehended in Texas, where he had decamped with his daughter - illegally, inasmuch as Normanie was a dependent of the court in California because of her parents' criminal records and was not supposed to be taken out of state. At the time, Normanie was just six-years-old. Normandie was discovered in Texas on January 30 and whisked back to California, where she was placed in the care of her grandfather, Leo's father George DiCaprio. Meanwhile Adam was arrested and accused by the Los Angeles Police Department of 'concealing' his daughter in another state. While out with his father, George DiCaprio, and stepmother, Peggy Farrar, the 49-year-old Oscar winner was seen spoiling his niece as he took her to various upscale boutiques as well as Tiffany & Co. and Prada The teenager appeared happy as she walked down the sidewalk, alongside her family, with two large shopping bags on her shoulder DiCaprio attempted to keep a low profile during the outing as he sported a black Dodgers baseball cap, blue face mask, black puffer jacket and a grey t-shirt At the time, a spokesman for the department of the LA County Department of Children and Family Service told RadarOnline : 'I am happy to confirm that this child has in fact been found. It's great news. Beyond that, I can't really say more.' Before their estrangement Leonardo and his stepbrother, Adam Farrar, used to be close and had been seen attending a number of Los Angeles Lakers games together. In 2014, sources told RadarOnline that the pair 'have had zero contact in recent years and do not get along.' It is widely reported that DiCaprio was inspired to go into acting after he saw his step-brother carve a career for himself in commercials, movies and TV in the 1980s. Farrar is best known for his roles in the science fiction series Battlestar Galactica and the ABC comedy-drama Eight is Enough. However, as DiCaprio's career took off in the late 90s and Farrar's came to a standstill, things ended up rather differently for the brothers, who grew up together in LA after DiCaprio's mother, Peggy, married Farrar's father, cartoonist George DiCaprio, when he was just one. Since 2010, Farrar has been in and out of courts on charges of harassment, possession of controlled substances, driving without a license and domestic violence. In 2000, as DiCaprio was riding the success of his blockbuster Titanic, Farrar was arrested on charges that he attempted to kill his then-girlfriend and made terroristic threats. At the time, Peggy DiCaprio said of her troubled stepson: 'Adam is one of the most nonviolent people I know,’ according to New York Daily News . Farrar was released within 48 hours of his March 2000 arrest, and the charges against him were eventually dropped. People Magazine reported that two years earlier, the struggling actor landed in trouble with the law after allegedly assaulting a photographer who was pursuing his superstar sibling. Charges were never filed in that case.

        "content": "Former Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Brandon McManus has been accused of sexually assaulting two women on a team flight last year. McManus and the Jaguars are named in a lawsuit by women identified as Jane Doe I and Jane Doe II, filed last Friday in Duval County, where Jacksonville is located. The women said the Jaguars did not provide a safe environment for staff on the flight, which took the team to London for consecutive games last fall. They allege McManus of rubbing and grinding against them during the flight. Jane Doe I said McManus tried to kiss her and Jane Doe II said McManus \"smirked and walked away\" after she confronted him about grinding against her. McManus and his attorney have yet to respond to the lawsuit, first reported by ESPN. The Jaguars declined to comment about the lawsuit, which is seeking more than $1 million in damages and a jury trial. McManus was not re-signed by Jacksonville this offseason and has since joined the Washington Commanders on a one-year, $3.6 million contract. \"Earlier today, we were made aware of the civil lawsuit filed on May 24 against Brandon McManus,\" the Commanders said in a statement. \"We take allegations of this nature very seriously and are looking into the matter. We have been in communication with the League Office and Brandon's representation, and will reserve further comment at this time.\" McManus, 32, spent the first nine years of his 10-year NFL career with the Denver Broncos and signed with the Jaguars in May 2023. --Field Level Media",

The brunette beauty - who moved from the Kent countryside to London with her spouse and their pet dog Teddy and is a keen gardener - said: \"I do think that your life changes: you evolve, you grow up and your interests change.

        "content": "Amazon shoppers say they work a treat at banishing pests like flies and mice. Amazon shoppers are hailing pest traps which are being called \"incredibly effective\" at getting rid of pests. Costing less than a tenner, they are said to be perfect for not just people struggling with flies, but people with mice problems too. And you can use them in a variety of places. Costing £8.99, the Pest Sticky Boards by Mossoko contain five sticky board traps to catch the annoying pests. The traps measure 21cm x 31cm and \"covers a large surface are\", according to the Amazon description. The Pest Sticky Boards pad traps can easily used for cockroaches, flies, and other pests and can be used both indoors and outdoors. Some of the areas listed you can use them in include in your gardens, in farms, in warehouses, in your kitchen, behind appliances as well as under sink. You can also use food to attract pests. This includes: The Pest Sticky Boards have four stars out if five on Amazon with the majority giving five stars. Taking to the reviews one wrote: \"I recently purchased the sticky mouse traps from Amazon and they have exceeded my expectations!\" They add: Although they are inhumane and I am saddened on finding the little guys but These traps are incredibly effective in catching mice without any mess or hassle. The strong adhesive on the traps securely holds the mice, preventing them from escaping. The traps are also easy to set up and dispose of, making the whole process quick and convenient. I was amazed at how quickly I caught several mice using these traps. If you're dealing with a mouse problem, I highly recommend giving these sticky mouse traps a try if all other routes have failed.\" Another said: \"Exactly what i needed. Managed to catch 2 mouses hiding in the garage. So works extremely well.\" In a detailed review a third, who gave five stars, said: \"I’ve used similar glue traps before but they were black not yellow. I was interested to see if the bright yellow attracted more flies than the black ones did. Join the Daily Record's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages. \"I’d say it’s pretty even but the yellow does seem have slightly more on. Maybe that’s because these boards are around 1/3 bigger than my black traps, or maybe the flies just like the brightness, I don’t know. Anyway, they work! I have lots and lots of dead little flies on my board. As the boards are so big, I cut them in half (each board is individually wrapped and folded together so there is a crease down the middle you can cut). Best to use a Stanley knife to cut as it made my scissors very sticky! Apple is launching new tablets with a refreshed iPad Air and all-new iPad Pro hitting UK stores. The iPad Air now boasts a more powerful M2 chip housed within its aluminium chassis, increased standard storage, new colours, improved connectivity and extended battery life. For the first time, this tablet also comes in two sizes including a standard 11-inch display and a much larger 13-inch panel. If you're looking to go Pro, there's a significant upgrade with the 2024 range featuring a super slim design, a greatly enhanced OLED screen that's brighter and an incredibly fast M4 processor which makes these tablets faster than most PC laptops. One deal that piqued our interest comes from Sky who are offering the 11-inch Air with Wi-Fi and Cellular from just £17 per month with no upfront fee and 100MB of data included as well. You can learn more about the iPad Air deal on Sky's website here. This deal is based on a 48-month contract, with the total cost over four years coming to £816 - in comparison, the same tablet from Apple costs £749, but this doesn't include any data and requires an upfront payment. Sky also offers other deals, including the 13-inch Air for £21 per month or the Pro for £27 per month. As we've previously noted, Sky isn't the only network offering iPads on contract, with Vodafone and EE also providing customers with the option to purchase these devices via a monthly plan. \"These really are such a simple yet effective way of catching the little flies around my houseplants. I can’t comment on if they would catch a mouse (and hope I never have to!!) but they are extremely sticky so they quite possibly could. \"I would certainly recommend these boards and think they are excellent value (especially as I cut them in half, so effectively have 10 boards).\" Not everyone was convinced with one writing: \"Mouse was able to easily pass several times by two rows of the (not so) sticky pad, as it was possible to see by the marks left on a flour trail.

        "content": "Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani said on Monday that he is making progress in his recovery from Tommy John surgery, per ESPN's Jorge Castillo . According to Castillo, Ohtani began throwing from 60 feet last week and reached 80 mph. \"Just progressively increasing the distance,\" Ohtani said. \"Usually anywhere from 60-70 pitches, in that distance. Just continuing to increase the distance and the pitches, and just seeing where that goes. I'm not quite sure how far I'm going to go out there, but that's the progression.\" Ohtani has not pitched since last August when he was still with the Los Angeles Angels. In 23 appearances last season, Ohtani notched a 10-5 record with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts. He underwent Tommy John surgery in September of last year, ending his season on the mound. While the Dodgers are likely eager to get Ohtani back on the mound, the 2023 AL MVP has had an outstanding season as a designated hitter this season. He currently has a .336 batting average and has picked up 131 total bases—both numbers the best in the majors. He also leads the NL in slugging percentage and OPS. In 53 games, Ohtani has notched 13 homers and 35 RBI, good for seventh and 14th-best in the majors, respectively. The Dodgers sit at the top of the NL West at 33-22, though they have lost their last five games and are looking to get back on track against the New York Mets this week. Los Angeles is looking to bounce back from back-to-back divisional series exits with a big postseason this year. With the addition of Ohtani, reaching a World Series seems well within reach for the Dodgers. When the star is back on the mound, it could lead to even more success for Los Angeles.",

South American prosecutors told a London court that Nicolas Gomes De Brito, 25, was a drug dealer who had a rival shot dead. He then fled to Britain and was arrested two years ago after an international police request and held in jail. Yet despite an extradition treaty and what a British judge accepted was 'a strong case' against him, De Brito was freed in January. He claimed he would face discrimination in Brazil because he is gay, to the surprise of police who say he left his wife there. Nicolas Gomes De Brito, a Brazilian in a global murder hunt has been freed to walk British streets because a judge feared jails in his homeland would breach his human rights (pictured: the murder scene) South American prosecutors told a London court that De Brito (pictured), 25, was a drug dealer who had a rival shot dead. He then fled to Britain and was arrested two years ago after an international police request and held in jail But he won his freedom by arguing Brazilian prisons were crowded and he faced torture in custody. Judge Briony Clarke ruled there were insufficient assurances of his safety if extradited, saying she was swayed by evidence on the poor conditions in the jail be would be held in. Now De Brito is understood to have melted away into London, where he previously lived in a semi in Wembley. He remains on global most-wanted lists. De Brito is accused of being in a feud with rival William Pereira De Paiva since 2016 after surviving an attempt on his life. De Brito is accused of being in a feud with rival William Pereira De Paiva (pictured) since 2016 after surviving an attempt on his life When a close friend of De Brito was shot and left paraplegic in 2018, he named De Paiva as being behind the shooting (pictured: the car at the murder scene) Prosecutors told Westminster magistrates that De Brito began working with one of De Paiva's former henchmen, a teenager known as JR. When a close friend of De Brito was shot and left paraplegic in 2018, he named De Paiva as being behind the shooting. De Paiva was arrested but was set free the next year when De Brito is said to have arranged for JR to kill him. After jumping bail, De Brito is understood to have entered Britain as a tourist before overstaying illegally.

        "description": "InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stocks of these companies are marching higher on news that they delivered Q1 earnings that crushed analyst expectations.The post Q1 Superstars: 3 Stocks to Buy After Stellar Earnings appeared first on InvestorPlace.",
        "content": "We’re approaching the end of first quarter earnings season with 92% of companies listed in the benchmark S&P 500 index reporting results. By and large, it has been a strong period. In all, 78% of companies announced better-than-expected profits, and according to FactSet , 59% beat expectations with their sales. Many analysts are crediting the strong corporate earnings with reversing the stock market decline seen in April. While many companies came in ahead of Wall Street forecasts, a few delivered truly exceptional Q1 prints. Surging profits and record sales led some stocks to rise 10% or more in a single trading session. A few companies surprised analysts with results that were not as bad as feared. Others delivered their first financials as a publicly traded company. The positive surprises have helped to improve sentiment and the outlook among investors. Here are three Q1 superstars to buy after stellar earnings. Honda Motor (HMC) Japanese automaker Honda Motor (NYSE: HMC ) had a great print , announcing that its net profit increased 70% from a year earlier. The company is benefitting from a surge in gas-electric hybrid vehicle sales. Honda’s annual profit totaled $7 billion as sales rose nearly 21% during the fiscal year, which ended March 31. The company said weak sales in China were offset by strong sales in the U.S. Honda sold 2.8 million vehicles globally over the last year, up from 2.3 million in the previous fiscal year. Sales also rose in Honda’s home market of Japan and in Europe. Honda and other automakers have had success with hybrid vehicles , which are gaining popularity with consumers who have grown weary of fully-electric cars. Despite the strong results, Honda provided a downbeat outlook for the current fiscal year, saying it expects its profit to decline nearly 10%. Management said the decline in profit will not be due to slower vehicle sales but increased research and development (R&D) spending that should total $7.7 billion. Honda said it is reinvesting profits to secure its future competitiveness. HMC stock has gained 22% over the last 12 months. Robinhood Markets (HOOD) A boom in the trading of cryptocurrencies pushed Robinhood Markets (NASDAQ: HOOD ) to record Q1 financial results . The online brokerage announced earnings per share ( EPS ) of 18 cents on record revenue of $618 million. The results crushed Wall Street forecasts that called for earnings of 6 cents a share and revenue of $553 million. A year ago, Robinhood reported a loss of 57 cents per share on revenue of $441 million. The company attributed the strong results to a rise in crypto trading on its platform. Crypto boomed to start the year, with the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hitting an all-time high of just under $74,000 on March 14. Consequently, crypto transaction revenue at Robinhood more than tripled from a year earlier. Assets under custody increased 65% year-over-year to $129.6 billion due to higher stock and crypto valuations. More subscribers joined the Robinhood Gold service that provides investors with advanced tools and market data. The company reported 1.7 million Gold subscribers at the end of Q1, up 42% from a year ago. Robinhood’s share price has risen 86% in the past 12 months, making it a stock to buy on earnings results. Reddit (RDDT) Social media platform Reddit (NYSE: RDDT ) just reported its first financial results as a public company. The print was so good, it sent RDDT stock up more than 10%. Reddit held its initial public offering ( IPO ) in March of this year. Now, the company behind online message boards, has reported a loss per share of $8.19, which was not as bad as a loss of $8.71 which was expected among analysts. Reddit’s revenue totaled $243 million versus the $212.8 million that was expected on Wall Street. The still unprofitable company said its sales rose 48% from a year earlier. Reddit also reported $222.7 million in advertising revenue, up nearly 40% YOY. The company had 82.7 million daily active users at the end of Q1, almost a million more than the 76.6 million that had been forecast. Average revenue per user rose 8% to $2.94. Looking ahead , Reddit’s management team said they expect revenue of $240 million to $255 million for Q2, topping expectations of $224 million. RDDT stock is now 16% higher than where it closed during its first day of trading on March 21.

        "content": "The Chartered Risk Management Institute of Nigeria has conferred its fellowship on the Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Zenith Bank Plc, Ebenezer Onyeagwu. The certification was presented to Onyeagwu during a courtesy visit by executives of CRMI, led by the President and Chairman of Council, Dr Ezekiel Oseni, to Zenith Bank’s head office in Lagos recently. During the visit, Oseni commended Zenith Bank for its outstanding risk management practices and contributions to the broader financial community. “Looking at how far you have come, aside from the leadership over the years, we observed that your risk management function has been fantastic. Your risk management function is well established, and we see the quality of staff you have there. This is a testament to other banks and organisations that risk management is not a deal stopper, but a business enabler,” he enthused. In his response, Onyeagwu emphasised the critical importance of risk management across various sectors, advocating for mandatory CRMI membership for fintech companies, listed firms, the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, and its related enterprises. He said, “Risk management needs to be entrenched in every facet of organisational life. Every financial institution, technology organisation, and listed company should be institutional members of CRMI because risk management is not just for financial institutions.” He also stressed the need for enhanced risk management training, particularly in light of the increasing prevalence of digital fraud. Onyeagwu further proposed that the National Universities Commission introduce risk management as a course in higher institutions to build capacity in the niche profession. During the presentation of the fellowship certificate, Oseni noted, “This is not an honorary certificate; it is one that you have earned. We are proud to formally present it to you.” The Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System said that financial institutions lost about N17.67bn to financial fraud in 2023.",

        "description": "Marcus Rashford has announced his exit from social media in the wake of a dreadful season that saw him score just eight goals, though he did help Manchester United to win the FA Cup",
        "content": "Marcus Rashford has announced he is quitting social media in the wake of Manchester United 's win in the FA Cup final. Rashford played 74 minutes at Wembley on Saturday to help United beat fierce rivals Manchester City and lift the trophy. The attacker has endured a miserable season for the Red Devils, scoring just eight goals in all competitions. He has come under intense criticism for his performances, with some suggestions United could be open to selling him this summer. Given his wretched form, England boss Gareth Southgate also opted to leave Rashford out of his squad for Euro 2024. Now, the United star has revealed he will taking a break from social media at the start of the summer. As he announced the move, Rashford also took the chance to fire back at his critics. Anthony Martial confirms Man Utd exit after nine years with emotional message Man Utd and Arsenal eye wonderkid that team-mates claim is 'best they have seen' He tweeted: \"It's time to come off Socials for a few weeks. I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.\" Immediately after the final win, Rashford has posted a series of pictures to commit his future to United. First, he posted a photo from the pitch, with the caption reading: \"People want to know what Man United means to me!\" He then posted a picture from the dressing room holding up the trophy, with his caption reading: \"The winning team.\" Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo secured the win, with boss Erik ten Hag left delighted.

For us it was not about this, it was about proving a point after having such a bad year,\" he said. \"Every time we had to survive. The team showed so much resilience and I am so proud of them. Football is about winning trophies at the end of the day. I want to play the best football, attacking football, dynamic football. \"But in the end, you have to win games and trophies. That is the mentality we brought in and we had only one opportunity this season, in the FA Cup. I am very proud of the players and the staff because they did a fantastic job. \"I am proud as well, firstly of the players and the staff.

        "description": "In the market for new wheels? Here's how fast Razor's top-shelf model of Dirt Rocket youth bikes, the MX650, can go, and how much weight it can safely hold.",
        "content": "When you think of the Razor brand, you might think of those small metal kick-scooters you rode around on when you were a kid. If that's all you remember about Razor, though, you might want to look again. Over the last couple of decades, Razor has established quite a repertoire of kid-friendly conveyance for itself. It still deals in kick-scooters, of course, but it also offers skateboards, hoverboards, compact dirt bikes, and a big, heavy electric version of its iconic scooter . Razor also launched its classic scooter in a grown-up version , but for the most part, it specializes in kid-sized stuff. Although most of its products aren't something you could take out onto the open road, Razor's offerings are still pretty impressive even for kids. One particularly interesting entry into Razor's array of battery-powered vehicles is the Dirt Rocket series of dirt bikes, including the MX125 , MX350 , MX500 , and MX650 models. These battery-powered beasties are excellent for young bikers, with the higher-end model able to hit higher speeds and safely carry larger riders as well. The question is, though, exactly how much weight and speed are we talking about here? Each of the four bikes in the Dirt Rocket series can carry slightly different levels of weight, making the higher-grade ones better suited for larger, older riders. If you're thinking about getting one of these bikes as an exorbitant birthday present for your child, you should think carefully about how old they are and how much they weigh. If they're too big, the bike won't be able to function. The MX650 model has the highest weight limit of all of the bikes in the Dirt Rocket line. It is intended for ages 16 and up and can carry up to 220 lbs. According to Stanford Medicine , the average 18-year-old male weighs between 116 and 202 pounds, and the average female of the same age weighs between 100 and 178 pounds. So, this bike would be a good choice for a young adult who's interested in dirt biking but can't or doesn't want to drop the kind of cash necessary for a full-on dirt bike. Obviously, a kid-sized dirt bike isn't going to output the same level of speed as some of the best dual sport motorcycles for expert riders . It wouldn't be even remotely safe or legal. That said, the Dirt Rocket line can output a decent amount of speed, perfect for zooming around a modestly-sized backyard or across a dirt road. As the top-shelf model in the Dirt Rocket line, the MX650 goes up to 17 miles per hour, powered by a 650W variable speed motor. Thanks to its 36V onboard battery pack, the MX650 can operate for up to 40 minutes continuously. As a vehicle for older kids and young adults, the MX650 is designed to generate more torque and power for going up hills safely, something that might not be safer for younger, smaller riders. It would probably be best to operate one of these bikes on the same roads you would a pedal-powered bicycle.",

        "content": "Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been \"comprehensive and multifaceted\" efforts to combat antisemtisim. \"Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,\" Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia's president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a \"disgraceful\" attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. \"I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.\" Gertler said the school's senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university's faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the \"disgraceful historical practice\" of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. \"Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,\" Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, \"processes are ongoing.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024",

        "content": "A Colorado rancher feeding his cattle was struck to death by lightning along with 34 of his cows. Mike Morgan, 51, was giving his animals food from a trailer when the bolt hit him around 2pm on Saturday, said the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. Bystanders and first responders performed life-saving measures on Morgan but he was pronounced dead at the scene. ‘Our deepest condolences go out to family and friends during this difficult time,’ stated the sheriff’s office. The lightning hit an area of open pasture near the town of Rand as well as more than 100 head of cattle that were gathered around the trailer filled with hay, said the county coroner, George Crocket. ‘All but the 34 got up,’ Crocket said of the cattle. Morgan’s wife and father-in-law were close by at the time the bolt struck and survived, he added. Rand is located about 80 miles northwest of Denver. The death shocked the tight-knit community where neighbors all knew each other, Crockett said. Morgan was killed as powerful storms caused twisters, flooding and heavy winds in states including Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee and Texas, over Memorial Day Weekend. The storms have killed at least 21 people.

No deaths have been recorded in Jackson County from 1980 to 2021, which is the time frame that the National Weather Service ( NWS ) has tracked lightning deaths and injuries. Within Colorado, El Paso and Larimer counties had the most such deaths within those four decades. The CDC advises that residents avoid being near windows, porches, concrete, electrical equipment and water during thunderstorms. Meanwhile, the NWS advises staying inside, though people have also been struck while under shelter. Morgan’s died nearly a year after a public works worker hit by lightning on a soccer field in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, was saved by a cop who performed CPR on him.

        "description": "The federal Competition Bureau says it's going to look the domestic air travel industry in Canada, and it's looking for input from Canadians as it prepares for a study of that market over the coming months.",
        "content": "The federal Competition Bureau says it's going to look the domestic air travel industry in Canada, and it's looking for input from Canadians as it prepares to study the market in the coming months. The agency, which is tasked with enforcing competition law in Canada, said in a press release listing the reasons for its study that domestic airfare in Canada \"appears to be relatively high\" and that Canadians are filing more complaints about air travel recently. The bureau also noted that domestic air travel is \"concentrated\" with only two major airlines — Westjet and Air Canada — and that new airlines seem to have difficulties joining the industry here. \"What we're trying to do here is study how competition is working in the sector, really with a view to making recommendations to government,\" said deputy commission Anthony Durocher. \"Why this matters is because we know that competition means lower prices, more choice, more innovation.\" Public invited to comment The Competition Bureau has asked Canadians to weigh on the upcoming study's terms of reference, essentially requesting public comment on the scope or potential limitations of the upcoming study. The tentative, draft terms of reference mention that the bureau wants to answer questions, such as, \"How can policymakers further support airline entry and expansion?\" and, \"How can policymakers further support consumers when shopping for airfares?\" Competition could bring 'lower prices; for air travel in Canada, says the bureau, which will be looking at there are only two dominant players in the domestic market. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press) The public has until June 17, 2023, to submit feedback, after which the bureau will finalize terms of reference and officially launch the market study, which is planned to be completed by summer 2025. The report would make recommendations to government, but is not looking at any specific allegations of wrongdoing. Airport costs too high: Flair Air The Competition Bureau's draft for the study includes questions around whether Canadians would be willing to use \"secondary or more distant\" airports, but industry players point out one factor is they believe airport costs or rents in this country are too high, which is being passed on to customers. \"When you look at the cost of operating to a Canadian airport, relative to one in the US [or Europe], the airport fees are much higher here,\" said Garth Lund, chief commercial officer with Flair Airlines in Vancouver. \"The whole ecosystem in Canada is very expensive when it comes to aviation and airports are a big piece of that,\" said Lund, whose airline positions itself as a low-cost carrier. He called fees like that a \"main contributing factors to higher airfares.\" Defunct Lynx Air selling off life-jackets, oxygen masks in bid to recoup losses Flair Airlines CEO bullish on future of discount airlines. Others aren't so sure It's a message echoed by Westjet CEO Alexis von Hoensbroech, who told CBC Radio's The Calgary Eyeopener in an interview that \"the government should actually stop collecting rent from airports\" as one step toward addressing affordability. The Competition Bureau wants to hear from people in Canada on the terms of reference of its study, which will be released in summer 2025. (Sam Samson/CBC) However, in a post on X , formerly known as Twitter, federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry François-Philippe Champagne suggested that the Competition Bureau's market study be \"refined to focus on domestic passenger airline services rather than airport governance.\" The study's terms of reference would have to be approved by the minister, and in draft form say they will not evaluate airport governance except where it relates to competition for Canadian passenger services. Regulator using new powers The market study, which was first announced May 9, is the bureau's first since it gained new powers in December Q & A: WestJet CEO Alexis von Hoensbroech talks air travel costs and new reduced-fare category WestJet planning new fare category for travellers willing to forgo carry-on bag \"One of the important changes to our law, and it's something we've advocated for for quite some time, was the ability to compel information rather than just companies providing it to us voluntarily,\" said Durocher. \"Whether we're going to do it for this first study, I think remains to be determined.\" He expects the Competition Bureau will make that decision after the market study officially launches in the coming months.

Over the past 13 months, newer low-cost carriers Swoop and Lynx Air have disappeared from the skies and WestJet scooped up Sunwing Airlines, with the latter two making up 72 per cent of seat capacity from Western Canada last year, according to the bureau. In a statement emailed to CBC News, Westjet said, \"Air travel is essential to our country and we welcome interest from all groups,\" with regard to this study. Air Canada said it could not comment directly on today's announcement, as they are reviewing the draft.",

        "description": "The 55th annual World Series of Poker begins Tuesday at Horseshoe Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas, with 99 live bracelet events and 30 online events scheduled.",
        "content": "It’s tough to top a good poker rivalry, and two of the game’s bright young stars will go head-to-head all summer long at the World Series of Poker starting Tuesday. Jeremy Becker and Landon Tice are involved in a crossbook bet that will see the players compare their results at the end of the series. The one with the most money earned will win an additional sum. But this is also a battle between poker giants Daniel Negreanu and Matt Berkey. Negreanu has a staking deal with Becker, and it was his post on X listing potential WSOP matchups that started the wheels in motion on the bet. When Tice saw the post suggesting he and Becker would be a good pairing, Tice responded about an hour later suggesting a crossbook. Tice is backed by Berkey, and the terms of the bet were agreed on quickly. May also do a WSOP matchups freeroll and give people a chance to win some money by picking the right matchups. A few off the top of my head: @JonathanLittle @berkey11 @Jbex2417 @LandonTice @krissyb24poker @MariaHo Chidwick @Sdavies22 @luckychewy @NickSchulman ... — Daniel Negreanu (@RealKidPoker) February 16, 2024 Plenty of side action also has come in, with many of the biggest names in poker eager to take Becker or Tice. “We both got what we wanted,” Tice told WorldPokerTour.com in April. Here are five more things to watch this summer at the WSOP, which takes place at Horseshoe Las Vegas and Paris Las Vegas: 1. Main Event growth The $10,000 buy-in No-limit Hold’em World Championship drew a record field last year, topping 10,000 entrants for the first time. Will there be another surge, or was that the ceiling? The WSOP and online poker sites are running promotions and satellites for entries to the Main Event, which begins July 3 . And poker continues to see a spike in popularity globally, meaning another record is not out of the question. “Poker continues to grow organically throughout the world,” WSOP vice president Jack Effel said. “We’re expecting a record turnout. We’re planning for bigger than ever. We’re planning for better than ever.” 2. Lower buy-ins One of the most notable changes at the WSOP in recent years is the proliferation of more affordable tournaments on the schedule, such as the $300 buy-in Gladiators of Poker No-limit Hold’em. Whether it’s the $500 buy-in WSOP Kickoff No-limit Hold’em Freezeout that starts Wednesday or the $777 buy-in Lucky 7’s No-limit Hold’em the final week, there are tournaments running all summer that cost less than a ticket to an Adele show at Caesars Palace. For those with a more modest bankroll, there are five tournaments from June 25 to July 3 ranging in buy-ins from $400 (Colossus No-limit Hold’em) to $800 (Independence Day Celebration No-limit Hold’em). 3. Negreanu’s slump While many of Negreanu’s contemporaries continue to earn gold bracelets for WSOP victories, the popular pro remains stuck on six for his career. Is this the summer the Las Vegas resident finally ends the drought? Negreanu has had success on the PokerGO Tour recently, including a victory at the Pot-limit Omaha series in March for $147,500 after a first-place finish in January. But his last bracelet came at the 2013 WSOP Europe, and he hasn’t won an event at the WSOP in Las Vegas since 2008. Expect Negreanu to play a lighter schedule than usual. If he makes a final table, expect a large crowd at the Horseshoe to see if he can finally bring No. 7 home. 4. What’s in the box? No format has gained more popularity in recent years than bounty tournaments, which give players the chance to win large prizes for knocking out an opponent without needing to make the final table. This year has no less than seven on the schedule and is highlighted by the return of the $1,000 buy-in Mystery Millions No-limit Hold’em event with a guaranteed $1 million for the top bounty. The $1,000 buy-in Mystery Bounty Pot-limit Omaha tournament is a new addition. Other bounty events of note include the $10,000 buy-in Mystery Bounty No-limit Hold’em and the $10,000 buy-in Super Turbo Bounty No-limit Hold’em Freezeout. 5. Online bracelets After announcing it was combining the online player pools in Nevada, Michigan and New Jersey into one network, the WSOP Online bracelet event schedule was released Saturday. There are 30 tournaments starting Saturday, including five high rollers. There will be gold bracelets up for grabs every Tuesday, Saturday and Sunday of the series with the $10,000 buy-in WSOP Online Championship main event set for July 11. The new WSOP software allows for Pot-limit Omaha events, multitabling, mystery bounty tournaments and multi-flight re-entry events. Contact David Schoen at dschoen@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5203.

        "description": "Arne Slot is already getting plans in place ahead of his first transfer window as Liverpool boss but club scouts already appear to have altered the Reds’ first move of the summer",
        "content": "Liverpool are set to make a move for Atalanta midfielder Ederson after being left impressed when scouting another star. The Reds are heading into their first summer under the control of Arne Slot this year and could do with midfield recruits following the exit of Thiago Alcantara . Slot’s compatriot Teun Koopmeiners was previously thought to be among their targets this summer, but plans appear to have changed following a scouting mission in Italy. According to Tuttosport , the Reds watched the Dutch midfielder in action for Atalanta. While they were there, they noticed one of his teammates, Ederson. It is reported that they were left impressed by his performance and are ‘now planning an attack’ for his signature. Ederson, 24, is a Brazilian international. He joined Atalanta from Salernitana in July 2022. The defensive midfielder has gone on to make 89 appearances in all competitions since and helped the Italian side to the Europa League title this season. Transfer news live - Chelsea in 'advanced' Maresca talks, Man Utd deal confirmed Ex-Liverpool ace Philippe Coutinho in 'advanced talks' to rejoin old club Ederson has three years left on his contract with Atalanta. Should Liverpool make a move, it could see the Reds end their interest in Koopmeiners. The Dutchman has been linked with a move to Anfield in the past. Serie A side Juventus are also credited with an interest and could swoop should they face little competition. Koopmeiners’ agent has admitted that interest in his client is only natural given his form. Speaking to CalcioMercato, Bart Baving said: \"Let's see. Liverpool are interested Ederson after scouting Teun Koopmeiners ( Image: Getty Images) Who should Liverpool sign this summer? Share your suggestions in the comments below “Teun is having a fantastic season, he has scored many beautiful and important goals, moreover he is a footballer with a constant performance, so it would be strange if other clubs didn't follow him. \"We know how football works. For now he is very happy to have won the Europa League with Atalanta, and he will focus on finishing Serie A well, given that Atalanta can still finish third and then on the European Championship. That's all I can say for now.\" Meanwhile, Koopmeiners failed to rule out a summer transfer away from Atalanta. “I’m only happy to enjoy this title with the fans, I’m focused on celebrating,” he told told Sky Italia after winning the Europa League. “Next season? I don’t know. We will see.” While the Reds are keen to add to their midfield ahead of next season, they might also be forced into the market for a new winger. Colombian winger Luis Diaz has been linked with a move to Spanish giants Barcelona. Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of a May 18 game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty in New York. Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark drives to the basket against New York Liberty forward Betnijah Laney-Hamilton during the first half of a May 18 game in New York. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More? Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.

        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of a May 18 game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty in New York. Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark drives to the basket against New York Liberty forward Betnijah Laney-Hamilton during the first half of a May 18 game in New York. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More? Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.

        "description": "Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s losing predicament, coming off a UConn career where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games in college.",
        "content": "NEW YORK — Sue Bird can relate to Caitlin Clark’s early frustrations about losing in the WNBA. But Bird knows from experience how things could change for the much-talked about rookie. Now 43, Bird came out of UConn where she won two NCAA titles and only lost four games. Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader. Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft — 22 years apart — and landed on last-place teams. Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center. Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners. Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will “dramatically” change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster. Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000. The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State’s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year. Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women’s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity: Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of a May 18 game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty in New York. Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League? Bird: If I’m being honest, we’ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it’s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you’re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there’s a soft cap — now we’re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year — so by 2026, it could be dramatically different. What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League? Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas. Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark drives to the basket against New York Liberty forward Betnijah Laney-Hamilton during the first half of a May 18 game in New York. Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes? Bird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out — the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it’s just growing pains. I’m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world — the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There’s a popularity and you’re connecting with a brand. There’s no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way. You’ve done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career? Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It’s nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that’s exactly what we’d be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We’re trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport. What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More? Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don’t get it — women, women of color. They’re so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women’s sports. We’ve adapted a book “Cleat Cute,” it’s an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.

        "content": "Parents' nightmare after doctor mistook rare bruise condition for abuse and called in social workers to take away daughter Robyn Parker-Briggs suffers from a condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome By Chris Brooke and Victoria Williams Published: 21:44, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:45, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments A couple were told to hand over their children to social services after a doctor mistook their baby daughter's bruise for a sign of abuse during a 'three-minute consultation'. Little Robyn Parker-Briggs suffers from an extremely rare condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) which causes her fragile skin to bruise and burst open at the slightest touch. The two-year-old has been in and out of hospital since birth and has been cared for by devoted parents Louise Parker and Mark Briggs, who have given up work to look after her. But the parents were thrown into a nightmare lasting three months when they were reported to social services after a routine hospital visit. Ms Parker, 39, said the doctor, who had been called in to examine Robyn by a fellow medic, looked at the bruising and slight swelling behind her ear and stated: 'We are getting social services involved.' Robyn was nine months old at the time. Ms Parker, from South Shields, said: 'I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I always carry Robyn's extensive medical notes with me, but the doctor wasn't interested in looking at them. Louise Parker (right) was ordered to hand over her children to social services after a doctor wrongly accused her of abusing her poorly daughter Robyn Parker-Briggs (left) Robyn suffers from an extremely rare condition called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) which causes her fragile skin to bruise and burst open at the slightest touch 'The doctor made a snap decision that changed our lives for ever.' The property sales adviser along with Mr Briggs, 43, a warehouse worker, refused to hand over Robyn and her brother Mason, then aged three. But they were forbidden from being alone with their children and had to move in with relatives. South Tyneside Council only dropped the case when Robyn was given a diagnosis of EDS by specialists. The toddler's variant is so rare and extreme that medics are still learning how to deal with it, and she cannot even wear shoes for fear of damaging her feet. Ms Parker said: 'All the doctors who had treated Robyn since birth and knew our family understood how wrong this was. They tried their best to stop this happening. They pushed for extra tests...to get answers we all hoped would end this nightmare.' The ordeal began in July 2022 after Ms Parker noticed swelling behind her daughter's ear, and feared she may have been stung by an insect. She took her to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where Robyn had been treated since birth but had not received a formal EDS diagnosis. The parents were thrown into a nightmare lasting three months when they were reported to social services after a routine hospital visit They were discharged after four days of tests and scans to check for signs of abuse, but they could not return home alone. At that point a social worker told them to hand over the children until the conclusion of court proceedings. The couple refused and fought the demand, though they were warned against this. Ms Parker said: 'There was no chance I was going to allow them to take away my children. Not even for a day.' The family was subjected to detailed checks until the ordeal was ended by the formal diagnosis. Ms Parker said: 'You'd imagine I would feel a sense of relief, but I don't. I feel angry and traumatised.' Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals Foundation Trust said: 'We are very sorry to hear of the distress this family has experienced. If they would like to raise any issues about their child's care, we would encourage them to get in touch.' South Tyneside Council added: 'We appreciate the distress such proceedings may cause any family but take our safeguarding responsibilities extremely seriously.'

        "content": "Pope Francis shocks bishops by allegedly saying gay men should not be admitted to church seminaries because 'there's already too much f*****ry' Bishops told Italian media the comments were met with 'incredulous laughter' By Elena Salvoni Published: 21:40, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:44, 27 May 2024 e-mail 4 View comments Pope Francis has allegedly shocked bishops in Italy by using an offensive slur when saying that homosexual men should not be admitted to church seminaries because there is already 'too much' gay sexual activity. The pontiff told an episcopal conference at the Vatican that homosexual men should not be allowed into colleges to train for the priesthood, Italian media reports. Bishops at the meeting were reportedly taken aback by the language he used to make this statement - the derogatory word 'frociaggine', which roughly translates to f*****ry. The remark was met with 'incredulous laughter', bishops told newspaper Corriere della Sera. They suggested that it was an honest mistake by the Pope, for whom Italian is a second language, and that he did not know how offensive the word was. The alleged comments, which seem to go against recent moves to amend seminary admission rules, have come as a surprise to some in the church as Francis is known for taking a more liberal view than his predecessors on LGBT rights. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past When asked about his views on homosexuality in 2013, he famously said: 'If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?' Last year, he described laws that criminalise homosexuality as a 'sin' and an 'injustice', and allowed Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples in a significant advance for LGBT rights in the church. The reports about the closed-door meeting on May 20 come after bishops approved a document regulating admission to Italian seminaries, according to Corriere. The paper reported that members 'approved by majority vote an amendment that recognized the distinction between simple homosexual orientation and 'deeply rooted tendencies.' This, it suggests, means 'in substance, that a homosexual person could be admitted to the seminary if, like the heterosexual, he gave the guarantee that he knows how to live the discipline of celibacy.' However, it reportedly implies 'that it is more difficult for homosexuals because they will be living in an all-male community for many years.' Francis' latest remarks suggest he is taking 'a more radical' view on the issue, by preventing gay men from being allowed to join altogether. The Holy See has not approved the document, according to reports, and the issue is still under discussion. The comments were allegedly made in a closed-door meeting ahead of the conference. Pictured: The opening session of the 79th general assembly of the Italian Bishops Conference The 2005 Vatican document, which was endorsed by Francis in 2016, states that the Church 'cannot admit to the seminary or to holy orders those who practice homosexuality, present deep-seated homosexual tendencies or support the so-called \"gay culture.\"' There is so far no official record of the Pope's latest comments on the issue. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Francis' first language is Spanish, and though he is fluent in Italian he has made a number of linguistic faux pas in the past. He has previously said that if a boy is unsure about his sexuality and is facing mental health challenges he might need 'psychiatric' support. It widely believed he instead meant 'psychological' help, words he has also confused on other occasions.

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "description": "Notre Dame pummeled Maryland, 15-5, in Philadelphia to win its second straight NCAA Division I men's lacrosse national championship.",
        "content": "PHILADELPHIA — Charged with trying to derail the juggernaut in men’s lacrosse this spring, Maryland’s bid to play roadblock devolved into being more of a speed bump. Defying a scheduled start delayed by inclement weather, the No. 7 seed Terps raced to an early two-goal lead but couldn’t keep up with top-seeded Notre Dame, which confirmed its reputation as the season’s most imposing team and captured its second consecutive national championship with a 15-5 thrashing in the NCAA Tournament final Monday afternoon before an announced 31,479 at Lincoln Financial Field. The crowd was the largest for the title game since 2019 when 31,528 watched Virginia outlast Yale, 13-9, also at Lincoln Financial Field. The attendance for the three-day championship weekend was 80,898. Senior midfielder Eric Malever totaled one goal and two assists, but Maryland (11-6) fell well short of its first NCAA title since 2022 and fifth overall. The program dropped to 4-13 in the tournament final overall and 2-6 under coach John Tillman. The Fighting Irish (16-1) wrapped up their season on a 14-game winning streak that began with a 14-9 victory over the Terps on March 3. Notre Dame, which had not lost since Feb. 25 when Georgetown pulled off an 11-10 overtime stunner in South Bend, Indiana, became the seventh team to repeat as national champions, joining Johns Hopkins in 1978-79 and 1984-85, Syracuse in 1988-89 and 2008-09, Princeton in 1996-98 and Duke in 2013-14. Senior attackman Chris Kavanagh scored five goals and graduate student attackman and older brother Pat forged a game-high six points, all on assists, for Notre Dame, which scored at least 10 goals in every contest this spring. Pat Kavanagh broke the school’s NCAA Tournament single-game record for assists while Chris tied the mark in goals. Despite a 17-for-24, six-ground ball performance by graduate student faceoff specialist Luke Wierman, Maryland had few remedies for Notre Dame’s relentless play in seemingly every facet. The Terps scored the fewest goals in a title game since 2015 when they dropped a 10-5 decision to Denver, committed 11 of their 16 turnovers by midway through the second quarter, went almost 20 minutes in the first half without a goal, and didn’t get a save from graduate student goalkeeper Logan McNaney until 93 seconds had elapsed in the third quarter. Although McNaney stopped 10 shots, his early struggles were a drastic departure from his Fighting Irish counterpart Liam Entenmann, the graduate student who rebounded from giving up two quick goals to finish with 16 saves. And as effective as the Kavanagh brothers were, the offense got a significant lift from its second midfield of sophomore Max Busenkell (one goal and two assists), junior Will Angrick (one goal and one assist) and graduate student Reilly Gray (one goal). Those contributions, as well as goals from juniors Jalen Seymour and Fisher Finley of the third midfield line, propelled Notre Dame despite appearing to mirror a long weather delay that pushed the game’s start time from noon to 2:10 p.m. The time had been adjusted Sunday afternoon from its original schedule of 1 p.m. in anticipation of severe thunderstorms and lightning. The delay did not seem to affect Maryland, which got a goal from senior midfielder Ryan Siracusa off a pass by Malever just 34 seconds into the game. Siracusa returned the favor by giving the ball to senior attackman Daniel Kelly (Calvert Hall) for a rip from the high slot that extended the team’s lead to 2-0 less than four minutes in. Notre Dame shook off any lethargy when Angrick collected a feed from Busenkell and scored from the slot a minute later. And less than a minute after that, the Fighting Irish pounced on a breakdown by the Terps defense that left graduate student attackman Jake Taylor wide-open in the slot to receive a pass from Pat Kavanagh and score. Busenkell gave Notre Dame its first lead of the afternoon with a well-placed shot from a sharp angle left of the cage to the top right corner of the net midway through the high-scoring first frame. But Maryland evened the score at 3 just 11 seconds later when senior midfielder Jack Koras caught a pass from graduate student attackman Daniel Maltz and fired a jump shot from the left point. That’s when the Fighting Irish imposed its will. They scored seven straight goals over a 17:40 stretch bridging the first two quarters. The run included three consecutive goals by Chris Kavanagh and three assists by Pat Kavanagh. Malever ended a 19:51 Terps scoring drought when he converted a skip pass by Koras for an extra-man goal with 1:15 left in the second quarter. Even that tally had to withstand a challenge by Notre Dame coach Kevin Corrigan that was eventually denied by officials before Maryland players and fans could release a sigh of relief. Armed with a 10-4 lead, the Fighting Irish opened the third quarter with three straight goals — including two by Chris Kavanagh — to extinguish any hopes of a Terps comeback.

        "content": "Police say they’ve identified a suspect sought in connection with a central Hamilton, Ont., shooting in mid-May that saw two men and a driver exchange fire. The gunfight , which happened on May 13 around 5 p.m. near Barton Street East and Kinrade Avenue, was featured in a press conference last week highlighting an uptick in gun violence across the city. Chief Frank Bergen characterized the recent spate of brazen daytime gunfights as “alarming” and “not acceptable.” The footage showed a youngster walking down an alleyway moments before two men and a driver exchanged fire. “If that’s not alarming, then I don’t know what it is,” Bergen commented. “Moments before these punks thought it was a good idea to target another gangster, ... you saw a five-year-old walking down that alleyway coming home from school.” Story continues below advertisement The Nissan sedan involved struck two other vehicles before the driver jumped out and fled down Gibson Avenue. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. There were no reported injuries. Police have identified the driver as a 25-year-old Hamilton man who now faces 10 charges including possession of a prohibited firearm and failure to stop after an accident. UPDATE: Kinrade Avenue shooting in #HamOnt .

        "description": "Edmonton-born comedy legend in town to receive award at Grow Up Conference",
        "content": "Tommy Chong may be the OG of potheads, but these days the 86-year-old gets his cannabis from edibles. “I was never a heavy smoker,” said the Edmonton-born Chong, in town to collect a cannabis industry award at the Grow Up Conference and Expo taking place from Monday to Wednesday at the Delta By Marriott Toronto Airport Convention Centre. “The (Cheech and Chong) movies (of the 1970s and onward) showed me with a big, old joint, but there was no inhaling.” In fact, Chong’s more recent time behind bars lead to him quitting smoking weed entirely. “When I got in trouble with the law (for selling bongs online), I had to quit smoking — it’s called pretrial probation — and then I did nine months in jail (between 2003 and 2004) and then I was on probation for a year after that, so I did three years without any cannabis.” Following that, Chong battled both prostate and rectal cancer. “I’m a medical miracle,” said Chong. I asked him: What, then, contributes to his longevity? “My gorgeous wife,” he joked. “I stay in shape chasing after her.” More seriously, he said: “I got into bodybuilding in the ’50s. And I’ve been an avid bodybuilder, still am, all my life. And that included diet, that included lifestyle. So in spite of my movies, I’m really a boring, healthy guy.” Chong is the curator for Tommy’s Craft, a cannabis brand run by family members that is sold in Alberta, Manitoba and Newfoundland, and he is getting the Tommy Chong’s Legends of Cannabis Award at the Grow Up Conference. “It’s a ticket that says I don’t have to go to jail,” he joked. Chong, who claims not to know much about the laws surrounding the 2018 Canadian legalization of recreational cannabis, is nonetheless thrilled it happened. “That phrase it took too long, it doesn’t work,” he said. “Cause we’re only in the now. Right now, we’re in a nice position.” And he’s not surprised that a recent Canadian report said 30% of people in our country still get their pot from their dealer instead of government stores. “Of course!” said Chong. “You don’t need this expensive packaging that keeps kids — and old guys like me — from opening it.” Chong feels similarly about a 2022 study published in the New York Times , saying more Americans imbibe in cannabis daily than alcohol. “It makes me feel good,” he said, adding: “I’m 86 years old. I can still dance. I can still play golf. I can still do lots of things and a lot of it has to do with my involvement with the cannabis plant. ” Chong, who teamed up with Mexican-American Cheech Marin in Vancouver in the early ’70s to form the comedy duo Cheech and Chong, most recently toured across Canada with his old partner in 2019 until Marin’s “knees gave out. “We had a nice time,” said Chong, who is planning on touring again with wife and Vancouver native Shelby Fiddis. “Cheech loves Canada. Well, you know, he was a landed immigrant during the Vietnam War.” Still, a new documentary about the comedy team called Cheech and Chong’s Last Movie is coming from his daughter Robbi Chong and producer Dave Bushell ( Sling Blade , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. ) “It’s looking for a home,” said Chong. “Right now, we’re trying to figure out how to distribute it.”",

        "content": "BARTOW, Fla. (WFLA) — This historic mansion in Polk County is said to be a tribute to a man who constructed the home without any blueprints. The Wonder House was considered a popular tourist destination and attraction from the 1930s to the 1960s. The four-story gem was built by Conrad Schuck, from Pennsylvania, in 1926. “People come in and appreciate a little bit of history and see a little bit about the architecture around the house. I think that’s the coolest aspect,” Wonder House Manager Krislin Kreis said. The home is now used as a private residence by Kreis, who offers tours to visitors when her schedule allows. “My intention is to be able to do tours, to share the house with people, to share the story of Conrad and his family, to see the architecture and engineering that he was able to put into a home,” she explained. Some of the unique features added by Schuck were laundry systems and air conditioning. “A twenty-one square foot lazy Susan kitchen cabinet, wall panels that you could switch out in the ceilings,” Kreis added. Kreis said she is working on renovating and restoring some of the rooms and the moat that is outside. “It’s very special that we’re able to preserve a piece of our history here in Polk County,” The Wonder House offers guided tours that last about an hour and a half. Admission is $25 for adults and $10 for children. Click here to book.",

        "content": "Megastar Amitabh Bachchan wowed the audience with his on-screen persona and acting prowess in the 1999 Hindi family drama Sooryavansham , evoking every emotion in the process. Aside from the talented ensemble, there was one more star whose strong performance and versatility kept moviegoers captivated during the entire screen time. He is actor Ananda Vardhan , who starred in the EVV Satyanarayana film as Amitabh Bachchan’s son Chhote Thakur Bhanupratap Singh a.k.a. Sonu. Now, after twenty years, are you curious about that young artist's current look? One of the numerous child artists that moviegoers cherish is Ananda Vardhan. The actor made his acting debut with the Telugu film ‘Priyaragalu’ in 1997. Ananda featured in over five Telugu movies prior to her role in ‘Sooryanvansham’. Today, the actor has grown up to become a well-known figure in the Telugu film industry . Interestingly, he is the grandson of famous playback singer PB Srinivas. He started out as a young artist and has since grown into a well-known South star. He is quite active on social media. He played the roles of Bala Hanuman and Valmiki in the ‘Ramayanam’ movie when he was four years old. He made his feature film debut as a child actor in ‘Priyaragalu’ alongside Jagapathi Babu and Soundarya. Notable roles followed in hit films like ‘Manasantha Nuvve’ and ‘Preminchukundam Raa’.

        "content": "The flight had on board people that were headed to Nigeria from the U.S., and a few other European countries via Istanbul. Less than two hours into the flight, the announcement that unsettled a lot of us was made. ‘‘Is there a medical doctor on board this flight? Any medical doctor on board this flight, please come forward, we have an emergency’’. Immediately, a man stood up and headed to the scene of the ‘‘emergency’’. It was not until a young lady (who seemed to be in her twenties) and another middle-aged lady approached the scene and got hands-on that I realised the man who got to the scene first probably went there to LOOK at what was happening. As the two ladies battled to stabilise the man, some other passengers on the flight began to approach the scene of the emergency cautiously. Some would mutter a word of encouragement and others...a nod of support. I settled for silently praying for the passenger but I had begun to have a headache! What was clear though is that from the time of that announcement, the atmosphere in that flight became unsettled. Perhaps, what was going on was a reminder of our humanness to most of us. And the rude realisation that it could have been any of us made some of us in that flight restless and people did what they could to show support. The experience is best described as one of those moments when life is whispering ‘‘I hope you realise this could be you’’ Thankfully, the young man was stabilised and most people went back to their seats. He was placed on an IV drip. And the older lady that helped stabilise him kept going to check on him from time to time. The male cabin crew also dutifully kept an eye on him. I must admit that as I watched the two ladies bring their professional training to bear on the situation, I felt a sense of pride at being a woman and muttered ‘‘dear daughter, please try to study a course that is worthwhile in school...if only for moments like this, when you have to be there for humanity”. I think it’s high time Airlines began to give a discounts to medical professionals because when ‘‘emergencies’’ arise in the sky, these people selflessly rise to the occasion. When we landed and began to disembark, I made sure that I got close enough to the passenger and said to him ‘’God be your strength’’. And he nodded. It turned out that he was the tall, slim, and dark young man, who was wheeled into the aircraft when we were boarding, This next encounter happened in church! Sometimes when my soul is troubled, I walk into the church (usually empty), kneel at the altar to pray and I feel calm, afterward. So, on this particular day when I turned around to leave, I caught sight of a lady (kneeling in between the pews) ...her eyes were closed but she was crying and wiping her tears. Then, I remembered the man who was lying down before the altar when I walked in. I looked around and saw two or three others, kneeling or sitting...heads bowed. And I muttered “Ije uwa’’ (the journey of life)! As you are embarking on your honeymoon, someone is receiving a sack letter/quit notice. The news of a newborn in one household versus a tense atmosphere in another...thanks to an unpleasant health report. A marriage that someone has so much hope for is crumbling before their very eyes while another is awash with the excitement of a dream come true. Someone is popping champagne over a new car while another has just buried a loved one. I have lost count of how many times I was taking a leisurely walk overseas and a wailing ambulance would speed by...leaving you praying for the best outcome in whatever the situation is. It’s all life and her endless circles! One of the reasons it’s not good to attack another’s belief system is that it could just be their coping mechanism. As long as their idea of “knowing God” has a human face, I don’t judge people’s faith, because, you don’t know what’s still holding them up. A habit that I have picked up is just saying a prayer for people who may be going through a challenging phase, now and then. You don’t need to know people to keep them in your prayers. It could be someone you read their story in the media. What you do at that moment is to spare a minute or two and say a prayer for them. Prayer cleanses the soul but every prayer you say does not always have to be for you and yours, alone.",

Clarkson has long been a fan of the Alfa Romeo brand, and even once said: “You cannot be a true petrolhead until you've owned an Alfa.\" 5 The Alfa Romeo Brera is a big favourite of Jeremy Clarkson Credit: Getty 5 It's stunning design has made it popular with petrolheads Credit: Getty 5 Clarkson once even described it as \"the best-looking car that money can buy.\" Credit: AP That's particularly true about the Alfa Romeo Brera, which he gushed over on a 2006 episode of Top Gear. The Italian set of wheels, which ran from 2005 to 2010, was the brain-child of much-heralded car designer Giorgetto Giugiaro - who also worked on other beautiful motors such as the Maserati Merak, Lotus Esprit, and even the iconic DMC Delorean. The Brera was made available in two petrol modes, a 2.2-litre and a 3.2-litre V6 - capable of 256 bhp. A diesel version was made, too. But it's the motor's stunning looks that's the real selling point, along with its wonderful interior styling and even its decent luggage space. Loosely considered a crossover between a hatchback and a coupe, the Brera's long bonnet and short, low back gave it an unusual and sporty image, coupled with the sleek triangular grille coupled with three round headlamps on each side. On the Top Gear episode, Clarkson said: “We think it may very well be the best-looking car that money can buy.\" And Richard Hammond added: \"It's just gorgeous from every angle.” Most read in Motors BALOGUN'S BACK Rangers star Leon Balogun signs new one-year contract GER HUNGARY Rangers 'in advanced talks' to sign winger who helped shock Real Madrid TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate The motoring guru even scoffed when a member of the audience suggested the Aston Martin Vanquish was better looking.

        "content": "A STUNNING motor that Jeremy Clarkson once described as the \"best-looking car money can buy\" could be yours for just £6,000 second-hand. Clarkson has long been a fan of the Alfa Romeo brand, and even once said: “You cannot be a true petrolhead until you've owned an Alfa.\" That's particularly true about the Alfa Romeo Brera, which he gushed over on a 2006 episode of Top Gear . The Italian set of wheels, which ran from 2005 to 2010, was the brain-child of much-heralded car designer Giorgetto Giugiaro - who also worked on other beautiful motors such as the Maserati Merak, Lotus Esprit, and even the iconic DMC Delorean. The Brera was made available in two petrol modes, a 2.2-litre and a 3.2-litre V6 - capable of 256 bhp. A diesel version was made, too. But it's the motor's stunning looks that's the real selling point, along with its wonderful interior styling and even its decent luggage space. Loosely considered a crossover between a hatchback and a coupe, the Brera's long bonnet and short, low back gave it an unusual and sporty image, coupled with the sleek triangular grille coupled with three round headlamps on each side. On the Top Gear episode, Clarkson said: “We think it may very well be the best-looking car that money can buy.\" And Richard Hammond added: \"It's just gorgeous from every angle.” The motoring guru even scoffed when a member of the audience suggested the Aston Martin Vanquish was better looking. Even its name exudes class and style, with Brera being a district of Milan where art, history , and fashion meet. Nowadays, the Brera can be picked up for a reasonable price, with a 3.2-litre JTS V6 example from 2009 available for less than £6,000 . If you're looking for something much newer, then Sun Motors' main man Rob Gill recently took the eye-catching Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio for a test drive - which he described as \"beyond brilliant\" with a price tag that's \"an absolute bargain.\" Alfa Romeo also made the news in bizarre fashion last month when they were forced to change the name of their newewst EV after it broke an obscure piece of legislation.",

        "description": "Drew Brees accounts for four of the top 10 passing-yardage seasons in NFL history.",
        "content": "Only 15 times in history has a quarterback thrown for 5,000 yards in a single season. Unsurprisingly, all but one has occurred since the turn of the century as offenses have emphasized the passing game in recent years. When legendary quarterback threw for 5,084 yards in 1984, he became the first NFL quarterback to hit the 5,000-yard milestone. Today, however, that season doesn't even rank in the top 10 all-time as it pertains to passing yardage. So, who exactly does crack the top 10? Let's take a look. When arrived to play for the in 2012, nobody knew what to expect, as he'd missed the entire 2011 season with a neck injury after spending the first 13 years of his Hall of Fame career with the . After an outstanding first season with the Broncos, Manning continued to show he still had what it took to be an elite quarterback. In 2013, Manning led the league with 5,477 passing yards and 55 touchdown passes, setting new NFL records in both categories. The Broncos also became the first NFL team to score more than 600 points in a season, putting up 605. At one point during the season, Manning, who won his record fifth NFL MVP award, threw for 403 yards with five touchdown passes in a win over the and then came right back with 397 passing yards and threw four more touchdown passes in a win over the . In the final week of the 2011 season, quarterback set numerous league records, including the most passing yards in a single season, finishing the year with 5,476 yards, a record that stood until Manning broke it by a single yard two years later. Brees had one heck of a season in 2011. Not only did he lead all quarterbacks in passing yards, but he was also tops in completions (468), completion percentage (71.2%), and touchdown passes (46). While he was named Offensive Player of the Year, he failed to win NFL MVP, finishing second to . It was the third straight season in which Brees was the NFL's best in completion percentage. It was also the third time in his career that he led the NFL in passing yards and touchdown passes. After 20 seasons with the , proved he wasn't finished when he signed with the ahead of the 2020 season. Brady, who won , led the Bucs to a in his first year with the team and then put together one of the best statistical seasons of his Hall of Fame career in year two. In 2021, TB12 threw for an NFL-best and career-high 5,316 yards and also led the league with 43 touchdown passes, also leading the league with 485 completions and 719 passing attempts. In just three seasons with the Buccaneers, Brady racked up 14,643 passing yards, good for third on the franchise's all-time list. Three Super Bowls in his first six full seasons as the starting quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs solidified as the . An athletic quarterback with a strong arm and pinpoint accuracy, Mahomes has already put up some ridiculous numbers, some of which helped him earn the second NFL MVP award of his young career during the 2022 season. The Texas Tech alum led the Chiefs to a 14-3 record and led all quarterbacks with 5,250 passing yards, also leading all signal-callers with 41 touchdown passes. Mahomes earned his fifth straight Pro Bowl selection and was named an All-Pro for the third time in his career. Brady obviously had plenty of outstanding seasons with the Patriots, but his 2011 season, which often goes overlooked, was arguably one of the greatest of his career. Brady started all 16 games, going 13-3, and put up his only 5,000-yard passing season in New England, finishing with a then-career-best 5,235 yards. He also tossed 39 touchdowns and completed 65.6% of his passes. Brady set the tone early in the season by throwing for a career-high 517 yards and adding four touchdown passes in a win over the Miami Dolphins. In the final game of the regular season, he became just the fourth player in NFL history to throw for better than 5,000 yards in a season. Brees was the perfect fit in the Saints' pass-happy offense under head coach Sean Payton. And in his 11th season with the team in 2016, he continued to light it up. After having already led the NFL in passing yardage six times, Brees made it a seventh in 2016. The former Purdue star threw the ball a league-leading 673 times and piled up 5,208 passing yards, but he went just 7-9. While the win-loss record wasn't good in '16, Brees certainly was, completing 70% of his passes. Oddly enough, that was not one of the six seasons in which he led the league in completion percentage. He opened the season with a 423-yard game, including a 98-yard TD pass to Brandin Cooks. In Week 6, he threw for 465 yards, setting a record for the most 400-yard games in an NFL career. He also became the sixth player in league history to record 50,000 passing yards with one team. Brees had yet another 5,000-plus-yard season with the Saints in 2012, but New Orleans finished with another 7-9 record. In 2012, Brees finished with a league-best 5,177 yards and also topped the NFL with 43 touchdown passes. His 19 interceptions were also the most by any quarterback. It was a tough year for the Saints, who had to play without Payton, who was suspended for the year for his role in the infamous Bountygate scandal. Despite the season-long distraction, Brees continued to put up big numbers and made what was then his fifth straight Pro Bowl. Brees clearly is no stranger to this list. He eclipsed the 5,000-yard passing mark in a season five times in his career and, as mentioned, led the league in passing seven times. He followed his impressive 2012 campaign with another strong season in 2013 when he racked up a league-high 5,162 yards. He also threw for 39 touchdown passes, leading the Saints to an 11-5 record. In Week 14, he became the fastest quarterback to reach 50,000 passing yards in his career during a win over the , also throwing four touchdown passes in that game. Brees was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week three times in 2013. While put up big numbers throughout his NFL career, it took him 15 years with the before he hit the 5,000-yard passing mark. Big Ben came close in 2014 when he led the NFL in passing with 4,952 yards. In 2018, he finally hit the milestone when he finished with a league-leading 5,129 yards. He also tossed 34 touchdown passes but also recorded an NFL-worst 19 interceptions. For the first time in his career, Roethlisberger topped all quarterbacks in passing attempts (675) and completions (452). In Week 2, he threw for 453 yards and three touchdowns in a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. In Week 12, he had a season-high 462 yards in a loss to the Denver Broncos. Despite the big numbers, Roethlisberger's streak of four straight Pro Bowl seasons came to an end in 2018. played the first five years of his NFL career with the Buccaneers and had his best statistical season in his final year with the club in 2019. Winston, the in the 2015 NFL Draft, threw a league-leading 626 passes in 2019 and led the NFL with 5,109 passing yards. He threw a career-high 33 touchdown passes, but his 30 interceptions were the most in the league and made him the only quarterback in league history to throw 30 TDs and 30 picks in the same season. In 2019, Winston broke several Bucs records, including passing yards and passing attempts. He also became the first quarterback in franchise history to throw 100 touchdown passes in his career. In a Week 15 win over the Detroit Lions, Winston had 458 passing yards and threw four touchdowns. Winston left the Bucs after the season, making way for Brady to take his talents to Tampa.",

        "description": "Bruce Springsteen took to Instagram to reveal that he and the E Street Band won't be able to perform at a few upcoming concert dates.",
        "content": "Bruce Springsteen has been forced to postpone three upcoming concerts in Europe due to \"vocal issues\" after a doctor ordered the artist to rest his voice for ten days. In a statement released by Springsteen to his social media accounts on Sunday, it was revealed that -- after having to postpone a performance in Marseille, France, on May 25 -- Springsteen and his iconic band would be missing three additional shows in Prague, Czech Republic, and Milan, Italy. \"Following yesterday's postponement in Marseille due to vocal issues, further examination and consulting has led doctors to determine that Bruce should not perform for the next ten days,\" the statement read. \"With this in mind, additional postponements are required for Airport Letnany in Prague (originally scheduled for May 28) and San Siro Stadium in Milan (originally scheduled for June 1 and 3).\" Additionally, the statement said that the 74-year-old rock legend is \"recuperating comfortably\" amid his vocal rest, and that \"he and the E Street Band look forward to resuming their hugely successful European stadium tour on June 12 in Madrid at the magnificent Civitas Metropolitan.\" The statement also shared that new dates for the postponed concert shows will be \"announced shortly.\" This isn't the first time recently that the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" artist -- who is on the Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band's 2024 World Tour -- had to cancel or postpone shows due to a health concern. In September 2023, Springsteen announced that the entire 2023 World Tour would have to be postponed as he recovered from peptic ulcer disease. \"Bruce Springsteen has continued to recover steadily from peptic ulcer disease over the past few weeks and will continue treatment through the rest of the year on doctor's advice,\" he tweeted at the time. \"With this in mind, and out of an abundance of caution, all remaining 2023 tour dates for Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band will be postponed until 2024.\" The tweeted statement concluded with a quote from Springsteen himself, which read, \"Thanks to all my friends and fans for your good wishes, encouragement, and support. I'm on the mend and can't wait to see you all next year.\" Meanwhile, Springsteen's latest health concern comes almost four months after the legendary rocker announced the news that his mother, Adele Springsteen, had died at age 98. The \"Dancing in the Dark\" singer announced the news of his mom's death in a sweet tribute posted to Instagram, where he posted an adorable video of his mother dancing on her front porch to swing music. Springsteen also shared in the caption the lyrics to his 1998 song \"The Wish,\" which was written to honor and thank his mom for the sacrifices she made throughout his life so that he could pursue his dreams. Springsteen often got a chance to dance with his mom over the decades -- notably, the duo shared a cute moment a few years ago during one of his concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City in March 2016. The rock legend jammed out with his then-90-year-old mom, treating her to a little dance and even a kiss during a very sweet moment of the concert. Springsteen revealed during a Broadway performance in 2021 that his mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease a decade ago, according to Today. The rocker shared with his fans, \"She's 95 and she's 10 years into Alzheimer's and that’s taken a lot away from us... But the need to dance hasn't left her.\" \"She can't speak. She can't stand. She can't feed herself. But when she sees me, there is always a smile. Still a smile. There's still a kiss,\" Springsteen shared. \"There's a sound which she makes when she sees me. It's just the sound, but I know it means 'I love you.'\" RELATED CONTENT: Video News Movies News News Music News",

Nithya Raman, who has been a member of the City Council since 2020, blamed Toyota, accusing the company of making their cars so 'easy to steal'. The video, which was filmed in 2023, has attracted widespread criticism as residents accuse LA D emocrats of neglecting to target thieves as car theft continues to surge. The video comes as actor and General Hospital star, Johnny Wactor, was shot and killed on Saturday when he interrupted thieves breaking into his car attempting to steal a catalytic converter. He was only 37. In 2023, nearly 8,000 catalytic converter components stolen in a single year, a staggering 728 percent increase from 2018. In an attempt to crackdown on theft LA City Council passed a 8-4 motion vote that made it illegal to possess a detached catalytic converter unless you had valid documentation. A viral video has resurfaced revealing Los Angeles council member Nithya Raman blaming Toyota for the increasing catalytic-converter theft ravaging the city - while opposing a motion to hold criminals accountable This comes as the latest victim, actor and General Hospital star, Johnny Wactor, was shot and killed on Saturday in LA when he confronted thieves breaking into his car attempting to steal a catalytic converter But Raman opposed the motion and placed the blame on the car company, Toyota, claiming they should not make their cars so 'easy to steal.' 'In this case, I think one of the things that infuriates me is that we have a company — whatever, Toyota — who makes the Prius, that essentially has a device on their cars which is super easy to remove. It's basically the value of a MacBook, right?' said Raman in the 2023 Council meeting. 'That is put in a place that is incredibly easy to access in your car, and all the costs of the thefts are given to us to bear instead of them [Toyota] having to manufacture a car that actually is not so easy to be stolen,' she continued. Fellow Democrat, Eunises Hernandez, agreed and said the ban on possessing a catalytic was 'racist'. 'Criminalizing the mere possession of a catalytic converter, I think is the wrong way to go, because we know which communities are gonna be the ones most criminalized because of this,' Hernandez said. 'This makes it a misdemeanor, it creates a fine of $1000, you can go to jail for six months.' 'Even a short incarceration of a couple of days can destabilize someone's life forever, and leads to collateral consequences that they have to carry until they can get an expungement, if they can get that ... I'm not in agreement with creating more opportunities to criminalize our communities,' Hernandez continued. According to a KTLA report, police officers reported to the area of Pico Boulevard and Hope Street around 3:25am Around 600,000 catalytic converters are stolen each year . Most cars are equipped with one converter but those with a dual exhaust system require two. Larger vehicles such as SUVs and trucks may have more than two. According to the New York Times, stolen catalytic converters are passed through 'middlemen, smelters and refineries in the United States and overseas.' They can be stolen in under a minute and cost around $1,000 to replace. LA has seen a sharp increase in car thefts since the Covid-19 pandemic - with the rate of thefts increasing every year since 2019. There were more than 25,000 auto thefts across the city in 2023, a staggering 64 percent increase as compared to pre-pandemic numbers.

The last time the force updated robbery statistics, at the end of March 2024, thefts were up 9.5 percent, according to ABC 7 . Wactor, who appeared in 164 episodes of the soap opera from 2020 to 2022, was leaving his side job at a rooftop bar with a female colleague at around 3:25am Saturday in the area of West Pico Boulevard and South Hope Street, when he saw the three men, believing he was being towed. Police said that one of the three men, all of whom were wearing masks, shot Wactor before fleeing in a separate vehicle. Paramedics got to the scene shortly after and took him to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The masked suspects remain at large and have yet to be identified or described. Wactor's mother Scarlett told TMZ that her son saw three men trying to steal the catalytic converter off of his car Scarlett Wactor, Johnny's mother, said that her son didn't attempt to fight them or even stop them from stealing but they still shot him and got away. Johnny's younger brother Grant confirmed to DailyMail.com that Johnny was shot in the chest as he came upon the suspects who were trying to steal the catalytic converter from his truck.

        "description": "Spain has suggested sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued attacks in the southern Gaza city of Rafah.",
        "content": "BRUSSELS — Relations between the European Union and Israel took a nosedive Monday, the eve of the diplomatic recognition of a Palestinian state by EU members Ireland and Spain, with Madrid insisting that sanctions should be considered against Israel for its continued deadly attacks in southern Gaza’s city of Rafah. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz told Spain that its consulate in Jerusalem will not be allowed to help Palestinians. At the same time, the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell threw his weight to support the International Criminal Court, whose prosecutor is seeking an arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others, including leaders of Hamas. “The prosecutor of the court has been strongly intimidated and accused of antisemitism — as always when anybody, anyone does something that Netanyahu’s government does not like,” Borrell said. “The word antisemitic, it’s too heavy. It’s too important.” Spain, Ireland and Norway plan to make official their recognition of a Palestinian state on Tuesday. While dozens of countries have recognized a Palestinian state, none of the major Western powers has done so, and it is unclear how much of a difference the move by Ireland, Spain and non-EU member Norway might make on the ground. The recognition, however, is a significant accomplishment for the Palestinians, who believe it confers international legitimacy on their struggle. Angry words abounded, with Katz accusing Spain of “rewarding terror” by recognizing a Palestinian state, and saying that “the days of the Inquisition are over.” He referred to the infamous Spanish institution started in the 15th century to maintain Roman Catholic orthodoxy that forced Jews and Muslims to flee, convert to Catholicism or, in some instances, face death. “No one will force us to convert our religion or threaten our existence. Those who harm us, we will harm in return,” said Katz. Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares slammed the comments, and said his colleagues from Ireland and Norway were “also receiving absolutely unjustified and absolutely reprehensible provocations from our Israeli colleague” because of their plans to recognize Palestine. “In the face of those who want to divide us with any type of intimidating propaganda, the unity of Europeans is essential to send a very powerful message,” he said. Also on Monday, Slovenia’s Prime Minister Robert Golob said his government will decide on the recognition of a Palestinian state on Thursday and forward its decision to parliament for final approval. Slovenia launched the recognition procedure earlier this month, and Golob has been under pressure to speed up the process since Spain, Norway and Ireland announced they would go ahead with recognition. Borrell said the actions of the Israeli government, including plans to stop transferring tax revenue earmarked for the Palestinian Authority, could no longer be reconciled with the idea he had about the state of Israel. “From now on, I will never again say ‘Israel,’ (but) will say ‘Netanyahu government’ because it is this government who is taking these decisions,” Borrell said. Even though the EU and its member nations have been steadfast in condemning the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in which fighters stormed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage, the bloc has been equally critical of Israel’s ensuing offensive that has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The latest attacks have centered on Rafah, where Palestinian health workers said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 45 people Sunday, hit tents for displaced people and left “numerous” others trapped in flaming debris. Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said such strikes will have long-standing repercussions. “Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,′′ he told SKY TG24. The strikes came after the U.N.’s top court, the International Court of Justice, on Friday demanded that Israel immediately halt its offensive on Rafah, even if it stopped short of ordering a cease-fire for the Gaza enclave. Albares said Spain and other countries asked Borrell “to provide a list of what measures the European Union could apply” to make Israel heed the ICJ’s ruling and explain what the EU has done in the past in similar circumstances “”when there has been a flagrant violation of international law.” The joint announcement by Spain, Ireland and Norway last week triggered an angry response from Israeli authorities, which summoned the countries’ ambassadors in Tel Aviv to the Foreign Ministry, where they were filmed while being shown videos of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and abductions. Albares criticized the treatment of the European ambassadors in Israel. “We reject something that is not within diplomatic courtesy and the customs of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations,” he said. “But at the same time we have also agreed that we are not going to fall for any provocation that distances us from our goal,” he added. “Our aim is to recognize the state of Palestine tomorrow, make all possible efforts to achieve a permanent cease-fire as soon as possible and also, in the end, to achieve that definitive peace.”",

        "description": "After a second pre-season win on Saturday in Edmonton, the Riders now have two weeks before their first game of the CFL season",
        "content": "Article content The final week of training camp for the Saskatchewan Roughriders looks quite different this year. Following Saturday’s pre-season game in Edmonton , the Roughriders have returned to Regina’s Mosaic Stadium for the final week of camp after the CFL club held the first two weeks of workouts at Griffiths Stadium in Saskatoon. Having already played both of their pre-season games last week — wins against Winnipeg and Edmonton — the Green and White aren’t preparing for an opponent this week but instead Saturday’s roster cutdown day where some tome tough decisions will have to be made when it comes to who the team will keep, who will be offered a practice roster spot and who will be released. “There’s still a lot of close battles,” said Riders’ head coach Corey Mace. “And it might come down to special teams if someone has more value. “It might come down to a few (missed assignments) that they have this week that might be the ultimate factor for them so games or not, the evaluation is still tightly watched.” While game action traditionally carries more weight when it comes to evaluating players, Mace said there’s still plenty he wants to see this week including how players react to five days of workouts without preparing for an opponent. “The main thing is just knowing that we don’t have a game,” said Mace. “Usually people have got something to look forward to to get them amped up. “We’re done (games) so how are you going to approach each day of practice because this is still training camp and it still counts. “You’ve got to be just as detailed in the playbooks. All the same things we preach, you should come out here and treat each practice like it’s a game. “We’ll be dialled because nothing is changing for us as far as coaches and evaluation.” Following Saturday’s 28-27 pre-season win in Edmonton , Mace was happy with how his team was able to find a way to win a game that saw the Elks turn the ball over five times to Saskatchewan. However, the first-year head coach also saw plenty of things his team needs to clean up. “From a special teams standpoint and a defensive standpoint, it’s really good to see,” Mace said of the turnovers. “We do have a knack for the ball and we’ve kind of had that since camp has started so that’s encouraging to see. “It’s easy to look at the good stuff. (But) as coaches, we always try to fix the bad stuff so that’s always going to be the main focus.” While the team can use some of the week to get a head start on the CFL season — which begins on June 8 when the Riders make a return trip to Edmonton — there are still positional battles to be ironed out this week including at American receiver. With Shawn Bane Jr. and Jerreth Sterns presumably having secured starting spots, there’s potentially one more available and it appears to be between rookies KeeSean Johnson, Geronimo Allison and Dohnte Meyers, who have all shown flashed during the pre-season. Fellow Americans Jake Parker, Kalija Lipscomb and Joe Robustelli could also in the mix for a practice roster spot. “That was a position spot we knew there was going to be some tough battles there,” said Mace. “The first week, some guys stepped up (and) the second week, different guys stepped up. “So, you want consistency from guys but by the same token, you see that there’s some really good players at that position so that’s a good problem for us.” Now they have a week to figure it out. tshire@postmedia.com The Regina Leader-Post has created an Afternoon Headlines newsletter that can be delivered daily to your inbox so you are up to date with the most vital news of the day.

        "description": "The former Manchester United and Real Madrid forward has been in sensational form since moving to the Middle East in January and has now set a new Saudi Pro League record.",
        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo has set a new record for the most goals scored in a Saudi Pro League season - adding another accolade to his illustrious career. The 39-year-old netted twice in Al-Nassr's 4-2 triumph over Al-Ittihad at Al Awal Park, taking his total to 35 and surpassing Abderrazak Hamdallah's previous record of 34 from the 2018-19 season. Hamdallah, who was also representing Al-Nassr when he set the record, achieved his tally in just 27 league games, four fewer than the ex- Manchester United and Real Madrid forward. Ronaldo had an early goal disallowed for offside but equalled the record in first-half stoppage time, controlling Mohammed Al-Fatil's long ball and firing home to open the scoring in Al-Nassr's final match of the season.

However, Ronaldo only had to wait another four minutes to claim his 35th goal of the season, heading home from a corner before being substituted. Goals from Abdulrahman Ghareeb and Meshari Al-Nemer, along with strikes from Farhah Al-Shamrani and Fabinho, saw Al-Nassr secure a 4-2 victory. They finished the season in second place, 14 points behind champions Al-Hilal but 17 ahead of Al-Ahli in third.

        "content": "MONTREAL , May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE: CAE) (TSX: NYSE: CAE ) “ CAE Inc . today announced that it has received regulatory approval to proceed with its previously-announced normal course issuer bid (\" NCIB \") to purchase, for cancellation, up to 15,932,187 of its common shares commencing May 30, 2024 and ending May 29, 2025 . The maximum number of common shares that may be repurchased under the program represents approximately five percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding common shares of CAE. The actual number of common shares purchased under the NCIB, the timing of purchases and the price at which the common shares are bought will depend upon management discretion based on factors such as market conditions. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\" TSX \") in accordance with the TSX's applicable policies or the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange (\" NYSE \") in compliance with applicable NYSE rules and policies and U.S. laws, or in such other manner as may be permitted under applicable stock exchange rules and applicable securities laws, including through alternative Canadian and US trading platforms and privately-negotiated, off-exchange block purchases. In the case of off-exchange block purchases, purchases will be at a discount to the prevailing market price in accordance with and subject to the terms of applicable exemptive relief. RBC Dominion Securities Inc. (\" RBC \") has agreed to act as CAE's designated broker to make purchases of common shares pursuant to the NCIB. CAE has also entered into an automatic share purchase plan (\" ASPP \") with RBC allowing it to purchase common shares under the NCIB when the company would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self-imposed black-out periods. Before entering a black-out period, CAE may, but is not required to, instruct RBC to make purchases under the NCIB during such a period based on parameters set by CAE in accordance with the ASPP, TSX Rules and applicable securities laws. All purchases made under the ASPP are included in computing the number of common shares purchased under the NCIB. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be implemented and effective June 3, 2024 . The price CAE will pay for any common shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition, plus brokerage fees. All common shares purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled. During the period that the NCIB is outstanding, CAE does not intend to make purchases of its common shares other than by means of open market transactions or such other means as may be permitted or approved by any applicable securities regulator. The average daily trading volume of CAE's common shares through the facilities of the TSX over the last six completed calendar months was 605,257 (\" ADTV \"). Accordingly, under the TSX Rules and policies, CAE is entitled on any trading day to purchase up to 25% of the ADTV, which totals 151,314 common shares, for the next 12-month period of the NCIB. In excess of the daily repurchase limit, CAE may also purchase, once a week, a block of common shares not owned by any insiders, which may exceed such daily limit, in accordance with the TSX Rules. As of May 16, 2024 , CAE had 318,643,758 common shares issued and outstanding. CAE has not repurchased any of its common shares during the last twelve months. The NCIB is being established as part of CAE's capital allocation strategy. The Board of Directors of CAE believes that any purchases made under the NCIB will be in the best interest of CAE and that such purchases will constitute a desirable use of funds that should enhance shareholder value.

        "content": "MONTREAL , May 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE: CAE (TSX: CAE )) (TSX: NYSE: CAE ) “ CAE Inc . today announced that it has received regulatory approval to proceed with its previously-announced normal course issuer bid (\" NCIB \") to purchase, for cancellation, up to 15,932,187 of its common shares commencing May 30, 2024 and ending May 29, 2025 . The maximum number of common shares that may be repurchased under the program represents approximately five percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding common shares of CAE. The actual number of common shares purchased under the NCIB, the timing of purchases and the price at which the common shares are bought will depend upon management discretion based on factors such as market conditions. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\" TSX \") in accordance with the TSX's applicable policies or the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange (\" NYSE \") in compliance with applicable NYSE rules and policies and U.S. laws, or in such other manner as may be permitted under applicable stock exchange rules and applicable securities laws, including through alternative Canadian and US trading platforms and privately-negotiated, off-exchange block purchases. In the case of off-exchange block purchases, purchases will be at a discount to the prevailing market price in accordance with and subject to the terms of applicable exemptive relief. RBC (TSX: RY ) Dominion Securities Inc. (\" RBC \") has agreed to act as CAE's designated broker to make purchases of common shares pursuant to the NCIB. CAE has also entered into an automatic share purchase plan (\" ASPP \") with RBC allowing it to purchase common shares under the NCIB when the company would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self-imposed black-out periods. Before entering a black-out period, CAE may, but is not required to, instruct RBC to make purchases under the NCIB during such a period based on parameters set by CAE in accordance with the ASPP, TSX Rules and applicable securities laws. All purchases made under the ASPP are included in computing the number of common shares purchased under the NCIB. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be implemented and effective June 3, 2024 . The price CAE will pay for any common shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition, plus brokerage fees. All common shares purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled. During the period that the NCIB is outstanding, CAE does not intend to make purchases of its common shares other than by means of open market transactions or such other means as may be permitted or approved by any applicable securities regulator. The average daily trading volume of CAE's common shares through the facilities of the TSX over the last six completed calendar months was 605,257 (\" ADTV \"). Accordingly, under the TSX Rules and policies, CAE is entitled on any trading day to purchase up to 25% of the ADTV, which totals 151,314 common shares, for the next 12-month period of the NCIB. In excess of the daily repurchase limit, CAE may also purchase, once a week, a block of common shares not owned by any insiders, which may exceed such daily limit, in accordance with the TSX Rules. As of May 16, 2024 , CAE had 318,643,758 common shares issued and outstanding. CAE has not repurchased any of its common shares during the last twelve months. The NCIB is being established as part of CAE's capital allocation strategy. The Board of Directors of CAE believes that any purchases made under the NCIB will be in the best interest of CAE and that such purchases will constitute a desirable use of funds that should enhance shareholder value.

        "content": "May 27, 2024 This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies . Editors have highlightedthe following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked peer-reviewed publication trusted source proofread by Griffith University Researchers have conducted one of the first quantitative studies of social structure and social foraging in Antarctic minke whales, using pioneering animal-borne camera tags. This study , published in Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology , sheds light on the complex social and foraging behaviors of these elusive krill specialists within the fragile Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem. The study was led by Dr. Jenny Allen as a Griffith University Research Associate in collaboration with the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC). Data were collected in 2018 and 2019 around the Western Antarctic Peninsula as part of a research grant from the National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs to Dr. Ari Friedlaender, a Professor in UCSC's Ocean Sciences Department. The study is unique in its use of motion-sensing, video- and audio-recording tags deployed on Antarctic minke whales for the first time to study their ecological role through analysis of their diving, foraging, and social behaviors. Data analyses focused on the whales' diving, foraging, and social behaviors, providing fresh insights into their ecological roles. Findings from the study indicated that Antarctic minke whales exhibit a \"fission–fusion\" social structure, frequently switching companions. This social flexibility is similar to what is seen in several other baleen whale species. In 60.6% of cases, whales were observed forming short-term associations, engaging in both foraging and non-foraging activities. Larger individuals were more likely to socialize, and this social interaction correlated with a noticeable reduction in their feeding efforts, regardless of dive depth. Furthermore, the study documented 12 instances where tagged whales associated with each other in pairs or trios. These groups demonstrated synchronized spatial movement and diving behaviors, suggesting that Antarctic minke whales employed group foraging strategies. Specifically, 67.5% of associated dives and 64% of associated feeding lunges were synchronized. \"These findings provide essential baseline information on the sociality and group foraging behaviors of Antarctic minke whales,\" Dr. Allen said. \"Understanding these patterns is crucial, especially as climate change continues to impact the Antarctic ecosystem.\" The study underscored the importance of Antarctic minke whales as top krill predators, highlighting their role within the ecosystem. The synchronized foraging behavior observed suggested these whales might optimize their feeding efficiency through cooperation, a behavior previously underappreciated in this species. \"This study is fascinating because it provides new information on complex and dynamic social and behavioral patterns by an animal that until now we had very little information about,\" says Dr. Friedlaender, the senior investigator on the project. This research not only enhances our understanding of Antarctic minke whale social and foraging ecology but also encourages the need for future studies aimed at more targeted investigations.

        "content": "The door may soon be open for Australian young gun Jack Doohan to make his Formula One debut amid a bombshell report Alpine could drop Esteban Ocon for the Canadian Grand Prix. Ocon ruined Alpine’s entire race when he attempted to overtake teammate Pierre Gasly on the opening lap in Monaco. Every qualifying session and race from the 2024 FIA Formula One World ChampionshipTM LIVE in 4K. New to Kayo? Start Your Free Trial Today > However, Ocon’s move failed as he suffered enough damage to force him out of the race and hampered Gasly’s efforts, although the latter managed to recover and finish 10th to secure a point. Ocon, who also copped a five-place grid penalty for the Canadian GP, apologised for the incident on social media as Gasly ripped his teammate in a stinging public spray. Alpine boss Bruno Famin was also highly critical of Ocon and threatened the 27-year-old will face “consequences”. According to Sky Sports reporter Craig Slater, those consequences could be as severe as being dropped for the Canadian GP on June 10 (AEST). “Bruno Famin, he was actually on the pit wall with Canal+ who called him up immediately in the aftermath of that first-lap crash and Famin spoke angrily and he talked about taking a tough decision, which everyone has interpreted as benching Esteban Ocon for the next race in Canada,” Slater said. 'Why did he try to attack me?!' | 00:52 MORE COVERAGE ‘F*** me’: Verstappen’s radio message dripping in irony as world champ tastes his own medicine Monaco Wrap: F1 curse lifts in teary scenes; Piastri’s podium stunner after ugly first lap carnage Monaco Talking Pts: Horror crash exposes F1 rules farce; ‘out of line’ move could open door for Aussie “What I can say to you is that that is still a serious consideration for the Alpine boss, Bruno Famin. He will do what is best for the team. “But if he decides that leaving Esteban Ocon out for a week as a demonstration of how team discipline needs to be, he is prepared to do that, but that decision has yet to be taken. “There were face-to-face meetings between Ocon and Famin in the aftermath of the Grand Prix yesterday. Ocon apologised, both privately face-to-face and publicly afterwards via social media. So let’s see what happens.” Should Ocon be dropped, Aussie star Doohan looms as the obvious candidate to step up into his seat. The 21-year-old joined Alpine as their reserve driver in 2023 and has already driven a number of practice laps for the team. If Doohan does secure a surprise call-up for the Canadian GP he would be the third Australian on the grid alongside Oscar Piastri and Daniel Ricciardo, who drive for McLaren and Visa CashApp RB respectively.",

His unique all-around skills made him a dominant force at UCLA and led to an NBA regular-season and Finals MVP, two NBA championships, and a spot on the NBA's 50th and 75th Anniversary Teams.\" After retiring from basketball, he started his career in sports broadcasting in 1990. As a basketball broadcaster and analyst, he covered college and NBA games for broadcasters, including ESPN, CBS, and NBC, as well as the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers. Advertisement His sports commentary was fun and colorful. Once, he gobbled down a cupcake still topped with a lit candle on live TV. He would often go on air wearing Grateful Dead t-shirts and other colorful attire. In a statement, Martin Jarmond, UCLA's Alice and Nahum Lainer Family Director of Athletics, said that Walton \"represented so many of the ideals that our university holds dear.\" \"He loved being back on campus at UCLA, calling games in Pauley Pavilion, and being around our teams,\"Jarmond said. \"We offer our deepest sympathy to his family, and we take solace in knowing that Bill made each day his masterpiece.\"",

        "content": "The Ecuadorian Cycling Federation (FEC) announced on Monday that it has chosen Jhonatan Narváez (Ineos Grenadiers) for the single spot for the Paris Olympic Games road events over defending champion Richard Carapaz . Narváez will compete in both the time trial and road race in Paris. The FEC explained that it appointed the Ecuadorian representative \"as requested by the Ecuadorian Olympic Committee (COE), on the basis of federal autonomy and the regulations issued.\" In a statement issued on social media last week, Carapaz decried \"a lack of transparency and fairness\" in the selection process, and that they were \"clearly biased and lack the fundamental principles of sports justice and equity.\" However, on Monday, Carapaz issued a video wishing Narvaéz luck in Paris and thanking his supporters. The FEC only released its selection criteria in March but used UCI points gained from January 1 to May 21, 2024, to choose the top-ranked rider. Carapaz was ranked higher than Narváez in the UCI rankings, which calculate points on a rolling 12-month calendar, but the situation was reversed in results taken only from this year.

The EF Education First-EasyPost rider complained that the revision to the selection criteria came out after the start of the period to gain points had already begun. \"This should have been issued at the end of the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Games or at the end of last season when all athletes started with zero points and could plan our season equitably,\" Carapaz stated. \"However, its publication in an improvised manner and without room for manoeuvre seems to be designed to keep me out of Paris and exempt the president of the FEC from any responsibility.\" Carapaz had appealed to the Ministry of Sport to intervene, but the FEC chose to finalise the selection before the request could be accepted. In 2021, Carapaz became the first Ecuadorian athlete to win a gold medal in cycling at the Olympics. He raced in Tokyo with Narváez. This season, Carapaz won his national time trial championship, while Narváez won the road race. Carapaz finished second overall in the Tour Colombia and won the final stage . He also won a stage of the Tour de Romandie . Narváez won the Down Under Classic and finished second in the Tour Down Under in January, and more recently won the opening stage of the Giro d'Italia .",

        "description": "Hostile occupation of nuclear sites could end in disaster",
        "content": "Russia has devastated vast portions of Ukraine and killed or kidnapped thousands of civilians, but Russian “ecocide is now a tool of war,” researcher Dr. Sasha Dovzhyk at a recent conference I attended at the Ukrainian Institute of America in New York City. Dovzhyk said Russian planes, or artillery, have scattered small landmines, called “little petals” (also called PFM-1s), across 156,000 square kilometres, the equivalent to one-quarter of the country or four times the size of Switzerland. She added that removal will take years and cost billions and until that’s accomplished hundreds of thousands of people and animals will be injured or killed. “Scattered from aircraft or delivered by mortars, the “petals” spin through the air, bite into the earth and explode upon contact with as little as 5 kilograms of weight.... Hectare by hectare, Russia’s invasion turns barren the country which contains almost a quarter of the world’s chernozem, a highly fertile soil... Russia has turned Ukraine into the world’s biggest minefield. This is not the first environmental disaster perpetrated against Ukraine. In 1986, Kremlin incompetence caused a nuclear reactor to explode at Chornobyl, spreading radioactivity across the country and Europe. Now that area, 90 kilometres from Kyiv, is a no-go zone and a massive steel and concrete structure, or sarcophagus, contains the reactor. Now, Vladimir Putin doubles down on that catastrophe. In March 2022, right after the Feb. 24 invasion, Russia occupied Chornobyl’s no-go zone, then days later Ukraine’s biggest nuclear complex, the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), also the largest reactor in Europe. Russian military officials have overseen its operations ever since. The United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have been granted occasional access to monitor the ZNPP’s operations. But, in a recent report, the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency : “The IAEA observers at ZNPP reported that they continued to be denied timely and appropriate access to all areas important to nuclear safety and security.” There are concerns that maintenance is inadequate and that there isn’t enough power and water to keep reactors cool at all times. Testing and inspections are also a problem, and staff numbers at the facility have fallen from 11,500 workers to 4,500. Then, on June 6, 2023, the Russian-occupied dam was blown up — 80 miles away from ZZNP. This reduced the water levels in the reservoir that cools ZNPP’s reactors, and water must now be pumped in from local wells. (Experts concluded that Russian forces likely blew up a segment of the dam to hinder , but Russian authorities have denied the accusation.) Putin now controls Ukraine’s largest nuclear facility and the integrity of the Chernobyl sarcophagus which prevents the escape of radiation. This potential eco-terrorism is on an unimagined level: If just ZPNN explodes or is blown up, a meltdown would cause a massive fire and explosion that would release radiation over a vast area of Europe. The IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, in an April 2023 news release: “We are living on borrowed time when it comes to nuclear safety and security at the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant. Unless we take action to protect the plant, our luck will sooner or later run out, with potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.” And the odds of catastrophe increased after the destruction of the nearly Nova Khakovka dam. Dovzhyk said this was the “first ever” intentional dam explosion. “Ecocide on this scale should be a crime in the International Criminal Court and isn’t yet,” she said. Ukraine is scarred with landmines, but also with pockmarks from bombing attacks. “Two dozen experts who spoke with Reuters, including soil scientists, farmers, grain companies and analysts, said it would take decades to fix the damage to Europe’s breadbasket — including contamination, mines and destroyed infrastructure — and that global food supplies could suffer for years to come. Shelling has also upset the delicate ecosystems of microorganisms that turn soil materials into crop nutrients such as nitrogen while tanks have compressed the earth, making it harder for roots to flourish, the scientists say,” Indian broadcast network NDTV. Putin’s war is barbaric and uncivilized. The Ukrainian diaspora, the G7, the UN and world’s environmental movements must condemn and stop Russia from perpetrating the biggest ecocide in history.",

ICTAM conferred the accolade during its recent 2024 Corporate Awards, marking the second consecutive year that TNM has scooped the award. Reacting to the award, Corporate Affairs Manager, Limbani Nsapato says it further confirms TNM’s ability to consistently deliver high quality and stable internet services despite operating in a challenging environment characterized by unpredictable weather and macro-economic conditions. TNM Plc, listed on the Malawi Stock Exchange competed with Airtel and Inq Digital in the category. “This accolade is a testament to TNM’s unwavering commitment to innovation and excellence in advancing the ICT sector and driving the digital economy. At TNM, we continue to take command of technological advancements in response to the dynamic needs of our customers in a fast-paced digital economy,” said Nsapato. Nsapato said the award reaffirms TNM’s position as trailblazer in delivering seamless internet connectivity and empowering individuals and businesses alike in the digital world. Nsapato said the award inspires TNM to continue pioneering innovative and integrated mobile network and ICT services that respond to the customer needs. TNM is the pioneer of 5G network services which launched in 2023. The telco is expanding its service to other parts of the country after Blantyre CBD and City Centre in Lilongwe. The company has also pioneered its own Master-card powered debit cards which operate based on its mobile money platform, Mpamba. This makes TNM the first operator in Malawi to provide convenience in the retail experience sector and electronic ticketing for soccer matches. “The ICTAM award will motivate us to continue delivering world-class innovations by applying mobile network technology as a catalyst for helping Malawi achieve her national growth ambitions as envisioned in the #MW2063 document,” he said.

The announcement, citing concern for public safety, follows much the same script as that of the British Columbia government, which — after decriminalizing in 2023 — recently retreated to ban use in public places due to complaints of rampant drug use and continuing high rates of overdose. In early April, the state of Oregon went further, recriminalizing drug possession, replacing small fines with probation and up to six months in prison. The state was forced to backtrack on decriminalization measures that were passed in 2020 due to backlash over spiking overdoses during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Continued deaths due to drug use is all the evidence required to curb reform, despite the fact that these spikes occurred mostly during the pandemic. Research shows that the pandemic exacerbated many of the factors underlying the drug crisis. Health disparities and a lack of resources in underserved communities, social isolation, economic burden, stress, a lack of access to treatment and barriers to care all contribute to acute health effects of drug dependence. Regardless of these facts, drug policy reform is being blamed for these outcomes. It’s still all about the politics, of course In Ontario, predictably, the Ford government’s position on Toronto’s proposal is staunch opposition. Yet there is a sense of new momentum in the same old rhetoric: because drug users continue to die and use drugs in public places, presumably this means the experts and bleeding-heart liberals who supported reform have been soundly proven wrong. Most concerning, whereas conservatives and liberals may differ in their emphasis on punishment or treatment as solutions to drug problems, neither type of government seems prepared to fully implement a public health approach to substance use. That would mean addressing health disparities and deeper causes of substance use disorders, such as social inequality and social dislocation in Canadian society. No North American jurisdiction has been able to achieve this, despite the depth of knowledge and increasingly articulate demonstration of progressive public servants. Bureaucrats and politicians speak the language used by experts and other knowledgeable observers, who in turn inform the public of the need for harm reduction and more comprehensive, meaningful social policy reform. Logically, this requires commitment to decriminalization to shift the emphasis from punishing addicts to rehabilitating them. Increasingly, the discourse has gone further in establishing the need for more coherent public health policies addressing the root causes of addiction. To that end, important progress has been squandered by apparent bewilderment that addicts are still dying in large numbers, despite (and now because of) decriminalization measures that were never claimed to solve the problem of addiction, but rather to reduce known harms of criminalizing drugs. Decriminalizing drugs is not intended to be a solution to drug problems. Rather, it is a critical first step that’s necessary, but not sufficient, for replacing prohibition with a public health approach. Although Canada has made this work for regulating cannabis, it still has far to go to implement a more progressive public health approach to other drugs. The dangers of drug use stem not so much from psychoactive substances themselves, but from the toxic and unsafe drug supply that is the result of criminalization. But most of these substances continue to be treated as dangerous enough to ban. Yet there is scant consideration of the societal and legal circumstances and conditions that make drugs dangerous because they happen to be used in harmful ways by certain people. Whereas opiates, like alcohol, may have higher risk of overdose and adverse health effects due to physical dependence, all drugs can be misused with risk to health and public safety. Addiction and public health Decriminalizing drugs can make them safer, but not always, and reduce some harms of using drugs. What cannot be resolved entirely by decriminalization are the societal conditions that make substance use attractive enough to override considerations of concern for the self or others. Addiction thrives on hopelessness and feelings of despair, abandonment and disconnection, which are caused by homelessness, unemployment and discrimination, among other social problems. Despite the range of local addiction support services and treatment options called for in support of decriminalization proposals, so far decriminalization efforts have failed to go beyond half measures to implement a full array of integrated resources. Further off course yet, there has been little indication of meaningful commitment to addressing deeper structural root causes of addiction in North American society. Canada’s putative commitment to a public health approach has fared no better than in Oregon. None of these jurisdictions have gone far enough to remedy the real causes of drug problems. The fate of Portugal’s successful run as a global leader in tackling addiction, as opposed to punishing addicts, helps to clarify new lessons being learned in North America. Adopted over 20 years ago, decriminalization measures in Portugal have been implemented more successfully because its social safety net is far more comprehensive and better integrated with the criminal justice system. In recent years, as cuts to funding decimated rehabilitation programs, rising rates of overdose soon followed, demonstrating that decriminalization is not a silver bullet; if you do that and nothing else, things will get worse. Put otherwise, half measures are ineffective. Until we are prepared to go all in to solve the problem, people who use drugs will keep dying unnecessarily because we have not afforded them real hope. Sadly, this is news to no one. Not just experts. The Liberal government went on the record years ago by recognizing that decriminalizing drug use is not a panacea. Rather than committing to the next step, then and now, the necessary first step has been taken off the table. How about try giving it more time? Another lesson learned in Portugal, that evidently has not been resonating here in North American society, is that the kind of change required takes time. Now that decriminalization has been tried (and deemed a failure) in B.C. and Oregon, the reigning logic appears to be that going back to doing nothing makes more sense than doing something. Despite great patience shown during a century of misery inflicted on drug users in Canadian society, trying something new is scary. Cue the same old moral panic scapegoating addicts as dangerous people who those in charge prefer should not be seen. Decriminalizing drugs can’t eliminate people’s struggles with addiction. To work well, it requires a considerable level of investment, similar to what has historically been devoted to policing and imprisonment of addicts. Redistributing resources to support the integration of services, housing and employment for more people is not, and has never been, prioritized over punishing drug users. Until that shift occurs, we will keep falling back on failed policies consistent with a war-on-drugs mentality that has now prevailed for 50 years against all logic. In the meantime, be prepared for a new wave of antiquated arguments proclaiming more liberal policies a failure. Commitment to half measures creates more problems than it solves. ___ Andrew Hathaway does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment. ___ This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

CONTINUE READING Show less Donald Trump just dropped a \"hint\" on social media about the jury instructions in his criminal case in New York, and it shows prosecutors have a new advantage, a former prosecutor said Monday. Catherine Christian, a onetime assistant district attorney, appeared on MSNBC to discuss Trump's hush money cover-up case, where he stands accused of paying off adult film star Stormy Daniels in order to impact the results of the 2016 presidential election. That case goes to closing arguments on Tuesday. The host asked Christian a series of questions about Trump's ongoing trial, including one about a Truth Social post in which Trump appears to be complaining about the instructions that will be handed down to jurors before they make their decision. Those decisions are not yet public. ALSO READ: What Trump's weird WWE Hall of Fame speech tells us about his presidential debate strategy \"I want to show something he posted on Truth Social,\" the host says. \"I wonder if this gives a hint about jury instructions and what they might be. I know we haven't gotten an announcement from Judge Merchan, but I wonder if he has said something to the prosecution or defense, and I'm asking because Donald Trump said this, 'The reason the highly conflicted Judge Merchan had to come up with three fake options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous, which is completely un-American and unconstitutional, is the corrupt Soros' ... so he's talking about three options for the jury to choose from without requiring them to be unanimous. Is he talking about federal election crime, state election crime, tax crime as the underlying felony charge, and do you have a sense that they know what the jury instructions are going to be?\" Christian replied, \"I would hope that the defense and the prosecution know what the jury instructions are going to be since they're giving their summations tomorrow. I understand why the press and why we would all want it, [but also] why the judge didn't release it. He wants to make sure the first time the jury hears about this, and the jury is abiding by judge's rules, and not watching this right now, is the first time they hear about this is tomorrow, so that post by Donald Trump is sort of a hint, if you can believe Donald Trump, that maybe the instruction to the jury will be that the unlawful means, conspire to promote an election by unlawful means, could be the federal election law violation, could be tax crimes, state tax crime violation, so I have a feeling that that's probably what Donald Trump is talking about because his lawyers have a copy of the jury instructions the judge will give tomorrow.\" She added that it's \"definitely it's a gift\" to prosecutors. \"If the jury believes all of the evidence, it's a gift to them.\" Watch the video below or click the link.

Jim Walden, who is now in private practice, said the former president's constant attacks on the judge in his case — coupled with disrespect from a witness — are likely to backfire when jurors start deliberating this week. \"The thing that I think Trump just doesn't get is, even if you don't like the judge, the jury is going to like the judge,\" Walden said. \"When you're super disrespectful to someone the jury sees as a professional person doing their job, that's a self-inflicted wound. \"Whatever else Donald Trump may be — a great businessman, a great reality TV show host, a great politician — he's a dumb lawyer.” Among major errors in Trump’s defense, Walden said, was calling attorney Robert Costello to the stand. Costello infuriated the judge by rolling his eyes and making snide remarks while being questioned. Judge Juan Merchan’s fury forced him to clear the courtroom to reprimand the witness. \"Costello was a disaster,\" Walden told the Post.

        "content": "Insecurity, which has claimed hundreds of lives and left many others missing, is a major challenge that has plagued the administration of President Bola Tinubu since the President came to power on May 29, 2023, GODFREY GEORGE writes As the blue skies folded up to welcome the dark clouds, 40 villagers in Zurak, a village in the Wase district of Plateau State were slaughtered by armed men on May 20, 2024. That Monday night, blood flowed and many families were left in mourning. Reports from the villagers showed that the daredevils rode motorbikes into the village and opened fire on the residents, torching homes as they did. The attack was the latest violence in an area that has long been a flashpoint for disputes over resources and outbreaks of intercommunal clashes. A resident, Musa Ibrahim, had told Sunday PRIMANEWS that the armed men who invaded the Zurak community, did so without cause. “As we speak, about 40 people have been confirmed dead. Zurak is a popular mining community,” he said. A local youth leader, Shafi’i Sambo, had told Reuters that, at least, 42 people had been killed in the raid. Although the Transition Committee Chairman of Wase, Hamisu Anani, could not be reached for comment, a youth leader in the community, Sampson Alheri, told our correspondent that the incident occurred around 6 pm that Monday when the sun had gone down and the market women were clearing their goods for the day. “It was a calculated attack. They knew people were already tired from the day and would not expect the attack. Although some people managed to escape from the community, several others could not make it. They were shot dead in cold blood,” he said. Another youth, who said he did not want to be named, said tension had begun to build from Sunday when some vigilantes sensed imminent danger and went to the bush where they encountered a camp of bandits. The next day, according to the source, the bandits came out in their numbers in anger, shooting and burning homes. Another resident, Hamisu Bashar, said he counted no fewer than 46 bodies. According to him, the deceased persons were not only from Wase but also from the Kanan Local Government Area and had come to the farm. Lamenting, he said, “We are tired of this kind of situation. The government needs to come to our aid.” Spokesman of the state police command, Alfred Alabo, while confirming the attack, said following the aggressive onslaught against bandits by a combined team of Department of State Services and other security operatives in Bangalala forest, Wase, Plateau State, a border between Plateau, Bauchi and Taraba states, seven bandits were neutralised in the area. “Other bandits who fled during the operation attacked Zurak and Dakai villages, killed nine persons, and burnt down six houses while on the run. The Commissioner of Police, Plateau State Command, has made more deployments to the area and has directed the area commander of Langtang to relocate his base to Wase LGA with immediate effect. “The command is also pleased to announce to the state government and the people of Plateau State that one of the bandits, who escaped and went to seek treatment at a hospital in Wase, was arrested with gunshot wounds. The suspect has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Jos for discreet investigation,” Alabo added. Wase has deposits of zinc and lead, while Plateau as a whole is known for its tin mining industry. Sitting on the dividing line between Nigeria’s mostly Muslim North and predominantly Christian South, Plateau often sees outbreaks of violence sparked by disputes between nomadic herders and pastoral farmers. Climate change has also escalated tensions over grazing land, water access, and other resources, such as the state’s metal reserves. Parts of North-West and North-Central Nigeria have also been terrorised by heavily armed criminal gangs, who raid villages to loot and carry out mass kidnappings for ransom. Earlier in the year, inter-communal clashes erupted in Plateau’s Mangu town that left churches and mosques burnt, more than 50 people dead and thousands displaced. More killings in Plateau On April 17, communities in the Bokkos Local Government Area of the state gunmen identified by locals as herders killed more than 30 locals, while many women and children fled to other areas. A Bokkos resident, who asked not to be named, told the Foundation for Investigative Journalism that four natives protecting a part of the Ghatingut village in the Mbar district of Bokkos were shot to death by the herders. He said the attackers also killed one person in Wumat and extended their destruction to places like Kawel and Butura Kampani. “There was an attack at Butura Kampani on Monday. As a result, the women of the area came out to protest inside the town, stating that they wanted their leaders to do something about the attacks because they were tired,” he told the FIJ. “Inside Bokkos town, you’d hear gunshots in different locations almost every night. Now, there are plenty of cows around Bokkos town, and we don’t know why they are there,” he added. In recent times, there’s been unrest in Kuteng, Bokkos; Kopnanle, Mangu, and around the borders of Bokkos. In January, scores of people were killed on their farms in Miyanga. Between December 23 and December 26, 2023, more than 160 people lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Bokkos and Mangu. 23 JTF men killed in Borno That same month, in Borno State, at least 23 members of Nigeria’s civilian joint task force were killed on Saturday, April 27, in separate attacks by militants and an armed kidnapping gang in the area. In Borno State, armed men suspected to be Islamic State West Africa Province fighters used an improvised explosive device to blow up a vehicle carrying the civilian joint task force team, a local force chairman, told Reuters. The CJTF was first formed in 2013 to protect communities in the North-East and help the military fight Boko Haram and later its offshoot, ISWAP. The force has since been extended to other northern states grappling with armed kidnapping gangs. The CJTF chairman for the Gamboru Ngala area near the border with Cameroon, Tijjanima Umar, said his team was travelling to Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, when they drove over the IED. “As the mine blew up, nine of them died instantly while two other people had severe injuries and were immediately taken to hospital for treatment,” Umar told Reuters. The Nigerian military was not immediately available to comment. Although severely curtailed by Nigerian security forces, Boko Haram and ISWAP still carry out deadly attacks against civilians and the military. In northwestern Sokoto State, 14 CJTF members were said to have been killed and several missing following an ambush by gunmen also in April, task force sector commandant Ismail Haruna told Reuters. Haruna said the CJTF members were killed in Sokoto’s Isa Local Government Area, where they had raided and destroyed a bush camp belonging to a known armed kidnapping gang leader. The gang quickly regrouped and ambushed the CJTF as they drove back to the state capital, he added. 21 villagers killed in Kogi On April 4, gunmen killed at least 21 villagers in Kogi State, in the wake of clashes between herders and farmers in the area, fuelled by the growing pressure on land resources. The Chairman of the Omala Local Government Area of Kogi where the violence took place, Edibo Mark, said around 21 people were buried that day. He said the attack was a reprisal by herders after the villagers three days earlier killed six of them (herders), including two who were beheaded. Violence between farmers and pastoralists has become increasingly common in recent years as population growth leads to an expansion of the area dedicated to farming, leaving less land available for open grazing by nomads’ herds of cattle. “It’s tragic, we never expected something like this,” a resident, Elias Atabo, 54, told Reuters. “The attack lasted not more than 45 minutes,” he added. Another resident, simply identified as Julius, said up to 100 herdsmen attacked the village on Thursday and started shooting indiscriminately, adding that 19 bodies were recovered after the incident with an additional 15 found on Friday morning. Julius said most of the casualties were older people who could not escape the assailants. Kogi is one of Nigeria’s North-Central states, where the Muslim North meets the Christian South. Competition over land use is particularly intractable in the region as the fault lines between farmers and herders often overlap with ethnic and religious divisions. The Boko Haram insurgency in the North-East has worsened the problem by driving herders into the middle belt and further South, analysts say, while climate change and increasing aridity in the North are also contributory factors. In October 2022, President Bola Tinubu, who was the then-presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, promised to end insecurity if elected, but this has not been the case, with the many recorded killings and mass abductions. In December 2023, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, George Akume, said Tinubu was determined to end the insecurity ravaging many parts of the country, another promise that has yet to be fulfilled. Over 1,000 killed in Q1 2024 At least 1,027 civilians lost their lives to preventable incidents such as violent clashes, armed robbery, abductions and killings by Boko Haram, and other forms of terrorist attacks in the first quarter of 2024. In the same period, 123 security agents, ranging from members of the police to officials of the Nigeria Security Civil Defence Corps and soldiers, lost their lives. The top seven states with the highest number of such deaths, according to SBM Intelligence, are Zamfara (482), Borno (329), Katsina (328), Benue (297), Kaduna (157), Plateau (99), and Delta (97). The least affected states are Cross River (six), Lagos (five), Ekiti (four), Jigawa (four), Ondo (three), Abia (two), and Oyo State (two). On January 1, Boko Haram insurgents invaded two Chibok communities in Borno, killing 14 people and abducting a lady. The following day, insurgents killed two locals in Dure and Wala communities in the Gwoza area of the state. By the end of January, Fulani herders had killed more than 31 locals in the Bokkos and Barkin Ladi local government areas and the violence has continued. In 2023 alone, 400 people in these affected lost their lives to terrorist attacks while the government failed to take preemptive action. In the 45 days between May 29 and July 13, 2023, over 600 people were killed by non-state actors across the country. According to data, these killings primarily resulted from the activities of bandits, Boko Haram insurgents, ethnic militias, armed robbers, and other non-state actors. Data from SBM Intelligence revealed that about 629 Nigerians were killed in the last 45 days under the Tinubu administration. Other data from the Council on Foreign Relations’ Nigeria Security Tracker and media reports checked by the ICIR showed that non-state actors killed 587 people within the same period. •Youths protesting killings Photo: 247Ureports Tinubu’s promises on security In his victory speech after securing the APC presidential ticket in June 2022, Tinubu promised a secure, prosperous, united Nigeria if he won the 2023 general elections. “They have been worrying us, but we will eliminate them. We are Nigerians. We are sure that no animal in the darkness of the night, no intruders, no destroyers, can bring Nigeria backward. Forward we are moving,” he said. The President, while delivering his inaugural speech amid cheers from his supporters on Monday, May 29, at Eagle Square in Abuja, outlined the key initiatives to be anticipated from his administration and pledged to prioritise security and effectively tackle the menace of insecurity. “Security shall be the top priority of our administration because neither prosperity nor justice can prevail amidst insecurity and violence. To effectively tackle this menace, we shall reform our security doctrine and its architecture. “We shall invest more in our security personnel, and this means more than an increase in number. We shall provide better training, equipment, pay, and firepower,” Tinubu stated. Despite the promise to hit the ground running, data from various sources showed that the situation has yet to improve under his administration. Killing on inauguration day Four people were reportedly killed on the very Monday Tinubu took his oath of office, with two of them beheaded by gunmen who invaded the Rundele community in the Emohua Local Council of Rivers State. Many described this as a slap in the face of the Nigerian people, as it happened on the exact day of the handover. On May 30, 2023, bandits killed 25 people in three separate attacks in the Kanoma district of the Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State. On Wednesday, May 31, gunmen suspected to be cultists invaded two communities in the Ahoada East and Ahoada West local government areas of Rivers State, killing six people. The next month, the Makurdi branch of the Shitile Development Association in Benue State wrote a letter of intervention to the state government. Signed by its President, Door Samuel, and Secretary General, Zuai Ephraim, it stated that at least 40 people were killed in separate, simultaneous attacks on June 4 in several communities of the Katsina-Ala Local Government Area of Benue State. Samuel reported that after the dust settled on the June 4 shooting by gunmen at Imande Mbakange village market in Mbacher council ward, 28 people had been killed. The group added that on the same day, six other people were slaughtered in Michihe council ward, while another six were killed that night in Achamegh village, Mbagene Kpav, bringing the total number of those killed to 40 in just one night. In June, bandits killed no fewer than 50 people in the Gwadabawa and Tangaza local government areas of Sokoto for refusing to pay illegal levies imposed on them. In another incident, attacks by bandits on the villages of Janbako and Sakida in the Maradun Local Government Area, Zamfara State, resulted in the death of 31 people and injuries to many others. At least 13 people were also killed in the Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau State on June 10 in a retaliatory attack between herders and farming communities. The incident followed the killing of five herders in Rawu village earlier. Reports indicated that bandits in Niger State’s Rafi local government area slaughtered 25 farmers and kidnapped several women and girls from different areas. The incident affected five communities. On Sunday, July 2, Taraba State Governor, Agbu Kefas, imposed a 24-hour curfew on Karim town and its surroundings in the Karim Lamido Local Government Area. The curfew followed a communal clash between the Wurkuns and the Karimjos in the area, where at least 50 people died. On Saturday, July 8, a total of 24 people were killed when armed men entered the Zaki Akpuuna 1 and Diom towns in the Mbaterem district of the Ukum Local Government Area of Benue State. A further look at the data from SBM Intelligence revealed that people were killed by non-state actors between May 29 and May 31, 541 in June, and 50 as of July 13. On March 14, 2024, for instance, 16 Nigerian soldiers lost their lives to attacks in the Okuama community of Delta State. ‘2,423 killed, 1,872 abducted’ In January 2024, some civil society groups, under the aegis of the Civil Society Joint Action Group, said 2,423 persons had been killed, while 1,872 others had been abducted in the eight months since President Bola Tinubu’s administration began. The groups asked the President to declare a state of emergency on insecurity and prosecute the 400 sponsors of terrorism arrested under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. In a joint press conference, the groups, numbering about 50, expressed concern about the state of insecurity in the country, following a spate of bandits’ attacks, killings, and abductions across the country, including the Federal Capital Territory. Speaking on behalf of the group, the Executive Director of the Civil Society Legislative and Advocacy Centre, Auwal Rafsanjani, said insecurity had persisted over the last three administrations, with 24,816 Nigerians killed and 15,597 persons abducted in the last administration of President (Mahammadu) Buhari, between 2019 and 2023. “It has now been eight months since President Tinubu took his oath of office and yet, things have failed to improve. Our tracking shows at least 2,423 people have been killed in mass atrocities-related incidents and at least 1,872 persons were abducted since the beginning of President Tinubu’s administration till January 26, 2024. “We are particularly concerned about the upsurge in abductions, noting that at least 230 incidents, in which multiple victims were involved, occurred within the first two weeks of January 2024 alone,” he said. In its 12-point recommendation to the government, the groups asked the government to “declare a state of emergency on kidnapping and other forms of terrorism, uncover and prosecute those responsible for the misappropriation of the $460m earmarked for the provision of Closed-Circuit Television cameras in the Federal Capital Territory, and to create a register of victims of abductions and other forms of mass atrocities.” Northern senators lament In March, senators from the 19 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory, under the aegis of Northern Senators’ Forum, decried the raging wave of killings and kidnapping in the North and urged decisive action to stop the trend. In a statement by their chairman, Senator Abdulaziz Yar’Adua, APC, Katsina Central, the senators said they would not rest until the security situation was brought under control and the perpetrators brought to justice. The statement read in part, “The distressing state of affairs concerning the recent wave of violence and kidnappings in the North is a major concern to the Northern Senators Forum. “The series of events that have unfolded in Kaduna State, beginning with the kidnapping of 286 students and staff from a school on March 7, the despicable attack on worshippers in a mosque on March 8, the abduction of 61 more persons on March 12, followed by 14 individuals on March 17, and a staggering total of 87 individuals in Kajuru on March 18, among others, are not only reprehensible but demand urgent and resolute action.” In an assessment of the President’s first year in office, a one-time member of the House of Representatives and elder statesman, Dr Usman Bugaje, accused the administration of lack of progress in addressing the nation’s pressing issues. During an interview on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Wednesday, Bugaje was asked about the government’s decision to mark Tinubu’s first year in office with a low-key approach, without any fanfare. In his response, Bugaje said, “Well, as Citizens and as people who have been in government, clearly the last year has been a tragedy. Simple. There is not one problem they have been able to solve, so I cannot see anything other than low-key. “I mean, I give them the sense that they are feeling the pressure, they can see the faces of Nigerians and so perhaps they are trying to see how they can assuage this anger because the people are angry.” Expressing concern over the government’s inability to address the country’s challenges, Bugaje stated, “Since this administration came one year ago, I’ve not seen one problem that they have solved. “If anything, the policies they started with have created far more problems than they found, and in this one year, they are clearly groping in the dark Highlighting the importance of measurable metrics in evaluating governance, Bugaje expressed disappointment and accused the government of a lack of a baseline established. “We as a nation should have by now developed metrics for evaluating governance. In the academic cycle, there are, and there are statistics. Every government should have come up with a baseline. “After one year, they will be able to say scientifically this is the production in terms of agriculture, what we found in 2023, and this last season we have improved by some metric tons. In the field of security, these are the figures we would have improved,” added. The victories However, the Minister of Defence, Muhammad Badaru, on Thursday, said the military killed over 9,300 bandits and insurgents in the last year under President Tinubu. He also said the service chiefs had been working closely against what was obtained in the past. According to him, this has increased their productivity and translated into laudable achievements in the last year. Speaking at the ministerial sectorial update in Abuja, Badaru noted that the synergy among the service chiefs and sister agencies led to the killing of over 9,300 bandits and insurgents, while 7,000 had so far been arrested in the last year. He said, “We have also recovered 4,882 assorted weapons and 83,900 assorted ammunition in just one year. Among those that we naturalised are bandits that you hear. We have neutralised not less than 20 bandit leaders that command armies of insurgents and terrorists in just one year.” Experts weigh in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation and fourth-largest economy is grappling with a persistent and multifaceted insecurity crisis that has left countless lives devastated. Killings and abductions have become tragically routine, affecting every corner of the country. This crisis, fuelled by a complex web of factors, demands a thorough examination and a concerted effort from all sectors of society to address its root causes and find lasting solutions. The insecurity in Nigeria is multifaceted, according to a renowned Sociology professor in the Department of Sociology, Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Imo State, Iheriohanma Ekeoma. Ekeoma explained that it is a combination of factors including economic disparity, political instability, ethnic tensions, and climate change. He said, “Nigeria’s economic inequality is stark, with a significant portion of the population living in poverty. This economic hardship fuels criminal activities as individuals and groups turn to banditry, kidnapping, and other forms of violence to survive. “Nigeria’s political landscape is often marred by corruption, weak governance, and a lack of accountability. This instability undermines efforts to address security challenges effectively. For instance, funds allocated for security purposes are frequently misappropriated, leaving security agencies ill-equipped to tackle the threats.” Speaking on ethnic tensions, the professor said, “Nigeria is home to over 250 ethnic groups, and tensions between these groups often result in violence. “Disputes over land, resources, and political power have led to deadly clashes, particularly between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers. The middle-belt region, including states like Benue and Plateau, has been a hotspot for such conflicts.” A security expert, Jackson Lekan-Ojo, said President Bola Tinubu has a lot of work to do as he enters his second year in government. He identified terrorism as a major fuel of insecurity in the country, stressing that the armed forces must do all within their powers to stamp out terrorists in the country. Also speaking, a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Political Science, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Enugu State, Dr Ugwueze Ikechukwu, said the human toll of Nigeria’s insecurity crisis was immense. “According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, over two million Nigerians are internally displaced, with many living in dire conditions in camps across the country. “The psychological impact of this violence is profound. Survivors of attacks often suffer from trauma and mental health issues, with little access to support services. Children are particularly vulnerable, as many have witnessed horrific violence or have been abducted and forced to join militant groups,” Ikechukwu added.",

        "description": "Hearing takes place Friday for Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer",
        "content": "Two animal activists who were convicted for their role in a 2019 protest at an Abbotsford hog farm will have an appeal of their sentences heard on Friday (May 31) in Vancouver. Amy Soranno and Nick Schafer of Kelowna are hoping to have the B.C. Court of Appeal set aside their 30-day jail sentences and re-sentence them to either a conditional discharge or a conditional sentence, which could include house arrest. The pair were among four people initially charged in relation to a protest on April 28, 2019 at the Excelsior Hog Farm. The group – who dubbed themselves the “Excelsior 4” – faced a total of 21 charges. Charges against Geoff Regier were later stayed, and Roy Sasano was acquitted at trial. Soranno and Schafer, who are spouses, were convicted in July 2022 of one count each of break-and-enter and sentenced in October 2022. They appealed their convictions on the basis that the trial judge erred when he wouldn’t allow the jury to see video footage obtained from hidden cameras that showed the alleged mistreatment of animals on the hog farm. The cameras had been placed by members of the Meat the Victims group, to which Soranno and Schafer belonged. The B.C. Court of Appeal in January of this year upheld the convictions. Soranno and Schaffer have since filed an application with the Supreme Court of Canada to appeal that decision. Meanwhile, they are appealing their sentences. In a press release issued Monday (May 27), the pair alleged that Soranno was “unceremoniously cut off” during her 2022 sentencing hearing and told by Justice Frits Verhoeven that “this is not the platform for you.” “According to the appeal brief, Verhoeven denied Soranno her ‘well-entrenched right to speak before being sentenced’ and additionally deprived the court of information relevant to her sentencing,” the press release states. The appeal brief states that the judge’s actions were “condescending, dismissive and illegal.” “Soranno and Schafer argue that Justice Verhoeven also erred by deciding their beliefs and morals were irrelevant to their culpability, a claim underscored by Verhoeven’s decision to use their political goals as a reason to impose a custodial sentence, basing it on denunciation and deterrence,” the release states. Soranno states that the judge “can’t have it both ways.” “Our reasons for engaging in non-violent civil disobedience is either relevant to our case or it’s not. We believe that exposing animal cruelty is a social imperative and highly relevant to our sentencing,” she said. Soranno and Schafer are planning to hold a press conference and rally outside of the B.C. Court of Appeal on Friday at 9 a.m. The hearing is scheduled to start at 10 a.m.",

In all, they conducted 366 corporate political activities (i.e. lobbying efforts) of which 82 (22%) involved criticizing the scientific data on which Health Canada based its recommendations and 76 (21%) involved submitting non-peer-reviewed, cherry-picked industry-friendly data. Those are the findings of a study published in the December 2023 issue of Health Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention in Canada . Lead author Marie-Chantal Robitaille is a master's student at Université de Montréal supervised by Jean-Claude Moubarac, a professor in the Department of Nutrition. Health Canada set up a committee to review the scientific literature and hold public consultations in order to update Canada's Food Guide on the basis of three guiding principles. To ensure transparency and avoid conflicts of interest, representatives of the food industry and industry-funded experts and scientists were excluded from the consultations. \"This decision by Health Canada was supported by the scientific literature and the World Health Organization, which has found that public-private collaboration can undermine the focus on the public interest and make it more difficult to establish public health policies ,\" said Robitaille. The previous version of the food guide was considered outdated by many health professionals, who criticized it as \"ineffective and lacking in credibility because it had become a marketing tool for certain products,\" she noted. Although excluded from the public consultations, food industry players expressed their views about the guidelines by submitting 11 briefs to the House Standing Committee on Health. Robitaille combed through these briefs and the websites of the 11 organizations that submitted them to survey their corporate political activities. Her analysis revealed four main strategies: \"I started by identifying the corporate political activities carried out by biofood industry players to influence the development of Canada's Food Guide and then documented and analyzed their discourses and positions on Health Canada's three guiding principles and the recommendations,\" Robitaille explained. Three organizations accounted for the bulk of the 366 examples of corporate political activity Robitaille found: Dairy Farmers of Canada (24%), the Canadian Juice Council, which also represents manufacturers of sweetened beverages and soft drinks (20%), and the National Cattle Feeder's Association (16%). The most common practices were information management (197 examples, or 53.8%) and discursive strategies (108 examples, or 29.5%). Within the information management category, the most frequently used strategy was suppressing information, which consisted mainly of criticizing the scientific evidence and emphasizing its complexity and uncertainty (98 examples or 27%). Robitaille pointed to the Egg Farmers of Canada brief, which argued that \"consultation and dialogue with both food producers and health professionals is an important step to ensure a balance of opinions are heard throughout the process.\" Similarly, the Canadian Meat Council maintained that it should be consulted because \"it had extensive expertise in nutrition and science, as well as experience in consumer education.\" According to Robitaille, the pressure from the agri-food industry on the committee charged with revising Canada's Food Guide and on Health Canada had no effect. \"This is a positive for Canada compared with other countries, where the food industry has succeeded in exerting considerable influence,\" said Robitaille. \"Studies show that the same strategies have been used in other jurisdictions, most notably in the United States, where companies banded together in 2010 to 2012 to fight government efforts to combat obesity.\" According to the article, one of the industry's main tactics was to \"exaggerate the cost of the proposed changes, using an alarmist narrative suggesting that the proposed recommendations will fail and that many undesirable health and economic problems will affect the whole of society.\" Principle No. 1: A variety of nutritious foods and beverages is the foundation for healthy eating. Health Canada recommends: Principle No. 2: Processed or prepared foods and beverages high in sodium, sugars or saturated fat undermine healthy eating. Health Canada recommends: Principle No. 3: Knowledge and skills are needed to navigate the complex food environment and support healthy eating.

        "content": "Researchers at Edith Cowan University (ECU) are investigating the effects ellagic acid, an antioxidant found in some fruits and vegetables, could have on halting and potentially reversing the damage caused by fatty liver disease. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the physiological manifestation of obesity in the liver. The prevalence of NAFLD has increased from 25.24% in 2015 to 29.38% in 2021, and this condition now accounts for 45.8% of all cases of chronic-liver-disease-related deaths worldwide. There currently exists no treatment for the long-term management of NAFLD; however, dietary interventions have been investigated for the treatment of this disease, including several polyphenolic compounds such as ellagic acid. ECU researcher Dr. Lois Balmer and Ph.D. student Mrs. Tharani Senavirathna noted that ellagic acid, which is found in a variety of food such as raspberries , pomegranate , blackberries, and pecan nuts, is widely recognized for its antioxidant properties, but also exhibits anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and anticancer properties. The paper is published in the journal Antioxidants . \"Ellagic acid stands out as a remarkable polyphenolic compound, possessing a wide range of pharmacological properties that hold promise in treating various chronic diseases, including NAFLD. \"Due to its multifaceted biological effects, edible plants containing ellagic acid, and its derivatives are recognized as valuable functional foods for enhancing human health. Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that ellagic acid, when combined with other antioxidant nutraceuticals, exhibits a synergistic therapeutic effect, making it a potential candidate for combination therapy .\" Mrs. Senavirathna was involved in a previously undertaken pilot study investigating the effects of several polyphenolic compounds on NAFLD, with ellagic acid showing the most promise in reducing inflammation. A larger study is now under way which will also investigate at which point of the illness treatment would be ineffective to reverse damage to the liver.

        "content": "This positive development was revealed in the MAN CEO’s Confidence Index Report (MCCI) for Q1’24, released recently. The MCCI serves as an index to gauge changes in the quarterly outlook of CEOs of manufacturing firms concerning government policies and macroeconomic indicators. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, Director General of MAN, commented on the report, stating, “The moderate improvement in the Aggregate Index Score (AIS), from 51.8 points to 53.5 points, signifies a positive shift in the manufacturing sector’s sentiment. This suggests a trajectory towards restoration and recovery, potentially reaching levels observed in Q3 2022, with optimism for further improvement in the coming quarter.” He attributed this improvement to the resilience of manufacturers, recent gains made by the Naira, anticipated reduction in diesel prices, and expectations regarding the seamless disbursement of presidential intervention funds for the sector. However, Ajayi-Kadir cautioned that despite these positive indicators, emerging policies may pose challenges to this optimism. Highlighting the significance of the manufacturing sector in driving economic growth and fostering prosperity, Ajayi-Kadir emphasized the need for the government to prioritize the sector by providing necessary policy support and incentives.

        "content": "An artificial pancreas developed by researchers at the University of Cambridge has been granted approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use by individuals with type 1 diabetes aged 2 and older, including during pregnancy. This means that even more people living with the disease will be able to use this life-changing app. For the first time, the FDA authorized the use of the artificial pancreas system in pregnancy. CamAPS FX, produced by Cambridge spinout company CamDiab, is an Android app that can be used to help manage glucose levels in people with type 1 diabetes, including during pregnancy. The app allows a compatible insulin pump and a compatible continuous glucose monitor to 'talk to each other,\" creating an artificial pancreas. The CamAPS FX closed loop algorithm was given FDA authorization on Thursday 23 May. It had already been CE-marked for use in the UK and the EU. CamAPS FX creator Roman Hovorka is Professor of Metabolic Technology at the Institute of Metabolic Science and Department of Pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, where the technology was developed. He said, \"We set out to help people with type 1 diabetes and their families live better lives and we're delighted that the FDA has reviewed the safety and effectiveness of CamAPS FX and has given the technology its approval.\" \"It has been extensively tested and we're proud that it is considered by many to be the best algorithm out there.\" CamAPS FX is already used by more than 27,000 people in 15 countries across Europe and Australia. Artificial pancreas systems such as CamAPS FX have been granted approval for wide use by the NHS in November 2023 by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).",

        "content": "The College of Southern Nevada’s baseball team appeared to have things under control through six innings Monday. Florence-Darlington Tech (South Carolina) had other plans. Tyman Long and Jet Gilliam hit home runs to lead CSN, but the Coyotes gave up a six-run lead in the late innings to fall to the Stingers 9-8 in their second-round game of the National Junior College Athletic Association World Series at Grand Junction, Colorado. The loss dropped the ninth-seeded Coyotes (52-11) to the losers bracket. They will play an elimination game against No. 5 Crowder (Missouri) at 9 a.m. Tuesday. “It’s tough losing those types of games,” CSN coach Nick Garritano said. “(Florence-Darlington Tech) just did a great job on the offensive side and they kept chipping away. They just kept hitting the ball where we weren’t.” The eighth-seeded Stingers (53-10) got on the board first with a second-inning solo home run by Zack Hunt off Coyotes starter Naun Haro. Long, whose 10th-inning homer against Northwest Florida State College lifted the Coyotes to victory Saturday, belted a three-run blast in the third inning to put CSN ahead 3-1. Florence-Darlington Tech cut its deficit to 3-2 in the fourth. CSN responded by tacking on two more runs in the fifth. The Coyotes then extended their lead to 8-2 in the sixth thanks to a two-run homer by Gilliam and an RBI single by Garrison Geis. “It was a great feeling to know we had the thing in hand,” Garritano said. “But we did lose some opportunities in the early and middle innings that could have made the difference.” Haro’s effectiveness on the mound waned in the bottom of the sixth. Florence-Darlington Tech got within 8-5 with the help of a two-run double by Mac James. A trio of CSN relievers fared no better in the eighth. The Stingers jumped ahead 9-8 with four runs on three hits and an error. “I’m the head coach and I’ve got to make the right decisions,” Garritano said. “I trust my pitchers, but they’re kids and you’ve got to give credit to a really good team.” Michael Cruz went 2-for-3 with an RBI to help CSN. Tyler Ray (0-1) suffered the loss. “Our backs will be against the wall tomorrow,” Garritano said. “So, we’ll see what we’re made of. We’ve been in the losers bracket before and we’re going to play hard for nine innings.”",

        "content": "A WAILING mother held her four-year-old daughter's tiny hand for the last time after her heart was pierced by shrapnel from one of Putin's missiles. Nadiia Rostochyl and her husband Viacheslav buried little Zlata in a coffin filled to the brim with flowers, dolls and teddy bears. The child was buried in Odesa , southern Ukraine - a city Russia has been relentlessly pounding with aerial attacks in an attempt to decimate the key port city. On Sunday, an entire community came together to grieve the loss of Zlata whose heart gave up after she bravely fought for nearly a month to stay alive. Her mother was pictured clinging onto her hand next to the small coffin and staring into her eyes that would never open again. Zlata's home city had been bombarded with ballistic missiles and illegal cluster munitions on April 29. The strike took out a university building and the Odesa Law Academy, dubbed the \"Harry Potter Castle\", killing eight and injuring over 30 , including another child and a pregnant women. Footage from the attack showed Odesans watching in horror as the landmark buildings crumbled and burned and firefighters frantically attempted to save the victims. Local student Maria said at the time: \"In front of my eyes, a missile was shot down, this was just in front of me. \"My doors were blown open and the glass was shaking. And then I saw this.\" As of last month, the UN says that roughly 600 children have been killed and 1,350 injured since the start of the war 27 months ago. Moscow has been accused of deliberately targeting Ukrainian children , especially through its illegal deportation of children into Russia. Last year, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin and Russia's commissioner for children's rights Maria Lvova-Belova for war crimes against kids. In Kharkiv, another frontline city and the focus of Russia's new offensive , The Sun watched as a Ukrainian soldier wedded his sweetheart before heading to fight. The number of couples tying the knot in the bomb-blitzed region rose by 11 per cent to 10,977 as troops fear they might not make it back. It comes as Ukraine carried out its deepest ever drone strike 1,120 miles inside Russia. The attack targeted radar systems and even buzzed close to Putin's £1billion Black Sea fortress palace as it hit infrastructure nearby.",

        "content": "A WAILING mother held her four-year-old daughter's tiny hand for the last time after her heart was pierced by shrapnel from one of Putin's missiles. Nadiia Rostochyl and her husband Viacheslav buried little Zlata in a coffin filled to the brim with flowers, dolls and teddy bears. The child was buried in Odesa , southern Ukraine - a city Russia has been relentlessly pounding with aerial attacks in an attempt to decimate the key port city. On Sunday, an entire community came together to grieve the loss of Zlata whose heart gave up after she bravely fought for nearly a month to stay alive. Her mother was pictured clinging onto her hand next to the small coffin and staring into her eyes that would never open again. Zlata's home city had been bombarded with ballistic missiles and illegal cluster munitions on April 29. The strike took out a university building and the Odesa Law Academy, dubbed the \"Harry Potter Castle\", killing eight and injuring over 30 , including another child and a pregnant women. Footage from the attack showed Odesans watching in horror as the landmark buildings crumbled and burned and firefighters frantically attempted to save the victims. Local student Maria said at the time: \"In front of my eyes, a missile was shot down, this was just in front of me. \"My doors were blown open and the glass was shaking. And then I saw this.\" As of last month, the UN says that roughly 600 children have been killed and 1,350 injured since the start of the war 27 months ago. Moscow has been accused of deliberately targeting Ukrainian children , especially through its illegal deportation of children into Russia. Last year, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin and Russia's commissioner for children's rights Maria Lvova-Belova for war crimes against kids. In Kharkiv, another frontline city and the focus of Russia's new offensive , The Sun watched as a Ukrainian soldier wedded his sweetheart before heading to fight. The number of couples tying the knot in the bomb-blitzed region rose by 11 per cent to 10,977 as troops fear they might not make it back. It comes as Ukraine carried out its deepest ever drone strike 1,120 miles inside Russia. The attack targeted radar systems and even buzzed close to Putin's £1billion Black Sea fortress palace as it hit infrastructure nearby.",

Via , Myers wrote: “Also, Textor is not on his own with regards to having an interest in buying the club.” Toffees fans have long awaited news of a change in ownership, as the tenure of Moshiri has been marked by significant discontent and the subsequent involvement of 777 Partners has only added to the turmoil. The potential takeover by Textor, a Crystal Palace co-owner, represents a beacon of hope for a fanbase that has grown increasingly disillusioned with the current leadership. The American’s interest suggests a serious intent to invest in the club and steer it towards a more stable and successful future. This is particularly welcome news in light of the failed takeover by 777 Partners, which has left the club in a state of uncertainty. The prospect of new ownership offers the promise of fresh investment, improved decision-making and a renewed sense of direction for the club. Also, Textor is not on his own with regards to having an interest in buying the club Moreover, the fact that Textor is not alone in his pursuit to buy the club is paramount as this could mean more investment and potentially a chance to take the club to the next level.

Sailing from its homeport of Long Beach in Southern California, the cruise ship responded to a call from the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Saturday about a small boat full of people who were stranded at sea in the area. According to the cruise line, Carnival Radiance was sailing toward Ensenada, Mexico, Saturday afternoon when they got the call from the Coast Guard. Carnival said the ship was then routed to the location provided and they were able to rescue all 25 people, including three children, who were stranded on a small boat. The Coast Guard said it also launched a small boat and helicopter to assist. Carnival said it then provided food, water and medical assistance to the rescued boaters, while a rendezvous was coordinated with Coast Guard officials. The cruise line noted Carnival Radiance’s three-day cruise from Long Beach will remain on schedule despite the small detour to rescue the boaters in need.",

        "description": "Michael Dunlop fired in a 129mph lap to lead the Superbike times as the 2024 Isle of Man TT roared into life on Monday.",
        "content": "The Ballymoney man stands on the brink of history at the event, when two more wins would ensure he becomes the most successful rider ever at the legendary Mountain Course spectacle ahead of his uncle Joey. Dunlop is poised on 25 victories and made a strong start to practice week, which was delayed by four hours due to fog and wet roads after overnight rain. His 129.59mph lap on the Hawk Racing Honda was set from a standing start, with the 35-year-old’s time squeezing out Davey Todd on the Milwaukee BMW by only 0.114s, who lapped at 129.575mph on his second lap of the 37.73-mile Mountain Course. Peter Hickman, last year’s Senior TT winner, was third fastest after a lap of 128.721mph on the Monster Energy by FHO Racing BMW. Hickman, a 13-time TT winner, is nursing a hand injury after a crash-hit British Superbike round at Oulton Park prior to the North West 200. The 37-year-old said the gruelling nature of the TT course was taking its toll on his badly bruised left hand. “It is what it is,” said Hickman. “It’s bruised bones in my left hand and it’s probably worse than a break because it takes so long to get fixed, and it will be a couple of months before it’s normal. “It’s good it’s my left hand and not my right. I have full movement and strength but the biggest problem is pain – it just hurts. “It’s super bumpy here so it gets banged about,” he added. “Overall I’m happy enough and it’s steady away.” Honda Racing UK’s John McGuinness was fourth fastest in the Superbike class at 127.646mph, 8.8s back on Hickman, with team-mate Dean Harrison in fifth on the early leaderboard after lapping at 125.909mph. Young prospect James Hind had an impressive first night as he slotted into sixth on the North Lincs Components Suzuki ahead of James Hillier (WTF Racing Honda). Australian rider Josh Brookes had a lucky escape after hitting a bird at Bray Hill which completely shattered the screen of his FHO Racing BMW. Hickman set the pace in Superstock qualifying, lapping at 129.032mph to lead Dunlop by 1.322s after the Ballymoney man clocked 128.87mph on his MD Racing Honda. Dominic Herbertson was almost 11 seconds down on Dunlop after a solid start for Dungannon team Burrows Engineering/RK Racing on the BMW M1000RR. “This place is just amazing, how are we allowed to do this,” Herbertson exclaimed. “I’m with the Burrows team and I feel like a bit of spare part because I’m used to having a couple of mates with me and running around look for this and that, but now I just have to turn up and ride the bikes.” In the Supersport class, North West 200 winner Todd made a promising start on the Powertoolmate Ducati with a speed of 125.601mph after two laps, which put him 1.014s ahead of Hillier (Bournemouth Kawasaki). Dunlop, winner of the last four Supersport TT races, was a further 3.768s adrift on his new MD Racing Triumph after lapping at 125.048mph. Hind featured prominently again in fourth on the North Lincs Components Suzuki 750, almost five seconds behind Dunlop. Double NW200 Supertwin winner Hickman led the times in the class on the Swan Yamaha with a lap of 118mph. Todd was 19.3s behind on the Dafabet Kawasaki in second place, while Dunlop – a Supertwin TT winner last year – was forced out on his Paton machine at Greeba. In the Sidecar class, Ryan and Callum Crowe were fastest at 116.70mph from Ben Birchall and new passenger Kevin Rousseau (115.88mph). Practice is scheduled to continue on Tuesday evening, with roads closed from 6pm.",

        "content": "The 2023 presidential candidate of the African Action Congress, Omoyele Sowore, has knocked President Bola Tinubu over his style of leadership and the level of poverty in the country. Sowore spoke in Benin, Edo State capital on Friday, at the party’s campaign flag-off ceremony ahead of the state governorship elections coming up on September 21. He said Tinubu has failed to make a meaningful impact on the development and economic growth of the country. He said almost a year into his administration, people are grappling with poverty and pain brought upon them by policies that have further impoverished them. He said, “The leadership style of President Tinubu is bad and the poverty that the people are experiencing is alarming. “Tinubu has failed to make a meaningful impact in the development and economic growth of the country almost a year into his administration while people are grappling with poverty and pain brought upon them by policies that have further impoverished them.” He, however, expressed the hope that the country would one day bounce back if only the people were allowed to take charge of their affairs.

        "description": "Former Atomic Kitten star Kerry Katona has revealed she will be moving our of her £2million mansion next month with her fiancé Ryan Mahoney as her children fly the nest",
        "content": "As her children leave the nest for their own ventures, has announced she is moving out of her lavish house for a smaller property. The 43-year-old is looking to move out of her sprawling £2million Cheshire pad to settle into a more manageable home. The former Atomic Kitten has previously been travelling back and forth to Marbella with her fiancé Ryan Mahoney. But as her daughter Lilly-Sue, 21, and Heidi, 16, share their plans to move out of the family home, the mum-of-five and her beau have decided to stay in the North of England. In her exclusive column for OK! Magazine on Monday (May 27), the hitmaker confessed that despite moving out in June, she has not started packing up yet. She wrote: “We’re moving next month, and we haven’t packed a single thing. We are not prepared! I’m going to be really sad to leave this house, because it’s gorgeous and we really get along with our neighbours. It’s a shame. “But at the same time, I want a house to feel really homely and this one is just so big, I can’t keep on top of it.” She went on to add that she hopes in her smaller home “there will be less mess for me to tidy up after the kids.” Kerry added that her new home is “still close by for DJ’s school” and will be the perfect spot for her younger children. The TV favourite is the proud mother of five – Molly Marie and Lilly whom she shares with her ex-husband Brian McFadden. She also welcomed Heidi and Max from her marriage with taxi driver Mark Croft. The star gave birth to her youngest daughter DJ during her marriage with the late George Kay. The proud mum recently shared the news that Heidi, 21, had landed a sport a at a coveted music school in Ireland. The star later announced that 17-year-old Lilly would also be leaving home to move to Liverpool, where she is enrolled in a performing arts school. But it hasn’t been plain sailing for the happy couple since. Kerry hinted at trouble in paradise earlier this month when she moved in with her mother after she went under the knife. Earlier this month, Kerry decided to get a nose job which had been damaged by past drug abuse. In her column, the TV star thanked her mum for her continued support and “really looked after me” following her operation. She then admitted that she had felt “unsupported” by her other half who zipped down to London to get a tattoo at the time of her operation. Kerry confessed: “I haven’t seen him since my surgery over a week ago. “That upset me, because it made me feel unsupported and I could have done with that emotional support.”",

        "description": "Boston's pitching staff has been better than expected, while its offense has struggled, but the Red Sox are still in the mix.",
        "content": "Tanner Houck had another strong outing on Sunday, allowing one run in six innings to help the Red Sox beat the Brewers, 2-1, at Fenway Park in Boston. Steven Senne/Associated Press This was a good weekend to take stock in the Red Sox. Memorial Day is a signpost in the annual baseball season. We’re just about one-third of the way through the campaign. It’s a chance to assess a team and figure out where it stands. The simple answer is, we have no idea. Still. The Red Sox are 27-27 after an 11-3 loss to Baltimore on Monday, and in third place in the AL East. That’s better than most people expected from this team. It is also one full game behind where the Red Sox were through 54 games last year. No one is holding 2023 up as a standard worth repeating. One of the most impressive aspects of the Red Sox start has been their pitching. The Red Sox hit Memorial Day with the second-lowest ERA in the majors, but that has steadily crept up. Boston’s ERA is over 3.97 since mid-May, and Red Sox pitching ran into a buzzsaw over the weekend when the Brewers came to town. Milwaukee scored 13 runs in the first two games at Fenway, and showed an advanced approach against Red Sox pitchers. The Brewers refused to expand the strike zone and wouldn’t go after breaking pitches outside the strike zone. “They didn’t chase a whole lot, I noticed, like in some of my previous outings” starting pitcher Kutter Crawford told reporters after Boston’s 7-2 loss Friday. “They’re good hitters. They’ve got a good approach. They don’t chase a whole lot and make you get in the zone.” It was almost like the Brewers figured out the cheat code to break the spell Sox starters have been casting on major league hitters this spring. The plan of attack has been to throw fewer four-seam fastballs and to focus on breaking pitches with east-west movement. It has worked for the better part of two months. It worked well again on Sunday, when Tanner Houck lowered his ERA to 1.90 with six brilliant innings in a 2-1 win that saw tempers flare and benches empty in the seventh inning. The fire brought the Fenway crowd to life, as did Jarren Duran’s single an inning later that drove in the winning run. Jarren Duran drove in the go-ahead run in the eighth inning of the Red Sox’s 2-1 win over the Brewers on Sunday at Fenway Park in Boston. Boston improved to 9-0 on Sundays. Steven Senne/Associated Press The Sox are 9-0 on Sundays this season, and taking the final game of a weekend ensures you don’t get swept. Manager Alex Cora needs to start taking his team to church, or brunch, every morning to make that Sunday feeling a daily ritual. He also needs to get them to play better at home. The Red Sox fell to 11-15 at home this season, the third-worst mark in the American League and by far the worst in the division. The Red Sox are 50-57 at home going back to the start of last season. If you can’t win at home, you almost certainly won’t win a playoff spot. The mere fact that we are talking about the possibility of a wild-card spot is a testament to how this team has exceeded expectations early in the season. Experts had them headed for the basement in the AL East. While they are closer to last place than first, they have kept their heads above water and are ahead of the Rays and the Blue Jays. The Red Sox have been far from perfect. They have given up a staggering 37 unearned runs this season, a reminder their defense is fragile at best. The offense has been inconsistent, especially with runners on. They have run into outs. All of that speaks to a collection of young players. So does the excitement they flash at times. It’s been a fun, if occasionally frustrating, team to watch. “I know what we are as a team,” Cora told reporters after Sunday’s game. “There are things we have to do better but I bet there’s a lot of people a little surprised at what we’re doing. But if we continue to do those things, we’re going to be in the mix.” That’s more than anyone expected this season. Even if staying in the mix has come with mixed results along the way.

        "content": "Powerline tampering has been on the rise over the last 10 days. Photo: File image Senior Sergeant Roy Appley said reports of powerline tampering and copper and electrical supply thefts have increased over the past 10 days. \"Incidents are occurring across Christchurch, including multiple central locations such as Disraeli St in Addington, the area surrounding Hillview Rd and Phillips Rd in Phillipstown and Brougham St, they are as wide spanning as West Melton, Halswell, and Marshlands. \"Police have informed community patrol and frontline police units on what to look out for and have communicated with businesses and residents in affected areas.\" Officers are also talking to scrap metal dealers as part of the investigation, Appley said. \"On multiple recent occasions powerline tampering and the theft of copper from the powerlines have led to power outages on affected streets. \"Typically once the offenders get what they want, the powerlines are left in an exposed and dangerous state. \"In one occasion powerlines were tampered with and left broken outside of a Phillip St pre-school. \"Fortunately, no one has been harmed, but as far as police are concerned it is only a matter of time.\" In February, three men were charged over powerline tampering and electrical thefts in the Bromley area. “Our message to offenders is to stop this behaviour before someone, including yourself, gets hurt. “You are putting yourselves and others at extreme risk of electrocution, for such a small return. \"We are appealing to the public for any information that could assist in identifying and locating those involved. “If you hear anything out of the ordinary overnight, do not think nothing of it. “We need Christchurch residents to be aware of the risk of exposed or damaged wires – do not touch them and call Orion on 0800 363 9898 straight away,” said Appley. Residents should call 111 if they see anyone acting suspiciously around power poles and lines or phone 105 after the fact.",

The tone and tenor of the crucial meeting of the State executive of Mr. Pawar’s NCP faction in Mumbai on Monday saw Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, along with other senior leaders like Chhagan Bhujbal and Sunil Tatkare already making noises about getting a larger share of seats from its partners in the Mahayuti government — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s Shiv Sena — in the Assembly election likely to be held in October this year. “Elections are a test for party workers. No one should be over-the-top with joy following an election victory, nor should one be disheartened by defeat,” said Mr. Pawar while addressing his party workers at the meet. Minister Chhagan Bhujbal made it clear that the NCP would have to be given a larger share of seats in the Assembly election than it had received in the general election this year. 80-90 constituencies: Bhujbal “Only if we are given 80-90 seats [of the total 288 Assembly seats in Maharashtra] can we hope to win 50 or 60 of them. Whatever may have happened this time [Lok Sabha seat-sharing process], but in the coming election, the NCP should get its rightful share of seats. When we entered [the Mahayuti coalition], we were told we would be given our fair share of seats,” Mr. Bhujbal said. Mr. Pawar also staked claim to the Satara Rajya Sabha seat during the course of his address. Mr. Pawar, who split the NCP founded by his uncle Sharad Pawar in July last year, had been given only four Lok Sabha seats — Baramati, Shirur, Raigad, Dharashiv — of the total 48 in the Mahayuti’s seat-sharing formula. The BJP, being the largest party in the State in terms of number of MPs, had fielded candidates on 29 Lok Sabha seats. However, Mr. Shinde had driven a hard bargain with his saffron ally, managing to secure 15 Lok Sabha seats in the Shiv Sena’s kitty. This had upset Mr. Pawar’s NCP faction, which had been importuning the BJP high command for at least eight Lok Sabha seats. ‘BJP will contest most seats’ Meanwhile, responding to Mr. Bhujbal’s remarks, BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said the BJP would get the maximum seats to contest the Assembly election as it was numerically the biggest party. At the same time, Mr. Fadnavis assured that the BJP’s Mahayuti allies would be accorded due respect in the seat-sharing process. “Leaders of all the three parties of the Mahayuti alliance will sit together to decide a proper seat-sharing formula for the Assembly election. Obviously, BJP will get the maximum number of seats as it is the biggest party. However, our allies will be shown due respect in the process,” he said. In the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly election, the BJP had won 105 seats, while its then ally — the undivided Shiv Sena led by Uddhav Thackeray had won 56 seats. The undivided Nationalist Congress Party, which was part of the opposition Congress-led UPA, had won 41 seats.

        "content": "Mike Tyson suffered a medical scare on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles on Monday (AEST). In Touch Weekly provided the first details of the scary scene, labelling it an “apparent medical scare”. “Mike had some kind of medical emergency on the plane and paramedics boarded,” a source told the outlet. “Before the paramedics arrived the flight issued an announcement asking for a doctor — the message even came on everyone’s screens. The publication did not know whether Tyson, 57, was removed from the flight, which had been delayed two hours in Miami. The reported medical scare delayed passengers leaving the plane for 25 minutes. “He was in first class, but we were in an exit row and the stewardess was very chatty. They asked us to stay on the plane and landed so paramedics could enter,” a source told In Touch Weekly. “She said something like, ‘He’s a really important passenger so we wanna make sure he’s OK’. I knew it was him, but I just mouthed the words ‘Mike Tyson’ and she nodded her head yes.” Tyson, who turns 58 next month, is scheduled to fight Jake Paul on July 20 in Dallas in his return to the ring. The former heavyweight champion last fought a sanctioned fight in June 2005, although he battled Roy Jones Jr. to a draw in a November 2020 exhibition. It’s led to concerns about whether he should be stepping in the ring against Paul, but his representatives insisted Tyson is “doing great” in an email to the New York Post. “He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing,” the email read. “He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him.” Mike Tyson has suffered a scary medical issue before his upcoming fight against Jake Paul. Picture: Sarah Stier/Getty Images Source: Getty Images Tyson said earlier this month that he’s going to defeat Paul in what has been officially sanctioned by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulations as a heavyweight bout. His training regiment has included him giving up sex and marijuana. “He couldn’t even knock out [Nate] Diaz,” Tyson said of Paul. “Diaz is 40 pounds. He’s going to knock me out? Anderson Silva. He couldn’t even knock out the little guys, how’s he going to knock me out? . He never knocked out a real man, come on. He didn’t knock out Tommy Fury. I’m going to f–k Jake up.” Paul, as to be expected, believes he’ll end Tyson’s career with a loss. “But what I promise to the people on July 20th: Mike will be put to sleep and he will feel my power,” Paul said. “I will go down as the man who put Tyson to sleep for the last time.” This article was originally published by the New York Post and reproduced with permission",

'Mathew also kept the news quiet because he prefers to live his life out of the spotlight, even though he’s a household name thanks to Gavin & Stacey. 'All his Gavin & Stacey co-stars know about him being a dad, including James Corden and Joanna Page. 'They all have kids so you can imagine the talk on set for the Christmas special is going to centre a lot on their kids.'

        "content": "Britain's Got Talent fans spotted a big problem with the show's first live semi-final tonight. A total of eight acts performed including Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, Stardust, with singer Innocent Massuki closing the show with an impressive performance. However, fans were left puzzled by the decision to have so many Golden Buzzer acts in the first show. Normally, each judge - Bruno Tonioli , Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, and Alesha Dixon, plus hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly get one Golden Buzzer each. However, they broke the rules and several judges gave out more than one. As the first semi-final aired tonight, fans were puzzled to see so many Golden Buzzer acts in the first show. Ssaulabi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Duo Stardust were all Golden Buzzer acts, and they all performed tonight. Taryn got a Golden Buzzer during the auditions ( Image: Dymond/Thames/REX/Shutterstock) One wrote: \"Are they doing all the golden buzzers tonight? Seems odd #BGT #BritainsGotTalent ,\" whilst a second added: \"What's with so many golden buzzer acts tonight? #BritainsGotTalent .\" A third shared: \"May aswell rename it the Golden Buzzer show at this rate, featuring a man in a bag #britainsgottalent ,\" with a fourth adding: \"Most of the golden buzzers are on tonight I noticed.\" \"Haven't watched the auditions. How many golden buzzers are there?! Last time I watched they had one each and out one in each semi-final?! #BritainsGotTalent ,\" a fifth penned, as a sixth added: \"Every act tonight is a golden buzzer act?? This show is silly #BritainsGotTalent .\" A seventh wrote: \"Why are they putting all the golden buzzer acts on tonight? There's only meant to be 4 and I'm sure I've seen 3 already #bgt britainsgottalent .\" This year, there was nine Golden Buzzers in total. Speaking about his decision to allow it, Simon shared: \"Well, the truth is, honestly, when I watched the yes tapes back, I thought there were about another 17 acts who easily could have had a golden buzzer. That’s how good the talent is this year. But look, I think eight or nine is the absolute limit. I don't think you could ever really go beyond nine, well, maybe 10 at a push! But I always listen to the audience and the feedback I got was they enjoyed seeing more golden buzzers.\" * Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .",

        "content": "An American quarry company on Monday rejected the Mexican president’s campaign of criticisms and closures, as well as his offer to buy its property on the Caribbean coast. In July, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador offered to buy the American company’s Caribbean coast property for about $385 million amid a bitter, years-long dispute. Alabama-based Vulcan Materials said in a statement Monday that offer “substantially undervalues our assets.” In papers filed on the case in an international arbitration panel, Vulcan Materials valued the almost 6,000-acre (2,400 hectare) property, located just south of the resort town of Playa del Carmen, at $1.9 billion. The Mexican president has in the past threatened to expropriate the extensive property, claiming the pits it has dug to extract crushed limestone have damaged the fragile system of underground rivers and caves in the area. But Vulcan Materials rejected the charge. “Our operations have not adversely affected underground caves, cenotes or archaeological sites. In fact, we have mapped, protected and preserved these valuable resources,” the company said in a statement. Instead, the company alleged that some other quarries in the area have been operating unlawfully. “Unlike other quarrying sites that have been operating unlawfully to supply the Mayan Train, our operations were duly permitted,” the company said. The Mayan Train is a pet project of López Obrador to build a tourist train around the Yucatan peninsula. Activists, cave divers and archeologist say the project has damaged the caves, which hold some of the oldest human remains in North America. The president’s office had no immediate reaction to Vulcan’s allegations. López Obrador has said in the past that the most attractive part of the property was the company’s freight shipping dock — the only deep port on the coast’s mainland — which he plans to turn into a dock for cruise ships. He says he wants to turn the rest of the property into a natural reserve. “The Mexican government is using these political threats and false allegations to try to justify converting our property into a “naturally protected area,” which could — ironically — be used not to protect the environment but for commercial tourism purposes and naval operations, including cruise ship activity”, the company said. López Obrador said he also wants to use the flooded pits that the company dug out of hundreds of acres of the limestone soil as “swimming pools” or an “ecotourism” area that would be operated as a concession by a private operator. The huge pits are inhabited by crocodiles, which are a protected species in Mexico. The company’s dock at Punta Venado is the only one in the area that can handle cement, crushed stone and other shipments for the Maya Train. The 950-mile (1,500-kilometer) Maya Train line is meant to run in a rough loop around the Yucatan Peninsula, connecting beach resorts and archaeological sites. López Obrador touts the train as a way to bring some of Cancun’s tourism income to inland communities that haven’t shared in the wealth. But there are no credible feasibility studies showing tourists would want to use the train.",

        "description": "The 26-year-old has struggled for Manchester United this season and was left out of England’s training squad for Euro 2024.",
        "content": "Marcus Rashford is planning to take some time to reset mentally after acknowledging he has endured a “challenging season”. The England forward was left out of Gareth Southgate’s training squad for Euro 2024 after scoring just eight goals in all competitions for a struggling Manchester United side who finished eighth in the Premier League. But after helping his club end the season on a high by beating Manchester City in Saturday’s FA Cup final, the 26-year-old will now look to make the most of his summer of rest. And as he announced his decision to step away from his social media accounts for a few weeks, Rashford – who last month said “enough is enough” after receiving online abuse – responded again to his critics. He wrote on X: “It’s time to come off socials for a few weeks. I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. “Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. To the ones that didn’t, just remember at United, we always stick together.” Team-mate Luke Shaw did make Southgate’s provisional squad despite injuries restricting him to only 15 appearances for United this season, the last of them in February. The full-back has addressed criticism over his apparent availability for his country, but not his club. Shaw posted on Instagram: “I don’t normally react to things I see on social media, but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United. “The reality is I am not 100 per cent fit for either right now, but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. “I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating.” Meanwhile, team-mate Anthony Martial bade an emotional farewell to the club after confirming his nine-year stay at Old Trafford was over. The 28-year-old France international joined the Red Devils in a £36million move from Monaco in September 2015, but has not played a senior game since December after undergoing groin surgery and his departure was widely expected. In a statement on Instagram, he said: “It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion.” During his time in England, Martial has won the Carabao Cup, the FA Cup and the Europa League, but has struggled for consistency and slipped out of the reckoning under current boss Erik ten Hag. In 2019 during Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign, he signed a contract up until this summer with the option of a further 12 months.",

        "description": "Indigenous culture took centre stage in Super Netball First Nations Round, but what are the clubs doing in National Reconciliation Week to form an authentic connection with community? Meanwhile, the Fever have finally been dethroned after a six-week winning streak.",
        "content": "Wow, that went fast! Week seven marked the midway point of the Super Netball season and the first half of First Nations Round. The action began on Kabi Kabi Country, where the Sunshine Coast Lightning made it two wins in a row to claim Queensland Derby bragging rights against the Firebirds, 76-65. A grand final re-match between the Adelaide Thunderbirds and NSW Swifts on Kaurna Country saw the visiting team succumb to the lowest-ever Super Netball score in history, 58-33. Yes, you read that right. The Melbourne Mavericks' drought at home continued as they lost 66-59 to the Giants in Naarm. Before the Melbourne Vixens became the first team this season to beat the West Coast Fever in stunning fashion in Boorloo, 76-65. If you missed it, don't worry — we'll get you up to speed with our Super Netball Round-Up. First Nations Round, part one One of the key differences in fixtures this season has been the split of First Nations Round. Previously, the league held its celebration of Indigenous culture across back-to-back rounds during National Reconciliation Week (May 27- June 3) to allow each club a chance to host. But this year, Super Netball has a larger gap between the two rounds so that the first was held right before National Reconciliation Week in round seven and the second aligns with the start of NAIDOC Week (July 7 – July 14) in round 13. The shift on the Super Netball calendar was recommended by First Nations engagement lead and Kamilaroi woman Ali Tucker-Munro, who was appointed in her role in July 2023. The sport has made important steps in this space since its – such as its recent introduction of an named the Black Swans. Netball takes a significant step in its commitment to increase the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander athletes, introducing an inaugural First Nations team to compete against World Cup talent at the Pacific Aus Sport Netball Series. \"The reason for separating the rounds and playing in the lead-up to National Reconciliation Week was because it sets the tone,\" Tucker-Munro said. \"The week is all about reflection and for non-Indigenous Australians to recognise what they need to do to be part of the reconciliation journey. \"The intent was to give all of netball's member organisations and Super Netball teams the opportunity to demonstrate what they're doing in partnership with our communities, because that's the missing piece. \"Instead of sitting there and either thinking or saying, 'Our sport needs to do better,' people need to recognise that they have to be part of that change as much as anyone else. \"So, what does reconciliation mean to you as a non-Indigenous Australian and what are you doing in the other 50 weeks of the year to make a change at your team, club or association level? \"That's what's important to our community, because we as First Nations people can sense if something is inauthentic from a mile away.\" Most grassroots associations will be hosting activities this upcoming Saturday and Sunday during the actual week, and Tucker-Munro reiterates it was Super Netball's job to amplify its \"Join in the Journey\" message ahead of time to set an example for the entire ecosystem. The fact remains that just two of Super Netball's 80 full-time athletes are Indigenous – a ratio much lower than what we see in the footballing codes. So, the purpose of the round should be to build a genuine relationship with the Indigenous community, celebrate their contribution to the sport and find ways to retain First Nations talent in netball. ABC Sport has been in touch with each of the Super Netball clubs to find out more about the kinds of activities each team got up to this week. The dresses this year were stunning of course, but it can be easy to get caught up in what's happening at that superficial level and harder to find out about the action behind the scenes. It would be great to see clubs promote their work in this space more prominently on social media. The host broadcaster Fox Netball can also play a role in highlighting this. Last year's Indigenous round turned into a PR disaster for Super Netball, but rising star Gabby Coffey hopes a renewed focus this year will help draw Indigenous athletes to the sport. For instance, Super Netball stars Leesa Mi Mi (Wakka Wakka) and Donnell Wallam (Noongar) were talked about on the coverage, but Vixens training partner Gabby Coffey (Wiradjuri) less so, even after she was elevated to the team's game-day squad through injury. To focus on the positives, two great examples of connection that caught our eye included Lightning's and Netball Queensland taking the next step in their Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). Lightning's video was filmed on Kabi Kabi Country with elders from local First Nations Group Yir'un-Yalangi and has been played at every one of the club's home games this season. Meanwhile, Netball Queensland moved on to the second part of its RAP process \"Innovate\" last week and for a second straight year, the Firebirds First Nations dresses will be auctioned off to raise money for their Diamond Spirit program. Fever's winning streak finally broken It may have taken seven rounds to find a side that could dismantle Fever's attacking dominance, but from an entertainment perspective, it was worth the wait. The Vixens, sitting second in the league, had their five-game unbeaten streak snapped last week in round six against the Lightning. Yet they bounced back from that loss to put on their best performance so far in 2024 – despite missing a couple of players. Defender Kate Eddy was out for a second straight week with a leg injury, while midcourter Zara Walters was missing for a fourth round in a row as she continues to rehab a lower back issue. These omissions didn't stop the Vixens from running rampant at the back of the court and head coach Simone McKinnis didn't even make a single change to her starting seven. Experienced defenders Emily Mannix and Jo Weston got their usual starts, this time at goal defence and wing defence, allowing Rudi Ellis to occupy the goal keeper bib. Ellis played two seasons at the Fever before heading back to Vixens this year and her insights into the workings of her former club truly came in handy. Playing against the tallest shooter in the competition, Jhaniele Fowler-Nembhard, Ellis used her footwork and timing to overcome the 8-centimetre difference in the match-up. There's a reason Fowler-Nembhard is a five-time Super Netball MVP and her team's ball speed and incredible work rate have made it difficult to stop the feed heading into her in their shooting circle. Enter Mannix, Weston and Ellis at the peak of their powers and suddenly Fever were the most unsteady we've seen them this season, panicking and trying to force the ball long. That pressure crept into Fowler-Nembhard's game too, as she had her first miss midway through the first quarter and went on to finish the game with 43/47 at 92 per cent accuracy. It seems crazy to suggest a player had an off game while shooting in the 90 percentile, and that's a compliment to Fowler-Nembhard's standards – because she is just so tough to face. But when we see her typically tallying 60-plus goals each week and only ever missing one or two goals in a match, it shows how much of a thorn Ellis was in her side for round seven. So huge kudos to Ellis (four gains, one rebound, one deflection, three intercepts) is in order, as well to her teammates Mannix, Weston and Kate Moloney at centre for their work out front. It's no surprise that the team is excelling under the guidance of Vixens' specialist defence coach and two-time world champion Sharni Norder (née Layton), who was rightly tight-lipped and unwilling to share much about their game plan. Crowds are on the up We've already alluded to this this season, but it has been great to see a boom in crowd numbers. Fans turn up in droves to break Super Netball's opening round attendance records. At the halfway point, there has been a 34 per cent increase in the average attendance per round (now up to 21,613) in comparison with crowd numbers at this point last year. This is partly due to the move for Super Netball teams to play at larger venues – such as the Thunderbirds for their home games, thanks to a leg-up offered by their state government to underwrite the costs. In round seven, 8,447 people turned up to watch their side take on the Swifts, marking the biggest turnout they've had so far this season. Other state governments should take notice. For instance, the Lightning had a sell-out crowd on Saturday for the Queensland Derby, but the USC stadium capacity only holds 3,000 people. Imagine how many fans would have come through the gates for the Battle of the Bruce Highway if they had played at a larger venue. However, the club that has truly been leading the way ever since the Super Netball era began is the Fever. On Sunday, 11,119 fans turned up to Perth Arena to watch a top-of-the-ladder contest against the Vixens. Their side may have lost the game, but it was a huge win for the club off the court, as that was Fever's biggest crowd ever for a non-finals match. In fact, they've registered four of their top five regular season crowds over the past two years. At a time when the sport is trying to realise its true commercial potential, whatever Fever is getting up to on the west coast should be studied because it is seriously impressive. 11,119 Fever v Vixens Round 7 2024 11,013 Fever v Giants Round 13 2023 10,764 Fever v Lightning Round 12 2023 8,702 Fever v Lightning Round 2 2024 8,306 Fever v Giants Round 6 2018 Is Ash Ervin our next gen Diamonds GK? Australia has a long history of producing impressive goal keepers. Liz Ellis, Laura Geitz and the incumbent Courtney Bruce are just some of the names on the long list of Diamonds defenders who are considered legends of the world game. Watching 21-year-old Ash Ervin play for the Sunshine Coast Lightning this year has therefore got a lot of fans excited about the future of our national team. Defenders typically bloom in the later stages of their careers, as it takes them a bit longer to mature into that role. It takes many years to develop the nuance required to read the game and how best to assert yourself in the contest as the last line of defence. But Ervin – with her height (192cm), wingspan, courage and timing – is playing beyond her years. In round seven, Ervin was recognised as the player of the match against the Firebirds, for her 11 gains including four intercepts, nine deflections and four rebounds. She was only penalised seven times. Overall, Ervin sits second in the league for deflections (47) and fourth for intercepts (13), putting her well and truly in contention for Super Netball's Rising Star award. Without trying to heap too much pressure on the young goal keeper's shoulders, it appears as if this young woman is going to be very important to Australia moving forward and that talent needs to be nurtured by the national high-performance system as much as possible. Ervin has already got a bit of a taste for the international stage too, playing Fast 5 for the green and gold in netball's modified version of the game last year. Speaking after the win against the Firebirds, Ervin credited her work alongside Bruce this season – after the Diamonds GK moved to the Sunshine Coast this year and was seen giving her tips at half-time – as one of the catalysts for her form. \"She's had such a big impact on my game, it's amazing how she shares her intelligence, I'm really grateful for her insight,\" Ervin told Fox Netball. Next weekend Ervin faces the best shooter in the world in Fowler-Nembhard. Watch this space.",

But it tells only part of the tale of a compelling spectacle lasting 3hr 5min hours that featured stunning strokes from both men and swings of momentum fit for a thriller. It continued after a final forehand from Nadal sailed long, inside of honing into the court like it did when he was at his peak, with the Spaniard agreeing to address his subjects from the court. He had knocked back a farewell ceremony as he is not certain this is the end. It is a message he reiterated again, because his mind remains willing and the body that had broken down badly over the past couple of years is now starting to feel better again. As a case in point, against most other rivals competing at Roland Garros, he probably would have prevailed, so high was his standard. As he said when reflecting at a press conference later; “I was not far away.” “It is difficult for me to talk. I don’t know if it is going to be the last time I am here in front of you. I am not 100 percent sure. But if it is the last time, I enjoyed it,” he said. “The feelings that I have had today are difficult to describe in words but it is so special to feel the love that I have received in the place that I have loved. “I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries. I went through all this process with the dream to be back at Roland Garros. I was competitive. I had my changes. But it was not enough against a great player like Sasha.” TOPSHOT - Germany's Alexander Zverev plays a backhand return to Spain's Rafael Nadal during their men's singles match on Court Philippe-Chatrier on day two of the French Open tennis tournament at the Roland Garros Complex in Paris on May 27, 2024.

That has long seemed a likely end date, provided his body remained fit enough, but he continues to improve, he remains a threat. As a result, it is exceptionally unlikely he will feature at Wimbledon, with the switch between clay and grass and then back to clay likely to prove problematic. “It is difficult to say what is going on in the future. I am travelling with the family and I am having fun. And the body is feeling a little bit better than two months ago,” he said. “Maybe in two months I say, ‘It is enough’. But it is something that I don’t feel yet. I have some goals in front of me. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics. That motivates me. I really hope to be well prepared. “The amount of feelings I have had on this amazing court during my tennis career have been unbelievable. I could not imagine when I was a kid that I would be here at almost 38 - I wish I was 28. It has been a beautiful process. “What makes me feel so special is all the people who are at Roland Garros behind the scenes who have been helping me from my first visit here. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. I really hope to see you again. But I don’t know. Merci beaucoup.” PARIS, FRANCE - MAY 27: Rafael Nadal of Spain looks on from his seat after his defeat by Alexander Zverev of Germany in the Men's Singles first round match on Day Two of the 2024 French Open at Roland Garros on May 27, 2024 in Paris, France. (Photo by Clive Brunskill/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images The atmosphere during the three hour match was akin to a Davis Cup final but there was no split in support from the crowd. Everyone was willing the 14-time champion to add another famous memory to a catalogue grander than any to have played at the venue. “Rafa. Rafa. Rafa!” At times the chant became a deafening roar that reverberated around Philippe Chatrier Court, the volume enhanced by the roof in place due to torrential rain at times that interrupted play on the outside courts. It was the hottest ticket in Paris and a spectacle even the players, who rarely stray from their routine of bouncing between their hotel, the courts and the massage table during tournaments, could not miss. Novak Djokovic, who has a 30-29 advantage of over his great rival, camped not far behind the Zverev box to take in what proved to be an exceptional second set of tennis. Iga Swiatek, who began her campaign for a third straight Roland Garros title in swift fashion a match earlier, was back courtside to watch her idol in action. Carlos Alcaraz, too, watched with concern on his face as Nadal tried valiantly to level the match deep in the second set. French stars including Alize Cornet also dropped in to watch. Roger Federer’s agent Tony Godsick was on hand as well and entered the Nadal camp prior to the match to offer his well wishes. “I am happy that happens because that means I had a positive legacy here and a positive moment in my career,” Nadal said. Near the entrance to the grounds fans who had braved the wintry conditions stopped to consider and also photograph the 3m steel sculpture of the Spaniard scorching a forehand. The statue is now three years old and an honour to a living legend. So rare has Nadal’s reign been, he earned a tribute to his domination while he was still winning major titles. Are those days behind him? Clearly his domination is. But Nadal showed enough to suggest that if he is fit, there might yet be another marvellous moment to savour, perhaps with a golden tinge back at Roland Garros in a couple of months time. Nadal started slowly, making a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes in the opening game, including a double fault, to concede serve. But from early in the second set he began striking the backhand with more venom while getting a toehold in Zverev’s service games.

(Photo by Clive Mason/Getty Images) Source: Getty Images If the 22-time major winner was shaky on serve early in the match, he did little to concede when broken back deep in the second. The German, simply, was too good, playing inspired tennis from 3-5, 15-30 to surge back into the set. But there were moments where Nadal rolled back the clock. The thunderous forehand he thumped at full sprint that went whizzing by an advancing Zverev in the second set tiebreaker was one. So, too, another that enabled him to break serve to start the third set. He was in unfamiliar territory by that stage, trailing by two sets at Roland Garros for just the second time. Later in the set he somehow returned a smash from Zverev with a forehand carrying even more venom that left the German shaking his head. His touch at the net, too, was sublime. Every time the legend had a volley in the first two sets, he won the point, with the angles he found time and again simply exquisite. But the rustiness was apparent and pitted against a rival he described as “one of the best in the world”, it was a combination that caused his downfall. A drop shot on the backhand side was one example. But more to the point, he could not hit through his rival enough either. Zverev is younger and stronger. He found greater angles on his serve and was able to hit winners with greater frequency. Nadal was almost unbeatable in Paris, with his record now standing at 128-4. But Father Time is unbeatable. Even those who once seemed immortal eventually surrender. “I played I think at a good level in all ways, comparing to the way that I was playing the weeks before. So (I’m) happy for that,” he said. “Of course (I’m) disappointed for losing, but in terms of (my) body feeling, (I’m) happy that I finish healthy ... and I had a tough battle out there. And I was ready for a little bit more. So that’s it. Accept the moment. If it’s the last time that I played here, I am at peace with myself. “I tried everything to be ready for this tournament for almost 20 years. And today and the last two years I have been working and going through probably the toughest process in my tennis career with the dream to come back here. At least I did. I mean, I lost, but that’s part of the business.” Nadal's wife Xisca Perello and their son leaves the court after Spain's Rafael Nadal lost against Germany's Alexander Zverev in their men's singles match on Court Philippe-Chatrier on day two of The French Open tennis tournament at The Roland Garros Complex in Paris on May 27, 2024.

However, he expressed disappointment that the NPP has yet to respond to the request for the Economic Council debate. “However, the NPP’s response did not address the Economic Council. They assert that they have not yet formulated an economic policy. If they aspire to govern effectively, it is imperative for them to develop a comprehensive economic policy,” he said. Marikkar noted that while the NPP aims to prioritise the leadership debate, the SJB is open to this arrangement but under the condition that dates for the economic council debate are also provided. “We are not prepared to attend a mere political discussion,” he said",

        "content": "One of Australia's biggest mango growers is ramping up the commercial rollout of three long-awaited mango varieties. Manbulloo Limited has just planted about 4,000 of the Yess! AhHa! and Now! varieties at its Ballongilly farm near Katherine, 300 kilometres south-east of Darwin. The three varieties are the result of 25 years of development from the National Mango Breeding Program and in 2022, Manbulloo was awarded their commercial rights. In Queensland a total of 20,000 trees of the new varieties were planted among 26 growers including Manbulloo. Another 26 farmers across Australia will also plant the Yess! AhHa! and Now! varieties, under Manbulloo's commercial rollout. New mangoes planted Manbulloo managing director Marie Piccone said most of the new varieties were being planted in Queensland. It has taken decades of work and a number of setbacks, but three mango varieties are being commercially rolled out — and finally have names. \"We're hoping for some more expansion in New South Wales, West Australia and Northern Territory,\" she said. \"We have indications now, based on trees that have been planted in the last 12 months and trees that are on order, being produced in nurseries right now, that the volume will continue to increase. \"We'll put a cap on that once we've got enough volume to supply profitable customers.\" Ms Piccone said Manbulloo would focus on selling the new mangoes to the domestic market, but had an eye on exports in the future. \"There's potential in every market in the world because these varieties taste very good and are flavoursome,\" she said. \"But in terms of which markets we will hone in on, that will be dependent on profitability and potential in the domestic market.\" Planting at Ballongilly The 4,000 new mangoes planted at Ballongilly took six people just five days to put in the ground. Farm manager Trevor Nelson said one of the big challenges was keeping wallabies away from the young trees. \"We've put up a big fence around them to try and prevent any wallabies from getting in,\" Mr Nelson said. \"So far it's working. Obviously wallabies can jump over but we have a big skirt on there and all we can do is try our best.\" Most of the new mangoes planted at Ballongilly were the Yess! variety. \"They were selected because they have great flavour, consistent flowering and quite a heavy yield,\" Ms Piccone said. \"In terms of the Northern Territory, the Yess!

        "description": "Jack Grealish was in high spirits as Manchester City paraded the Premier League trophy but the England international almost took a tumble off the open-top bus",
        "content": "Manchester City winger Jack Grealish nearly suffered a catastrophic accident during the Premier League celebrations on Sunday. Grealish nearly took a tumble off the open-top bus not once, but twice during their victory parade around Manchester. This celebration marked their fourth consecutive title win, a feat no team has achieved in England before. The 28-year-old was clearly enjoying the festivities and the bubbly, just a day after City's 2-1 defeat in the FA Cup final by arch-rivals Manchester United . However, the England international had two close calls; the first was when he was dancing on the seats at the back of the bus, mistakenly thinking it was stationary.

The second incident occurred later on as Grealish , donning a cap, stood in the same spot alongside teammates Ruben Dias and Nathan Ake . Both players had to grab Grealish when the bus started moving again to stop him from falling. Despite the rain and Saturday's loss, the players' spirits remained high as they celebrated City's unique achievement. Nathan Ake and Ruben Dias stopped Jack Grealish from falling (Image: X/bluemoon_mcfc) Grealish, who didn't play against United, even commandeered a TV camera at one point, holding it while he danced. Fans thronged the streets as City made their way from Cathedral Gardens, passing by the National Football Museum, through Exchange Square and down Deansgate, ending the parade outside the Hilton hotel. Some supporters were so keen to engage with the players that they scaled scaffolding. Manager Pep Guardiola was seen enjoying a cigar as he celebrated with his team, hours before news broke that the ex-Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss could depart City next summer when his contract ends. \"We are happy, it's a big achievement, that's why we are here again,\" Guardiola shared with fans. \"Even myself I couldn't expect to stay here eight years but everything goes well. \"Step by step we are here and it looks like a routine [having a bus parade at the end of a season] but it's not a routine.\" He then pledged: \"We will be back next season. The FA Cup, we will take it.\" He got hold of the TV camera at one point (Image: X/@obviouslyruben4) Phil Foden, City's player of the year, added: \"It's been a special season. Nobody has done it before. \"It's an unbelievable season. It's the hunger inside me. We've got great players, we want to win more next season.\" Top scorer Erling Haaland also expressed: \"It's been lovely, this club is amazing, I'm so proud of everyone. \"There have been many good moments. When we knew we were gonna win the league, that was the best one. \"The support we get home and away is unbelievable.\" City will have the opportunity to claim their next piece of silverware on August 10 when they face United in the Community Shield.

        "content": "According to him, he would definitely like to come back in the future because Barcelona is the club of his life and he has enjoyed every bit of the experience in recent years. Xavi added that even if the past few weeks have been really tough for him, his conscience is very clear. His words, “Yes, I would like a return, why not? Barcelona is the club of my life. I have enjoyed this experience — and also suffered, of course. But I love being at this club and working for it. I am fine. It’s been tough last week, but I have my conscience very clear. I’m proud and happy. When we got here we knew it was a difficult time for the club and I think we can be proud of the work we have done.” WOW. Futbol Club Barcelona, commonly referred to as Barcelona and colloquially known as Barça, is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, that competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football. Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto “Més que un club” (“More than a club”). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as “The Classic” (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War. Over the years, the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 102 victories for Madrid, 100 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws.

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? MILWAUKEE (AP) — Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the Chicago Cubs hired him away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos. A brief pregame video showcased some highlights from Counsell’s tenure as Milwaukee’s manager before displaying him wearing a Brewers cap alongside the message, “Thank You No. 30.” Brewers fans booed throughout the video, and then booed again when he was introduced as the Cubs’ manager. “Look, cheer, boo, whatever, man,” Counsell said before the game when asked about what kind of reception he expected. “Just have a good time at the game. That’s what fans get to do. Just have a good time. It’s Memorial Day. You don’t have to work today Let’s all have a good time.” Counsell did receive a little applause from the substantial portion of Cubs fans in attendance — Cubs-Brewers games in Milwaukee generally have a pretty even split of supporters for both teams — but the cheers were drowned out by the boos. Counsell managed the Brewers to five playoff appearances over the last six seasons and set franchise records in wins and games managed before the Cubs lured him away with a five-year deal worth more than $40 million. This wasn’t the first time Counsell had managed against his former team — the Cubs won two of three against the Brewers at Wrigley Field from May 3-5 — but it was his first time in Milwaukee. Ryan Hoffman, a Brewers fan from Burlington, Wisconsin, said he planned to “boo a little bit” and said he made sure to get tickets for this game because it marked Counsell’s return. “We wanted to be here for this, make sure we let our opinion be heard a little bit,” Hoffman said. Counsell had managed the Brewers since May 2015 and led the franchise on its greatest run of sustained success while posting a 707-625 record. Pat Murphy, who managed Counsell during his college career at Notre Dame and later served as his longtime bench coach in Milwaukee, replaced him as the Brewers’ manager. “Twenty years from now, we’ll all look back at this and Craig will be recognized as a big part of the Brewers,” Murphy said. “What he feels today, he’ll go through a lot of emotions, but he’s getting his ballclub ready to compete.” Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich downplayed the hoopla surrounding the manager’s return to Milwaukee. This four-game series also pits the NL Central’s top teams against each other; the Brewers entered Monday leading the Cubs by 3 1/2 games. “Obviously a lot of good memories here with Couns,” the 2018 NL MVP said. “In our minds, it’s no different than a player leaving in free agency. He earned the right to do what he wanted to do, go to the highest bidder. I’m happy for him. I’ve still got a great relationship with him.” Plenty of Brewers fans weren’t nearly as forgiving. “People feel betrayed,” Jake Starck, of East Troy, Wisconsin, said while wearing a Brewers Jackson Chourio jersey. “I get it. Go get your money. Go do what you want to do. But there’s a whole rivalry. He grew up here. I just feel it’s going to be this way for a while.” Counsell’s ties to Milwaukee preceded his managerial tenure. He grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, as the son of former Brewers director of community affairs John Counsell. The former second baseman played for the Brewers in 2004 and again from 2007-11. Counsell was asked Monday if he had ever envisioned making this kind of move before he actually left the Brewers for Chicago. “Life takes different turns, man,” Counsell said. “I don’t want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. I don’t make plans like that. You’ve got to take the ride of life, man, and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you’ve got to jump on the ride and go.” Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. Counsell’s background made it particularly painful for Brewers fans when he left for a division rival just 90 miles away. Counsell said he understands why some fans might have been angry. “It’s not my job to tell people how to feel about something,” he said. “Figure it out, let people feel how they want to feel, and I’m good with it. I think it doesn’t have to be all positive. “We’re in a public job. We’re in a job with fans. Fans are allowed to feel however they want to feel. ... It bothers you initially, of course. Some things that happen bother you, for sure. But as it goes on, some of it’s, you’re a fan and you get to feel how you want to feel. You’re entitled to that as a fan. I’m good with that, I think that’s part of it and it’s part of what makes sports fun.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Advertisement Advertisement",

Its level on May 27 remains below normal despite rains dumped by Typhoon “Aghon” over the weekend. —photo courtesy of Norzagaray Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office PLARIDEL, BULACAN, Philippines — The drop in the water level of Angat Dam and the plan to cut supply to rice fields by May 30 will not affect farmers in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces who depend on the reservoir for their irrigation needs, a leader of a farmers’ group said. Despite Angat Dam’s current elevation of below 180 meters above sea level (masl), farmers would no longer require the water it supplies to their fields since many have harvested their rice crops since late April until early in the month, said Carlos Dimaapi, acting president of the more than 22,000 Angat Maasim River Irrigation System (Amris) farmers in Bulacan and Pampanga. READ: Angat Dam water level at 178 meters, still below operating level of 180 The continuous release of water by the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) until May 30 will be enough to allow the remaining farmers to harvest good quality rice crops, he added in a phone interview on Friday. The farmers began planting for the dry season in December last year and January this year in time for the May harvest period. On Monday, because of the rains brought by Typhoon “Aghon” (international name: Ewiniar) over the weekend, the water level of Angat Dam reached 179.80 masl, slightly higher than its 178.86 masl on Sunday but still below its operating level of 180 masl and its spilling level of 212 masl. Liza Sacdalan, president of the Central Luzon Organic Rice Producers Association Inc. and the Plaridel-Guiguinto Irrigators Association that is under Amris, also affirmed they have no objection to cutting the water supply to their farms. “The cutoff is accepted because no one will need the supply. It is harvest season already until last week,” Sacdalan told the Inquirer in a text message on Sunday. Sacdalan said that despite the dry spell brought on by the El Niño phenomenon, which started last December and was projected to end by this month, many of them were still able to plant and harvest good crops because of enough water supply from the dam. Angat Dam supplies water to more than 27,000 hectares in the Bulacan towns of Norzagaray, San Rafael, Angat, Baliwag, Bustos, Plaridel, Calumpit, Pulilan, Hagonoy, Paombong, Bocaue, Bulakan, Pandi, Balagtas and Guiguinto and the City of Malolos; and the towns of San Simon, Apalit, San Luis and Candaba in Pampanga. NIA, which manages the dam’s water supplied to irrigated fields in the two provinces, regularly released 40 to 32 cubic meters per second volume of water to the fields since January, which it gradually reduced as the water level dropped.

The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said Kanlaon recorded 24 volcano-tectonic or VT earthquakes between 1:35 p.m. and 4:30 p.m. on May 26, which occurred at depths of up to 6 kilometers beneath the western flank of its edifice.

READ: Fire at Mt. Kanlaon rages for 2 days now The ongoing VT earthquake activity indicated shallow rock-fracturing on the edifice, which may lead to further unrest, Phivolcs added. Phivolcs reminded the public that alert level 1 still prevailed over Kanlaon, indicating that the volcano’s condition remained abnormal. Kanlaon, which straddles Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental, is one of the active volcanoes in the country and the highest peak in the Visayas (2,464.92 meters or 8,087 feet above sea level). —Carla P.

        "content": "Julie Amos (right) talking to her players during the rout of Malaysia. —CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Gilas Pilipinas crushed one opponent after another in Thailand to punch a return ticket to the Fiba U-18 Women’s Asia Cup Division B. The young Nationals cut Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia down to size, winning by a whopping average 37.3 points in the short tournament held in Ratchaburi province.Still, coach Julie Amos feels there is plenty of polishing that her charges could do right before they plunge into action in the main tournament set in Shenzen, China, late next month. “We have always emphasized attack mentality—that everyone should run and push the ball. We have been consistent on that. But I will continue to polish [the girls] offensively,” Amos, a member of the women’s program brain trust, told the Inquirer on Monday. “There were situations that we needed to slow down to see mismatches and needed timing,” she pointed out. “We [also] need to be more consistent with our rotations and individual stops.” Overall, Amos feels that Gilas needs to improve on its maturity as it’s a trait that will allow the squad to be patient in certain situations. It was, somehow, what the team lacked in its overtime meltdown against Malaysia in the Division B semifinals two years ago in Bangalore, India. Amos is steadfast in her belief that Gilas can apply the necessary tweaks just in time, especially with promising players at her disposal. Aside from the ever-improving Ava Fajardo and hands-down the tournament’s finest scorer, Alicia Villanueva, Amos sees a lot of promise in Gabby Ramos and Tiff Reyes. “[Gabby] has been so solid inside and out and really contributes well offensively and defensively. There was this one game where she made 29 points and 19 rebounds,” said Amos, adding Ramos is a “complete package” like Villanueva.

        "content": "Carlo Paalam.–CONTRIBUTED PHOTO Carlo Paalam’s Olympic route is marked with several stops at the ongoing World Olympic Qualification Tournament in Bangkok, Thailand. After making short work of Alexei Lagkazasvili of Greece in his opening bout in the men’s 57-kilogram division, Paalam’s next layover is the round of 32 on Tuesday where Turkmenistan’s Shukur Ovezov awaits. “I’ll just have to continue what I’ve started,’’ said Paalam in Filipino after his final shot for the 2024 Paris Olympics got going with a trouble-free 5-0 win over Lagkazasvili. The Tokyo Olympics silver medalist showed no trace of an injured shoulder in that fight and will climb the ring opposite Ovezov at Indoor Stadium Huamark fresh from a three-day rest.“Very good start for Carlo. It’s great to see him back from the shoulder injury,’’ said Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines secretary general Marcus Manalo. Paalam is looking to even up matters with Ovezov, who showed him the door in the first world Olympic qualifier in Busto Arsizio, Italy, two months ago. “Coincidentally, his next opponent will be the Turkmen whom he lost to due to injury. But he’s in good shape for now and moving very well,’’ said Manalo.Back then, the 25-year-old from Talakag, Bukidnon, was already nursing a painful shoulder in an earlier bout before dropping his round of 16 match against Ovezov. Mexico’s Andrey Bonilla slammed Paalam to the canvas in their round of 32 clash before the Filipino pugilist survived with a split-decision win.Out of the four Filipino boxers sent to Bangkok, only Paalam and Hergie Bacyadan are still in contention following the early exit of Rogen Ladon (men’s 51 kg) and Criztian Pitt Laurente (men’s 63.5 kg). Ladon dropped his initial bout against Spain’s Rafael Lozano and Laurente fell prey to a quicker Mukhammedsabyr Bazarbay Uulu of Kazakhstan in their round of 64 face-off.Bacyadan, another promising Olympic prospect, drew Spain’s Dunia Mas Martinez in her initial bout in the women’s 75-kg division. If she survives Martinez, the vovinam world champion from Kalinga should get past two more opponents on June 1 and June 2 to join Eumir Marcial (men’s 80 kg), Nesthy Petecio (women’s 57 kg) and Aira Villegas (women’s 50 kg) in the French capital in July. Paalam needs to beat three more opponents after Ovezov since only the medalists in his division will earn those Paris berths. Although rougher roads lay ahead, coaches Ronald Chavez and Elmer Pamisa, Paalam’s trainer as a youth in Cagayan de Oro City, are optimistic that their ward could weather the challenges.

        "content": "Christian Standhardinger (with ball) has been working hard on that mid-range game. —PBA IMAGES Around April last year, Christian Standhardinger candidly spoke about approaching the game differently in a bid to get the most out of his aging knees. A little over a year later, the Barangay Ginebra ace continues to play splendidly, emerging as the club’s foremost weapon in a grueling seven-game semifinal showdown with tough-as-nails Meralco in the PBA Philippine Cup. “You just try to read what the defense is giving you and that’s what it was,” he said, with his signature deadpan expression, after an 89-84 Game 5 victory at Mall of Asia Arena that had the crowd darlings taking control of the series. “Coach (Tim Cone) tells me to shoot [the basketball] if [I am] open. So obviously, I took it. But, it’s more about the decision-making,” he added. “The challenge for me—or for us—this semifinals run is they (the Bolts) change a lot of the coverage and I’m just trying to make the right reads and make the right decisions.” Standhardinger had 34 points and 10 rebounds that night, bringing his semifinal averages to 22.8 points and 9.8 rebounds. He could’ve easily had more if not for the effort he also puts into playmaking. The top pick of the 2017 Rookie Draft there is nothing drastic behind his sustained fine play this series. “My prep doesn’t change. But what I’ve changed is my reaction to what they do,” he said of the Bolts, who have been trying their darndest in putting up a challenge from the battle-hardened Raymond Almazan to rookie Brandon Bates. “I’m just trying to make the right reads and I think we have a great video analyst with Pat (Partosa) and the rest of the coaching staff. So just watching film, and listening to what they have to say, helps a lot, too,” he added. Cone, however, did not let Standhardinger continue to make his feat seem minor. “If you saw us in practice, you’ll see how much Christian works on that shot,” he said of his mid-range jumper which allowed the do-it-all forward to finish Game 5 with an efficient 12-for-17 shooting. “He has faith in [his shot], we have faith in it. And when guys are going to back off of him like they do [against] his drive, he’s going to be able to take that shot and make it. And he did that with a really high percentage tonight. That’s just through the really hard work that he does,” he added. INQ Subscribe to our daily newsletter By providing an email address.

        "content": "Alas Pilipinas libero Dawn Macandili-Catindig during an AVC Challenge CUp 2024 game. –MARLO CUETO/INQUIRER.net A little Faith turned Alas Pilipinas into an unpredictable force entering the semifinals of the AVC Challenge Cup. The national squad battles Kazakhstan on Tuesday at Rizal Memorial Coliseum with a championship berth at stake and will ride into that duel confident that it has a lot of weapons to counter a taller and more powerful opponent. “The bench is pretty deep. Everyone is ready to play and deliver, even Julia Coronel as a setter. It’s good for us because at least we’re a bit more unpredictable against our opponents,” ace playmaker Jia De Guzman told reporters on Sunday after dominating Chinese Taipei, 25-13, 25-21, 25-18, to complete a four-game sweep of Pool A. READ: Alas Pilipinas can win AVC Challenge Cup title says Jaja Santiago Already the first Philippine volleyball team to enter the AVC semifinals since joining the confederation’s tournaments in 1961, Alas Pilipinas gave De Guzman a different set of starters to work with against the Taiwanese. Faith Nisperos filled in for Angel Canino and delivered eight points to help out Eya Laure and Vanie Gandler in providing the firepower against the Taiwanese, proving that coach Jorge de Brito has a lot to work with if he hopes to pull of an upset against the Kazahks. “I want to maximize every chance I can get and get all the experience I can get, and show my skills every chance I can get,” the young wing spiker said after subbing for Canino, the team’s leading scorer. “I’m really grateful to get a chance and also my other teammates who played today,” she added. Nisperos and the team are unfazed by the test that now lies before them. “We have to accept every challenge and we’re going to face Kazakhstan [in the semis]. “We will make whatever effort we can do and show our teamwork. That would be our mindset [on Tuesday],” the former Ateneo ace and current Akari standout said. “We have a good mix of young players and veterans. It’s a good blend of fire, energy and composure,” De Guzman said. “We hope to maintain this until the end and learn from our past games because the elimination round was a good training ground for us. Hopefully, we can get better results going into the next round.” “Kazakhstan is a very strong team, very tall also. We experienced playing taller and stronger teams in our bracket, and we will prepare with coach Jorge on our training tomorrow,” she added.

The milestone the team completed is something the nationals can rest on. But they are ready for more “What we went through wasn’t easy and we know it won’t be easier in the future because the semifinals is a different level. We’re just going in with a positive mindset,” De Guzman said. INQ",

        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo added yet another record to his collection as he set a new high for goals scored in a Saudi Pro League season. The 39-year-old struck twice in Al-Nassr’s 4-2 victory over Al-Ittihad at Al Awal Park to take his total to 35, eclipsing Abderrazak Hamdallah’s 34 from 2018-19. Hamdallah, who was also playing for Al-Nassr at the time, could at least take some comfort from the fact that his haul came in just 27 league games, four fewer than the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star’s. History is made and we’re now on GOAT time ⏱️🐐 Congratulations to Cristiano Ronaldo 🥳 — AlNassr FC (@AlNassrFC_EN) Ronaldo, who had seen a 10th-minute effort ruled out for offside, equalled the record in first-half stoppage time when he controlled Mohammed Al-Fatil’s long ball and fired home to open the scoring in his club’s final fixture of the campaign. The Portugal international was through on goal once again 20 minutes after the restart but was brought down by Suwailem Al-Menhali, who was sent off. However, he had to wait just four minutes longer to claim his 35th of the season when he headed home from a corner before he was substituted. Abdulrahman Ghareeb’s penalty and Meshari Al-Nemer’s strike either side of goals from Farhah Al-Shamrani and Fabinho ultimately saw the hosts prevail 4-2 to finish second, 14 points behind champions Al-Hilal but 17 clear of Al-Ahli in third.",

        "content": "TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUND In this November 2016 photo, a Filipino fisherman catches fish as the China Coast Guard patrols Panatag (Scarborough) Shoal in the West Philippine Sea, a traditional fishing ground for Zambales and Pangasinan fishers. —Richard A. Reyes/Inquirer MANILA, Philippines — Filipino fisherfolk continue to sail in the West Philippine Sea despite China’s intrusive fishing ban there, a unilateral annual policy which the government and analysts deem to be illegal and baseless while also being generally ignored by local trawlers even in previous years. Leonardo Cuaresma, president of the Zambales-based New Masinloc Fishermen Association, on Monday said they were unaware that the ban had already begun. READ: DFA protests China’s fishing ban encroaching West Philippine Sea Beijing’s fishing moratorium in the South China Sea encroaches most of the West Philippine Sea in outright disregard of Manila’s sovereign rights inside its own exclusive economic zone (EEZ) where it is allowed to explore and manage all the resources as provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It already started on May 1, 2024 and is expected to last until September 16, 2024. READ: Chinese ships block convoy’s mother boat from reaching Scarborough “Our pangulongs go sailing [in the West Philippine Sea] everyday [despite the ban],” Cuaresma, told INQUIRER.net in a phone interview in Filipino, referring to an indigenous mother boat. Cuaresma, who has sailed in the West Philippine Sea for over four decades, also noted that he, along with hundreds of fishermen, already joined the civilian convoy led by five “pangulongs”—which attempted to reach Scarborough (Panatag) Shoal—also this month when Beijing’s moratorium is already in place. The fishing activities of small bancas and pangulongs during the mission went unimpeded, as witnessed by INQUIRER.net. However, the convoy was blocked to come near the vicinity of Panatag Shoal by 10 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels in what the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) branded as an “overkill” response. The actions of CCG are in line with Beijing’s assertion of sovereignty in almost the entire South China Sea, including most of the West Philippine Sea, even if such a claim has been effectively invalidated by a July 2016 international tribunal ruling which stemmed from a case filed by Manila in 2013. Despite CCG’s latest demonstration of authority, a geopolitical analyst noted that Filipino fishermen were able to fish in the West Philippine Sea even in previous years. “Nevertheless, there are still risks of escalation,” Don McLain Gill, a lecturer at the De La Salle University’s Department of International Studies, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. Gill also said “we have to wait and see” as to how the administration of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. intends to address the lengthy ban. “This uncertainty and concern for miscalculation will likely raise pressures for the Marcos Jr. administration,” Gill noted. “It is likely for Manila to remain cautious and utilize its open channels with Beijing, while simultaneously emphasizing how the illicit and unilateral actions of China continue to derail bilateral ties,” he further said. In an expected move, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), through a diplomatic note, on Monday protested the fishing ban, calling it “illegal” under the “final and binding” 2016 Arbitral Award. The DFA would always lodge a protest whenever China announces this yearly moratorium. For Rommel Jude Ong, a retired Philippine Navy rear admiral and a professor at the Ateneo School of Government, the DFA should have completely disregarded China’s unilateral policy. “My personal opinion, we should just ignore it,” Ong said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “By protesting, we acknowledge its existence and inadvertently recognize it even in protest.” But for security expert Chester Cabalza, all other channels, like filing of a diplomatic protest, should be explored to defy Beijing’s policy and assert Manila’s rights in the West Philippine Sea. “This [fishing ban] should be defied,” Cabalza, president and founder of Manila-based think tank International Development and Security Cooperation, said in a message to INQUIRER.net on Monday. “We should encourage more of our Filipino fishers to continue their fishing rights in our maritime entitlements.” Cabalza further said: “If we submit ourselves to their domestic law, it means that we surrender to their will.” Which, Cuaresma said, the fisherfolk have no plans of doing, as PCG continues to allow the fishermen to sail in the West Philippine Sea. “As long as our government allows us, we will continue to fish and we will not allow our neighboring countries to bully us and interfere with our livelihood,” Cuaresma said.

        "content": "Qatar has announced a contribution of $75mn to support humanitarian efforts and interventions for the Syrian people, adding to its contributions over the past years. This came in Qatar's speech delivered by HE Minister of State for International Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lolwah bint Rashid Al Khater, before the Syria donors conference held Monday in Brussels, Belgium. HE Al Khater expressed hope that the conference would result in appropriate financial commitments and that the multiplicity of humanitarian crises would not affect the pledges towards Syria and its people. She emphasized the importance and necessity of continuing this conference and all efforts aimed at mobilizing financial support and encouraging donors to persist, pointing out the need to face the facts and say that there has been an international and regional entrenchment of displacement and division. HE Al Khater explained that this entrenchment began years ago with policies that prolonged the conflict on a no-winner, no-loser basis. She pointed out that this continued to the present day with entrenched verbal positions that reality has surpassed, making the Syrian issue a seasonal topic without genuine and effective international and regional efforts to find practical and fundamental solutions. She noted that despite its harshness and many unique aspects, the Syrian crisis is not an unprecedented situation that cannot be compared to other conflicts, pointing out that the region and the world have experienced many brutal civil wars and conflicts. HE Minister of State for International Cooperation pointed out that experiences have shown that ending conflicts and civil wars requires strength, courage, and sincerity from the parties involved. She explained that even if these qualities are present, a decisive political settlement cannot be guaranteed without regional and international consensus, especially since the Syrian crisis has been internationalised for years.

Anita Anand, Treasury Board president, and Marci Ien, the minister for women and gender equity and youth, announced the funding at the Centre for Aging + Brain Health Innovation ( ) on Sunday. The federal government said the recipients were selected through a new competitive evaluation process that saw 55 letters of intent narrowed down to 34 full applications. Those were then evaluated by sub-committees and a technical review before a final decision was made by an independent 18-person expert review panel. Vancouver-based , which provides research services to public, private, and academic institutions, received the most funding at $218.1 million. Mitacs says that it connects researchers and advisors in post-secondary institutions to those in industry and society that could apply the academic research in the real world. The organization also funds research and startups. Mitacs in Vancouver-based foodtech startup Maia Farms’ $2.3-million pre-seed financing round earlier this month. The only other organization to receive more than $50 million from the SSF is , an independent, federally funded non-profit that was granted $154.2 million to invest in genomics research, innovation, and talent. Canada-based global research organization CIFAR, which has a 128-member AI Chair program, a key component of the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy, received $34.5 million from the SSF. The chairs appointed by CIFAR are meant to support Canadian understanding and research in the strategy’s priority areas, which include health, energy, the environment, fundamental science, and the responsible use of AI. “CIFAR depends on national-level funding in order to take the risks that have led our programs to numerous profound advances in research,” CIFAR President and CEO Stephen Toope said in a statement. “I’m delighted that the support through SSF will allow our organization to continue pursuing bold ideas that drive profound impact.” CIFAR $1.3-million in grant funding from Google to support its Accelerated Decarbonization program, responsible AI research and development, and training programs for future AI scientists. According to CIFAR, its Accelerated Decarbonization program brings together experts in carbon capture, storage, and utilization to find new ways of solving climate-related problems. itself received $39.2 million to continue its work in accelerating the development of products and services that support aging and brain health. CABHI the $3.4-million CAD seed round of Toronto-based senior-care platform Homecare Hub last September. Other recipients of SSF funding include $34.4 million going to Waterloo’s , $6 million to , and $5 million to life sciences accelerator adMare. Last year, adMare with MaRS Discovery District to lead the MaRS-adMare Therapeutics Accelerator aimed at helping biotech ventures overcome fundamental barriers, such as a lack of lab space and access to capital. The federal government said the SSF funding will be disbursed from April 2024 to March 2029, pending finalization of contribution agreements. The next call for applications to the SSF is scheduled to take place in 2026 to 2027.",

        "description": "Mexico is an increasingly important destination for gay tourists, so get ready for your Pride Month trip with our list of the best locations to party.The post A guide to Mexico’s hottest LGBTQ+ vacation destinations appeared first on Mexico News Daily",
        "content": "Are you considering a vacation to Mexico and wondering if Mexico is safe for LGBTQ+ travelers? And what is the current state of LGBTQ+ rights in Mexico? If you have your heart set on sipping authentic margaritas on a pristine beach, you’ll be delighted to know that gay rights in Mexico surpass those in many countries worldwide. Historically, Indigenous populations such as the Zapotec and Maya have long accepted sexual fluidity, and same-sex sexual acts were decriminalized in the country in 1871. Today, same-sex unions are federally recognized and same-sex marriages are performed in 18 of Mexico’s 31 states. LGBTQ+ couples are also free to adopt children. Thanks to a pair of rulings in 2015 and 2016 by Mexico’s highest judicial body, laws banning gay marriage and gay adoption in Mexico were declared unconstitutional. This year, Congress voted to ban so-called “conversion therapies.” Although Mexico is generally very gay friendly, it should be noted that some regions are more so friendly than others. Mexico City’s Zona Rosa — which spans 16 blocks and is home to more than 200 gay-owned businesses — rivals San Francisco’s Castro District. Other parts of Mexico, such as Guadalajara, Monterrey, Los Cabos, Puerto Vallarta and Tijuana, are also considered extremely welcoming. Nowadays, a trip to Mexico often means visiting the country’s capital, so it’s worth asking: is Mexico City safe for LGBTQ+ travelers? The answer is yes. In fact, it may be one of the most gay-friendly cities in the Americas. The city’s annual Pride festival, which debuted in 1978, attracts several hundred thousand people, while other cities and towns also draw large crowds for annual festivities. Mexico is the sixth most visited vacation destination in the world, and most of the country is very LGBTQ+ friendly. But to make your gay vacation even more special, stay in a gay-friendly space. In Mexico, there are several cities and destinations known for being welcoming to the LGBTQ+ community. We’ve included some of the best below. Mexico’s capital is recognized as one of the most open and progressive cities in Latin America in terms of LGBTQ+ rights. There are many bars, clubs, restaurants and events aimed at the LGBTQ+ community in neighborhoods such as Zona Rosa and Condesa. Here are a few of its more famous bars: This Bajío city has a vibrant LGBTQ+ scene and is famous for its annual Pride march, which attracts thousands of people. Zona Chapultepec and Zona Rosa are popular areas for LGBTQ+ nightlife and events. Visit in February to get involved with Guadalajara’s month-long Carnival celebrations marking the start of Lent. Jalisco’s Pacific coast hub is a tourist destination known for its acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community. The Romantic Zone is the heart of the LGBTQ+ scene in Puerto Vallarta, with a wide variety of gay-friendly bars, clubs and restaurants. The city’s gay clubs are outstanding and always busy. There’s a huge variety of establishments, so you can enjoy everything from relaxed cocktail bars to strip clubs. Many bars also sell Purple Hand, a domestically produced beer marketed to the LGBTQ+ population. Winter sees Puerto Vallarta at its busiest , with top drag performers from Provincetown escaping the chill of the U.S. northeast and descending on the city’s myriad gay-run venues, bars and clubs. Although more conservative than the other cities on this list, Mérida has been developing an active and visible LGBTQ+ population in recent years. Neighborhoods such as Santiago and Santa Ana are known for being more welcoming. As for the gay bars Merida has in store, most are located downtown, on Calle 60, but it’s easy to meet like-minded people in the many cantinas, restaurants and bars around town, you’ll find acceptance and friendly tour operators to help ensure your time is memorable for all the right reasons. This Riviera Maya tourist destination has gained popularity among the LGBTQ+ population due to its relaxed and tolerant atmosphere. Quinta Avenida is the main place for nightlife and has several gay-friendly bars and clubs. This street is also home to the annual Playa Pride festival, a week-long celebration of LGBTQ+ culture and rights. These are just a few examples, but in general, most major cities and tourist destinations in Mexico tend to be quite inclusive and welcoming towards the LGBTQ+ community. The scene can vary by city and season, so it’s always a good idea to do some research before heading out and connecting with the local LGBTQ+ population by contacting local LGBTQ+ organizations or online communities to get insider tips on the best LGBTQ+ friendly establishments and events.

        "content": "MILWAUKEE (AP) — Craig Counsell’s first game at American Family Field since the Chicago Cubs hired him away from Milwaukee included a warm scoreboard message and a couple hearty rounds of boos. A brief pregame video showcased some highlights from Counsell’s tenure as Milwaukee’s manager before displaying him wearing a Brewers cap alongside the message, “Thank You No. 30.” Brewers fans booed throughout the video, and then booed again when he was introduced as the Cubs’ manager. “Look, cheer, boo, whatever, man,” Counsell said before the game when asked about what kind of reception he expected. “Just have a good time at the game. That’s what fans get to do. Just have a good time. It’s Memorial Day. You don’t have to work today Let’s all have a good time.” Counsell did receive a little applause from the substantial portion of Cubs fans in attendance — Cubs-Brewers games in Milwaukee generally have a pretty even split of supporters for both teams — but the cheers were drowned out by the boos. Counsell managed the Brewers to five playoff appearances over the last six seasons and set franchise records in wins and games managed before the Cubs lured him away with a five-year deal worth more than $40 million. This wasn’t the first time Counsell had managed against his former team — the Cubs won two of three against the Brewers at Wrigley Field from May 3-5 — but it was his first time in Milwaukee. Ryan Hoffman, a Brewers fan from Burlington, Wisconsin, said he planned to “boo a little bit” and said he made sure to get tickets for this game because it marked Counsell’s return. “We wanted to be here for this, make sure we let our opinion be heard a little bit,” Hoffman said. Counsell had managed the Brewers since May 2015 and led the franchise on its greatest run of sustained success while posting a 707-625 record. Pat Murphy, who managed Counsell during his college career at Notre Dame and later served as his longtime bench coach in Milwaukee, replaced him as the Brewers’ manager. “Twenty years from now, we’ll all look back at this and Craig will be recognized as a big part of the Brewers,” Murphy said. “What he feels today, he’ll go through a lot of emotions, but he’s getting his ballclub ready to compete.” Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich downplayed the hoopla surrounding the manager’s return to Milwaukee. This four-game series also pits the NL Central’s top teams against each other; the Brewers entered Monday leading the Cubs by 31⁄2 games. “Obviously a lot of good memories here with Couns,” the 2018 NL MVP said. “In our minds, it’s no different than a player leaving in free agency. He earned the right to do what he wanted to do, go to the highest bidder. I’m happy for him. I’ve still got a great relationship with him.” Plenty of Brewers fans weren’t nearly as forgiving. “People feel betrayed,” Jake Starck, of East Troy, Wisconsin, said while wearing a Brewers Jackson Chourio jersey. “I get it. Go get your money. Go do what you want to do. But there’s a whole rivalry. He grew up here. I just feel it’s going to be this way for a while.” Counsell’s ties to Milwaukee preceded his managerial tenure. He grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, as the son of former Brewers director of community affairs John Counsell. The former second baseman played for the Brewers in 2004 and again from 2007-11. Counsell was asked Monday if he had ever envisioned making this kind of move before he actually left the Brewers for Chicago. “Life takes different turns, man,” Counsell said. “I don’t want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. I don’t make plans like that. You’ve got to take the ride of life, man, and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you’ve got to jump on the ride and go.” Counsell’s background made it particularly painful for Brewers fans when he left for a division rival just 90 miles away. Counsell said he understands why some fans might have been angry. “It’s not my job to tell people how to feel about something,” he said. “Figure it out, let people feel how they want to feel, and I’m good with it. I think it doesn’t have to be all positive. “We’re in a public job. We’re in a job with fans. Fans are allowed to feel however they want to feel. ... It bothers you initially, of course. Some things that happen bother you, for sure. But as it goes on, some of it’s, you’re a fan and you get to feel how you want to feel. You’re entitled to that as a fan. I’m good with that, I think that’s part of it and it’s part of what makes sports fun.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",

This wasn’t the first time Counsell had managed against his former team — the Cubs won two of three against the Brewers at Wrigley Field from May 3-5 — but it was his first time in Milwaukee. Ryan Hoffman, a Brewers fan from Burlington, Wisconsin, said he planned to “boo a little bit” and said he made sure to get tickets for this game because it marked Counsell’s return. “We wanted to be here for this, make sure we let our opinion be heard a little bit,” Hoffman said. Counsell had managed the Brewers since May 2015 and led the franchise on its greatest run of sustained success while posting a 707-625 record. Pat Murphy, who managed Counsell during his college career at Notre Dame and later served as his longtime bench coach in Milwaukee, replaced him as the Brewers’ manager. “Twenty years from now, we’ll all look back at this and Craig will be recognized as a big part of the Brewers,” Murphy said. “What he feels today, he’ll go through a lot of emotions, but he’s getting his ballclub ready to compete.” Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich downplayed the hoopla surrounding the manager’s return to Milwaukee. This four-game series also pits the NL Central’s top teams against each other; the Brewers entered Monday leading the Cubs by 31⁄2 games. “Obviously a lot of good memories here with Couns,” the 2018 NL MVP said. “In our minds, it’s no different than a player leaving in free agency. He earned the right to do what he wanted to do, go to the highest bidder. I’m happy for him. I’ve still got a great relationship with him.” Plenty of Brewers fans weren’t nearly as forgiving. “People feel betrayed,” Jake Starck, of East Troy, Wisconsin, said while wearing a Brewers Jackson Chourio jersey. “I get it. Go get your money. Go do what you want to do. But there’s a whole rivalry. He grew up here. I just feel it’s going to be this way for a while.” Counsell’s ties to Milwaukee preceded his managerial tenure. He grew up in the Milwaukee suburb of Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, as the son of former Brewers director of community affairs John Counsell. The former second baseman played for the Brewers in 2004 and again from 2007-11. Counsell was asked Monday if he had ever envisioned making this kind of move before he actually left the Brewers for Chicago. “Life takes different turns, man,” Counsell said. “I don’t want to plan out my life forever. I want to do things that challenge me, that excite me. I don’t make plans like that. You’ve got to take the ride of life, man, and see what happens. This is not something I necessarily expected to happen, but you’ve got to jump on the ride and go.” Counsell’s background made it particularly painful for Brewers fans when he left for a division rival just 90 miles away. Counsell said he understands why some fans might have been angry. “It’s not my job to tell people how to feel about something,” he said. “Figure it out, let people feel how they want to feel, and I’m good with it. I think it doesn’t have to be all positive. “We’re in a public job. We’re in a job with fans. Fans are allowed to feel however they want to feel. ... It bothers you initially, of course. Some things that happen bother you, for sure. But as it goes on, some of it’s, you’re a fan and you get to feel how you want to feel. You’re entitled to that as a fan. I’m good with that, I think that’s part of it and it’s part of what makes sports fun.” ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name (required) Your email (required) Report a typo or grammatical error (required) Submit Δ Suggest a Correction",

Levi was found about a mile downstream and was unresponsive when first responders pulled him out of the fast-moving creek near his home on Tuesday. He w as airlifted to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City. The little cowboy was initially considered brain-dead but miraculously woke up from a coma. His devastated parents, Kallie and Spencer are praying for a miracle. Many in the community have been organizing fundraisers for Levi. On Saturday, the Junior Roughstock World Finals, Desert Region Rodeo, posted that each of the kids ' rode a little extra strong for Levi Wright.' Heartbreaking pictures showed the young riders on one knee, bowing their heads with cowboy hats in hand for a moments silence for little Levi. The young cowboys are pictured holding their hat and kneeling on the dirt in prayer for Levi Levi Wright, 3, the son of rodeo star Spencer Wright, has been fighting for his life, since his toy tractor dove into a creek in Utah and he was found unresponsive 'Each of the kids wore blue rode for Levi,' the post read. 'They say this is the first rodeo of the entire season that each and everyone of the kids young roughstock riders had a little extra grit and try.' On the day of the ordeal, Kallie was outside watching her son playing on his tractor trailer, and ran into the house to check on her 9-month-old. Within that split second Levi had disappeared from sight. The frantic mother dove into the creek to look for her son in the raging river. Levi's devastated parents were preparing for the worst and said they planned to 'stop care and hold him close until his last breath on earth.' But, miraculously Levi woke from the coma on Thursday night, two days after he was initially expected not to survive. 'LEVI WOKE UP! I am shook, we don't know much but the doctor said it was okay for me to get excited about that and I AM! My baby is so tough!' she said. 'He got a little wild so we had to settle him down again but my heart!' On Friday, they received the devastating news that an MRI gave a poor prognosis for the youngster . At the advice of a new doctor, the parents were told to give their son some time. 'We have time for a miracle!' the family wrote on their Facebook after their son woke up. 'Levi's heart is beating on its own, he has a will to breathe but his sweet little brain was without oxygen too long and there is no coming back from that,' an earlier update read. Heartbreaking pictures showed the young riders on one knee, bowing their heads with cowboy hats in hand for a moments silence for little Levi Young cowboys are seen placing a plastic dinosaur on a barrel at the fundraiser for Levi Kids placed little toy dinosaurs on the contained during the rodeo final T-Rex Strong Like Levi - the precious illustration was made by a family friend Photos on social media show Kallie in her son's hospital bed cradling him in her arms, as his father stands nearby. On Sunday she wrote: 'This is an experience, I pray deep in my soul you never have to know the way I am beginning to. 'This is a roller coaster that you go on unwillingly & blindfolded, you do not know what's coming next. You just get to wait & ride it out. We are taking it day by day.' She shared the type of brain injury her son may sustain, and the unknowns that are ahead. 'The term 'Brain Injury' is very broad, there are ranges and different severities. No two brain injuries are alike, even if the accident is similar. No two brains recover or don't recover the same. 'There is a lot Medical Professionals don't know, but what they do tell you is based off legitimate medical literature and history.' Kallie Wright dived in to save her three-year-old son when he drove his toy tractor into the raging river Levi miraculously showed signs of brain function on Friday, but now his mother, Kallie Wright (left) is warning the hardest part of their journey has yet to come Kallie expressed how grateful she is for the guidance from her doctor, she said 'has provided us the most precious gift of time. Something we almost did not have.' 'Our doctor is nothing short of outstanding and I believe with all of me that her heart is invested into him. 'Whether that is time to see if God provides a miracle to us or whether it's time for us to research, learn and process this all in order to make the most informed decisions. In the heartbreaking post, she continued to ask for prayers and 'for years to come.' She said, as 'I fear we haven't even reached the hardest part of this.' 'Every decision that Levi's Dad and I will make will be made based on what, we the two people who know him best believe he would want. In all this, he comes first. 'We are exploring the therapies that have been mentioned, engaging with those we feel can be of support for us & getting as many professional eyes on this as possible.'

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "content": "( KRON ) – Eric Ferguson was arrested for a sexual assault that was committed in 2002, according to the Oakley Police Department. Oakley PD received a notification from the Combine DNA Index System (CODIS) regarding a possible DNA match from a 2002 kidnapping and sexual assault of a minor in early May. The department subsequently coordinated with the U.S. Marshals Service and a Coeur d’Alene Police Department detective. The suspect was identified as 49-year-old Eric Ferguson, who was currently residing in Rathdrum, Idaho. Ferguson formerly lived in the east Contra Costa County area at the time of the rape. On May 12, Oakley detectives, along with the United States Marshals Service, Coeur d’Alene Police Department and the Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office, traveled to Idaho to serve a search warrant for DNA collection from Ferguson for the case. Oakley PD detectives returned to the Bay Area to ask the Contra Costa Sheriff’s Office Laboratory to compare the samples from the search warrant and the original case. According to Oakley PD, Ferguson’s DNA directly matched the DNA collected in 2002. A judge signed a formal complaint that was filed against Ferguson on May 16. The same day, the involved agencies utilized their SWAT team to apprehend Ferguson. Ferguson was arrested and booked into the Contra Costa County Jail for rape of an incompetent person, forcible oral copulation and kidnapping for rape.",

        "content": "Britain's Got Talent fans stunned by Amanda Holden's very revealing dress as her wardrobe malfunction catches the eye during first live semi-final By Owen Tonks For Mailonline Published: 16:07 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:39 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail 26 shares 19 View comments Amanda Holden caught the eyes of Britain's Got Talent viewers during the show's first semi-final of the series on Monday as she wore a revealing claret red dress. The radio host, 53, joined her fellow judges - Alesha Dixon , Bruno Tonioli and Simon Cowell - but stood out as she chatted to hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly during the opening minutes of the live episode. Actress Amanda looked glamorous in her one-shoulder gown which featured sleeves with attached gloves. The garment's material gathered to the front but it was for another reason that fans of the show focussed their attention on the dress - many took to social media to note that they could see her nipples through the material. They joked it must have been cold in London's Hammersmith Apollo where the semi-final was taking place.

First live show and Amanda already has her nips out. Fantastic.' While someone else joked: 'Amanda has a couple of things that are live.' Another viewer posted: 'Shoutout to Amanda Holden's nipples.' And someone else shared: 'Amanda smuggling peanuts again,' while one other show fan asked: 'Bit nippy Amanda?' 'Turn on the heating for Amanda. You could hang a painting off them,' giggled someone else. While another viewer noted: 'Amanda could cut glass with her diamond nipples tonight.' Someone else wrote: 'I think Amanda Holden has a couple of points to prove tonight.' After six weeks of Britain's Got Talent auditions, the live semi-finals kicked off on Monday as eight acts competed with one another in the hope of landing themselves a valuable place in Sunday’s grand finale. Actress Amanda looked glamorous in her one-shoulder gown which featured sleeves with attached gloves Viwers joked it must have been cold in London's Hammersmith Apollo where the semi-final was taking place A further eight entrants will feature each night of the week before the final, with two acts from each evening making it through – one decided from a public vote and the second decided by the judges. The winner will get a life-changing £250,000 cash prize and a spot on the bill of the Royal Variety Performance. The eight acts who performed on Monday night were Sven Smith, The Trickstars, Trey Braine, Sslaubi Performance Troupe, Taryn Charles, Bikoon, Stardust and Innocent Massuki. Also performing on Monday night’s show was the West End cast of Disney’s award-winning musical The Lion King. It comes after Simon and Amanda's children pushed the golden buzzer on Britain's Got Talent as the auditions for the series came to an end on Sunday. During the episode, Japanese skipping dancers Haribow, who somersaulted across the stage doing various tricks, left the judges almost speechless. They received a standing ovation from the audience and numerous pleas for a golden buzzer, which would put them straight through to the semi-finals and are generally used only by the judges and hosts, from the BGT fans. Alesha said she had 'none left' regarding the buzzers along with Bruno, while Simo said that he 'did not know what to say'. 'My son is literally going crazy right now,' Simon added. Simon Cowell let his son Eric and Amanda Holden's daughter Hollie gatecrash the Britain's Got Talent auditions on Sunday as they both smashed the Golden Buzzer Simon said he had 'never heard a reaction like that before' before gesturing to his son Eric, 10, to push the button after Japanese skipping dancers Haribow auditioned The audience went wild after Japanese skipping act Haribow took to the stage Haribow, a group of performers from Japan, all aged between 22 and 24, performed street dance while skipping on jump ropes His son Eric, who he shares with wife Lauren Silverman, then went over and pushed the buzzer along with Amanda's daughter Hollie, who she shares with record producer husband Chris Hughes.

        "description": "Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ten-year tenure, India has undergone a significant transformation, marked by an increasingly authoritarian rule. The monumental elections to elect 543 members of the Lok Sabha (lower house) are particularly being observed keenly in the SAARC nations, due to their potential impact on regional stability and international relations.The post Indian Elections: Implications for Regional Stability first appeared on Kashmir Times (Since 1954): Multi-media web news platform..",
        "content": "Altaf Hussain Wani* The world is awaiting the outcome of India’s general elections with a bated breath. The seven-phase elections will come to conclusion on June 1 and counting of votes is scheduled to take place on June 4. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ten-year tenure, India has undergone a significant transformation, marked by an increasingly authoritarian rule. The monumental elections to elect 543 members of the Lok Sabha (lower house) are particularly being observed keenly in the SAARC nations, due to their potential impact on regional stability and international relations. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), under Modi’s leadership, is aiming for a third consecutive term and has set a target of over 370 seats. Media outlets that support Modi and his Hindutva philosophy predict a landslide victory for the BJP. However, independent observers believe that the opposition alliance, known as INDIA Bloc, may still pose a significant challenge, contrary to the narrative pushed by government-aligned media. While it is too early to predict the election results with certainty, one can speculate on how India’s future may unfold depending on which of the two main contenders emerges victorious. Impartial observers, who have been closely monitoring Modi’s iron-fisted rule, view the prospect of a third term as a potential risk to peace and stability in South Asia. They argue that another term for Modi could amplify India’s global ambitions and regional hegemony. The ruling party has consistently expressed its commitment to “Akhand Bharat”, a concept championed by Hindu nationalist parties that has raised concerns among India’s neighbours. A mural in the new parliament building in New Delhi, depicting ‘ancient India’ including regions now part of Pakistan and other countries, exemplifies the BJP’s promotion of this expansionist ideology. India’s neighbours have been critical of this project and are genuinely worried about the threats it poses to their territorial sovereignty. The idea of restoring the territorial unity of the Indian subcontinent under a unified Hindu-majority nation is not universally accepted and has sparked considerable controversy. This concept is supported by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the BJP. A potential third term for the BJP is also seen as a continuation of the erosion of India’s secular and democratic principles. During Modi’s ten-year tenure, India’s secular credentials have faced substantial criticism. Since 2014, Indian society has witnessed a surge in communal conflicts, violent incidents, and an increase in xenophobia, intolerance, racism, and discrimination. Key events such as the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Ayodhya verdict and subsequent construction of the Ram Temple, appointments of Hindu nationalist sympathisers to significant positions, infusion of Hindu ideology into education and culture, restrictions on minority rights and freedoms, biased policies against Muslims and other minorities, erosion of secular institutions, and the judiciary’s apparent alignment with the BJP’s agenda have profoundly undermined India’s secular democracy. The consequences of a third term for Modi could be far-reaching and damaging to India’s secular fabric, democratic institutions, and social cohesion. Here are some potential outcomes: Hindu nationalist ideology may become further entrenched, marginalising minority communities and undermining the principles of equality and justice. #The judiciary, media, and other institutions may face increased pressure to conform to the BJP’s agenda, compromising their independence and integrity. #The concept of Hindutva (Hindu-ness) may become even more dominant, potentially leading to a formal declaration of India as a Hindu state. #Muslims, Christians, and other minorities may face heightened discrimination, violence, and exclusion from the political and social mainstream. #The promotion of Hindu-centric education, history, and culture may accelerate, suppressing diverse perspectives and India’s pluralistic heritage. #Dissent may be met with increased surveillance, censorship, and repression, silencing critical voices and undermining democratic freedoms. #The polarisation and fragmentation of Indian society may worsen, potentially leading to increased communal tensions, violence, and social unrest. #The very foundations of India’s secular democracy, enshrined in the Constitution, may be challenged or even rewritten to accommodate the BJP’s ideology. #A permanent shift towards authoritarianism may make it challenging for opposition parties to restore democratic values, secularism, and the rule of law in the future. The BJP’s stringent stance on the Jammu and Kashmir issue has resulted in heightened tensions with Pakistan, raising the possibility of escalating conflict. Additionally, India’s growing rivalry with China could lead to increased military build-up and tensions in the region. India’s aspirations for regional influence might result in a more assertive approach towards its smaller neighbours, potentially disrupting the balance of power in the region. The expansionist agenda of the BJP could escalate tensions with neighbouring nations. However, the impact of India’s emergence as a regional hegemon under the BJP will depend on how it chooses to exercise its power and influence in the region. If Narendra Modi secures a third term, his government’s policies in Jammu and Kashmir may include: #Continued crackdown on dissent , leading to increased tensions and potential human rights violations. #Increased security measures, with additional security forces and strict measures to maintain control and prevent unrest . #Promotion of Hindu nationalism, potentially altering the demographics of the region. These actions could result in the continued exclusion of the Kashmiri population and heightened polarisation and marginalisation of the majority community. Conversely, a victory for the INDIA Bloc alliance is expected to steer the country back towards secularism, protect minority rights, and recalibrate its relationships with neighbouring countries. India needs stable leadership and a unifying approach to move away from the politics of anarchy and polarisation. In just a few days, the world will learn whether Indians have voted in favour of a progressive alliance or a party that has thrived on falsehoods and communal frenzy. Tailpiece: India’s regional influence may have expanded under BJP leadership, but its advancement as a regional power remains a distant dream due to formidable challenges and competition from other regional powers. India’s aspiration to assume a leadership role in the region depends on its ability to address domestic challenges, strengthen relationships with neighbouring countries, and resolve the longstanding issue of Jammu and Kashmir. *The author is the chairman of the Islamabad-based think tank, Kashmir Institute of International Relations (KIIR). —–",

        "content": "Inter Milan CEO Beppe Marotta feels that critics of the Nerazzurri are “jealous” of the club’s success, and that the club is in good shape. Speaking at the Inter Club party, as reported by FCInterNews , the Nerazzurri executive was also confident about the contract extension of captain Lautaro Martinez despite the recent words from the Argentine’s agent. Inter are currently in a period of transition. The Nerazzurri have just changed owners. Last week, Oaktree Capital took over the club from Suning. This has raised some doubts about the future plans at Inter. Even the future of CEO Marotta, whose work has been pivotal for the past few years, has been in some question. And then there have been recent reports regarding the status of a contract extension for Inter captain Lautaro Martinez. The 26-year-old’s current deal runs out at the end of June 2026. And despite negotiations that have been going on for month, he has yet to pen an extension. However, Inter CEO Marotta is not worried about any of this. The executive was in a confident mood as he spoke to reporters. Inter Milan CEO Beppe Marotta Hits Out At “Jealous” Critics Marotta said that “I can guarantee you that there will be total continuity in the management iof the club. “I want to make clear that those who speak against us are driven by jealousy, and spread biased news that portrays a club in disarray,” the Inter CEO continued. “But Inter is a club that’s alive and well, and in great shape,” Marotta said. “Rest assured,” the executive added. “With your help and the support of the players and the coach who are all top professionals, we can get great results. “I think Inter should be considered one of the strongest teams in the world,” Marotta added. “And we have to have the courage to aim high with our goals.” Confidence On Lautaro Martinez Extension Despite Agent’s Comments Meanwhile, Marotta also gave his thoughts on the contract extension talks with captain Martinez. “We’re in regular talks with his agent,” the Inter CEO said. “And agents always have their own interests to look after,” he aimed with a dig at Martinez’s agent Alejandro Camano . The Inter captain’s agent has given a couple of recent interviews in which he has hinted without much subtlety that the striker is seeking a larger pay increase than Inter have so far offered. “However, I’m optimistic. Because every day Lautaro shows that he wants to stay here.” “It’s not something that’s just going to get wrapped up in a few days,” Marotta cautioned. “But we should certainly have his contract extended by the start of pre-season training,” the executive made very clear.",

Where has this Man United been all season? Listen to the It's All Kicking Off podcast By Ash Rose Published: 21:26 BST, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:46 BST, 27 May 2024 e-mail View comments Marcus Rashford has taken the decision to remove himself from social media in the wake of a season that he's labelled 'challenging.' The Manchester United forward has endured a dramatic week at the end of a difficult season, and has seen him decide to take a complete rest from glare of social media to reset himself mentally. Last week he was left out of Gareth Southgate 's final England squad ahead of Euro 2024 , after a season where he has scored just eight goals for his club. The campaign has finished on a high note for the 26-year-old, as he helped United triumph over Manchester City in the FA Cup Final on Saturday, but Rashford says he now needs a rest. Posting on his X account, he admitted it was time to come off the platforms and spoke of the support he's received from fans, and had a message for those who have not stood by him this season. Marcus Rashford has decided to take a break from social media following a challenging season The Man United forward did finish the campaign on a high note by winning the FA Cup His performances this season has seen him axed from England's squad for Euro 2024 Rashford wrote: 'It's time to come off Socials for a few weeks. 'I plan to rest and reset mentally after a challenging season individually and collectively. Thanks to the fans that stood by me through a difficult period. 'To the ones that didn’t just remember at United, we always stick together.' The post comes days after Rashford was seen in tears at the end of the FA Cup Final win, as the pure emotion of a difficult season poured out of the striker. His performances have been largely criticised this season, and so much so, it's led to a snub from England manager Gareth Southgate - someone who's always been a big supporter of the striker. Asked about his decision to axe Rashford for the tournament in Germany, Southgate stated that be believed other players in his positions have just had better seasons than the Red Devils man. Rashford has scored just seven league goals all season, compared to the 17 he got last season - 30 in all competitions. His season has also been marred with off the field issues, after he embarked on a 12-hour tequila bender in Belfast back in January and then reported ill for United training. The message Rashford sent to announce his break off social media after a difficult season The emotions of the season all come to the surface in United's FA Cup victory over Man City The antics did not go down with United fans, who despite the FA Cup win have also suffered a disappointing season, finishing in their worst-ever league position . The United forward has also has to deal with the deaths of two people within his circle of family and friends, something his mother admitted during an interview with The Times, 'set him back a lot'. His performances this season has led to speculation he could be one of the big names to be sacrificed this summer, with Rashford linked with a possible move to Paris Saint-Germain . Following his post, United fans showed support for a player they've taken to calling 'king' with messages looking forward to next season with the player still at the club. 'Next season, we will see the best Rashford.' One post read, while another told their star 'Rest up & come back stronger, Rashy.' Man United fans show their backing for Rashford following his decision to mentally reset Similar themes saw posts saying 'We go again next season' and 'Come back stronger king!' Others played on the scenes they saw from Rashford during Saturday's FA Cup celebrations and said, 'We see how this club means a lot to you king'. In all, Rashford has played 402 games for club since bursting onto the scene as a teenager in 2015 and scored 131 goals.

While conducting an investigation, detectives “learned that during the course of 9-10 years, dozens of citizens were being victimized by a serial slingshot shooter”, the Asuza police department said in a statement. The man is suspected of breaking windows and car windshields and of narrowly missing people with ball bearings shot from a slingshot, the statement said. No injuries were reported. The man was arrested on Thursday after officers served a search warrant and found a slingshot and ball bearings at his home in Asuza, about 25 miles (40km) east of Los Angeles, police said. The Azusa police Lt Jake Bushey said on Saturday that detectives learned that most of the ball bearings were shot from the suspect’s backyard. “We’re not aware of any kind of motive other than just malicious mischief,” Bushey told the Southern California News Group. The man was scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday.",

        "content": "A strong political ally of former President Buhari and the Chairman of Arewa Media Group, AbdulMajid Danbilki Kwamanda, has warned President Bola Tinubu against allowing anyone to violate court orders that stopped the reinstatement of Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II . He insisted that the reinstatement of Sanusi has set a bad precedent that could affect everyone. Speaking to newsmen in Kano on Monday, Kwamanda argued that the reinstatement of the deposed Emir violates the rule of law and constitutes a threat to the nation’s constitution. According to him, “ We cannot understand why the people who celebrated and effectively used the courts to maintain their government now stand firmly against a substantive court order preventing them from carrying out illegality.” “The insistence that the reinstated Emir must stay and continue parading himself as the authentic Emir of Kano violates the rule of law and constitutes a threat to the nation’s constitution and general well-being.” To this end, the political ally of former President Buhari called on Tinubu to urgently intervene in the matter to bring peace and stability to the state. He said, “ Although I’m a politician, honestly, this time around, politics aside, there is great danger in what the Kano State Government is doing. The court injunction must be respected to allow peace to reign. “Why is controversy associated with the reinstated Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II? Look at how he was removed from office by former President Goodluck Jonathan and the reasons for his removal. Now, are you returning him to continue anarchy in Kano or what?” Danbilki Kwamanda urged President Tinubu to act accordingly as a respecter of law and order, a reputation he is known for. “ You should not allow this bad precedent to be set during your tenure. You should ensure that everyone respects the law by stopping the reinstatement,” he added.",

        "content": "In recent years, “Jaws” star Richard Dreyfuss has come under fire for speaking out on subjects such as Oscar diversity requirements and the use of Blackface. At a “Jaws” retrospective screening in Beverly, Mass. on Saturday evening, he appeared to take his inflammatory remarks even further as he ranted about subjects reported to include trans people, Barbra Streisand and women in general. The Cabot sent an email to patrons to ticket purchasers, according to New Bedford, Mass. radio station WBSM, and apologized for comments it characterized as “offensive and distressing.” According to WBSM, which obtained the email from a patron, it read: “Dear Cabot Patrons, I am writing to address an important matter concerning last night’s event with Richard Dreyfuss at The Cabot. We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss’s comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize. At The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort it caused. We are taking immediate steps to ensure that such an incident does not happen again. This includes more rigorous vetting of our event participants and more proactive communication strategies to keep our audience informed. Thank you for your understanding and continued support of The Cabot. We value your feedback and are dedicated to learning from this experience to better serve our community.” In a video an attendee posted to YouTube, Dreyfuss comes onstage to applause while a Taylor Swift song plays, wearing a dress over his clothes, which stagehands then remove before he sits down. Facebook commenters expressed anger over his comments, characterizing them as “vile, dehumanizing, abhorrent things about trans youth, LGBTQ+ people, women and survivors of sexual violence.” “A young family with a 10 year old daughter had to leave,” recounted another commenter. Dozens of patrons reportedly walked out of the venue. After the screening, another video posted to YouTube. shows him talking about a book he published in 2022. “Why don’t you tell us about your new book?” the moderator says. “It’s called ‘One Thought Scares Me,'” Dreyfuss answers, “And it’s about how 50 years ago, without telling anyone, they took civics out of the curriculum. Which means we have no knowledge of who the hell we are.” His remarks are met with applause from the remaining moviegoers. Dreyfuss could not immediately be reached for comment during the holiday weekend. Representatives for the Cabot did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.",

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "content": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Midfielder Marten de Roon has been ruled out of the European Championship after being injured playing for Atalanta in the Italian Cup final, the Dutch football association said in statement on Monday. The 33-year-old Atalanta midfielder suffered an undisclosed muscle injury two weeks ago in the final, which his club lost 1-0 to Juventus, and will not be fit in time for the tournament in Germany. It meant he missed last Wednesday's Europa League final in Dublin, which Atalanta won 3-0 over German champions Bayer Leverkusen. \"I can't imagine I've had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn't play the final, win the Europa League,\" De Roon posted on social media on Monday. \"In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff: it turns out I can't play the Euros. \"I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it's a very tough day.\" De Roon has won 42 caps for the Netherlands, competing in the last Euros and the World Cup in Qatar. Dutch coach Ronald Koeman will announce the final Euro 2024 selection on Wednesday. After De Roon's withdrawal, the pre-selection consists of 29 players, with three set to be axed from the final squad. The squad assembled on Monday for their first session with Quinten Timber training apart from the rest as the Feyenoord midfielder is still nursing an injury. In the run-up to the tournament in Germany, the Dutch will play warm-up matches against Canada and Iceland next week. (Writing by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Christian Radnedge)",

        "content": "Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) MP Nalin Bandara yesterday accused the National People’s Power (NPP) of attempting to sabotage the plans to hold a debate between the leaders and economic councils of the parties. In a letter to the NPP he accused the rival of employing diversionary tactics to prevent the scheduled debates between the economic council and party leaders from proceeding as intended. Bandara in the letter requested the NPP to provide a date for the debate between the Economic Councils. Bandara stressed the importance of initiating discussions on the economic policies of both parties amidst the current economic challenges facing the country. He emphasised the need to prioritise these discussions through the Economic Council debate. “Despite our readiness to engage in a leadership debate as proposed by your party, it is perplexing that you are now seeking to evade the Economic Council debate. We have readily accepted your proposal for a leadership debate without any reluctance. However, we are puzzled by the lack of clarity regarding your party’s stance on the fundamental proposal for the debate, especially considering the various proposals put forward intermittently,” he noted. Bandara reiterated the SJB’s stance that the economic discourse should precede the leadership debate, as originally suggested. “Hence, we implore you to promptly finalise the date for the Economic Committee debate from the provided options. Furthermore, we extend another invitation to work together in coordinating both discussions, encompassing the selection of appropriate channels, moderators, and all essential arrangements,” he said.",

The RTÉ star also announced who his replacement will be in his absence. Read more: RTE's Ray D'Arcy poses with 10-year-old son Tom on Toy Show The Musical red carpet Read more: RTE's Ray D'Arcy celebrates daughter Kate's birthday at home with wife Jenny Ray revealed that Kathryn Thomas will be filling in for him during his holiday. He shared the news live on air earlier today. \"Kathryn will talk to you next week, that is it from us,\" he said on his afternoon show. The Ray D'Arcy Show airs Monday to Friday on RTÉ Radio 1 from 3pm until 4.30pm. Kathryn is no stranger to the afternoon slot and she regularly fills in for Ray during his time off, especially during the summer months. Brendan Courtney has also stepped in for him in the past. Ray's salary, along with his colleague's pay packets, made the headlines during the RTÉ payment scandal last summer. He recently revealed that he was \"angry\" during this tense time. \"If you ask anybody, would they like their salary published in the national papers, they wouldn't like it. You'd prefer that that wasn't the case, but it was,\" he told the RTE Guide. \"I was very honest at the time, I came out and told people what I was on, and I was in the commercial sector for 14 years, so I know what the salaries are outside of RTÉ and therein lies a story that's never told, because it doesn't suit the narrative.\" Kathryn's hit TV show Operation Transformation won't return in 2025. The health and wellness programme was on screens for 17 seasons. \"It has been an incredible privilege to be a part of Operation Transformation for the past 14 years and I am so so proud of the legacy the show is leaving behind. \"To be able to shine a national spotlight on the importance of looking after our health through our amazing leaders, ordinary people living ordinary lives, who opened up their hearts and homes in the most extraordinary ways.",

        "content": "Starting pitcher Cooper Criswell delivers a pitch during the Red Sox’s 11-3 loss to the Orioles on Monday in Baltimore. Criswell allowed seven runs (six earned) on six hits in four innings Nick Wass/Associated Press BALTIMORE — Kyle Stowers had three hits, including two doubles and a career-high four RBI, Ryan Mountcastle also had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles cruised to a 11-3 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Monday. WHO: Boston Red Sox (Bello 5-2) at Baltimore Orioles (Rodriguez 5-1) WHEN: 6:35 p.m. Tuesday TELEVISION : NESN Cedric Mullins added a two-run triple as Baltimore scored five runs in the fourth off Boston’s Cooper Criswell (2-2) to help open the series with its fifth consecutive win. “It was fun for me to have a big day, fun for the team to get a win,” Stowers said. “Just cool to have a big moment.” Cole Irvin (5-2) pitched five shutout innings in a return to the rotation spurred by the Orioles placing John Means and Dean Kremer on the 15-day injured list last week. Criswell allowed seven runs – six earned – over four innings as Boston lost its third out of four overall and fourth straight against Baltimore. Five of the Orioles’ six hits off the right-hander went for extra bases. “He was OK,” Boston Manager Alex Cora said. “Not too many swing and misses. They did a good job taking away certain pitches, and they put good swings on it.” Romy Gonzalez hit a three-run triple in the eighth off Baltimore’s Thyago Vieira, who let all five batters reach in his club debut. A second-round selection in the 2019 MLB draft that produced Orioles stars Adley Rutschman and Gunnar Henderson, the 26-year-old Stowers has struggled to find time in Baltimore’s lineup. But he made the most of his 33rd career start, and fourth since his most recent recall from Triple-A Norfolk. “A lot more comfortable,” Stowers said. “Playing with a lot of confidence, a lot of gratitude. And honestly just playing, just playing the game.” After lining out in the second, Stowers came up again with the bases loaded and none out in the fourth, and drove Criswell’s 2-2 changeup the opposite way. Left fielder Jarren Duran started in on the ball, then couldn’t retreat in time as it landed in the grass shy of the warning track, growing Baltimore’s lead to 4-0. Stowers added another double in a scoreless sixth, then drove in two more runs in the seventh with a single against the Red Sox’s Brad Keller. Irvin allowed four hits and three walks, and twice escaped jams while the game was still close. In the second inning, he got Dominic Smith to hit into an inning-ending groundout to strand runners on the corners. In the fourth, he fanned Smith looking and Ceddanne Rafaela swinging to leave the bases loaded. “It took a couple innings to get back to feeling kind of like myself,” Irvin said. “But all and all, battled through that and the last two innings felt like myself again.” TRAINER’S ROOM Red Sox: Right fielder Tyler O’Neill (right knee soreness) was out of the lineup for a second consecutive day, but was “most likely” to return Tuesday, manager Alex Cora said.

        "content": "ATLANTA (AP) — A record was broken ahead of the Memorial Day weekend for the number of airline travelers screened at U.S. airports, the Transportation Security Administration said Saturday. More than 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports on Friday, surpassing a previous record set last year on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, according to the transportation security agency. “Officers have set a new record for most travelers screened in a single day!” the TSA tweeted. “We recommend arriving early.” The third busiest day on record was set on Thursday when just under 2.9 million travelers were screened at U.S. airports. In Atlanta, the world’s busiest airport had its busiest day ever. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer . AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "content": "The French star is out of contract at Old Trafford at the end of the season and it will bring a nine-year stay at the Manchester club to an end. The 28-year-old moved to Man United from Monaco as part of a in 2025 and made a lightning-quick start to life in the Premier League, scoring on his debut against United’s bitter rivals Liverpool. However, life at Man United would not go to plan for Martial as it has been a very frustrating nine years at the Premier League giants. The French star would suffer from several injuries but overall, the forward never seemed good enough. The United star would even spend time on loan with Sevilla during the 2021/22 campaign. Nevertheless, the 28-year-old would go on to play 317 times for the English giants, scoring 90 goals and producing a further 47 assists. Although things have not always been perfect for Martial at Old Trafford, the forward took to social media to pen an emotional letter to fans of Man United. Anthony Martial pens letter to Man United fans Martial took to Instagram to confirm his exit from Man United on Monday and also to say goodbye to fans of the Premier League giants. The 28-year-old wrote via : “Dear Manchester United fans. It’s with great emotion that I write to you today to say goodbye. After nine incredible years at the club, the time has come for me to turn a new page in my career. “Since I arrived in 2015, I have had the immense honour of wearing this shirt and playing in front of you, the best supporters in the world! You have been an unwavering support, through the good times and the difficult. Your passion and loyalty have been a constant source of motivation for me.” Martial continued by saying: “I’d like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. Your songs, your encouragement and your love for the club are memories that will remain engraved in my heart forever. “I would also like to express my gratitude to all my team-mates, technical staff and all the members of the club I have met during my 9 years here. I am proud to have been able to share these experiences with you. “Manchester United will always be in my heart. This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you. I’m leaving to take on new challenges, I’ll always be a Red Devil and I’ll continue to follow the club’s results with passion. “Thank you again for everything, and see you soon.”",

Walton, who starred for John Wooden's UCLA Bruins before becoming a Basketball Hall of Famer and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, died Monday, May 27, 2024, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was 71. (AP Photo/Jack Smith, File) Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. \"I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

        "content": "Chad’s newly appointed Prime Minister, Allamaye Halina, unveiled his inaugural government on Monday, signalling the conclusion of a three-year period of military governance in the arid nation. Naija News reports that the cabinet decree, broadcasted on public television, retained senior ministers who are predominantly supporters of President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno. Halina, a former ambassador to China, assumed office on Thursday, just prior to junta leader Deby’s presidential inauguration following a disputed election victory. The new government will consist of 35 ministers, with 23 individuals carrying over from the previous administration. Halina succeeded his predecessor, Succes Masra, who resigned last Wednesday after losing the presidential election. Masra, an economist, held office for only four months. Notably, none of the ministers from Masra’s Transformers party were included in the new government lineup. Deby officially secured 61% of the vote on May 6, a result criticized by international NGOs as lacking credibility and freedom. His main opponent denounced it as a “masquerade.” Before taking office, Deby announced a restoration of the constitutional system and committed to being a president for all Chadians, regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs. It is important to remember that Deby assumed the role of interim president in April 2021, following the assassination of his father, President Idriss Deby Itno, by rebel forces after ruling for three decades. Chad, a country known as one of the poorest in the world, holds significant importance in the global effort to combat the spread of jihadist groups in the Sahel region.",

If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. ___ AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA Tim Reynolds, The Associated Press See a typo/mistake?

        "description": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself.",
        "content": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. \"I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history.

        "content": "Former member of the House of Representatives, Tajudeen Yusuf, has revealed that it might be impossible for Peter Obi and Atiku Abubakar to work together in the 2027 presidential election. Naija News reports that Yusuf, who was speaking on the premise of recent possible merger talks between Obi and Atiku, argued that he does not see the possibility of a merger between the two politicians. He said, “They worked together before in 2019, so it would not be out of place if they worked together again. However, I am not in their mind, but I do not see the possibilities. “They met a few days ago and after the meeting, Atiku Abubakar came out to say he would continue to contest as long as he is alive and healthy, to me that was to send a signal to those, especially the media, who were running with a notion that Atiku Abubakar might step down; shelve his political ambition for Peter Obi, but the follow-up statement a week later clarified that. “So I believe that Atiku Abubakar is going to contest I believe that Peter Obi is going to contest in 2027 if the two of them can create a compromise, fantastic for the opposition but i doubt if such will happen. “I love the statement made by the spokesperson of the Obi campaign organisation here, he clearly stated that this talk individuals have to be subjected to the individual’s parties, so we will now sit down, which of the parties should be the leading party, naturally it should be the PDP, but is Peter Obi ready to play second fiddle in this arrangement and will Peter Obi still have his base with him if he ceases to be presidential candidate those are the things you need to look into.”",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal exited what could be his last French Open to an outpouring of love and support with a first-round defeat by Alexander Zverev, wishing to be back at Roland Garros for the Paris 2024 Olympics. \"I hope to see you again, but I don't know,\" Nadal told an ecstatic crowd after crashing to a straight sets loss, 6-3 7-6(5) 6-3, against fourth seed Alexander Zverev on Monday (local time). \"There's a big percentage I will not be back here but I am not 100% sure. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that motivates me.\" It will the third time since his debut at Roland Garros in 2005, that Nadal, whose body has been martyred by 23 years of professional tennis and who left the tournament with a crushed foot after his record-improving 14th title two years ago, does not get to celebrate his June 3 birthday in Paris when he'll turn 38. The French, who tend to arrive on court Philippe Chatrier fashionably late on the back of a long lunch, skipped coffee and digestif to fill the arena before the king, racket in hand as usual, stepped onto the court to deafening roars. Rafael Nadal acknowledges the crowd in Paris. Photo: Reuters On a rainy day in Paris, organisers closed the roof, adding to the intimacy of the moment. On a court he knows like no one else, Nadal struggled to find his mark early on, netting a routine drop shot and serving a double fault to give Zverev the opening game. The German, who after winning the Rome Masters was the worst possible draw for Nadal, kept his foot on the gas pedal to take the first set even if the Mallorcan showed glimpses of his best with a couple of spinning forehand winners down the line. Alexander Zverev is in great form after winning the Rome Masters. Photo: Reuters \"Rafa! Rafa!\" went the crowd, again, as world number ones Iga Swiatek and Novak Djokovic, as well as fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz, joined the party. Nadal served for the set but Zverev levelled and forced a tiebreak, which he comfortably won. There was another break for Nadal in the third set, and some 'I-can-still-do-it' fist pumps after a few jaw-dropping winners, but two years after Zverev left their semi-final match on a wheelchair with a broken foot, the German was too good this time. Never far from physical issues in his glittering career, Nadal missed almost all of 2023 with a hip problem and his comeback earlier this year was stalled by a muscle tear, before small niggles affected his preparation for the claycourt major. \"My body has been a jungle for two years. You don't know what to expect. I wake up one day and I find a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,\" Nadal told a packed press conference following his earliest exit from Roland Garros. \"I've been fighting with all the things that I went through. But the dynamic is positive the last few weeks. I felt ready. I think tomorrow I'll be ready to play again if I have to. But I will not have to. \"So that's the thing. Now, I need to prepare myself, I need to clear my ideas and see what's the new calendar to try to be ready for Olympics. I can't say anything today, but my main goal now is to play the Olympics.\" Nadal will be eyeing his third gold medal after triumphing in singles in the 2008 Beijing Games and doubles eight years later in Rio. He had expressed doubts about his fitness ahead of Roland Garos. The 22-Grand-Slam winner said it would be unwise to prepare for the grasscourt season that follows with a potentially difficult transition back to clay for the Olympics. \"It looks difficult, honestly. For me now I can't confirm what's going on, but it looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,\" Nadal said. \"I need to talk with the team. I need to analyse so many facts. But I don't think it's going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body to make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back to clay. \"Today I feel that's not a good idea, but I can't confirm. But my feelings is even if I'm booked in Wimbledon because I had to, I don't think it's a positive idea right now.\" Sinner and Swiatek through In other first round matches, Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner, seeded second, barely broke sweat as he downed American Chris Eubanks in straight sets, just like former runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas did with Hungarian journeyman Marton Fucsovics. In the women's matches, Swiatek, gunning for a fourth title in Paris, kicked off her campaign with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean. Swiatek has now won her last 15 matches in the French capital following her back-to-back wins in 2022 and 2023. Coco Gauff also made a strong start, dispatching German Julia Avdeeva 6-1 6-1 for her 50th Grand Slam match victory. The 20-year-old American, who won the US Open last year to break her Grand Slam duck, is looking to claim her first French Open title after losing the 2022 final in Paris.",

        "content": "CALGARY, Alberta, May 27, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Canacol Energy Ltd. (“Canacol” or the “Corporation”) (TSX: CNE; OTCQX: CNNEF; BVC: CNEC) is pleased to provide the following update regarding scheduled interest payment, termination of Fitch Ratings coverage, and exploration drilling program. On May 24, 2024, Canacol paid its scheduled semi-annual interest payment of US $14.375 million on its November 2028 Senior Notes. On Tuesday, May 21, 2024, the Corporation informed Fitch Ratings that it was terminating its contract for the provision of ratings coverage. The Corporation retains the services of both Moody’s and S&P Ratings. The Corporation is preparing to drill the Cardamomo-1 exploration well located in the northern part of its 100% operated VIM-5 Exploration and Production (“E&P”) contract situated approximately 25 kilometers to the north of its Jobo gas processing facility. The Cardamomo-1 exploration well will target potential gas bearing sands within the Cienaga de Oro (“CDO”) reservoir, in a large well defined structural closure identified on the Redoblante 3D seismic survey acquired in 2023. Similar to all of the other large discoveries the Corporation has made in the past, including the Clarinete, Nelson, Aguas Vivas, and Pandereta gas fields, the Cardamomo prospect exhibits a well-defined AVO attribute, a seismic characteristic commonly associated with the presence of gas within the CDO reservoir. The Corporation plans to spud the well in late July 2024, and anticipates that it will take 3 to 4 weeks to drill and complete the well. Given success, the Cardamomo field will be tied into the Alboka flowline located approximately 12 kilometers to the south.

        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that a “tragic mistake” was made in an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah that set fire to a camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to local officials, killed at least 45 people. The strike only added to the surging international criticism Israel has faced over its war with Hamas , with even its closest allies expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Netanyahu did not elaborate on the error. Israel's military initially said it had carried out a precise airstrike on a Hamas compound, killing two senior militants. As details of the strike and fire emerged, the military said it had opened an investigation into the deaths of civilians. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war’s deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighborhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.” “We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,” he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. An initial investigation found that the soldier had responded to an exchange of fire between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants, Egypt’s state-owned Qahera TV reported. Egypt has warned that Israel’s incursion in Rafah could threaten the two countries’ decades-old peace treaty . Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people — about half of Gaza's population — displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Elsewhere in Rafah, the director of the Kuwait Hospital, one of the city’s last functioning medical centers, said it was shutting down and that staff members were relocating to a field hospital. Dr. Suhaib al-Hamas said the decision was made after a strike killed two health workers Monday at the entrance to the hospital. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he says are Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from Israel's strongest supporters. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images\" from the strike on Rafah were \"heartbreaking.\" It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. \"There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,” he wrote. The Foreign Office of Germany, which has been a staunch supporter of Israel for decades, said “the images of charred bodies, including children, from the airstrike in Rafah are unbearable.” “The exact circumstances must be clarified, and the investigation announced by the Israeli army must now come quickly,\" the ministry added. ”The civilian population must finally be better protected.” Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into possible violations of international law, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of property crimes and looting were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its Rafah offensive, a ruling it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. The ICC only intervenes when it concludes that the state in question is unable or unwilling to properly prosecute such crimes. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war. Israeli leaders also say they face an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel , in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have fled their homes. Severe hunger is widespread, and U.N. officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine . Magdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press writers Zeke Miller in Washington, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Colleen Barry in Rome contributed to this report.

High notes from their broadcasts together included Walton bringing Pasch odd gifts, changing his t-shirt mid-broadcast and, quite famously, eating a lit candle on live TV. The No. 1 pick in the 1974 NBA Draft and 1993 Hall of Fame inductee started his broadcasting career in 2002 as a pro basketball analyst for ESPN and ABC. Pasch joined ESPN the following year and the duo went on to be a regular fixture calling college basketball games. Walton, a two-time NCAA champion with the UCLA Bruins and two-time NBA champion, passed away following a long battle with cancer. He was 71 years old.",

        "content": "A bike rider in Vadodara was injured and his wife and two children had a narrow escape on Sunday night after a bus rammed a green shade at the Akota Dandia Bazar signal, pulling it down, said police. The Vadodara Traffic Police, which had put up the shades at three junctions, has decided to remove the structures. The bus driver is set to be booked for negligence, officials said on Monday. The green shade – supported by iron pillars — was installed just a day before the incident to provide relief to drivers during the heatwave. The incident occurred at around 11 pm on Sunday when the luggage carrier of the luxury bus was passing the Akota Dandia Bazar flyover and got stuck in the green mat, pulling down the structure. Amid the collapse, Nivritt More (40), a bike rider, was injured while his wife and two children had a narrow escape. More suffered minor injuries on his right leg and was rushed to a hospital for treatment. Advertisement Jyoti Patel, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Vadodara Traffic Police, told The Indian Express that the traffic police had begun the process to identify the driver of the luxury bus to book a case of ‘negligent driving’. “We had erected the shades at three traffic junctions with the intention of providing relief to motorists in wake of the heat wave. The driver of the luxury bus was negligent as he was aware that the height of the shade was lower than the height of the bus he was driving. He should not have attempted to cross the shade and put other motorists at risk. We are identifying the driver and booking a case of negligence,” Patel said. Patel said that the shade was erected on Saturday as the mercury soared in Vadodara; however, the police have decided to remove the shades following Sunday’s incident “We have decided to remove the shades as negligent drivers can cause such mishaps. We are fortunate that we did not have any major accidents at this spot yesterday. Also, the temperatures have dipped and the orange alert for heatwave has been withdrawn so the shades are not needed anymore,” Patel said.",

        "content": "Britain’s psychotic flying scumbags are being celebrated in the nation’s first festival of seagulls. Gullfest in Plymouth, Devon, will feature a two-hour procession that will see gull fanatics dress as the winged menaces to perform a song in their honour. Centred around the 37 Looe Street gallery, the festival will also see around 40 performers and artists holding music, spoken word, poetry, painting, and movies events to celebrate gulls as “majestic” human companions. Organiser Mo Bottomley said: “Gullfest is an arts festival celebrating our great Plymouth co-habitant, the majestic seagull. “Whether the svelte lesser black-backed, its larger cousin, the ubiquitous herring gull, the sweet little black-headed gulls, or any of the myriad, sometimes hybrid, species that live alongside us in Plymouth, Gullfest honours them all over a weekend of painting and sculpture, performance and moving image, music and poetry, workshops and ritual.” Ralph Nel and Isaac Lenkiewicz will lead a “ritual songwriting workshop” during the three-day event. It will see participants dressed in the “white, greys, blacks, and reds” of gull feathers. Also at the event will be a ‘Gull Dance’ that will be created after an examination of gulls’ “muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, hearts and blood”. Audiovisual artist Lucy Dafwyn will be hosting a workshop teaching guests how to screech like gulls, which will then be performed as part of a ‘Gull Choir’. And “local pigeon lord” Adam Coley will be taking a ‘Gullaerobics’ lunchtime “wellness break”. It will see him putting guests through “gull positions, gestures and movements” so they can “get as sleekety-sleek as your local herring or black-backed gull”.",

        "content": "Reports from the Central Bank of the Iranian regime indicate that government debts to the banking system have doubled during Ebrahim Raisi’s presidency, and the government’s has worsened. The Central Bank of the Iranian regime recently released annual budget details for the period from 2017 to 2020, showing an annual deficit of 30%. Despite this, the Central Bank has still refrained from reporting on the budget realization status during Raisi’s term. In 2018, then–president Hassan Rouhani had instructed the Central Bank to stop publishing the country’s budget realization reports, citing the need to keep government information confidential due to US sanctions. Pro-government media in the Iranian regime are attempting to highlight the 5% growth in GDP in 2023 as a success for Raisi. However, details from the Statistical Center’s report show that the only reason for the relatively higher GDP growth last year was a 21.8% increase in and a 16.7% increase in government spending. Meanwhile, none of the mentioned GDP growth drivers have had a positive impact on people’s livelihoods and are not sustainable. In March, after a six-month halt, the Central Bank of the Iranian regime published the inflation report for December of the previous year, which indicated that the 2023 broke the 49% record set in 1995. According to the Central Bank, in December 2023, the point-to-point urban inflation rate was 54.2% and the average urban inflation rate was 55.9%. However, in March and April, the Central Bank, in its debt and dowry payment calculation table, announced the annual inflation rate for 2024 to be 52.3%, the highest annual inflation rate in the past 80 years. At the same time, the Statistical Center of Iran, by publishing the point-to-point inflation rate for 2023, announced that among commodities, various types of meat led the price increases with a 50.9% inflation rate. According to published statistics, the inflation rate this year was 32.24%, and the public transportation services sector topped the price increases with 58% inflation. Inflation in Iran has been increasing daily, and a recent report from the Statistical Center at the end of May showed that inflation in the red meat and poultry group was about 74% in the 12 months leading up to May 2024. According to this report, inflation in the housing sector was over 40%. Official reports, including the report from the Parliamentary Research Center, show that the pressure from rising costs on one hand and the lack of proportionate wage increases on the other has caused families to reduce their consumption of food and beverages. According to a report published by the Parliamentary Research Center in April and May 2024, the calorie intake of Iranians in 2022 was below the standard level. According to official data recorded on changes in the rental index, the highest growth record in rental rates in the history of recorded rental data was registered under the 13th government. Rental rates jumped by 44% and 52% in 2022 and 2023, respectively, which is unprecedented in Iran’s economic history since the rental index was recorded. Tejarat News website, in a comparative report, announced: “ ‘s government holds the record for the highest increase in gold coin prices in the first two and a half years of activity among the governments of the past 40 years.” According to this report, in the first 32 months of the 13th government’s activity, the price of gold coins jumped by 291%, the highest increase among the post-1979 revolution governments. In the first two and a half years of Hassan Rouhani’s government, the price of gold coins increased by 11%. The price of the dollar also grew by 160% in the first two and a half years of Raisi’s government, whereas it had increased by 10% in the first 32 months of Rouhani’s government.",

        "description": "Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts.",
        "content": "TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a “tragic mistake” had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry and and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service, killed at least 45 people. Israel’s military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior terrorists. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world’s top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. “Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,” Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel’s parliament. “We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.” In a separate development, Egypt’s military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas’ last remaining battalions in Rafah. The terrorist group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation. The U.S. National Security Council said in a statement that the “devastating images” from the strike on Rafah “are heartbreaking.” It said the U.S. was working with the Israeli military and others to assess what happened. French President Emmanuel Macron was more blunt, saying “these operations must stop” in a post on X. “There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate cease-fire,” he wrote. Qatar, a key mediator in attempts to secure a cease-fire and the release of hostages held by Hamas terrorists, said the Rafah strike could “complicate” talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas’ demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. The Israeli military’s top legal official, Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said authorities were examining the strike in Rafah and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers’ conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian terrorists and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of “violence, property crimes and looting” were also being examined. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian terrorists killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. The overall Palestinian death toll in the war is now above 36,000, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally.",

        "content": "Chinese doctors say they've CURED diabetes in man, 59, using stem cell therapy in a world-first By Connor Boyd Health And Science Editor For Dailymail.Com and Maiya Focht For Dailymail.Com Published: 21:18, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 21:56, 27 May 2024 e-mail 6 View comments Researchers in China say they have cured diabetes for the first time. The patient, a 59-year-old man, received a pioneering cell transplant in 2021 and has been medication-free since 2022. The experimental treatment involved creating an artificial version of cells found in the pancreas that produce insulin and keep blood sugar levels in check. The man had suffered from type 2 diabetes for 25 years and had lost almost all function of these cells, known as islets. He was deemed high risk of deadly complications, requiring multiple insulin injections every day to prevent him from going into a diabetic coma. The pancreas is an organ which, amongst other functions, produces insulin. Insulin is a natural hormone that our body uses to control the amount of sugar in our blood stream. People with diabetes have trouble regulating their blood sugar because of pancreatic dysfunction. People with diabetes often use blood sugar monitors, like this one pictured, to determine how much sugar is currently circulating in their blood stream. This helps them decide what to eat and when to use insulin to best manage their disease. Up to this point, no one has ever been 'cured' of diabetes, but doctors have figured out how to put it into remission. But this requires patients to keep up a relatively strict diet and exercise program to stop the blood sugar problems returning. However, the case in China suggests it's possible to restore the body's ability to naturally regulate blood-sugar without a patient changing their lifestyle. The treatment used stem cells, which are a blank-slate kind of cell that can be turned into the many different types of cells the body needs to function. Under the right conditions, stem cells can turn into brain, muscle, kidney or even pancreas tissue. This treatment used a new chemical cocktail to turn the patient's stem cells into pancreas cells. These cells produce insulin, which tells your body when to pull sugar from the food we eat for energy. In diabetics, the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar. Too much or too little sugar in the blood can cause nerve damage, kidney damage, heart disease and more. Read More Revolutionary treatment for type 1 diabetes could see cells that act like the pancreas transplanted into patients' arms By implanting the new, lab-grown cells, which can produce insulin, the patient could begin producing their own insulin again, researchers suggest. This is what doctors have observed in the Chinese patient. 'I think this study represents an important advance in the field of cell therapy for diabetes,' Timothy Kieffer, a professor of cellular and physiological sciences at the University of British Columbia in Canada, who was not involved with the research, told South China Morning Post . Though this finding is encouraging, there's still a ways to go before it can be approved for the masses. Next, scientists will have to test their therapy in more patients. After they test it in more people, Professor Kieffer said, they'll need to find a way to scale up their operation. Currently, turning blank 'seed cells' into functioning pancreas cells is incredibly intricate, time-consuming and expensive. Scientists will have to make the process easier if it's going to be feasible for most people. There is a chance it might only work to treat type 2 diabetes, which is the more common form of the disease. Type 1 diabetics, whose pancreas has been attacked by the immune system, might have a harder time using this treatment because their immune system might reject the new implanted cells, the study authors wrote. GOT A HEALTH-RELATED STORY? EMAIL: Health@dailymail.com Advertisement Regardless of all the hurdles still left to cross, this could be a huge step forward for the 38.4 million Americans currently living with diabetes and the 97.6 million who will likely go on to develop the disease. It's the eighth leading cause of death in the country. This paper, which was published in the journal Cell Discovery is the result of decades of research, across many countries, into how best to turn stem cells into islet cells, and how to get those islet cells into the body. 'Our technology has matured and it has pushed boundaries in the field of regenerative medicine for the treatment of diabetes,' Dr Yin Hao, one of the lead researchers said. The study was a collaboration between three institutions based in Shanghai -the Shanghai Changzheng Hospital, the Centre for Excellence in Molecular Cell Science under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Renji Hospital. In the future, Professor Kieffer said this therapy may, 'free patients from the burden of chronic medications, improve health and quality of life, and reduce healthcare expenditures.'

That was later revised up to 670, according to estimates from the Chief of Mission for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in the country. But that may now be a major underestimate according to the latest projection from Papua New Guinea’s disaster agency. “The landslide buried more than 2000 people alive and caused major destruction to buildings, food gardens and caused major impact on the economic lifeline of the country,” National Disaster Centre Acting Director Lusete Laso Mana said in a letter to the UN. “The situation remains unstable as the landslip continues to shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both rescue teams and survivors alike,” he added, saying the main highway to the area had been completely blocked by the landslide. “Following the inspection conducted by the team, it was determined that the damages are extensive and require immediate and collaborative actions from all players.”",

        "content": "After making significant strides in his second NFL season, Giants edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux has his sights set on taking yet another leap in 2024. Thibodeaux, the fifth overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, flashed upside as a rookie but only racked up 49 tackles, including six for a loss, and four sacks. Although he started and ended 2023 sluggishly, Thibodeaux finished the year with 11.5 sacks, the 12th-most in the NFL. Now back in East Rutherford for his third year of organized team activities, Thibodeaux recently told reporters he's doing \"everything\" he can to \"take that next step\" toward greatness. “Last year I was able to get 11 and a half sacks,” Thibodeaux said , via Pro Football Talk's Josh Alper. “Those are the accolades. Now it’s about getting that respect throughout the league, having teams fear coming to play against us. Just taking everything I do to the next level as far as that extra. Greatness is optional. I just got to kind of take that next step.” Prior to Thursday's OTAs session, Thibodeaux also made it clear that \"every year\" he's with the Giants, he's gunning for his mentor and Giants legend Michael Strahan's single-season sack record of 22.5. While no player has yet to top Strahan's impressive feat, it's worth noting that Steelers LB T.J. Watt tied the record during the 2021 season. Despite his confidence and last season's increased production, Thibodeaux has a long way to go before he can be considered one of the NFL's top edge-rushers and have a chance to break the single-season sack record. As mentioned, Thibodeaux struggled to maintain consistency last season. Not only did he go his first two games of the season without a sack, but he also failed to collect one across his final four games. During those six games, Thibodeaux made just five solo tackles, three of which came in New York's 27-10 Week 18 win over Philadelphia. Additionally, Thibodeaux's underlying metrics from last season show that he wasn't nearly as dominant as his sack total suggests. According to Pro Football Focus , Thibodeaux posted a 6.4 pass-rush win rate in 2023, ranking 101st among all qualified edge-rushers. The total was also substantially lower than the 9.7 pass-rush win rate he posted as a rookie, which would've still only ranked 77th among edges this past season. Nonetheless, considering the Giants are implementing a different scheme under new DC Shane Bowen and the team added two-time Pro Bowl edge-rusher Brian Burns earlier this offseason, Thibodeaux is well-positioned to continue his ascent.",

        "content": "At least one member of the believes the team's offense is ready to cook in 2024. Michael Pittman Jr., who with the team this offseason, : I think we could have the best RPO [run-pass option] game in the whole NFL. We went to the RPO a lot last year, and just being able to add Anthony's legs, I mean, he can add in a whole other aspect which is you can't really load up that box. He can pull it and throw it. You can't really [concentrate] most of the defense towards J.T. There are reasons for Pittman's optimism. Two of those reasons are quarterback and running back Jonathan Taylor. Both are healthy after injuries affected them in 2023. In fact, the two barely played together in 2023. As ESPN notes, Richardson got hurt as Taylor returned from injury, and the pair hardly spent any time together on the field. Key Players Return for the Colts Taylor started 2023 late due to an ankle injury and a contract dispute, while Richardson was sidelined with a shoulder injury. Jonathan Taylor 2023 Stats Games Played 10 Rushing Attempts 169 Rushing Yards 741 Rushing Touchdowns 7 Receptions 19 Receiving Yards 153 Receiving Touchdowns 1 Fumbles 1 Pittman Jr. himself is still developing into a key weapon, and other young Colts such as Josh Downs and Alec Pierce have more experience under their belts now. The Colts also will get tight end Jelani Woods back as he will be recovering from injury, and the team added wide receiver Adonai Mitchell via the . That gives Indianapolis an offense full of young, talented skill players. Head coach that things are looking up for the Colts: It's fun and it's exciting. Every week, we'll have things [in the game plan] for every single guy. As far as the scheme goes, it's exciting to have a whole bunch of guys that you can do a whole bunch of different things with. According to ESPN, Steichen has spent a lot of time in his office, working on the best ways to utilize this offense against opponents by creating the best possible matchups. The coach loves to use multiple personnel groupings, and the versatility offered by this group of skill-position players gives him a lot of options. He's also open to feedback from his players. We just toss ideas around. He asks me how I feel about certain things, and, then if I see certain things on the internet, like if I see a sweep or an option play or something like that, I'll say 'Hey, that's kind of nice.' I'll show it to him and he'll be like, 'OK, we might be able to throw that in.' It's amazing to have a coach like that because we get to use our offense and use our weapons. Even with backups Gardner Minshew and Zack Moss playing, the Colts managed to be 10th in the NFL with 23.3 points per game.

It's going to be a crazy year. Perhaps just crazy enough that the Colts, who missed the playoffs due to a loss in the regular-season finale, will be in the postseason at the end of the year. Anthony Richardson's injury-plagued first four games were still historic: his 136 rushing yards were 9th-most for a QB in his first four career games, and his four rushing TDs were tied for 1st with Cam Newton and RG3.

        "description": "Bill Walton, who starred for John Wooden’s UCLA Bruins before becoming a Hall of Fame center for his NBA career and one of the biggest stars of basketball broadcasting, has died. The league announced that Walton died Monday after a...",
        "content": "Bill Walton was never afraid to be himself. Larger than life, only in part because of his nearly 7-foot frame, Walton was a two-time NCAA champion at UCLA, a two-time champion in the NBA, a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, an on-court icon in every sense of the word. And off the court, Walton was a chronic fun-seeker, a broadcaster who adhered to no conventional norms and took great joy in that, a man with a deeply serious side about the causes that mattered most to him. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton died Monday at the age of 71 after a prolonged fight with cancer, the league announced on behalf of his family. He was the NBA’s MVP in the 1977-78 season, the league’s sixth man of the year in 1985-86 and a member of the league’s 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he blossomed while playing under coach John Wooden at UCLA, becoming a three-time national player of the year. “I am sad today hearing that my comrade and one of the sports world’s most beloved champions and characters has passed,” Julius “Dr. J” Erving, a fellow Hall of Famer, wrote on social media. “Bill Walton enjoyed life in every way. To compete against him and to work with him was a blessing in my life.” Walton, who entered the Hall of Fame in 1993, was one of the game’s most beloved figures. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. “It’s a legend lost when you talk about basketball and what he brought to the media side,” Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “As an ex-player, to be able to be successful not just on the court but also on TV.” Walton's most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,” UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. “Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger-than-life personality. \"I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” When Walton retired from the NBA he turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times’ bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.” It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “I lived most of my life by myself. But as soon as I got on the court I was fine,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper for a story published in 2017. “But in life, being so self conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word. Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and sang its praises all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton was involved in the broadcasts of college and NBA games for CBS, NBC and ABC/ESPN in his career, along with stints working for the Clippers and Sacramento Kings as an analyst. He returned to ESPN and the Pac-12 Network, touting the roots of his beloved league, in 2012. “Bill Walton was a legendary player and a singular personality who genuinely cherished every experience throughout the journey of his extraordinary life,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said. “Bill often described himself as ‘the luckiest guy in the world,’ but anyone who had the opportunity to interact with Bill was the lucky one. He was a truly special, giving person who always made time for others. Bill’s one-of-a-kind spirit captivated and inspired audiences during his second career as a successful broadcaster.” But Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. It was snapped against Notre Dame in 1974, a 71-70 loss in which Walton shot 12 for 14 from the field. “Bill Walton's passing is a sad tragedy. One of the great ones in UCLA basketball history,” Digger Phelps, who coached that Notre Dame team, posted Monday on social media. “We were great friends over the years. It won’t be the same without him.” UCLA went 30-0 in each of Walton's first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” Walton led Portland to the 1977 NBA title, then got his second championship with the Celtics in 1986. “Bill Walton was an icon,” said Jody Allen, the chair of the Trail Blazers. “His leadership and tenacity on the court were key to bringing a championship to our fans and defined one of the most magical moments in franchise history. We will always treasure what he brought to our community and the sport of basketball.” The Celtics released a statement saying: “Bill Walton was one of the most consequential players of his era. ... Walton could do it all, possessing great timing, complete vision of the floor, excellent fundamentals and was of one of the greatest passing big men in league history.” Walton considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said in his Hall of Fame speech. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He said Bill Russell was his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. In his final years, Walton spoke out about issues that mattered most to him, such as the problem of homelessness in his native San Diego. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said in a statement. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Walton, who had a prolonged fight with cancer, was 71. He was the NBA's MVP in the 1977-78 season, a two-time champion and a member of the league's 50th anniversary and 75th anniversary teams. That followed a college career in which he was a two-time champion at UCLA and a three-time national player of the year. “Bill Walton,” NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said, “was truly one of a kind.” Walton, who was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1993, was larger than life, on the court and off. His NBA career — disrupted by chronic foot injuries — lasted only 468 games with Portland, the San Diego and eventually Los Angeles Clippers and Boston. He averaged 13.3 points and 10.5 rebounds in those games, neither of those numbers exactly record-setting. Still, his impact on the game was massive. His most famous game was the 1973 NCAA title game, UCLA against Memphis, in which he shot an incredible 21 for 22 from the field and led the Bruins to another national championship. “One of my guards said, ’Let’s try something else,” Wooden told The Associated Press in 2008 for a 35th anniversary retrospective on that game. Wooden’s response during that timeout: “Why? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” They kept giving the ball to Walton, and he kept delivering in a performance for the ages. “It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball,\" UCLA coach Mick Cronin said Monday. \"Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him.” Walton retired from the NBA and turned to broadcasting, something he never thought he could be good at — and an avenue he sometimes wondered would be possible for him, because he had a pronounced stutter at times in his life. Turns out, he was excellent at that, too: Walton was an Emmy winner, eventually was named one of the top 50 sports broadcasters of all time by the American Sportscasters Association and even appeared on The New York Times' bestseller list for his memoir, “Back from the Dead.\" It told the story of a debilitating back injury suffered in 2008, one that left him considering taking his own life because of the constant pain, and how he spent years recovering. “In life, being so self-conscious, red hair, big nose, freckles and goofy, nerdy-looking face and can’t talk at all. I was incredibly shy and never said a word,” Walton told The Oregonian newspaper in 2017. “Then, when I was 28 I learned how to speak. It’s become my greatest accomplishment of my life and everybody else’s biggest nightmare.” The last part of that was just Walton hyperbole. He was beloved for his on-air tangents, sometimes appeared on-air in Grateful Dead T-shirts; Walton was a huge fan of the band and referenced it often, even sometimes recording satellite radio specials celebrating what it meant to be a “Deadhead.” And the Pac-12 Conference, which has basically evaporated in many ways now because of college realignment, was another of his many loves. He always referred to it as the “Conference of Champions” and loved it all the way to the end. “It doesn’t get any better than this,” he once said on a broadcast, tie-dyed T-shirt on, a Hawaiian lei around his neck. Walton will always be synonymous with UCLA’s dominance. He enrolled at the school in 1970, before freshmen could play on the varsity team. Once he could play for Wooden, the Bruins were unbeatable for more than two years — Walton’s UCLA teams won their first 73 games, the bulk of the Bruins’ extraordinary 88-game winning streak. UCLA went 30-0 in each of his first two seasons, and 86-4 in his career on the varsity. “My teammates ... made me a much better basketball player than I could ever have become myself,” Walton said at his Hall of Fame speech in 1993. “The concept of team has always been the most intriguing aspect of basketball to me. If I had been interested in individual success or an individual sport, I would have taken up tennis or golf.” He also considered himself fortunate to have been guided by two of the game’s greatest minds in Wooden and Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach. “Thank you John, and thank you Red, for making my life what it has become,” Walton said. Walton was the No. 1 pick by Portland in the 1974 draft. He considered Bill Russell his favorite player and found Larry Bird the toughest and best he played with, so it was appropriate that his playing career ended as a member of the Celtics. “Playing basketball with Larry Bird,” Walton once said, “is like singing with Jerry Garcia,” referencing the co-founder of the Grateful Dead. “What I will remember most about him was his zest for life,” Silver said. “He was a regular presence at league events — always upbeat, smiling ear to ear and looking to share his wisdom and warmth. I treasured our close friendship, envied his boundless energy and admired the time he took with every person he encountered.” Walton died surrounded by his loved ones, his family said. He is survived by wife Lori and sons Adam, Nate, Chris and Luke — a former NBA player and now a coach. AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA",

Although Goldberg never wrestled Eddie Guerrero, the WWE Hall of Famer did wrestle Chavo. (per Fightful ) “That Guerrero family had such a huge impact on me when I was coming up. They would take the time, unlike others, who felt threatened, they would take the time to make sure I knew the basics. Whether it was Eddie or Chavo. Chavo was great with me. The entire family, I have nothing but found memories with all of our interactions. In this day and age, a lot of people have ulterior motives. That family never had an ulterior motive, just an effort to make you better than you were before. That, you have to take your hat off to and cover your heart for, and you have to be appreciative that you run into people with such good character.”",

        "content": "AMSTERDAM - Midfielder Marten de Roon has been ruled out of the European Championship after being injured playing for Atalanta in the Italian Cup final, the Dutch football association said in statement on Monday. The 33-year-old Atalanta midfielder suffered an undisclosed muscle injury two weeks ago in the final, which his club lost 1-0 to Juventus, and will not be fit in time for the tournament in Germany. It meant he missed last Wednesday's Europa League final in Dublin, which Atalanta won 3-0 over German champions Bayer Leverkusen. \"I can't imagine I've had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn't play the final, win the Europa League,\" De Roon posted on social media on Monday. \"In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff: it turns out I can't play the Euros. \"I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it's a very tough day.\" De Roon has won 42 caps for the Netherlands, competing in the last Euros and the World Cup in Qatar. Dutch coach Ronald Koeman will announce the final Euro 2024 selection on Wednesday. After De Roon's withdrawal, the pre-selection consists of 29 players, with three set to be axed from the final squad. The squad assembled on Monday for their first session with Quinten Timber training apart from the rest as the Feyenoord midfielder is still nursing an injury. In the run-up to the tournament in Germany, the Dutch will play warm-up matches against Canada and Iceland next week. REUTERS",

However, things took a sharp turn when, according to social media posts from attendees, the Oscar-winning actor began sharing offensive comments about women and trans youth. According to one attendee , Dreyfuss called Barbra Streisand a “genius” but said he “didn’t listen to her because she is a woman and women shouldn’t have that power.” The same attendee said Dreyfuss—who was clad in a housedress and waving a cane, according to Deadline —then claimed that “you shouldn’t be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.” More attendees shared on the theater’s Facebook page that they walked out of the event because of Dreyfuss’ inflammatory remarks. One person wrote, “We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred[s] of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic [sic] rant.” Another attendee posted: “richard dreyfuss is an embarrassment to society. I walked out tonight because of his small minded bigoted view of women and choice.” The Daily Beast has reached out to Dreyfuss’ representative for comment. This isn’t the first time Dreyfuss’ views have landed him in hot water. Last year, during an interview on PBS’s Firing Line , the actor blasted the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences’ new diversity and inclusion rules while defending actors using blackface. “They make me vomit,” he said of the academy’s rules. “Because this is an art form. It’s also a form of commerce and it makes money, but it’s an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.”",

        "content": "EAMONN Holmes is facing fresh heartbreak following his split from Ruth Langsford — the loss of custody of their beloved dog Maggie. The pooch, 14, which the former This Morning presenters adopted in 2011, is said to be like a “second child” to them, even appearing with the pair on the ITV show. Ruth shared a video of herself walking Collie cross Maggie on Sunday — her first post since the couple told The Sun their 14-year marriage was over. They said they had been living separate lives for two years and Eamonn, who has faced health struggles of late, had recently moved out. Pals said he and Ruth are now having “difficult conversations” over who gets the dog. The pair, both 64, are trying to avoid calling in lawyers like Ant McPartlin and his ex-wife Lisa Armstrong did when they rowed about their mutt Hurley. A source said: “Maggie is like a daughter to them. They dote on her. But she’s getting on and they know she needs stability. \"It’s a case of who can give her that. Eamonn adores her and Maggie’s been such a support during his health woes . \"The thought of giving her up is heartbreaking to him. “But if Ruth is able to get out and about and walk her more, then it may well be that she gets Maggie in the split . “They are adamant this won’t come to what Ant and Lisa went through and they won’t be getting lawyers involved.” Eamonn, who has a son, Jack, 22, with Ruth, spoke earlier this year of Maggie’s “unconditional love” and the joy she brings to his life. He said: “I genuinely have never experienced affection like it.” Friends said he and Ruth drifted apart when they were taken off This Morning in 2021. Insiders said Ruth wanted a fresh start while admitting Eamonn believed they could salvage something. Ruth will not appear on Loose Women this week following the news of their divorce. Eamonn is expected to return to GB News’ Breakfast Show today. Pals do not know if he will address their split on air. Before the shock split announcement, Ruth and Eamonn seemed like one of the strongest couples on UK TV – even with their signature bickering style. Here's how their romance played out 1997 - The couple first meet after being introduced by mutual friends, two years after Eamonn splits from his first wife, Gabrielle, with whom he has three children. 1997-2002 - To be respectful to Gabrielle, the couple kept their relationship out of the limelight. Ruth told Daily Mail : \"I thought it spoke volumes about the sort of man he was, the sort of father he was and the integrity he had. It made me love him more, not less.\" 2002 - Ruth and Eamonn welcome their son, Jack, to the family 2005 - Eamonn finalises his divorce with Gabrielle 2006 - The pair begin to host Friday episodes of This Morning together 2010 - Eamonn proposes to Ruth while at the Cheltenham Races, after asking Ruth's mother for her hand June 2010 - Eamonn and Ruth marry at Elvetham Hall, Hampshire 2016 - Eamonn undergoes a double hip replacement in the first of many health battles. June 2019 - On This Morning, Ruth and Eamonn say the secret to their happy marriage. Eamonn credits \"compromise, consideration and lots of conjugals,\" while Ruth said it was \"laughter and an equal marriage\" November 2020 - Ruth and Eamonn are replaced on their regular Friday slot by Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary in a 'show shake-up' December 202 1 - After a year of being moved to the bank holiday presenting slot, both Eamonn and Ruth left This Morning January 2022 - Eamonn makes his debut on GB News, while Ruth stayed with ITV in her long-standing role on Loose Women. September 2022 - Eamonn undergoes spinal surgery after years of back issues including a trapped sciatic nerve. November 2022 - Eamonn falls down the stairs of his Surrey home with Ruth and breaks his shoulder, requiring a new operation September 2023 - Eamonn has a spine and neck stretching procedure as part of his year-long recovery May 2024 - Ruth and Eamonn announce they have split after 14 years of marriage and 27 year relationship",

        "content": "EAMONN Holmes is facing fresh heartbreak following his split from Ruth Langsford — the loss of custody of their beloved dog Maggie. The pooch, 14, which the former This Morning presenters adopted in 2011, is said to be like a “second child” to them, even appearing with the pair on the ITV show. Ruth shared a video of herself walking Collie cross Maggie on Sunday — her first post since the couple told The Sun their 14-year marriage was over. They said they had been living separate lives for two years and Eamonn , who has faced health struggles of late, had recently moved out. Pals said he and Ruth are now having “difficult conversations” over who gets the dog. The pair, both 64, are trying to avoid calling in lawyers like Ant McPartlin and his ex-wife Lisa Armstrong did when they rowed about their mutt Hurley. A source said: “Maggie is like a daughter to them. They dote on her. But she’s getting on and they know she needs stability. \"It’s a case of who can give her that. Eamonn adores her and Maggie’s been such a support during his health woes . \"The thought of giving her up is heartbreaking to him. “But if Ruth is able to get out and about and walk her more, then it may well be that she gets Maggie in the split . “They are adamant this won’t come to what Ant and Lisa went through and they won’t be getting lawyers involved.” Eamonn, who has a son, Jack, 22, with Ruth, spoke earlier this year of Maggie’s “unconditional love” and the joy she brings to his life. He said: “I genuinely have never experienced affection like it.” Friends said he and Ruth drifted apart when they were taken off This Morning in 2021. Insiders said Ruth wanted a fresh start while admitting Eamonn believed they could salvage something. Ruth will not appear on Loose Women this week following the news of their divorce .

        "content": "OTTAWA — Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan has announced he will stand down ahead of the general election. In a personal statement posted on X, formerly known as Twitter , Mr Brennan said \"a seed of doubt\" as to whether to continue was \"sown\" after surgery for prostate cancer. Sharing the news on Monday evening, he said: \"I’m announcing my decision to stand down as Cardiff West MP after 23 years - thank you to local Labour members and constituents for your friendship and support.\" In the statement he explained how he intended to stand for his seventh term, but decided not to due to the intensity of the role. He said it is \"the right moment\" for him to stand down.

Following the sudden announcement on Wednesday, it was still my intention to stand again for a seventh term, but after discussing it with my family over the bank holiday weekend I have concluded that this is the right election for me to step down. \"The job of a Member of Parliament is immensely rewarding but highly demanding for the individual and their loved ones. I have always enjoyed its intensity and challenge, but after surgery for prostate cancer a small seed of doubt was sown as to whether I should continue in such a full-on role. \"Standing again would mean making a commitment to perform the demanding duties of an MP close to my 70th birthday. This has led me to conclude that this is the right moment to stand down.\" Mr Brennan underwent prostate cancer surgery in 2022. Mr Brennan said he had had a PSA test, a blood test which is used to help detect prostate cancer. The test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood. Speaking at the time he said: \"I am a fit and healthy man who had zero symptoms before diagnosis - over 50s ask your GP for a PSA test and get a scan if indicated as I did - early diagnosis means you can monitor changes and intervene only if necessary.\" Mr Brennan entered the Commons in 2001 and previously served as a Labour minister, as well as on the shadow front bench. He is a member of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.",

        "description": "Walton supported the 'Conference of Champions' like nobody else during his career as a broadcaster for ESPN and the Pac-12 Network.",
        "content": "Two days after the Pac-12 took its final competitive breath, the conference lost its soul. Bill Walton passed away Monday after 71 years of a life like no other, ever. The cause: cancer. Left unsaid: a broken heart. Walton might have been the greatest player in college basketball history. He won two NCAA titles with UCLA and two more in the NBA (with Portland and Boston) and was a no-brainer Hall of Fame inductee. He was the world’s preeminent Grateful Dead fan, a cycling enthusiast, a passionate environmentalist, a voracious reader and an iconic sports broadcaster. He was as brilliant as he was goofy, as genuine as he was colorful, as joyous as he was loquacious. Oh, could he talk. My first conversation with Walton, years ago, was by telephone. I dialed; he answered. I introduced myself; he thanked me for calling, then spoke for 40 consecutive minutes — I did not utter a peep — on a surreal range of topics. The conversation at the Pearly Gates just went next-level, folks. Also, Walton was the most passionate, unrelenting champion of his beloved ‘Conference of Champions.’ Using his platform on ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, Walton became the face and voice of the Pac-12 — a favorite of conference executives and campus officials alike. For years, the only thing former commissioner Larry Scott and his marginalized athletic directors had in common was their fondness of Walton. He loved engaging with fans, took a sincere interest in the athletes and continually praised the quality of play, even when the metrics were at odds with his reality. It made sense: The UCLA graduate used to credit the Pac-12 “for my life.” When UCLA and USC announced in the summer of 2022 that they were leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, Walton was crushed. He remained silent for months, then finally authored “ UCLA’s Wrong Turn ,” a poetic lament offered as a written statement: “I don’t believe that joining the Big 10 is in the best interest of UCLA, its students, its athletes, its alumni, its fans, the rest of the UC system, the State of California, or the world at large.” Later in the statement, he wrote: “I have spoken to no one, other than the highest-level directors of athletics at UCLA, who think that this proposed move to the Big 10 is a good idea, “Every argument made by these senior AD’s and why they like it, is about money, “These same proponents of moving to the Big 10, are the first people I have ever encountered in my life, “Who have claimed economic hardship and limitations in Los Angeles, “And that the solution lies in the Midwest” Walton continued his broadcasting duties for ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, mixing life stories with game analysis as only he could. But the heartache endured. His passing on Monday, first announced by the NBA, came two days after the final athletic competition under the Pac-12 banner: Arizona’s victory over USC in the baseball tournament. Whether Walton was aware of the event, we cannot say. He passed away two months before the Pac-12 as we know it ceases to exist. On Aug. 2, the departing schools will join their new leagues.

Beyond that, nobody knows. But this much is sure: Walton lived for 26,136 days, and the Pac-12 existed for every one of them.

        "content": "Two days after the Pac-12 took its final competitive breath, the conference lost its soul. Bill Walton passed away Monday after 71 years of a life like no other, ever. The cause: cancer. Left unsaid: a broken heart. Walton might have been the greatest player in college basketball history. He won two NCAA titles with UCLA and two more in the NBA (with Portland and Boston) and was a no-brainer Hall of Fame inductee. He was the world’s preeminent Grateful Dead fan, a cycling enthusiast, a passionate environmentalist, a voracious reader and an iconic sports broadcaster. He was as brilliant as he was goofy, as genuine as he was colorful, as joyous as he was loquacious. Oh, could he talk. My first conversation with Walton, years ago, was by telephone. I dialed; he answered. I introduced myself; he thanked me for calling, then spoke for 40 consecutive minutes — I did not utter a peep — on a surreal range of topics. The conversation at the Pearly Gates just went next-level, folks. Also, Walton was the most passionate, unrelenting champion of his beloved ‘Conference of Champions.’ Using his platform on ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, Walton became the face and voice of the Pac-12 — a favorite of conference executives and campus officials alike. For years, the only thing former commissioner Larry Scott and his marginalized athletic directors had in common was their fondness of Walton. He loved engaging with fans, took a sincere interest in the athletes and continually praised the quality of play, even when the metrics were at odds with his reality. It made sense: The UCLA graduate used to credit the Pac-12 “for my life.” When UCLA and USC announced in the summer of 2022 that they were leaving the Pac-12 for the Big Ten, Walton was crushed. He remained silent for months, then finally authored “ UCLA’s Wrong Turn ,” a poetic lament offered as a written statement: “I don’t believe that joining the Big 10 is in the best interest of UCLA, its students, its athletes, its alumni, its fans, the rest of the UC system, the State of California, or the world at large.” Later in the statement, he wrote: “I have spoken to no one, other than the highest-level directors of athletics at UCLA, who think that this proposed move to the Big 10 is a good idea, “Every argument made by these senior AD’s and why they like it, is about money, “These same proponents of moving to the Big 10, are the first people I have ever encountered in my life, “Who have claimed economic hardship and limitations in Los Angeles, “And that the solution lies in the Midwest” Walton continued his broadcasting duties for ESPN and the Pac-12 Networks, mixing life stories with game analysis as only he could.

        "content": "The Connecticut Sun are off to their third 5-0 start in franchise history, and their past four wins were decided by a combined 16 points. Coming off another close win, the Sun attempt to start a season with six straight wins for the first time Tuesday night when they host the Phoenix Mercury in Uncasville, Conn. The Sun are off to the same five-win start as the 2021 and 2018 seasons. After opening with a 21-point rout of Indiana, Connecticut earned a seven-point victory over Washington, a four-point win at Indiana and a one-point overtime home win over Minnesota. Connecticut kept the unbeaten start going on Saturday when it earned an 86-82 win at Chicago thanks to DeWanna Bonner, who leads the team in scoring at 20.6 points. Bonner scored eight of her 19 points in the fourth quarter. Bonner scored five straight points to spark a 7-0 run that turned a one-point Sun deficit into a 85-79 lead with about 3 1/2 minutes remaining in regulation. Bonner started by missing her first five 3-point attempts, and her big fourth quarter helped the Sun overcome Alyssa Thomas getting ejected in the third quarter for a flagrant foul against Chicago rookie Angel Reese. \"Certainly you don't want to have your MVP off the floor. She was on her way to a triple-double,\" Sun coach Stephanie White said of Thomas, who had nine points, six assists and six rebounds before the ejection. \"But everybody stepped up, and for us to be successful, that's what it's going to take.\" After winning three straight and holding their first four opponents to 42.3 percent shooting or lower, the Mercury (3-2) were handed a 107-92 loss to the Dallas Wings on Saturday. Phoenix allowed 52 percent shooting and a 40-point game to Arike Ogunbowale while struggling in the paint and on the glass. The Mercury experienced their worst struggles on the inside while Britney Griner continued to recover from a fractured toe. They were outrebounded 38-25 and outscored 52-26 in the paint. \"This is one of those games where we got dominated inside,\" Phoenix coach Nate Tibbetts said. \"Give them credit, that's their strength. They took full advantage tonight.\" Kahleah Copper led the Mercury with 32 points for her third 30-point game of the season; she now leads the league with 29.2 points per game. Diana Taurasi added 28 but Phoenix struggled to overcome a 17-point halftime deficit. This article first appeared on Field Level Media and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "Residents and developers will be able to remove trees within three metres of dwellings or pools more easily under changes proposed by Sutherland Shire Council. or signup to continue reading At present, development applications (DAs) are subject to a merit assessment against specified criteria, including public safety, bush fire risk, personal hardship, Greenweb, and scenic and visual quality. The council voted 8-6 at last week's council meeting to amend the Development Control Plan (DCP) to state, \"Council will permit removal of a tree located within three metres of an existing or proposed dwelling or swimming pool as part of council's assessment\". \"An application must still be submitted to council and approved before a tree which is located within three metres of an existing or proposed building or swimming pool or can be removed,\" the DCP will state. \"In bushfire prone zones RFS regulations apply (10 metres).\" The rewording will include the \"objective\" to \"recognise that some residents do not feel comfortable when large trees are located close to their residence\". The fee for replacement trees, required as part of approvals, will increase from $125 to a \"realistic\" $400. The council is required to conduct community engagement before the change is locked in. A report by council staff recommended the statu quo, stating that an \"as-of-right approach\" was less likely to maintain the current tree canopy percentages, and even more unlikely to deliver on NSW Government targets. Mayor Carmelo Pesce, who moved to amend the DCP, said the new wording was actually introduced in 2012 at the instigation of Liberal councillors, and remained until the 2015 LEP and DCP came into effect. The provision had been \"removed without our consent\" by council staff, he said. Cr Pesce said he only found out when, \"on three occasions, he was approached by residents after council staff refused a DA because a tree was in the way\". Cr Pesce said his priority was making sure people felt safe in their homes, not the tree canopy. \"That's what our responsibility is - not worrying about the canopy, because our community comes first,\" he said. Cr Pesce said there had been many incidents of trees falling unexpectedly and endangering lives. Labor councillor Jack Boyd opposed the change, saying it \"opened too many doors\" for trees to be removed. Cr Boyd said someone could lodge a DA, but go through with it, \"and then, 'look, amazing, the yard's just lost a big gum tree' \". \"We have enough problems with our tree and bushland policy and the loss of tree canopy, I think we can go to the minimal effort of having a merit assessment for an application that already has to be lodged,\" he said. \"I don't understand why we would open Pandora's Box for all the maybes. \"Let's not get wrapped up in the history of what's occurred in the past, let's look at it on its merits now. Fellow Labor councillor Diedree Steinwall said much had changed since 2012. \"We are losing 5000-6000 canopy trees a year and we can't afford to have something that would probably lend itself to more trees,\" she said. \"We are not meeting our own canopy targets or state government targets.\" St George and Sutherland Shire Leader reporter covering politics, urban affairs, council, development and general community news.Email: mtrembath@theleader.com.au St George and Sutherland Shire Leader reporter covering politics, urban affairs, council, development and general community news.Email: mtrembath@theleader.com.au",

        "content": "Rafael Nadal’s record-breaking French Open career came to its likely end on Monday when the 14-time champion slumped to a demoralising defeat against Alexander Zverev before he revealed his journey to the Paris Olympics in July will not take a detour to Wimbledon. Nadal, who turns 38 on June 3, went down 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in the first round to world number four Zverev, suffering only his fourth loss in 116 matches at Roland Garros since his 2005 title-winning debut. It was the first time he had been defeated in Paris in the opening round and will again lead to questions over his long-term future in the sport. “I don’t know if it’s the last time I’ll be here in front of all of you,” he said. “If it is, then you have been amazing. The feelings I have today are difficult to describe in words. It is the place I love the most.” He added: “It’s hard to say about the future. I am travelling with my family and I am having fun. The body is feeling better than it did two months ago. Maybe in two months I say it’s enough. That is something I don’t feel yet.” Nadal may not return for the 2025 French Open but he still plans to play the Olympics at Roland Garros in July. Nadal, an Olympic singles gold medallist in Beijing in 2008 and doubles champion at the Rio Games, later told reporters: “That’s my main goal now. I need to prepare myself the proper way to try to arrive healthy and well-prepared.” He won’t make the rankings cut for the Olympics, but as a Grand Slam winner he would be eligible for a spot reserved for major winners. Plagued by injuries, which had limited him to just four events since January last year, former world number one Nadal is now 275 in the rankings and was unseeded in Paris. “My body has been a jungle for two years. You don’t know what to expect. You know, I wake up one day and I found a snake biting me. Another day a tiger,” said Nadal of his recent battles with a hip injury. In his career, he has had to skip 11 Grand Slams. That is certain to become 12 next month when he is likely to skip Wimbledon where he was champion in 2008 and 2010. “It looks difficult to make a transition to grass, having the Olympics again on clay,” he said. “I don’t think it’s going to be smart after all the things that happened to my body now make a big transition to a completely different surface and then come back immediately to clay. I don’t think it’s a positive idea right now.” Zverev said it had been “a great honour” to play Nadal on 11 occasions in their careers. “I’ve watched Rafa play all my childhood and I was lucky enough to play him two times on this beautiful court. Today is not my moment, it is Rafa’s moment,” said the German star. In a repeat of the 2022 semi-final, which Nadal won when Zverev quit with ankle ligament damage, the Spaniard had his chances. He was a break of serve up in the second and third sets, only to be pinned back on both occasions by his in-form 27-year-old opponent. However, a relentless Zverev broke six times from 18 opportunities and fired 44 winners to Nadal’s 34. Chants of “Rafa, Rafa” had loudly echoed under the roof of Court Philippe Chatrier which was shut tight against the torrential rain sweeping across the grounds and bringing havoc to the schedule. They subsided to silence when Nadal was broken to love in his opening service game and he was left to regret his inability to convert two break points in the fourth game. Nadal saved two set points in the ninth game but surrendered the opener after 50 minutes when he buried a loose forehand into the net. It was only the fourth opening set he had lost at Roland Garros. Nadal broke for the first time in the match to lead 3-2 in the second set but couldn’t back up the advantage and handed the break back to three-time semi-finalist Zverev as he served for the set. A tense tie-breaker followed which the German claimed, buoyed by stretching to 5/3 on the back of a gruelling 19-shot rally. Nadal dug deep and with the likes of Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek having watched from the packed stands, he broke and held for 2-0 in the third set. However, Zverev again roared back to level at 2-2 before a besieged Nadal had to save four break points in a 13-minute fifth game to stay in contention. The effort was too much and a composed Zverev was soon 4-3 up and the match was over when Nadal fired a forehand wide and long.

        "content": "Share Tweet Share Share Email Figma is a potent design tool that has swiftly risen to the top of the UI/UX design field. Figma is a useful tool for designers of all experience levels to have in their toolbox. We’ll go over some essential stages in this blog post to assist you in learning Figma as a novice. Learn How to Use the Interface of Figma Getting acquainted with Figma’s interface is the first step towards learning it. Although Figma’s UI is simple to use and straightforward, it may take some getting accustomed to. Take some time to explore the various menus and panels, and see how they interact with one another. To gain a better understanding of how Figma functions , you may also have a peek at some of the pre-made designs and templates. Acquire Knowledge of the Fundamental Tools After you’ve become comfortable with the interface, it’s time to master the fundamental tools. Although Figma has a large toolkit, all you need to know to get started are a few fundamental ones. These consist of the text tool, pen tool, shape tool, and selection tool. Take some time to experiment and become familiar with these tools. Practice Creating Simple Layouts The following action is to practice creating simple layouts. Start with something basic, such as a login screen or landing page. When creating the layout, use the fundamental skills you’ve learned and pay attention to small elements like typography, spacing, and alignment. You can start by using one of the many templates available in Figma, but it’s also a good idea to try creating something from scratch. Play Around with Prototyping Design processes must include prototyping, and Figma makes it simple to produce interactive prototypes. Try out various animations and interactions while you create prototypes for your projects. Don’t be scared to try new things—Figma’s prototyping tools are user-friendly and straightforward to use. Participate in the Figma Community Getting involved in the Figma community is one of the greatest ways to learn Figma . Numerous online tools, guides, and discussion boards are available for you to interact with other designers and gain knowledge from their experiences. You can get access to templates, design materials, and other resources that will help you further your career by becoming a member of the Figma community. Figma’s ability to facilitate real-time collaboration on a single file is another significant benefit. If designers wish to share their work created with traditional “offline” tools such as Sketch and Illustrator, they usually have to export it to an image file and then transmit it by email or instant messaging. Rather than exporting still photographs from Figma, we can just send clients and colleagues a link to the Figma file, which they can examine in their web browsers. This alone can expedite a designer’s process and save a significant amount of time. More significantly, though, it allows clients and coworkers to engage with the work more deeply and examine the most recent version of the file. Create An Account on Figma. It’s easy to get started with Figma. Just visit www.figma.com, select “Get started,” fill out your information, and finish a short verification task. After you complete that, Figma will lead you to a screen containing a few additional onboarding questions before launching a project file that has some samples of what you can produce using the tool. Continue Learning and Practicing Figma Ultimately, continuing to study and practice is the key to becoming an expert in Figma. Figma is always changing, with new tools and features being released on a regular basis. Remain current with the most recent advancements and continue honing your design abilities. To sum up, if you’re just starting out with Figma, you’ll need to familiarize yourself with the interface, understand the fundamental tools, practice creating simple layouts, try out prototyping, connect with the Figma community, and never stop learning and improving. These steps will help you quickly become proficient with Figma. Explore the Figma User Interface The Figma interface has a simple appearance and feel, yet it conceals a number of useful capabilities. The major sections of the interface (identified above) are explained as follows. Launch a Fresh Design File Now that you’re familiar with the layout, let’s get started creating! To begin a new project, click the Menu button (the Figma logo) in the upper left corner, choose File, and then choose “New design file.” When you do this, your browser should automatically open a new tab and generate a new file with an empty canvas. Conclusion We hope this overview aids in helping you select the ideal Figma design system , as we have an endless supply of inventive kits and systems at our disposal. After all, each designer has distinct skills and is at a different stage of their journey! UI Figma Design System and online Figma courses are always ready for you if you want to advance your abilities a bit further. The sheer number of distinctive kits and design systems available attests to the greatness of Figma and its user base. What’s not to love about this passionate worldwide community that collaborates to produce tools that make design better for everyone?

        "content": "Cristiano Ronaldo added yet another record to his collection as he set a new high for goals scored in a Saudi Pro League season. The 39-year-old struck twice in Al-Nassr’s 4-2 victory over Al-Ittihad at Al Awal Park to take his total to 35, eclipsing Abderrazak Hamdallah’s 34 from 2018-19. Hamdallah, who was also playing for Al-Nassr at the time, could at least take some comfort from the fact that his haul came in just 27 league games, four fewer than the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star’s. Ronaldo, who had seen a 10th-minute effort ruled out for offside, equalled the record in first-half stoppage time when he controlled Mohammed Al-Fatil’s long ball and fired home to open the scoring in his club’s final fixture of the campaign. The Portugal international was through on goal once again 20 minutes after the restart but was brought down by Suwailem Al-Menhali, who was sent off. However, he had to wait just four minutes longer to claim his 35th of the season when he headed home from a corner before he was substituted. Abdulrahman Ghareeb’s penalty and Meshari Al-Nemer’s strike either side of goals from Farhah Al-Shamrani and Fabinho ultimately saw the hosts prevail 4-2 to finish second, 14 points behind champions Al-Hilal but 17 clear of Al-Ahli in third.",

Masterworking hit Diablo 4 at the start of , ushering in a crafting system for players exploring the endgame content. The mechanic enables users to enhance affixes attached to Legendary and Unique items up to 12 times. After leveling through all 12 ranks, an item should receive a 45 percent increase across its base affixes. While the feature proved a welcome addition, the Diablo community quickly uncovered a few flaws. For one, the . Blizzard rolled out a hotfix that reduced the cost, but the system still required some more fine-tuning. Diablo 4’s 1.4.1 to reduce cost of Masterworking As outlined in the patch notes, Diablo 4’s May 28 patch will address lingering Masterworking issues and much more. After the patch, players can expect Masterworking materials to be directly transmuted, for example. The Gold cost of Masterworking will also be decreased for Ranks 5 through 12. A host of bug fixes will additionally launch alongside the update, many of them tackling UI and User Experience troubles. Plus, strange -related hiccups like Zealots spawning underground and Aberrant Cinders not resetting should be resolved in 1.4.1 as well. Diablo 4 1.4.1 goes live across all platforms on Tuesday, May 28.",

        "content": "Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf’s government of Kano State has suspended Mustapha Indabawa, the Managing Director (MD) of Abubakar Rimi Television. The government has since appointed Hajiya Hauwa Ibrahim as the acting Managing Director of the television station. Naija News understands that the official letter of appointment for Ibrahim, dated 27 May 2024, was signed by Abdullahi Baffa Bichi, the secretary to the state government. The letter instructs Ibrahim to assume her new role immediately. Prior to this appointment, Ibrahim served as the deputy managing director of the television station. It is worth noting that the Kano State Government has filed seven charges, including criminal conspiracy, misappropriation, and diversion of funds, against the suspended MD and Staff Officer, Ibrahim M. Bello. These charges were brought forth following an investigation by the state anti-corruption commission, which was initiated after a petition was submitted to the state governor regarding the embattled MD. Reinstatement Of Emir Sanusi Done In Best Interest Of The State – Kano Govt Meanwhile, the Kano State Government, on Monday, said the reinstatement of Muhammadu Sanusi II as the Emir of Kano was done in the best interest of the state. Recall that Governor Abba Yusuf recently deposed the Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero and four emirs amd reinstated Muhammadu Sanusi 11 as the new Emir of a re-united single Kano Emirate. In a statement on Monday, the Commissioner of Information, Baba Halilu Dantiye, said the decision to reinstate Sanusi as the Emir of Kano State was made after careful consideration of the best interests of the state. Dantiye added that the reinstatement has been welcomed by a significant portion of the populace, who understand and cherish the long-term benefits of a unified emirate structure. He said: “It also behoves to reiterate that the decision by the administration of Abba Kabir Yusuf to legally abrogate the emirates and reinstate the 14th Emir of Kano State was made after careful consideration of the best interests of the state. The move has been welcomed by a significant portion of the populace who understands and cherishes the long-term benefits of a unified emirate structure.” Dantiye also urged the general public to disregard the sensational and grossly exaggerated media reports and support the efforts of the government to create a more cohesive and unified state. He also called on the media to exercise responsible journalism and verify facts before publishing any report that has the potential to cause unnecessary tension. “Kano State government under the leadership of Abba Kabir Yusuf remains committed to the progress and development of the state and call on all citizens to join hands in this regard,” he added.",

        "content": "PARIS — Bianca Andreescu was victorious in her return from an injury layoff of nearly 10 months with a 7-5, 6-1 win over Spain’s Sara Sorribes Tormo in first-round action Monday at the French Open. The 23-year-old from Mississauga, Ont., showed some rust in letting a 4-2 lead in the first set slip away before recovering. She elevated her game in a dominant second set and wrapped up the win in 94 minutes. Andreescu, who hadn’t played since sustaining a back injury at the National Bank Open in Montreal last August, will face No. 23 seed Anna Kalinskaya of Russia in the second round on Thursday. The former world No. 4 and 2019 U.S. Open champion is looking to advance past the third round at Roland-Garros for the first time in her career. Andreescu’s result was part of a successful day for Canadians at the clay-court Grand Slam with Felix Auger-Aliassime, Leylah Fernandez and Denis Shapovalov, all posting comfortable wins. Montreal’s Auger-Aliassime was a 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 winner over Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka, while Fernandez, from Laval, Que., downed Jessika Ponchet of France 6-2, 6-0. Auger-Aliassime fired seven aces and won 84 per cent of his first serves in a match marred by two rain delays. Fernandez, meanwhile, opened with her first of five breaks in a match that took just 69 minutes to complete. Neither Auger-Aliassime nor Fernandez faced break point. Auger-Aliassime, seeded 21st in Paris, will next face German qualifier Henn Squire. The 31st-seeded Fernandez will next play China’s Wang Xiyu. Later Monday, Shapovalov, of Richmond Hill, Ont., beat Luca Van Assche of France 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, completing a clean sweep for Canada, as not one Canadian player dropped a set in four matches. Shapovalov will next play 25th-seeded Frances Tiafoe of the United States. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "description": "Fewer than 40 North Pacific Right Whale still survive. On Friday, Bay Area scientists saw one of them.",
        "content": "In an extraordinary sighting, a critically endangered right whale was spotted off the Marin County coast on Friday, thrilling scientists. One of the rarest whales in the world, fewer than 40 animals are thought to survive. “It was astonishing,” said research ecologist Jan Roletto, who sighted the whale about three miles west of Point Reyes National Seashore while aboard a research vessel for the Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies. Friday’s weather was rough, with fierce winds that pushed 12 to 14-foot swells. The mission of the research team’s weeklong trip was to survey wildlife in a partnership between Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries and Point Blue Conservation Science. But the whale was unmistakable. “It came up right in front of us,” then lingered for nearly 20 minutes, said Roletto, research coordinator for the Greater Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries. Standing together on the ship’s viewing platform, Roletto and marine ecologist Kirsten Lindquist instantly turned to look at each other. “We both knew immediately what it was,” Roletto said. The identification has since been officially confirmed by the NOAA Marine Mammal Lab in Seattle, based on photos and video. The whale had a distinctive V-shaped blow. Wide and pitch black, it had no dorsal fin. And there was at least one cluster of telltale “callosities” on the head, rough and white skin patches. “It seemed to be resting,” Roletto said. “It wasn’t feeding. It wasn’t traveling. It would move a little bit, then sink down.” Like other whales, the species was driven nearly to extinction by commercial whaling. But unlike other whales — such as humpbacks, grey whales and blue whales — it has been much slower to recover. Populations of right whales are larger in the Atlantic Ocean, as well as in the Southern Hemisphere. North Pacific right whales were favored by hunters because they swim slowly near shore, and float after death. By the late 1800s, as many as 40,000 North Pacific right whales had been slaughtered. The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling banned the commercial hunting of right whales in the North Pacific in 1937, and their numbers began to climb. However, illegal Soviet whaling in the 1960s in the northern Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea again pushed the species toward extinction. They have been protected under the Endangered Species Act since 1970. While whaling is no longer a threat, human activity such as entanglement in fishing gear and marine debris, vessel strikes, impacts from climate change, oil and gas development and ocean noise continue to threaten the species. North Pacific right whales are baleen whales, which feed by straining huge volumes of ocean water through their comb-like baleen plates that trap copepods and other zooplankton. Because they are so rare, very little is known about the movements, migration, breeding or calving of the North Pacific species, said Jim Scarff, an independent whale researcher in Berkeley. Tagging is difficult and unsuccessful, he added. “There is remarkably little understanding about their distribution,” he said. Surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service have detected small numbers of North Pacific right whales in the Gulf of Alaska in a small area called the Barnabas Trough, according to the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission. Twelve were detected in the southeastern Bering Sea. In the past decade, there have been a handful of detections off the coast of British Columbia or Washington State. In March 2023, hale watchers sighted one close to shore near Pt. Pinos in Monterey Bay. In April 2022, a fisherman reported a sighting near San Mateo County’s Point Ano Nuevo. “It’s always one individual animal, often in the spring,” said Scarff. “And then it’s never seen again.”",

The 33-year-old Atalanta midfielder suffered an undisclosed muscle injury two weeks ago in the final, which his club lost 1-0 to Juventus, and will not be fit in time for the tournament in Germany. It meant he missed last Wednesday's Europa League final in Dublin, which Atalanta won 3-0 over German champions Bayer Leverkusen. \"I can't imagine I've had a week in my career, or in my life, that has had so many ups and downs. Lost the Coppa Italia, couldn't play the final, win the Europa League,\" De Roon posted on social media on Monday. \"In that last euphoric state, I spent a lot of time with the medical staff: it turns out I can't play the Euros. \"I will get over it, I will watch the squad and my friends as a fan, but for now it's a very tough day.\" De Roon has won 42 caps for the Netherlands, competing in the last Euros and the World Cup in Qatar. Dutch coach Ronald Koeman will announce the final Euro 2024 selection on Wednesday. After De Roon's withdrawal, the pre-selection consists of 29 players, with three set to be axed from the final squad. The squad assembled on Monday for their first session with Quinten Timber training apart from the rest as the Feyenoord midfielder is still nursing an injury. In the run-up to the tournament in Germany, the Dutch will play warm-up matches against Canada and Iceland next week. (Writing by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Christian Radnedge)",

        "content": "OTTAWA — Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

The bedroom burned to a crisp leaving what had been the king-size bed a twisted shamble. \"Here try a cherry,\" Metula mayor David Azulay says as he reaches up to pick the ripe fruit off the tree. \"You in the center of the country have no idea how wonderful it tastes.\" He came to inspect the damage right after the rocket strike and called the owners to brief them on the situation. \"This is a sad part of my job, calling my residents who were evacuated, to tell them about the damage to their property,\" he says. \"The owner told me she had kept a key on the windowsill but there is no longer a window there.\" 4 Holiday let destroyed in Hezbollah attack Photo: Efi Sharir He says sometimes they are just thankful that no one was hurt and sometimes they cry. It's hard to hear them cry after everything they owned was destroyed. Azulay had had to make many such calls since the war began in October. More than 150 anti-tank missiles were fired from Lebanon at the small border town, not to mention the rockets and mortar shells. Approximately 35% of the homes there have been damaged to some extent or other. Many are damaged beyond repair. We drove through the streets and stopped near a large home with a tractor parked outside. The house had been hit by a missile, but the tractor was spared. \"This neighborhood is targeted most often,\" he says pointing at the houses up the hill. \"That one over there took four kornet missiles in less than two minutes and the four in the row below were also hit by missiles as was the hotel on the main road. 4 Metula mayor David Azulay Photo: Efi Sharir Tevia Neistein, a member of the local security team was in his kitchen when a missile exploded in his bedroom. \"That's that,\" he said when we met in the command center, \"The house is gone. Only a pile of dust and stones is left.\" He is a tour guide but now he is on reserves and the tourists are gone. It's not just the destruction. It’s the desolation. The once manicured gardens are covered in dry weeds and some roads are blocked off with barbed wire, put there to slow Hezbollah's elite Radwan force, who are not very far away, if the infiltrate. As Efi, the photographer steps out of the car to take some pictures, Azulay urges him to be quick. \"We are exposed to fire from the El Khiam village across the border, he warns. \"You see those houses there? Anyone in them can see you.\" It is scary but more than that it is sad. Metula was founded 128 years ago at the very tip of the Upper Galilee region. Flanked by Lebanon's villages on three sides. It is a symbol of Zionism, now deserted. Most of its 2,000 residents had been evacuated when the war began and only the security team, a handful of farmers and the mayor remain. \"I am a mayor of no one,\" Azulay says. I've had enough. I want my residents to bug me about garbage collection or street lighting, like any other mayor.\" 4 Metula Photo: Efi Sharir His home is in the area often under attack so he sleeps at the command center. He is a veteran of 25 years of service in the IDF, divorced and a father of four who was raised in Kiryat Shmona, the city down the road, which is also under constant attack. One of his sons is a commander in the reserves and is now fighting in Gaza. \"He was stationed here in the north before they were deployed to Jabaliya and every time I called to check on him he would tell me I was embarrassing him with my worries.\" Azulay's youngest is also in the service and is now in the IDF's officer's school. He was at home when the war broke out recovering from an injury. In the fighting that day, 30 soldiers in his platoon were killed. The two girls are both at university. Azulay says 10% of Metula residents have already decided not to return and he will not even try to convince them otherwise. \"What can I promise them? Nothing,\" he says. \"In the past couple of weeks, the fire has increased considerably, and now the mortars are causing brushfires. We take it and take it, but the government does nothing. Our leaders are all talk but I want to see action. I want 50 homes destroyed on the other side for each one here. How come the airport in Beirut is operating as usual while we can't even access our own homes?\" 4 Home in Metula hit by a missile but the tractor survived Photo: Efi Sharir So will your children have to fight against Lebanon as well? I ask, \"this is our reality,\" he says. \"We have no other country and I have no other home.\" >",

        "content": "If you have been following news out of the USA, you know the midwest is already in the middle of a tough tornado season . Hurricane season, meanwhile, looks like it will be more intense than last year. Then there are earthquakes , which can happen at any time on the west coast (and hit the east coast just last month ). With so many disasters coming at us, preparing for anything and everything is vital. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security strongly recommends people prepare a disaster supply kit in one or two easy-to-carry containers so they can survive on their own for several days should something happen. In addition to storing maps, sanitiser, medications, and pet food for four-legged friends, you’ll need these recommended essentials should disaster strike. An emergency may leave you without clean water for a few days. It is recommended that you keep one gallon of water for each person in your household for several days. To ensure you have enough clean water, pick up this collection of six emergency water storage tanks. Each holds five gallons and comes with two spigots and a water purification kit. Even in a disaster, you have to eat, so why not eat well? This entree kit contains 10 different freeze-dried entrees that last a quarter of a century, including chili mac and mashed potatoes. Altogether, 120 servings of food are inside this rugged flood-safe container that you can store practically anywhere. They say nobody listens to the radio anymore, but it’s your lifeline for staying updated on weather-related catastrophes. This emergency AM/FM/NOAA weather radio is a versatile tool that can be powered by a hand crank, solar power, or USB cable. It also includes a flashlight and an SOS Alarm, giving you multiple modes to stay informed and safe. Most importantly, it can charge your phone, ensuring you stay connected when it matters most. Cuts, bruises, burns, and fevers: this 160-piece first aid kit takes care of everything. It includes all the essentials: cleansing wipes, assorted bandages, rolled gauze, antibiotic cream, itch-stopping cream, acetaminophen caplets, an instant cold pack, and even gloves to reduce the risk of infection. Yes, even nowadays, when everything is rechargeable, you’ll need some AAs, AAAs, and even some 9V batteries to ensure everything is up and running in your home during an emergency. Instead of keeping them in that drawer in your kitchen (you know which one), organize them in the Battery Daddy . My family has had one for years, and it’s always come in handy for testing the batteries we already have and keeping new ones together when we need them most (like Christmas morning). This emergency whistle can be heard from a mile away if you want to get someone’s attention or signal for help. It is also plastic, so there’s no danger of it sticking to your lips when the weather gets cold. In an emergency, the air may be contaminated, so wearing a mask approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to filter out anything harmful will protect your respiratory system and keep you safe. This 10-pack of disposable masks will do the job comfortably and at the right price. If your home is damaged, you will need to put something together quickly to protect it and your family from the elements. Plastic sheeting and duct tape can help you in a pinch, and this dense, heavy-duty product is easy to apply and will cover any area and protect it from the cold, rain, or high winds. If using the toilet isn’t an option, this toilet in a bag will capture your numbers one and two and turn it into something you can dispose of safely without worrying about the smell or attracting disease-spreading insects. Remember to pick up cleaning wipes, which you can purchase as compressed towelettes . After a disaster like an earthquake or fire, you may need to turn off your gas or water lines quickly. However, if the power is out or part of your home is flooded, you might be unable to reach your wrench set. This lightweight, aluminum four-in-one tool can do the job without charging your power tools. In addition to shutting off your utilities, it can also pry open doors so you can get to family members in other parts of your home. Your fancy electric can opener may not work if you need to open a can of food. Be sure to add this sturdy rust-resistant device to your kit to open that tin of peaches or pop open that bottle of beer you’ll need when that storm finally blows over. It’s hard to stay in touch with family and friends if your smartphone battery is dead. With this durable, waterproof, shockproof, and dust-proof solar charger , you can keep all your devices up and running. It also has a bright LED flashlight, so you don’t have to fumble in the dark for your charging cord.

The trophy of life for him,\" one fan lauded in the comments. \"His mom calling that dinner is ready, time to go back home after play for whole day outside,\" joked another to the tune of nearly 3,000 likes. Although it is hard to confirm that it was for sure Leclerc in the video, the unique Ferrari clothes and jewelry seemed to match. One supposed also left a comment on the video on Instagram confirming the story. \"He rode right past me at the exit for the K grandstands as I walked to the train. Baffling. Nobody bothered him.

        "content": "SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. — On the last Monday in May each year, people around America take the day to honor and mourn the many men and women who died while serving and protecting their country and the freedoms of the people who live there. In Saratoga Springs, members of the community gathered in Congress Park at the War Memorial where Gurtler Brothers VFW Post 420 hosted a commemoration ceremony in honor of the holiday. According to Gene Ratigliano, Post Quartermaster and Past Post and State Commander, this ceremony has been something that has been put on for many years and used to coincide with the Saratoga Springs Memorial Day Parade, which the city has not had for the last couple of years. He believes ceremonies like this one are important, not just because of the significant meaning behind them but because it stands as a reminder of how important it is to remember what these fallen soldiers did for their country. “We need to remember our past, we need to remember our history – if we don’t remember what we’ve done in the past, we’re bound to fail again in the future,” Ratigliano said. “It’s only common sense, and I think it means a lot – it means that people really understand and appreciate what they (the soldiers) did for them.” “The culture we have today is a little bit different than in the past. There are many things going on today that I think previous generations probably would not have put up with. This remembrance brings us back to reality.” The ceremony included a reading of Logan’s Order, which called for a National Day of Remembrance for those who died in the Civil War and was the basis for Memorial Day, as well as a singing of the National Anthem, a rifle salute, taps and a speech from Saratoga Springs Mayor John Safford. Safford shared that participating in these kinds of ceremonies gives him an opportunity as mayor to put emphasis on service and what that means to him as well as other veterans in the community who watched friends die while in the armed forces. During his speech, Safford recognized some of the individuals he knew who died in combat and talked about the respect and honor owed to those who died in uniform. “If there is any of us here that knows what it feels like to lose your friends at 20 years old, to know they died for you in your place, then you know something about what we are doing today,” Safford said in his speech. Safford also pointed out the commemorative bricks along the Veteran’s Walk of Honor, which includes more than 2,000 bricks engraved with the names of local war veterans to memorialize them in front of the War Memorial in Congress Park. Safford explained that many of these individuals were 20 or 21 years old when they died – and their service must be remembered. “They (the soldiers) died for me and for you, the city and this country,” Safford said. “We never should forget that. Never ever. I can tell you that I will never forget that.” Ratigliano shared that he and Safford have been talking and are starting plans to bring the Memorial Day Parade back next year so more people can celebrate the service and the sacrifices of those who gave their lives to ensure the freedoms of Saratogians and Americans in general. In Ratigliano’s eyes, bringing this parade back allows more people to understand and realize what this day really means and what it is honoring.

        "content": "K-pop’s first appearance on the US Billboard Hot 100 Chart was in 2009, when the Wonder Girls’ “Nobody” hit No. 76. Fifty years earlier, in 1959 The Kim Sisters (Sue, Aija, and Mia) from Korea made their American TV premiere on The Ed Sullivan show. So, is 1959 the year that K-Pop made its debut in the US? Probably not, but we should celebrate the importance of The Kim Sisters in representing Korea to the US. They would eventually appear on The Ed Sullivan Show twenty-one times, more than any other act. They performed covers of popular American songs, such as “Charlie Brown” (originally by The Coasters), “Try to Remember” (original song from the musical “The Fantasticks”) and “When the Saints Go Marching In” (traditional Christian hymn covered by Louis Armstrong, Fats Domino, Elvis, Judy Garland and many others). They sang songs familiar to mainstream American audiences. On one occasion, they performed “Michael, Row the Boat Ashore” and they were joined by their mother who added the occasional “Arirang” lyric, a nod to the traditional Korean song. These young women were remarkable not only because they could sing and dance as well as any of the girl groups popular in the US at the time, but they were also multi-instrumentalists. YouTube clips feature the members playing drums, saxophones, guitars, etc., in their performances. Sue (Kim Sook-ja) and Aija (Kim Ai-ja) were biological sisters. Mia (Kim Min-ja) was Sue and Aija’s cousin who was later adopted by Sue and Aija’s mother, singer Lee Nan-yang. Lee was famous for her 1935 song “Tears of Mokpo.” After the kidnapping and murder of her husband, conductor Kim Hae-song, she had to support herself and her children by entertaining American GIs. She later taught her children how to sing American songs and play musical instruments. Eventually, The Kim Sisters were formed and sent to Las Vegas with their manager, Bob McMackin. Their initial 4 week stint in 1959 at The Thunderbird in Las Vegas led to an additional 35 years in residency in Las Vegas venues including The Stardust, Las Vegas Hilton and the Holiday Casino. I think they deserve a place alongside other Asian American entertainers, perhaps more so than next to K-pop acts. What cemented this position for me was when I discovered their medley of songs from the film adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s musical “Flower Drum Song” (1961). This film is based on a Broadway musical inspired by Chin Yang Lee’s novel of the same title. The story is about Chinese American families in San Francisco, whose parents and children straddle stereotypically traditional Chinese versus American values. It includes Chinese characters who are born in the US and others that are recent arrivals to America. It became the first Hollywood film to feature a majority Asian American cast (and there would not be another one for another 30 years, until “The Joy Luck Club” in 1993). The film was nominated for numerous Academy Awards. The lead actors for the film included Nancy Kwan (biracial Chinese/white American), James Shigeta (Japanese American), Miyoshi Umeki (Japanese American), Jack Soo (Japanese American), Benson Fong (Chinese American), and Juanita Hall (biracial black/white American). Miyoshi Umeki is also the first Asian American actress to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress (for “Sayonara.”) These were many of the most well-known Asian American (and Black) actors of the time, but most were not Chinese or Chinese American. Among Asian American fans and scholars, views of “Flower Drum Song” have swung from positive to negative and back again. However, there is no debate about its iconic status for Asian Americans in the history of Hollywood films. As a Chinese American who grew up in San Francisco, I remember seeing this film as a child. I’ve seen it many times since. While songs like “Chop Suey” are a little “cringey,” seeing Asian American actors tell a story about the diversity of Chinese Americans in San Francisco left a deep impression on me. I’ve appreciated the importance of this film, even before I became an academic. The stereotypes of “traditional Chinese” versus “modern American” values is arguably a retrograde representation of the immigrant experience, but the film avoids using white actors in yellowface. There are no white actors with their eyes taped so they might appear “oriental” as was standard practice in Hollywood. Some might complain that not all of the actors were Chinese or Chinese American, but given the period during which this film was produced, the cast is a great leap forward. Despite being born in Korea, The Kim Sisters’ professional careers were built on their performances of American songs arranged to appeal to Americans, from GIs in Korea, to American TV and Las Vegas audiences. Their first job was performing as a part of the “China Doll Revue,” which included Chinese and Japanese American entertainers. They lived most of their lives in the US as Americans. Like the other Asian American actors in “Flower Drum Song,” they were constrained by how white Americans viewed Asian Americans. They could convincingly sing about a Chinese American family not only because they were seen as Korean, but also as Asian American.

        "content": "Article content Opposition New Democrats say the Alberta government is being anti-democratic by invoking time allocation measures that limit debate around some of its most controversial bills ahead of the end of the legislative session later this week. Last week, government house leader Joseph Schow introduced motions to limit debate on four separate bills, including Bill 20, which the government introduced amendments to last week following widespread backlash . The motions limit the time allotted for debate to one hour for each stage of each bill. “Be it resolved that when further consideration of Bill 20, Municipal Affairs Statutes Amendment Act, 2024, is resumed, not more than one hour shall be allotted to any further consideration of the bill in second reading, at which time every question necessary for the disposal of the bill at this stage shall be put forthwith,” states one such motion that was tabled last Tuesday. Schow defended the use of time allocation, saying it is needed to get through the government’s agenda. “There’s a difference between productive debate and just extended debate. I think we’ve reached a point where we may be past productive debate,” he said, accusing the Opposition NDP of being “obstructionist.” “I think robust discussion is ongoing in that chamber. But I also recognize and believe that ... if the Opposition is not interested in bringing forth new ideas, then we’re going to move forward in time allocation so that we can get through the legislative agenda.” He added the government also had invoked a motion to hold evening sittings from Monday through Wednesday, starting Monday night, in an effort to get through the bills. “We have a mandate from Albertans that was given to us in the last election,” he said, adding “we have a job to do.” “We’re going to use the tools at our disposal to get out at a reasonable time.” Opposition house leader Christina Gray said the government is on pace to use time allocation 50 times compared to her party who used it on four occasions when it was in power. “It’s incredibly frustrating and shameful that the government continues to eliminate time for debate on legislation that Albertans deeply care about,” she said. “It’s really a continuation of the pattern we’ve seen from this government and it’s doing a huge disservice to Albertans as well as being not what this government ran on.” She denied her party was being obstructionist and accused the government of ramming through its agenda. “This government feels entitled to pass any legislation that they feel they can without consulting with Albertans.” As of the start of Monday’s afternoon sitting, the bills impacted are: The current spring sitting of the legislature is scheduled to end late Thursday afternoon, although it may also wrap up ahead of then. — with files from Cindy Tran mblack@postmedia.com",

Memorial Day exists to remember and honor those military members who died in service of our country. Yet, Joe Biden ALWAYS mentions his dead son, Beau. Beau did NOT die in service his country. He died of cancer. Also, Biden claims — without proof — that Beau's brain cancer... pic.twitter.com/O6el3k2POq On Memorial Day, Biden chose to highlight the loss of his son, Beau. Biden is unable to accept Beau died of cancer and not in war, and insists it was as a result of his service and 'burn pits'. There is no evidence that is true. Unsurprisingly, Joe Biden made #MemorialDay about him and his family via the injection of his son Beau's death from brain cancer resulting from burn pits. 👉Six years after his service I'm not saying that many haven't died from cancers linked to burn pits, but Beau was there... pic.twitter.com/QgeYvYYSLf Injecting a bit of reality into the situation. Joe Biden just had to talk about Beau while giving a speech at Arlington. NO, Senile Moron Joe Biden, your son Beau was NOT killed in combat in Iraq! He died of cancer in his bed! By continously spouting that execrable canard you are committing Stolen Valor! It is an insult to all of us who ever wore the uniform of the United States Military! Now, STOP... As horrific as losing any child must be, Biden needs to recognize he had the chance to say goodbye to his child, surrounded by family with the gift of palliative care. Most families of lost soldiers do not have that kind of ending. Biden is a self-centered pr@ck that can never leave his name his story out of any national event Sick of hearing about his son, dying of cancer and comparing it to the brave heroes gave their lives to save their country https://t.co/Yq50kx1qNq I’m sorry for his loss but this was not the time or place. Why does everything have to be about him? https://t.co/IqZMHNjDbd Of course, people feel empathy for his loss, but why must he center his loss at every occasion about loss? He has issues with not being relatable and narcissism. He can’t not talk about himself when he should be talking about the needs of regular folks The crazy thing is apparently his team has told him people don't like the constant references and he should stop always bringing up his son, but he does not care and continues to do it. Always has to be about him. I HAVE NO WORDS 😡, he also went political during his \"speech\" . Typical Biden fashion. Those 2 things didn't belong in today's speech. Why is it he NEVER says God Bless America 🇺🇸? Oh No - Not Again! President Biden uses the Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery as another reason to bring up the death of his son, Beau Biden. There appears to be no solemn event that he will not attach to the tragic death of his son. Was it appropriate of Joe... pic.twitter.com/V8TuSVelDI He's a daily national embarrassment. November cannot come soon enough.",

        "description": "Kendall Waston, defensa del Deportivo Saprissa, manifestó que el título le sabe “riquísimo” y calificó el torneo como el más difícil que ha vivido.",
        "content": "Kendall Waston se sinceró, se desahogó, tras lograr el campeonato con el Deportivo Saprissa. Terminó el partido contra Alajuelense y se fue a saludar a su esposa y a su hijo, únicos testigos del sufrimiento de Kendall durante varios meses, pues padeció una pubalgia en diciembre del año pasado y estuvo cinco meses sin actuar, pero antes de reaparecer en los terrenos de juego, el defensa vivió un martirio: llegó a deprimirse y llorar de impotencia. “Lloré muchísimas veces, lloré a escondidas de mi esposa para que no me viera con dolor, porque uno, como cabeza de hogar, quiere estar fuerte. Tuve que abrirme a ella, serle sincero y decirle por lo que pasaba”, dijo Kendall. Waston nunca había estado tanto tiempo sin jugar, por eso calificó el Clausura 2024 como el torneo más difícil por la lesión y todo lo que vivió. “Sufrí bastante, pero también así es como se disfruta más. Me pasó por la mente si no volvería a jugar, si me tendría que retirar. Hubo momentos donde no me podía levantar de la cama, fue muy complicado, casi que me arrastraba para poder moverme y gracias a Dios con la ayuda de él salí adelante”, recordó Kendall. Waston manifestó que su esposa fue su gran soporte; ella le hizo ver que debía luchar, que no podía terminar ahí sin volver a una cancha de fútbol. Al zaguero lo atormentaba enfrentar una lesión que no sabía cuánto tiempo lo iba a dejar fuera. ''10 años atrás pude ser partícipe de lograr la 30, siempre ganar títulos es lindísimo'', Kendall Waston Pero esperó, fue paciente y el cinco de este mes volvió a sentirse futbolista. Ese día, Saprissa visitó a Puntarenas, Kendall ingresó en los últimos minutos, lo hizo como delantero y anotó. “Creo que el más sorprendido por esa anotación fui yo, pero bendito Dios que me dio el privilegio de jugar y anotar. Yo siempre oraba y le decía, si usted me tiene aquí por algo es y solo quiero cumplir su voluntad”, destacó Kendall Waston. Cuando a Kendall se le consultó cuánto le sabía el título 40, lo pensó poco, mostró su gran sonrisa y soltó la respuesta. “Me sabe riquísimo, riquisísimo”, dijo Kendall, al tiempo que soltó una carcajada. (Mayela López) Waston estaba seguro de que le iban a dar vuelta a la serie contra Alajuelense y ganar la final. Señaló que en el grupo había mucha convicción y se inyectaron de motivación por el recibimiento de la afición al llegar al estadio morado. “Yo sabía que cuando cayera el primer gol, iban a llegar los demás. Ver el estadio vibrar no es fácil de llevar y le sacamos ventaja a la localía”, dijo Waston. Un tema que no se podía dejar de lado es la Selección y Kendall reiteró que quiere estar en el grupo que dirige Gustavo Alfaro. “Yo lo dije en su momento, no le voy a cerrar nunca las puertas a la Selección, mientras esté jugando, soy un soldado más. Si me llaman, voy; si no, voy a darlo todo para estar disponible”, comentó Kendall Waston.",

The ACP’s name featured on some of the documents related to granting permissions for the hoarding following which he has been called to record his statement. An officer said that as part of their probe, they have found that the land on which the hoarding was erected did not belong to railways and ideally should have had permission from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Advertisement The police will also be writing to the BMC seeking to find out how an illegal hoarding could come up in their jurisdiction without them taking any action. As many as 17 people were killed when a hoarding collapsed on a petrol pump in Ghatkopar on May 13. The SIT has arrested owner of the hoarding Bhavesh Bhinde, who is in their custody till Wednesday.",

In a country obsessed with fair skin (slang — gori chamdi) and ‘foreign figures’ (slang — videshi maal) an (un)healthy trend has crept into the power corridors of the rich and famous. Many private yacht soirees, high-end clubs, car show events, realty project launches, foo-foo fine dining restaurants, and the whole wedding shebang are hiring foreigners from the UK, France, Uzbekistan, Russia, and Central Asia as ‘white eye candy’ ushers, entertainers, human tables, bartenders, and dancers. The unhealthy gaze of some uncouth wealthy desi men can be repulsive but the money is good and hard cash. Many event managers opine that white-skinned men and women raise the ‘oomph factor’. While the quick dough generated through wine and cheese tasting ‘human table’ or gyrating on desi songs is prevalent, the underlying reality highlights the need to sustain oneself in a low-paying industry.",

        "content": "What advice does an Olympian have for those starting out running? David Gillick raced for Ireland in the 2008 Olympics and currently holds the indoor and outdoor Irish 400m records. Speaking on The Hard Shoulder , Mr Gillick said it was important to remember to stretch as “you’re asking an awful lot from your body”. “If you could add in simple things like squats, lunges, press ups,” he said. “Things like that that can just kind [of] help the body adapt to what you’re asking them to do. “It’s going to take a pounding along the pavement, so you need to have a robust body that can take that extra work and that extra load.” Mr Gillick said forming good habits early on will pay off if you are serious about running. “If you are at the early stages, building in some basic exercises can really help you in the long-term,” he said. “Whether you’re elite or whether you’re a more seasoned runner, essence is key and even in the elite athletes are doing that probably as many times as they’re running... So, if you’re starting out, do try and build in some form of strength and conditioning or even resistance work.” As with many things, it pays to ramp things up slowly and Mr Gillick suggested increasing the mileage you run each time in a gradual manner. “People will look towards the end of the year and think, ‘Oh, it’s October’ for say the Dublin Marathon,” he said. “Start now and build it up; so again, you could be going for your 90 minute runs and then build it to 1.40 hours, 1.45 hours. “Don’t make any massive jumps because that will inflict a lot of issues in terms of physical impact.” You can listen back here: Main image: Ireland's David Gillick performs on men's 400 meters final during the European athletics indoor championships in Birmingham, UK on March 3, 2007.

Catching up with judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden , Alesha Dixon, and Bruno Tonioli , Simon momentarily halted the chat, eager to express his congratulations to new father Ant. Only days ago, Ant and wife Anne-Marie welcomed baby Wilder into the world, with Ant thanking fans for their support via social media over their joyous family addition. Announcing his newborn, he penned: \"Welcome to the family. Wilder Patrick Mcpartlin. Born, 14/05/24 at 8.54am. Baby is beautiful, Mummy's a legend, Sisters are over the moon. Dad's a mess!\" He followed up with another post explaining why Hurley, his beloved pet, was not visible on the family tree tattoo, hidden by their newest member.

        "content": "OpenseedVC, a new operator-led fund, has officially launched its $10m angel-style early-stage fund. According to a statement on Monday, the fund aims to be the first investor in seasoned operators starting their technology companies across Africa and Europe. Backed by a robust network of over 50 seasoned experts, including founders, operators, and high-net-worth individuals from Africa, Europe, and the US, OpenseedVC will offer up to $150,000 starter checks to support operators from zero to one. The investor said the fund would focus on investing in the Future of Commerce (B2B Software, AI, and FinTech) and the Future of Health & work, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Led by Partner, Maria Rotilu, OpenseedVC aims to invest in at least 60 startups over the next five years, primarily in Africa and Europe. The fund operates an open application process, allowing founders to apply without an introduction, OpenseedVC noted. According to the firm, Rotilu, an experienced operator turned investor, brings extensive market expertise from scaling multinational technology startups like Uber and Branch to millions of users. It stated that she had also invested in global companies as a Principal & Fund Manager of the Octopus Ventures First Cheque Fund and served as managing director at the Oxford Seed Fund of Oxford University, one of the leading producers of unicorns in Europe. OpenseedVC stated that it had already made its first two investments in the Future of Commerce and Health themes, including an AI-enabled supplier dispute resolution software in the UK and a foundational speech-to-text transcription model for underserved accents, starting with Africa. Speaking on the launch of OpenseedVC Fund, Rotilu said, “As an operator, and investor, I have encountered incredibly talented and experienced operators, and the challenges faced as they try to launch their startups.” According to him, operators have the advantage of domain expertise and unique insight into large problems that can be tackled with innovative technology. “Those who are visionaries coupled with the ability to execute, scale, build teams and have the grit required to solve difficult problems—these skills, especially in the current market, are highly relevant to building technology start-ups that solve real problems and create scalable value for the global economy and our investors. “The experience seasoned operators bring in terms of business building, combined with the dynamism and hustle that founders possess is the focus for OpenseedVC,” Rotilu expounded.",

        "content": "LESS than a week on since Rishi Sunak’s unimpressive announcement in Downing Street about the election on July 4, where are we? Well, for most people life has gone on entirely as normal. That, for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives, is a problem. As it happens, life was continuing for me in a very normal way. My wife’s niece, Juliet, was getting married in the North East of England and I was under strict instructions that the weekend was not to be filled with “politics”. Instead, a celebration of people coming together, building a life together and putting politics into perspective. For those of us who have been steeped in politics for years — in my case, 60 years this year as a member of the Labour Party — we often forget that people “have a life” which does not involve listening to politicians or getting deeply engaged with political arguments. If Labour is to win an overall majority, and this is by no means certain, reaching those people who are not “switched on” and, therefore, connected and engaged with the political debate will be critical. ­Surely the lesson, so far, is don’t attack your political opponent on issues and in a manner which is frankly unbelievable. This was the lesson of the 1997 election, when the Conservatives portrayed Tony Blair , with “demon eyes”, as some sort of threat. The visual images were such that people ridiculed what they knew to be entirely untrue. In this election it is the notion that the nation’s security is somehow at risk from a Starmer government. Given that Sir Keir has been absolutely, 100 per cent behind Government policy in terms of committing to and supporting Ukraine , and that all the crazy notions of Jeremy Corbyn five years ago are now for the birds, this line of attack is doomed from the start. Not least because the Prime Minister’s commitment to raising defence spending is not for the next Parliament , but for the one after — in 2030! In what is undoubtedly going to be a brutal few weeks, unlikely to do great credit to sensible and balanced dialogue or to trust and engagement with politics, there are issues which will be, in my terms, “toxic”. Immigration is clearly one such issue. As a home secretary, over 20 years ago, who reached an agreement with the French which cut those coming across from Calais by two-thirds, I’m painfully aware of the practical and political challenges that exist. However, Rishi Sunak’s decision to call a General Election unexpectedly in the summer has denied the Conservatives the right to claim that their so-called “Rwanda policy” is working. On the other hand, it has avoided the total embarrass- ment of calmer seas resulting in literally tens of thousands of people crossing the Channel despite the threat of being transported to East Africa . I wouldn’t say that there is “method in Rishi Sunak’s madness” because failure to give your own policy a chance to work isn’t a great offer to the electorate. But the more profound issue is the countless numbers of people who have been labelled by recent legislation as “illegal” and are completely stuck in the system. These are people who came across the Channel without documentation and can’t claim asylum . They are not being processed, not going anywhere and costing us a fortune. Here’s a thought. Why would anyone, after the last turbulent and, some would say (including me), disastrous 14 years, vote Conservative? I will, during the General Election, come back to this theme, but suffice it to say that, despite my tribal ideology and commitment to the Labour Party, I am not yet convinced that Labour will win by an avalanche. Pollsters and pundits all think it is a foregone conclusion. I’m not so sure. Labour enter this election with only 205 MPs thanks to the antics of Jeremy Corbyn and the far Left. There needs to be the most enormous swing of more than 12 per cent to get an overall majority, and this involves overturning Conservative seats where, in 2019, they won by 15,000 to 16,000 votes! It is a mountain to climb. So, although I wish, profoundly, that I am wrong, I predict, at this stage of the General Election, that a good result for Labour would be an overall majority of 20. I don’t believe the Conservatives can win, but I think it is by no means certain that Labour are yet home and dry. Complacency is always the killer.",

        "content": "IF you want to make a room pop, you'll want to listen to an interior pro's top paint picks. Whatever you do while decorating, make sure to put beige back where it came from. Instead, don't be afraid to try something new when reinvigorating a room. \"Color is back and we love it,\" Laura Fox, founder of Laura Fox Interiors Design , posted to her website. \"Here are some fun ways to spruce up your home while you are stuck inside,\" she said. When transforming a space, her biggest tip is to \"think outside the box.\" To accomplish this, Fox suggests focusing on one particular - and usually overlooked - area. \"Paint your cabinets, not the walls,\" she said. Fox also wants you to face your decorating fears. \"Don't be afraid to go dark,\" she said. \"Espresso, red, and charcoal have a dramatic effect on the finished look of the room,\" she added. Another way to show off your style is with some stripes. And that wasn't the only pro tip she shared. \"Go further than the walls and change up the mood of a room by adding an accent-colored furniture piece,\" she said. Affordable furniture retailer Wayfair sells a Cache metal end table with storage which is on sale for $76.06. The functional find also comes in a range of colors. Choose from yellow, orange, mint, magenta, bright blue and more shades. This will surely add some shine to your space. Lastly, she recommends how to best make things \"pop.\" All it takes is painting an accent wall. For a \"calming\" feel, you can opt for cool colors such as blue and green tones. \"Adding these colors to your walls will help create a relaxing environment,\" she said.

In an announcement last night, the Albanese government said emergency relief supplies, such as shelter, hygiene kits and specific support for women and children would be provided. Australia would also send technical experts to offer incident management assistance, support geohazard assessments and to help with early recovery efforts. Yesterday, Papua New Guinea’s national disaster centre asked the United Nations for international assistance , reportedly saying the landslide in the country’s remote north could have buried more than 2,000 people. The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles , said Australians will be thinking of PNG at this very difficult time. He said: As a close neighbour and friend, we will be doing all we can to provide support. Australia’s defence force is working closely with the PNG Defence Force to assist with the response. This work is yet another demonstration of the close partnership between our nations and militaries.

We have more details coming up, plus a feature and podcast by Full Story presenter Nour Haydar on a new women’s shelter in Parramatta in western Sydney. As the federal parliament returns for two weeks, our environment editor Adam Morton bemoans the lack of clear policies to tackle the climate crisis and issues an impassioned plea for a change. On the one hand the government appears confused and wedged by the gas industry – especially in Western Australia where Labor is in power and can’t turn against such a powerful lobby. And on the other hand, Coalition hasn’t even got a policy. Australia will send technical experts and $2.5m in initial aid to Papua New Guinea as the death toll continues to rise after a catastrophic landslide that destroyed a village . PNG’s disaster centre said more than 2,000 people had been buried alive by Friday’s landslide in remote Enga province. Under the Australian aid package experts will provide incident management assistance, support geo-hazard assessments and help early recovery efforts, with the Australian defence force also assisting.

        "description": "Leeds United’s nightmare relationship with the play-offs continued when they were beaten by Southampton in the Championship play-off final on Sunday at Wembley. Thousands upon...The post Troy Deeney blasts actions of ‘four or five’ Leeds players on Wembley pitch after play-off final appeared first on HITC.",
        "content": "Thousands upon thousands of Leeds fans descended to the capital hoping for history to be wiped out and not repeat itself. But it wasn’t meant to be for Daniel Farke and his players because, for the fourth time in their history, were beaten in a play-off final at Wembley or The Millennium Stadium. For a lot of fans, it was hard to take, not just because they were beaten in another or they were going to spend another season in England’s second tier. But because the majority of their players, , didn’t turn up and that’s what will hurt more. When the final whistle blew, you could understand the elation and joy in the eyes of the Southampton players because they celebrated like every team would do in their situation, But many of the Leeds players had their heads down and looked utterly distraught because a 49-game season has now ended with virtually nothing. Troy Deeney was pitchside at Wembley and he simply didn’t like what he saw from some of the Leeds players after the full-time whistle. The former striker, who has won promotion to the Premier League with Watford, slammed ‘four or five players’ for ‘laughing and joking’ when the game had finished, as he told (26/05/24 at 5:50 pm). Deeney wasn’t shy to point out his own troubles at the home of football and losing 6-0 to Manchester City in an FA Cup final, so he is someone who can speak from experience. Leeds United players at Wembley “When I look at Leeds, the last month flattered to deceive where you want your big players, your leaders to step up and they went missing,” said Deeney. “I am not going to name names, but you are standing and you can see how people react after. I have lost here (at Wembley) 6-0 to Manchester City. That was a drubbing. You have got to stand there, in a line, clap your opponents, well done and the better team won. Show a bit of humility and respect. “Four or five of them over the other side laughing and joking.” Recovering from another play-off final defeat Under Marcelo Bielsa, Leeds also lost a play-off – semi-final against Derby County – before going on to win the title the following season. When Farke won promotion with Norwich, he did so in his second season. Many would point towards that as a good omen for the club, but you feel these are different circumstances. In comparison to those teams, there is probably going to be more of a clearout this summer, with big players leaving and it will make Farke’s life more difficult. That’s why it’s paramount the club keep him at the club because it wouldn’t be a surprise if, , more than a few players departed.",

        "description": "Everyone loves food, and you can learn more about traditions surrounding our food and meals at the DeKalb History Center in Sycamore.",
        "content": "We all love food, and the DeKalb County History Center presents a new exhibition about the history and traditions surrounding our food and meals. “Food: Gathering Around the Table” will open with a grand reception from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, June 1, at the , 1730 N. Main St., Sycamore. According to the DeKalb County History Center, the exhibit will explore natural resources, local food traditions, food technology and food as an autobiography. Because food traditions are diverse and evolving, the intersection of American culture is an important factor in American food, the history’s website states. Michelle Donahoe, executive director of the DeKalb County History Center, said she and her team have been working for more than a year to research, identify photos and objects, and conduct interviews with residents for the exhibit. There are five main sections to the exhibit. The first is “Land of Plenty,” which focuses on Native American food traditions, hunting and gathering, local farming and food insecurity; “Local in Locale” presents stories about area restaurants, festivals and more; “Dynamic Delivery” shares information about food and its relationship to technology and local businesses; “Home Cooking” showcases historical cookbooks, old kitchen utensils and fine china that was used for special occasions. The fifth section is a hands-on activity area for kids. “The display really has something for everyone – young, old, current residents and those from out of town,” Donahoe said. “I think it really shows how food brings us together. Food has unrivaled power to connect people with place, to create an identity for a community or region, and to plant an enduring memory for people passing through.” The history center collaborated on the exhibit with the world-renowned Smithsonian Institution’s Museum on Main Street program, which helped provide the framework. Donahoe and her staff worked to find the local stories to complement those themes. “‘Food’ was a national competition directed by the Smithsonian’s Museum on Main Street team in Washington, D.C., and we were very honored to be selected,” she said. “Their input on the exhibit, programs and outreach has made this one of the most engaging displays ever.” Donahoe understands that not everyone is interested in local history, but said that everyone loves food, and the exhibit will appeal to folks from all over the area, not just DeKalb County residents. “Food can be an adventure when you try something new, it can be comforting when you enjoy a traditional favorite, it can energize when [you] eat something you have grown, and it can be a way to rally our community to bring support to that special cause,” she said. “In other words, this exhibit is about history, but it presents it in a fun and creative way. There is really something for everyone.” The exhibit will run for about two years, Donahoe said. The history center also received a grant from Illinois Humanities to host a podcast about food, and more details are expected to be released in coming months, she said. For more details, visit .",

The first quarter was tight, with Notre Dame leading 5-3 at it's conclusion. The second quarter, however, is where the Fighting Irish took control. Notre Dame outscored Maryland 5-1 in that frame, taking a 10-4 lead into halftime. It continued that pace in the next quarter, outscoring Maryland 4-1 to take a 14-5 lead into the final quarter. Bullseye. 🎯Make that a hatty for Chris Kavanagh. 📺 ESPN#NCAAMLAX x @NDlacrosse pic.twitter.com/ZrMu4Gf6RW The Fighting Irish added one more in the fourth quarter and opted to control possession for much of that final quarter in the effort to close out the game. Chris Kavanagh led Notre Dame with five goals, while his brother Pat led the team with six assists. Jake Taylor added two goals in the winning effort, while Eric Dobson, Jordan Faison, Devon McLane, Fisher Finley, Will Angrick, Reilly Gray, Max Busenkell and Jalen Seymour added the other goals. Fighting Irish goaltender Liam Enteman was a huge key to the victory as well, turning away 16 Terrapin shots.",

        "content": "From crowdfunding to the use of recycled paper and clothes – the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has said that its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Surat next month is set to be a sustainable event. The event is scheduled to be held between June 7 and June 9. Over 1,500 used denim trousers were collected from college students under a campaign that went on for a week. These will be refurbished as bags to be used during the event, said organisers. “We visited over 80 college and university campuses to collect used denims from students between May 7 and May 14. These have been handed over to Mahil Gruh Udhyog (women self help groups) to make shoulder bags that will be distributed among participants during the NEC meet,” ABVP Gujarat secretary Samarth Bhatt told The Indian Express . Advertisement The NEC meeting to be held in Parvat Patiya area of Surat is expected to witness a participation of nearly 500 student representatives from across the country. The student body, affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), also opted for crowdfunding to finance the event. Around Rs 5 lakh has been collected from textile and diamond markets of Surat by a team of ABVP members. “Five teams of ten each collected funds from textile and diamond merchants in Surat. This exercise was conducted to ensure social or community participation in the national event and also to reflect that the funds thus collected are used responsibly,” Samarth Bhatt added. To go paperless, the ABVP has launched a mobile app — especially for the meeting — where resolutions will be uploaded. Suggestions will also be sought on the app. Moreover, organisers also say they prefer the use of recycled paper throughout the event. The diaries to be used are made from recycled paper collected from students. Along with being a plastic-free event, the banners will be made of cloth, ABVP state media convenor Meet Bhavsar said. On June 6, a felicitation event will be followed by a cultural event. The NEC event is to be inaugurated on June 7 where ABVP representatives will deliberate on social, education and organisational issues, say organisers.",

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.",

Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. Photos: Remembering Lisa Marie Presley, 1968-2023 \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "content": "Iga Swiatek made a winning start in her bid for a fourth title French Open in Paris on Monday. The women’s world number one raced to a 6-1, 6-2 victory against French qualifier Leolia Jeanjean after just 61 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier. The Pole will next face fellow four-time major champion Naomi Osaka tomorrow. “I’m really happy to be back. Feel like I’m playing really good tennis so hoping to be here as long as possible,” said Swiatek. The 22-year-old Pole is aiming to become the first woman to win three straight Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007, and only the second ever after Serena Williams to win the Madrid, Rome and French Opens in the same year. Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner started his title tilt with a confident 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 win over Wimbledon quarter-finalist Christopher Eubanks. The Italian second seed, who withdrew from the Madrid Open and missed the Rome Open with a hip injury, set up a second-round meeting with French veteran Richard Gasquet. “The hip is good, I’m very happy,” said Sinner. Former finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas beat Marton Fucsovics of Hungary 7-6 (9/7), 6-4, 6-1. Women’s third seed Coco Gauff, the current US Open title-holder and who lost the 2022 French Open final to Swiatek, raced through in just 52 minutes by crushing Russian Julia Avdeeva 6-1, 6-1. The 20-year-old goes on to face Slovenian qualifier Tamara Zidansek for a place in the last 32. Marketa Vondrousova, also a former Roland Garros runner-up and the reigning Wimbledon champion, eased past Rebeka Masarova of Spain in straight sets. Tunisian eighth seed Ons Jabeur booked her place in round two with a comfortable win over US wildcard Sachia Vickery. Later, American Ben Shelton won his first match at the French Open as he overcame Frenchman Hugo Gaston 3-6, 6-3 ,6-4 6-4, not only surviving two interruptions from the Paris rain but also the wrath of the local fans. Loud chants of “Hugo, Hugo” echoed across Court 14 as the home favourite took the opening set, but Shelton’s fierce left-handed play quickly silenced the French crowd as he took the second, third and fourth sets, converting six of 14 break points to complete the two-hour, 29-minute encounter. Shelton will play Kei Nishikori, who beat Gabriel Diallo 7-5 7-6(3) 3-6 1-6 7-5, in the second round.

        "description": "A new Waco nonprofit is hosting a free \"Protect Yourself!\" conference to teach the elderly and their caregivers about ways to protect older adults from scams, fraud and abuse.",
        "content": "A new local nonprofit is inviting the public to a June 7 conference to teach senior adults and their caregivers how to protect against scams, fraud and abuse. The free \"Protect Yourself!\" conference, organized by Better at Last , will feature more than 20 speakers at the Waco Convention Center. The conference comes at a time when scams targeting the elderly are on the rise, according to a 2023 report from the FBI. Better at Last founder Teresa Gingles is a physical therapist and board-certified geriatric specialist with Baylor Scott & White who has been working with older adults for more than a decade. She started working on the nonprofit about 18 months ago. Teresa Gingles, founder of the local nonprofit Better at Last, is a physical therapist and a board certified geriatrics specialist. After hosting various workshops with help from a $10,000 Texas Bar Foundation grant, Gingles decided to organize a conference on elder fraud. She said the event is important because older adults are often the victims of scams but may not know how to protect themselves. \"We need to get these older adults in front of experts,\" she said. \"This problem is certainly not going away.\" The conference will feature two keynote speakers. Patrick Swanton, a retired sergeant from the Waco Police Department, and Sandy Sullivan, a retired senior vice president of fraud for Frost Bank, will both give speeches on the prevalence of fraud. Following the keynote speakers, attendees can choose to participate in three breakout sessions of their choice and various panel discussions featuring speakers from across the state, including from banks, law enforcement, Baylor Law School, law firms and the Texas Bankers Association. Among other topics, speakers will discuss basic bank security protections, rights of the elderly, when to report a scam, the most common types of fraud and how to vet potential scammers. Gingles said she felt passionate about hosting the conference because, like many people, an elderly relative in her family was affected by a scam. According to the FBI, older Americans are disproportionately affected by fraud. Scams targeting individuals aged 60 and older increased by 14% in 2023 compared to the previous year. More than 101,000 seniors age 60 or older reported being victimized by scams last year and the FBI estimates these crimes caused over $3.4 billion in losses. There are many types of scams, but tech support scams were the most widely reported type of elder fraud last year. Personal data breaches, confidence and romance scams, non-payment or non-delivery scams and investment scams were the other top four most common types of elder fraud reported. As for the most costly type of scams, investment scams were the costliest kind of elder fraud last year, with victims reporting more than $1.2 billion in losses. Cryptocurrency was also an increasing medium or tool used to facilitate scams targeting the elderly. More than 12,000 victims aged 60 or older reported cryptocurrency as a factor in the scam or fraud that targeted them. According to the United States Credit Union , older citizens are attractive to con artists because they often have a \"nest egg\", own their home or have excellent credit. Scammers may also exploit typical cultural norms held by older Americans, such as being polite or trusting, which makes it harder for them to say no or hang up the phone. Older adults are also less likely to report fraud because they either don't know who to report it to, are embarrassed about being scammed or don't know they've been scammed. Even when elder victims report scams, they may not be good witnesses due to the effects of age on memory. Gingles said the conference is just one part of her nonprofit's greater mission to improve the lives of older adults. \"The goal is getting people strong and active, connected and protected,\" she said. The conference will be held from 8 a.m. to noon and is free for adults ages 55 and older, as well as their caregivers. All attendees must register for the event on the Better at Last website . Browsing the web can leave you vulnerable to scammers so it's important to protect yourself. Get local news delivered to your inbox!

        "description": "Private providers say they’re being discriminated against as the province ramps up access to publicly-funded childcare spaces",
        "content": "It took Jason Li more than a decade to find a suitable detached house in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood where he and his wife could open their second daycare. Initially, Mr. Li believed the building he finally bought would only require minor adjustments to obtain a licence. But he spent months meeting the demands of the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health, requirements that were sometimes in conflict. The city wanted a cabinet in the basement area designated for child care gone. Vancouver Coastal Health ordered that it stay. Mr. Li had to find a smaller one that suited both parties. Then the city wanted a door linking the basement and ground floor eliminated, saying it violated building codes. But the health authority said it needed to be there to ensure child safety. “The city says one thing, VCH says another,” said Mr. Li. “We had no clue and felt confused.” Mr. Li invested more than $1.6-million to buy the house and thousands more in renovations. During the year he awaited licensing approval, he didn’t earn any income from this site. He noted he gets little support as a private daycare provider for his business as the provincial NDP government shifts its resources to funding non-profit and publicly-run child care. As demand for child-care spaces has exploded and with a fall election looming, the provincial government has worked to dramatically ramp up the availability of publicly-funded daycare spaces. But daycare spots in B.C. are still hard to come by and publicly-funded spaces, which generally cost less, have especially long wait lists. The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers like Mr. Li say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. On May 16, the B.C. government announced the latest round of grants for groups expanding or creating new child-care spaces. Those eligible include Indigenous governing entities, local governments, public bodies such as health authorities and non-profits. The grants can run up to $500,000 for costs related to minor renovations or equipment – and higher for bigger renovation, building and expansion projects. Providers like Mr. Li are not eligible. While he believes his building can accommodate more children, he is only allowed to enroll a maximum of eight. He received a $4,500 grant from the province – an initial payment of $500 plus an additional $500 per space – in startup funding. Mr. Li’s Green House Childcare Centre is classified as a “family child-care” centre, meaning it is privately owned and operated out of a home rather than a community-based facility. “Group child-care” centres, meanwhile, can be private or public, are allowed to accept more kids and are operated out of a community-based facility. Subsidies are available to parents at both types of facilities, but amounts differ. For example, parents of kids three and under at family daycares qualify for $600 per month. The corresponding amount at a group centre is $900. These discrepancies, where publicly-run centres receive more financial support from the government and parents at larger daycares are eligible for bigger subsidies, make it difficult for smaller, private centres to operate, he said. Fatima Abaszadeh said parents ask daily whether her daycare has space for their children but it’s fully booked until September, 2026. “It’s really horrible. I’m so sorry for all the parents,” said Ms. Abaszadeh, owner and manager at Cozy Childcare. In response to soaring demand, she explored the possibility of launching a larger facility in Kitsilano. But after nearly eight years of searching, Ms. Abaszadeh has been unable to find a location that meets the city’s requirements, especially for outdoor space. Even if one were available, she couldn’t afford it without substantial government support. Moreover, government-capped tuition means she is unable to charge enough to balance her investment. “With all expenses and the lease and the teachers’ wages, it isn’t worth to start this business at all. You’re stuck in a crazy loop of this business,” she said. Child-care advocates prefer a publicly-funded system, arguing it provides more affordable care, accountability and transparency. But private providers say the lack of space in the public system means their work is still necessary. A 2021 internal document from the Ministry of Education and Child Care, released by the BC United Party under freedom of information legislation, indicated that only public organizations, Indigenous governments and non-profits would be eligible for provincial child-care space creation funding. This approach was to “further signal government’s move away from market-based child care towards a universal, co-ordinated child-care system,” states the note. “As the government moves towards a universal, public-funded, flat fee model of child-care delivery, it may be cost prohibitive for for-profit providers to remain in the sector, making the creation of these spaces unviable in the medium-term.” The document also states that for-profit, private child-care providers make up the majority in the B.C. sector and are creating more spaces at a faster rate than publicly-funded daycares. Data provided by the ministry last month show that from 2019/20 to 2023/24, the number of private group child-care spaces increased by about 15,000 to 72,182. Publicly-funded group child-care spaces saw a smaller increase of around 10,400, climbing to 61,874. In comparison, family child-care spots increased by about 270, reaching 12,573. In a statement, the ministry acknowledged private providers continue to be important and said operational funding will remain equal in both sectors. Sharon Gregson, of the Coalition of Child Care Advocates of B.C., supports the government’s preference for a publicly funded system. “ When we think about investing public dollars, taxpayer dollars, we want to make sure that we’re building a system that is community owned, and it’s going to be long lived and serves the public good. It’s not just about investing taxpayer dollars for private asset,” she said. Still, that funding isn’t keeping pace with demand. In a 2023 report, researchers from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives concluded that 48 per cent of younger children – those not yet attending kindergarten – reside in a child-care desert, defined as a postal code in which there are at least three children competing for one licensed space. In B.C., 64 per cent of children live in child-care deserts. The province ranks behind only Saskatchewan, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Manitoba . B.C. was the first province outside Quebec to embrace the federal goal of $10-a-day daycare – a promise that helped the NDP win the 2017 election. But Ms. Gregson, B.C.’s spokeswoman for the $10-a-day child-care campaign, said the province is now behind other parts of the country in implementing the program: only 11 per cent of child-care is at a $10-a-day site in the province. “Like in other provinces, there’s been a lot of dependency on the federal government to carry out a bigger share,” she said. According to a chart provided by the ministry, federal investment in B.C.’s child-care sector has significantly increased since 2021/22. And by next year the federal government will be contributing more to daycare funding in the province than the B.C. government. On May 14, Premier David Eby announced the province will begin a pilot project using existing school space as well as school district resources and staff to provide child care. Mr. Eby said the model will start in three school districts with 180 spaces but is designed to grow. The care will be provided by CUPE BC members, including early childhood educators, early childhood educator assistants and education assistants. The union’s president, Karen Ranalletta, said such a move will attract education assistants back into the sector by supplementing their schedules, given that many of them do not work full-time hours. Mary Sweeney would be grateful for any kind of quality daycare spot for her three-year-old son. The Nelson, B.C., resident has been searching since 2022 for a facility that can accommodate her son, who has cerebral palsy. She said she has been rejected four times by small, privately operated centres, who told her their limited resources mean they can’t take him. A larger, publicly funded facility would be more appropriate, but she hasn’t been able to get a spot there either. As a result, she has been commuting 16 hours per week to the Okanagan, where her mother-in-law cares for her son. “It just makes no sense to not have kids like mine in these larger daycare centres where there is zero priority and everyone’s waiting for a spot,” she said. “There’s really not a lot that anyone can do; everybody’s basically powerless.”",

        "description": "Despite its recent sharp gains, Enbridge (TSX:ENB) stock has the potential to continue inching up in the years to come and reward investors with higher dividends.The post Where Will Enbridge Stock Be in 3 Years? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "After declining by nearly 10% in 2023, ( ) stock seems to be regaining strength in recent months. ENB stock has gone up by more than 12% over the last seven months to currently trade at $49.53 per share with a of $104.8 billion. At this market price, it offers an impressive 7.4% annualized dividend yield and distributes these dividend payouts every quarter. But can Enbridge continue to deliver strong returns to investors in the years ahead? Before discussing where the stock might stand three years from now by looking at the factors that are likely to influence Enbridge’s future performance, let’s first review the drivers of its recent recovery. Key factors helping Enbridge stock recover The main reason for Enbridge stock’s recent recovery could be the resilience of its core business, which consists of transporting and storing crude oil and natural gas across North America. Despite the challenges posed by warmer weather and largely weaker commodity prices in recent quarters, the company is continuing to maintain positive earnings growth, robust cash flows, and dividends. In the first quarter of 2024, Enbridge’s total revenue 8.6% YoY (year over year) to around $11 billion as significantly warmer weather affected the performance of its gas distribution and storage segment. Nevertheless, despite this negative factor, along with higher operating costs, the company’s adjusted quarterly earnings jumped by 8.2% YoY to $0.92 per share, beating Street analysts’ expectations of $0.81 per share. Similarly, its adjusted net profit margin expanded to 17.7% in the latest quarter from 14.3% a year ago. These positive factors might have supported a recovery in Enbridge’s stock price in recent months, as investors might have appreciated its strong earnings potential despite unfavourable market conditions. Where will Enbridge stock be in three years? Besides continued strength in its core energy transportation business, Enbridge, in recent years, has increased its focus on further diversifying its revenue stream. This is one of the key reasons why the company is investing in segments like crude oil export and renewable energy. Also, its strong cash flows and robust financial position give it the ability to invest in future growth. For example, in the first quarter, Enbridge completed the acquisition of The East Ohio Gas Company (known as Enbridge Gas Ohio now) in a deal worth US$6.6 billion, which is expected to improve its position in the gas distribution market and help it accelerate financial growth trends. While it’s nearly impossible for anyone to accurately predict where Enbridge stock will be three years from now, its strong and diverse revenue streams indicate that it has a bright future ahead, which can help its share prices continue soaring in the coming years. That said, if you expect to multiply your invested money in a short period of time, ENB stock might not be the best option for you. However, if you are looking for a long-term investment that can provide you with a steady dividend income and capital appreciation, then you might want to consider adding Enbridge stock to your portfolio. Also, the fact that it has a solid track record of increasing its dividends for 29 consecutive years makes it even more appealing for long-term income investors.",

But providers say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. kali9/E+/Getty Images Listen to this article 00:09:54 It took Jason Li more than a decade to find a suitable detached house in Vancouver’s Mount Pleasant neighbourhood where he and his wife could open their second daycare. Initially, Mr. Li believed the building he finally bought would only require minor adjustments to obtain a licence. But he spent months meeting the demands of the City of Vancouver and Vancouver Coastal Health, requirements that were sometimes in conflict. The city wanted a cabinet in the basement area designated for child care gone. Vancouver Coastal Health ordered that it stay. Mr. Li had to find a smaller one that suited both parties. Then the city wanted a door linking the basement and ground floor eliminated, saying it violated building codes. But the health authority said it needed to be there to ensure child safety. “The city says one thing, VCH says another,” said Mr. Li. “We had no clue and felt confused.” Mr. Li invested more than $1.6-million to buy the house and thousands more in renovations. During the year he awaited licensing approval, he didn’t earn any income from this site. He noted he gets little support as a private daycare provider for his business as the provincial NDP government shifts its resources to funding non-profit and publicly-run child care. As demand for child-care spaces has exploded and with a fall election looming, the provincial government has worked to dramatically ramp up the availability of publicly-funded daycare spaces. But daycare spots in B.C. are still hard to come by and publicly-funded spaces, which generally cost less, have especially long wait lists. The majority of spaces in B.C. are currently offered by private operators, and these centres are also growing faster than publicly funded options. But providers like Mr. Li say they are being discriminated against even though they’re offering a much-needed service. On May 16, the B.C. government announced the latest round of grants for groups expanding or creating new child-care spaces.

        "description": "Lightspeed is a tech stock that is growing at an enviable pace. But this TSX growth stock is a much better buy. The post A Growth Stock I’d Buy Over Lightspeed in 2024 appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "While have staged a remarkable comeback since the bear market of 2022, ( ) continues to trail the broader indices. Most equity indices, such as the S&P 500 and TSX 60, are trading near all-time highs, but LSPD stock is down 87% from record levels. Valued at a of US$2.32 billion, Lightspeed Commerce offers a fintech platform to small and medium enterprises, primarily in the restaurant industry. Lightspeed’s sales increased from US$221.7 million in fiscal 2021 (which ended in March) to US$909 million in fiscal 2024, primarily due to acquisitions. The rapid expansion in the top line meant LSPD stock soared from $27 in May 2019 to over $160 in September 2021. However, a scathing report from Spruce Point, a noted short-seller, drove LSPD shares lower. In late September 2021, Spruce Point accused Lightspeed of inflating its total addressable market, customer counts, and gross transaction volume (GTV). Spruce Point claimed it found evidence that Lightspeed inflated its business pre-IPO (initial public offering) and overstated its customer count by 85% and GTV by 10%. The short-seller also stated, “We believe that Lightspeed’s recent acquisition spree has come at escalating costs with no clear path to profitability while management pursues aggressive revenue reporting practices.” Lightspeed Commerce is a beaten-down growth stock that is forecast to increase sales to US$1.1 billion in fiscal 2025 and to US$1.32 billion in 2026. An asset-light model should help Lightspeed improve profit margins significantly and benefit from operating leverage. The company is on track to improve earnings from US$0.16 per share in 2024 to US$0.34 per share in 2025 and US$0.53 per share in 2026. So, priced at 44.5 times , LSPD stock trades at a 20% discount to consensus price targets. However, I believe this is a much better buy at the current valuation. Let’s see why. While LSPD stock is down in the dumps, ( ) stock is up 283% in the last three years. Bombardier has increased its sales from $6 billion in 2021 to $8 billion in 2023. While it reported an operating loss of $269 million in 2021, it ended 2023 with an operating income of $8 billion. In the last two years, its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) grew by a factor of more than four times to 15% in 2023. Its robust performance has put the company on track to end 2025 with sales of $9 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $1.625 billion, and free cash flow of $900 million. While Bombardier has $6 billion in debt, it aims to maintain a net leverage ratio of between 2 and 2.5 times. Moreover, a focus on cost optimization should help it end 2024 with adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.72. Analysts expect EPS to surge by 58% to $9 per share in 2025, indicating the TSX stock is priced at less than 10 times forward earnings. Despite its sizeable returns since 2021, Bombardier stock should continue to outpace the broader markets, given its earnings forecasts.",

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "content": "Three Campbell River teenagers tested their swimming skills during Olympic Trials in Toronto from May 14 to May 19. “CRKW (Campbell River Killer Whales) and I are incredibly proud of the local athletes and their accomplishments at [the] Olympic Trials this past weekend. It is incredibly inspiring for our young swimmers and for the rest of our club to know there is a brilliant path in front of them,” says Mercedes Hayduk, president of the club. “The credit goes to our amazing head coach who works passionately and tirelessly with our swimmers to create an environment where champions are inevitable.” The three swimmers were Zac Millns, Sarah Haugen, and Keyana Owens. Haugen says the trials went great. “It was very interesting, very exciting and a good environment,” she says. “It was good to race at that level.” She qualified for the 100-metre breaststroke but admits it wasn’t her best time. She also did a couple of races in the 100-metre freestyle and was able to qualify for an Olympic trial time. “It was mostly a really nice visual of what my next four years (and) what I have to work up to. I didn’t place too well, which is fine, but it is more for the experience. Next year I plan on having at least five races at the trials and hopefully final in some of them (the junior finals).” She talked about using that as a platform to advance into the ‘B’ and ‘A’ finals. Richard Millns is the club’s head coach and is also Zac’s father. “As a head coach, I am very proud of all three of these swimmers. I have coached them since they were very little and am proud to see them bloom into the champions I always knew they could be,” says Millns. “As a father, I am so overjoyed to see my son compete at the Olympic Trials. He makes me a proud dad no matter what level he competes at, but it is nice to see him at the highest level.” Millns says the three teens finished in the middle of the pack. His 15-year-old son nearly qualified for the Junior Championship Final. To qualify for the trials, the swimmers needed to break club records and perform at “historically high levels” to represent the Campbell River community. The three teens are preparing to compete at the Far Western Championships in California (Owens and seven other CRKW members) and an international age-group competition in Spain (Millns and Haugen). “We’re going to race in Barcelona with a close friend who was a foreign exchange student a couple of years ago,” says Haugen. “It’s a real competition, it’s like a western-level meet, so that’s faster than Provincials, a little slower than trials.”",

        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE: ) (TSX: CAE) – CAE Inc. today announced that it has received regulatory approval to proceed with its previously-announced normal course issuer bid (\" \") to purchase, for cancellation, up to 15,932,187 of its common shares commencing and ending . The maximum number of common shares that may be repurchased under the program represents approximately five percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding common shares of CAE. The actual number of common shares purchased under the NCIB, the timing of purchases and the price at which the common shares are bought will depend upon management discretion based on factors such as market conditions. Purchases under the NCIB will be made through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\" \") in accordance with the TSX's applicable policies or the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange (\" \") in compliance with applicable NYSE rules and policies and U.S. laws, or in such other manner as may be permitted under applicable stock exchange rules and applicable securities laws, including through alternative Canadian and US trading platforms and privately-negotiated, off-exchange block purchases. In the case of off-exchange block purchases, purchases will be at a discount to the prevailing market price in accordance with and subject to the terms of applicable exemptive relief. RBC Dominion Securities Inc. (\" \") has agreed to act as CAE's designated broker to make purchases of common shares pursuant to the NCIB. CAE has also entered into an automatic share purchase plan (\" \") with RBC allowing it to purchase common shares under the NCIB when the company would ordinarily not be permitted to purchase shares due to regulatory restrictions and customary self-imposed black-out periods. Before entering a black-out period, CAE may, but is not required to, instruct RBC to make purchases under the NCIB during such a period based on parameters set by CAE in accordance with the ASPP, TSX Rules and applicable securities laws. All purchases made under the ASPP are included in computing the number of common shares purchased under the NCIB. The ASPP has been pre-cleared by the TSX and will be implemented and effective . The price CAE will pay for any common shares will be the market price at the time of acquisition, plus brokerage fees. All common shares purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be cancelled. During the period that the NCIB is outstanding, CAE does not intend to make purchases of its common shares other than by means of open market transactions or such other means as may be permitted or approved by any applicable securities regulator. The average daily trading volume of CAE's common shares through the facilities of the TSX over the last six completed calendar months was 605,257 (\" \"). Accordingly, under the TSX Rules and policies, CAE is entitled on any trading day to purchase up to 25% of the ADTV, which totals 151,314 common shares, for the next 12-month period of the NCIB. In excess of the daily repurchase limit, CAE may also purchase, once a week, a block of common shares not owned by any insiders, which may exceed such daily limit, in accordance with the TSX Rules. As of , CAE had 318,643,758 common shares issued and outstanding. CAE has not repurchased any of its common shares during the last twelve months. The NCIB is being established as part of CAE's capital allocation strategy. The Board of Directors of CAE believes that any purchases made under the NCIB will be in the best interest of CAE and that such purchases will constitute a desirable use of funds that should enhance shareholder value.

Here’s How to Get In.It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million. Do this now.",
        "content": "Finding high-growth investment opportunities in the middle of volatile markets is like finding gold. These days, three exceptional businesses have surfaced, all displaying eye-catching numbers and bright futures that attract the attention of astute investors throughout the globe. To begin with, the first one stands out due to its incredible financial boost. With an impressive yearly increase and quarterly boost in adjusted EBITDA, the business demonstrates solid cost control and operational efficiency. Moreover, the second one is very noticeable in the field of online shopping. The company’s marketplace shows a rising interaction and transactional value ecosystem, with a noteworthy growth in gross merchandise value (GMV) that third-party (3P) sellers mainly drive. This emerging market highlights the company’s flexibility and scalability in the digital sphere and offers steady development prospects. Finally, the third one stands out as a shining example of growth and financial stability. Supported by a solid increase in EPS and a discernible improvement in operating margins, the firm exhibits improved profitability and efficient cost control. Nextracker (NXT) The revenue of Nextracker (NASDAQ: NXT ) has uplifted massively on a quarterly and year-over-year (YoY) basis. The company’s sales for the fiscal 2024 were $2.5 billion , a solid boost of more than 30% YoY. The solid growth is further demonstrated by the Q4 revenue of $737 million, a 42% YoY increase. With that, Nextracker may continue to hit growth because of its steady revenue growth over the last quarter and fiscal year. This is the result of solid market demand and a progressive business strategy. Moreover, at $521 million, Nextracker’s adjusted EBITDA has more than doubled YoY—a remarkable 150% increase YoY. Adjusted EBITDA increased 120% YoY to $160 million in Q4 alone. Even without the IRA 45X tax credit benefits, this reflects excellent cost control and operational success. Additionally, Nextracker has had tremendous success abroad. Its Q4 income from overseas sales reached $242 million, an over 90% YoY increase. In addition, the business revealed a record backlog of over $4 billion , up more than 50% YoY and tripling over the preceding two years. Overall, based on completed contracts and purchase orders, this increasing backlog indicates solid future demand and improves revenue visibility, enabling long-term growth. GigaCloud (GCT) The GMV marketplace operated by GigaCloud (NASDAQ: GCT ) had a high 64% YoY boost , rising from $553.5 million to $908 million for the 12 months ended March 2024 (Q1 2024). This increase in GMV highlights the platform’s growing efficiency and scale for GigaCloud. Even more significantly, the GMV from third-party (3P) vendors increased, rising from $285 million to $490 million in the previous year’s period, a 71.8% increase. Moreover, the percentage of GMV attributed to 3P sellers has increased from 51.5% to 54%, indicating these sellers’ growing significance and input to GigaCloud’s marketplace. In short, the growth reflects an expanding marketplace ecosystem with increased engagement and transaction values. Additionally, sales increased 43.7% YoY from 602 to 865 active 3P vendors in Q1 2024. At the same time, there were 5,493 active purchasers , up from 4,255, a 29.1% YoY increase. Notably, the average spend per active buyer increased by 27%, from $130K to $165K. Therefore, these indicators suggest that the GigaCloud marketplace ecosystem is robust and expanding, with consumers and providers exhibiting increasing transaction values and increased involvement. Celestica (CLS) Celestica (NYSE: CLS ) derives a healthy profit as Q1 2024’s adjusted EPS increased to $0.86 from $0.47 in Q1 2023. This astounding 83% growth suggests increased profitability and efficient cost control. The non-IFRS operating margin for Celestica increased from 5.2% in Q1 2023 to 6.2% in Q1 2024. This 1% increase was fueled by an uplifted bottom line in the Advanced Technology Solutions ( ATS ) and Communications and Enterprise Solutions ( CCS ) divisions. This is the first time the quarterly non-IFRS operating margin has surpassed 6%. Additionally, revenue for the CCS segment increased from $1.04 billion to $1.44 billion , a 38% increase YoY. Currently, this market sector derives 65% of the company’s consolidated top-line. Moreover, the sector margin increased by 1.2%, from 5.8% to 7%. Notably, the solid demand from hyperscale clients, especially AI computing solutions, drives growth. Revenues for the ATS segment decreased by 3% YoY to $768 million, but the segment margin rose by 0.3% to 4.7% , demonstrating effective operations despite a challenging market. Finally, declines in industrial demand were countered by growth in the aerospace and defense (A&D) sector and a stable capital equipment business.

        "content": "Premier Doug Ford is considering an early election call before the scheduled 2026 vote over concerns about cuts a future federal Conservative government might impose, the Star has learned. Sources say Ford is worried that if, , Pierre Poilievre wins an election expected in October 2025, there would be to the provinces, a of that is a and other slashed spending that would hurt the Progressive Conservatives. That’s a major reason why the premier is paying The Beer Store $225 million to liberalize booze sales as of this fall — more than one year earlier than planned — in a deal critics warn could actually cost taxpayers between $600 million and $1 billion. At , Ford repeatedly refused to commit to the planned June 2026 election and left open the possibility of a snap vote, which could cost more than $155 million, this fall or next spring. “I just want to get our agenda through,” the premier told reporters, noting the expansion of beer sales was long-standing PC campaign promise. But Tory insiders, speaking confidentially in order to discuss ongoing internal deliberations, say Ford was giving himself options at a time when and enjoys a big poll lead over Bonnie Crombie’s Liberals and Marit Stiles’s New Democrats. “It’s smart. It gets us in front of a tough budget from Pierre that could hurt the Conservative brand and help Bonnie,” said one insider, who is bullish on the plan. Another said it would force the Tory caucus to focus on priorities like delivering on , such as improved highways, public transit and hospital construction. “We have to show results and (booze liberalization) is something we promised to deliver and the premier has done that,” said the second official. A third PC source conceded that an earlier than anticipated election could get the Tories ahead of any fallout from the ongoing RCMP criminal probe of the $8.28-billion land swap scandal. But some Tories fear a reprise of 1990 — when popular Liberal premier David Peterson called a snap vote, and then lost to Bob Rae’s New Democrats in one of the most stunning upsets in Canadian political history. “Peterson was higher in the polls (50 per cent in summer of 1990) than Ford ( ) is now and had won a larger majority (in 1987 than Ford did in 2022),” said a fourth Tory. “But voters were ornery and punished him for the early election.” A fifth Tory expressed alarm that voters would feel it was “cynical and self-serving” to have a vote so soon after Ford received such a resounding re-election mandate in June 2022. “What would the rationale be for going early?” asked the Ford loyalist. The premier’s inner circle is mindful of the potential perils — but also aware of provincial political history. According to what’s known as the ” ,” when Ontario voters elect , they tend to elect Tories provincially. Conversely, when they elect federal Tory governments, the Liberals — and, in one instance, the NDP — usually win provincially. That has been the case , so Ford’s team believes a Poilievre victory in October 2025 would most likely help Crombie’s Liberals in June 2026, which is why they may act pre-emptively. For his part, Peterson, now the chair of Torstar, parent company of the Toronto Star, was circumspect when asked Monday about the wisdom of Ford going to the polls early. “Every single situation is different — different players, different times and I’m in no position to judge,” said the former premier, who governed Ontario from 1985 to 1990. “If I was so smart, I’d still be there,” he joked. Still, some on Ford’s team are poring over “Not Without Cause,” the searing 1991 post-mortem book on Peterson’s gamble by former Liberal aides Georgette Gagnon and Dan Rath. The book — billed as “a cautionary take for voters and politicians everywhere” — chronicled the mounting anger voters felt over an early election that cost $40 million at the time. “Confident they knew what Ontarians were thinking in the summer of 1990, the Liberal strategists gave no thought to the possibility Peterson might actually be defeated in the election he was about to call,” wrote Gagnon and Rath. Elections Ontario said the 2022 election cost $145.3 million, which according to the Bank of Canada inflation calculator, is the equivalent of $155.8 million this year. Rivals charged Ford risks the wrath of voters if he holds an early vote for his own benefit. “The people of this province would see it for what it is, which is an attempt to divert and hide what’s coming or the RCMP criminal investigation, but I say also — bring it on,” said Stiles. Crombie said governments calling early elections are “typically punished” for wasting tens of millions of dollars. “We know what the lesson has been in the past. It would be very disrespectful to the taxpayer. They have a majority government,” she said, calling Ford’s liberalization push “a billion-dollar booze boondoggle.” Under Ontario’s election law, a premier does not have to abide by the fixed date every four years.",

        "content": "The Strathcona Regional District is working on improving accessibility in the region, following rules set out by the province. The SRD announced the plan, which was approved in April, in recognition of National AccessAbility week (May 26 to June 2, 2024. The plan comes after the province enacted the Accessible BC act, mandating public organizations establish accessibility committees and develop accessibility plans. The act also directs governments to provide public feedback mechanisms to help identify and address barriers to accessibility. “In response, the SRD partnered with The City of Campbell River, the Village of Sayward, the Village of Zeballos, the Village of Tahsis, the Village of Gold River, Vancouver Island West School District 84, and the Vancouver Island Regional Library to establish the Strathcona Accessibility and Inclusion Advisory Committee (SAIAC), develop an Accessibility Plan and implement the feedback mechanism,” a release from the SRD says. The committee was established last year, and includes volunteer members from across the region. Those volunteer members provided feedback on the plan prior to its release. “The committee, representing a diverse range of voices is passionate about creating an inclusive region,” says Susan Sinnott, committee chair. “The approved accessibility plan marks the first step towards making our region and public institutions more inclusive for everyone.” “The partners of the Strathcona Regional Accessibility Plan and the SAIAC will prioritize the identified barriers, work to eliminate them, and report on the progress to do so,” the release says. “The Strathcona Accessibility Plan will be updated at least once every three years.” People can provide feedback online, and residents from throughout the region can provide information regarding barriers they have experienced or witnessed when accessing public services, programs and facilities. The SAIAC populated a list of barriers experienced, the public is also invited to add to this list through the feedback mechanism. The plan and feedback mechanism are located at www.srd.ca/accessibility .

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

(CAE or the Company) today reported its financial report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. Financial results are unchanged from preliminary...",
        "content": ", /PRNewswire/ - (NYSE: ) (TSX: CAE) CAE Inc. (CAE or the Company) today reported its financial report for the fiscal year ended . Financial results are unchanged from , including the re-baselining of the Defense & Security business along with Defense & Security impairments and unfavourable contract adjustments related to eight previously identified fixed-price legacy contracts (the Legacy Contracts). All financial information is in Canadian dollars. \"Last week we acted decisively and took the necessary steps to provide a clear path to margin improvement in our Defense business, supported by compelling long-term secular trends for this segment,\" said , CAE's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"As a result of the changes we have made, we have a more balanced risk profile going forward, and with as our new Chief Operating Officer (COO), we are well-positioned to further strengthen our execution capabilities and drive additional synergies between our Civil and Defense segments.\" As previously disclosed, in Civil, the larger of CAE's two businesses, record margins and orders position the Company well in the fiscal year ahead with expected low double-digit percentage Civil annual adjusted segment operating income growth and continued margin strengthening, with an annual adjusted segment operating income margin of approximately 23%. For Defense, CAE continues to expect fiscal 2025 revenue growth in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range and annual Defense adjusted segment operating income margin in the 6- to 7-percent range. As announced separately today, the TSX has approved the re-establishment of CAE's normal course issuer bid (NCIB). The NCIB will commence on and end on . The decision of the Board of Directors to re-establish the NCIB reflects CAE's current outlook and the cash generative nature of its highly recurring revenue business. CAE's Board of Directors will also continue to evaluate the possibility of reintroducing a shareholder dividend. Fourth quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was .3 million, compared with last year. Fourth quarter EPS from continuing operations was negative compared to last year. Adjusted EPS was ( excluding Legacy Contracts ) compared to last year. Operating loss this quarter was , compared to an operating income of (14.9% of revenue ) last year. Fourth quarter adjusted segment operating income was (11.2% of revenue ) ( excluding Legacy Contracts , 19.2% of revenue ) compared to (16.2% of revenue) last year. Annual fiscal 2024 revenue was .3 billion, compared to last year. Annual EPS from continuing operations was negative compared to in fiscal 2023. Annual adjusted EPS was this year ( excluding Legacy Contracts) compared to last year. Annual operating loss was , compared to an operating income of (11.6% of revenue) last year. Adjusted segment operating income was (12.8% of revenue) ( excluding Legacy Contracts, 14.9% of revenue) compared to (13.4% of revenue) last year. During the quarter, Civil signed training and operational support solutions contracts valued at . These included the sale of 7 full-flight simulators (FFSs) and long-term training and digital flight services contracts. For the year, Civil booked orders for a record , including 64 FFS sales (vs. 62 in the prior fiscal year) and comprehensive, long-term training agreements with customers worldwide. The Civil book-to-sales ratio was 1.19x for the quarter and 1.24x for the last 12 months. The Civil adjusted backlog at the end of the year was a record , which is up 12% from the prior year period. During the quarter, Defense booked orders for , bringing the full-year total to . The Defense book-to-sales ratio was 1.69x for the quarter and 1.04x for the last 12 months. The Defense adjusted backlog at the end of the year was . In addition, the Defense pipeline strengthened with some of bids and proposals pending customer decisions. As previously disclosed, within Defense there are a number of fixed-price contracts which offer certain potential advantages and efficiencies but can also be negatively impacted by adverse changes to general economic conditions, including unforeseen supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, availability of labour; all contributing to execution difficulties. These risks can result in cost overruns and reduced profit margins or losses. While these risks can often be managed or mitigated, there are eight distinct legacy contracts entered into prior to the COVID-19 pandemic that are firm fixed price in structure, with little to no provision for cost escalation, and that have been more significantly impacted by these risks (the Legacy Contracts disclosed in the third quarter of fiscal 2024). Although only a small number of contracts, they have disproportionately impacted overall Defense profitability. The Legacy Contracts include one that was inherited with CAE's fiscal 2022 acquisition of L3Harris Technologies' Military Training business and have completion dates mainly within the Company's next two fiscal years . The impairments and accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts resulting in unfavourable contract adjustments are expected to allow CAE to develop a new baseline for future profitability. In addition to the senior leadership changes at the business unit and corporate levels, CAE has continued to implement measures to further enhance risk management and execution over the past few years, including an increasingly disciplined and rigorous approach to the selection of bids and proposals and an enhanced focus on higher quality program pursuits. CAE incurred restructuring, integration and acquisition costs of during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, in connection with the previously announced restructuring program related to portfolio shaping actions including the sale of Healthcare and to the continued integration of the fiscal 2022 acquisition of Sabre's AirCentre airline operations portfolio (AirCentre). The restructuring program is related to portfolio shaping actions and to streamline CAE's operating model and portfolio, optimize its cost structure, and to create efficiencies. Total restructuring, integration and acquisition costs incurred since the start of the restructuring program this quarter amounted to , mainly related to severances and other employee related costs and the impairment of intangible assets related to the termination of certain product offerings within the Civil Aviation segment. CAE expects to record approximately of additional restructuring expenses over the next two quarters in light of the organizational and operational changes announced on , to re-baseline the Defense business, further strengthen its execution capabilities, and drive additional synergies between CAE's Defense and Civil Aviation businesses. Net finance expense this quarter amounted to , compared to in the preceding quarter and in the fourth quarter last year. Income tax recovery this quarter was , representing an effective tax rate of 14%, compared to an effective tax rate of 24% in the fourth quarter last year. The adjusted effective tax rate , which is the income tax rate used to determine adjusted net income and adjusted EPS, was 47% this quarter compared to 23% in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase in the adjusted effective tax rate was mainly attributable to the derecognition of tax assets previously recorded in partially offset by the change in the mix of income from various jurisdictions. Net income from discontinued operations was this quarter compared to in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 was mainly attributable to the after-tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations of in relation to the sale of the Healthcare business. Net cash provided by operating activities was for the quarter compared to in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow was for the quarter compared to in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, net cash provided by operating activities was compared to last year and free cash flow was , compared to in the same period last year. The cash conversion rate for fiscal year 2024 was 151%. Growth and maintenance capital expenditures totaled this quarter and for the year, mainly in support of accretive growth opportunities to expand the Civil global aviation training network. Net debt at the end of the year was for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.17 times (2.89 times excluding Legacy Contracts ). This compares to net debt of , for a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA of 3.16 times at the end of the preceding quarter. Adjusted return on capital employed (ROCE) was 5.9% this quarter compared to 7.0% last quarter and 5.8% in the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted ROCE includes the impact of in unfavourable Defense contract adjustments. This quarter, CAE submitted near-term (10 years) science-based reduction targets for validation by SBTi, an achievement that positions CAE on the net zero trajectory. Upon approval, these ambitious targets will guide our decarbonization journey organized around four value streams: aviation, sourcing, products and services, and buildings, which will help us transition from carbon neutrality to net zero emissions. Such an objective requires the mobilization of all our value chain which is why we introduced our new Supply Chain Management Program, CAE Resilient Together, designed to mutually reinforce both operational excellence and sustainability with our partners. Our carbon built-on approach extends to our business strategic planning and decision-making as we know that sustainability is a paramount long-term value driver. We have also contributed to raise awareness on the crucial role of sustainable aviation fuel via CAE Crew Training, for all business aviation pilots training with us. In addition, we remain strongly committed to creating social value and fostering an inclusive and diverse culture. Our efforts to strengthen relations with Indigenous Peoples in and around the world have been recognized through our first certification as a Progressive Aboriginal Relations Bronze company.

CAE confirms all of the 2025 guidance originally disclosed on , including for Civil and Defense, for finance expense and tax expense, and for balanced capital allocation priorities and accretive growth investments. CAE reiterates that a tenet of its capital management priorities includes the maintenance of a solid financial position, and it expects to continue to bolster its balance sheet through ongoing deleveraging, commensurate with its investment grade profile. Management's outlook for fiscal year 2025 and the targets outlined in CAE's press release ( ) and expectations constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws, and are based on a number of assumptions, including in relation to prevailing market conditions, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, supply chains and labor markets.

This summary earnings press release contains limited information meant to assist the reader in assessing CAE's performance, but it is not a suitable source of information for readers who are unfamiliar with CAE and is not in any way a substitute for the Company's financial statements, notes to the financial statements, and MD&A reports. This press release includes forward-looking statements about our activities, events and developments that we expect to or anticipate may occur in the future including, for example, statements about our vision, strategies, market trends and outlook, future revenues, earnings, cash flow growth, profit trends, growth capital spending, expansions and new initiatives, including initiatives that pertain to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, financial obligations, available liquidities, expected sales, general economic and political outlook, inflation trends, prospects and trends of an industry, expected annual recurring cost savings from operational excellence programs, our management of the supply chain, estimated addressable markets, demands for CAE's products and services, our access to capital resources, our financial position, the expected accretion in various financial metrics, the expected capital returns to shareholders, our business outlook, business opportunities, objectives, development, plans, growth strategies and other strategic priorities, and our competitive and leadership position in our markets, the expansion of our market shares, CAE's ability and preparedness to respond to demand for new technologies, the sustainability of our operations, our ability to retire the Legacy Contracts as expected and to manage and mitigate the risks associated therewith, the impact of the retirement of the Legacy Contracts, expected results from the re-baselining of the Defense business, management outlook for fiscal year 2025, the establishment of a NCIB program, the introduction of a shareholder dividend and other statements that are not historical facts. Since forward-looking statements and information relate to future events or future performance and reflect current expectations or beliefs regarding future events, they are typically identified by words such as \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"likely\", \"may\", \"plan\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"will\", \"strategy\", \"future\" or the negative thereof or other variations thereon suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. All such statements constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties associated with our business which may cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from results indicated in forward-looking statements. While these statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions regarding historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we believe are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as there is a risk that they may not be accurate. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release describe our expectations as of May 27, 2024 and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The forward-looking information and statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. In addition, statements that \"we believe\" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this press release. While we believe that information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. Except as otherwise indicated by CAE, forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any special items or of any dispositions, monetizations, mergers, acquisitions, other business combinations or other transactions that may occur after May 27, 2024.The financial impact of these transactions and special items can be complex and depends on the facts particular to each of them. We therefore cannot describe the expected impact in a meaningful way or in the same way we present known risks affecting our business. Forward-looking statements are presented in this press release for the purpose of assisting investors and others in understanding certain key elements of our expected fiscal 2025 financial results and in obtaining a better understanding of our anticipated operating environment. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. The forward-looking statements set out in this press release are based on certain assumptions including, without limitation: the prevailing market conditions, geopolitical instability, the customer receptivity to our training and operational support solutions, the accuracy of our estimates of addressable markets and market opportunity, the realization of anticipated annual recurring cost savings and other intended benefits from restructuring initiatives and operational excellence programs, the ability to respond to anticipated inflationary pressures and our ability to pass along rising costs through increased prices, the actual impact to supply, production levels, and costs from global supply chain logistics challenges, the stability of foreign exchange rates, the ability to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the availability of borrowings to be drawn down under, and the utilization, of one or more of our senior credit agreements, our available liquidity from cash and cash equivalents, undrawn amounts on our revolving credit facility, the balance available under our receivable purchase facility, the assumption that our cash flows from operations and continued access to debt funding will be sufficient to meet financial requirements in the foreseeable future, access to expected capital resources within anticipated timeframes, no material financial, operational or competitive consequences from changes in regulations affecting our business, our ability to retain and attract new business, our ability to effectively execute and retire the Legacy Contracts while managing the risks associated therewith, and our ability to complete the integration of the AirCentre business and the separation of the CAE Healthcare business within the anticipated time periods and at the expected cost levels. Air travel is a major driver for CAE's business and management relies on analysis from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to inform its assumptions about the rate and profile of recovery in its key civil aviation market. Accordingly, the assumptions outlined in this press release and, consequently, the forward‐looking statements based on such assumptions, may turn out to be inaccurate. For additional information, including with respect to other assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements made in this press release, refer to the applicable reportable segment in CAE's MD&A for the year ended March 31, 2024 available on our website ( ), SEDAR+ ( ) and EDGAR ( ). Important risks that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by our forward-looking statements are set out in CAE's MD&A for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, available on our website ( ), SEDAR+ ( ) and EDGAR ( ). Readers are cautioned that any of the disclosed risks could have a material adverse effect on our forward-looking statements. We caution that the disclosed list of risk factors is not exhaustive and other factors could also adversely affect our results. This press release includes non-IFRS financial measures, non-IFRS ratios, capital management measures and supplementary financial measures. These measures are not standardized financial measures prescribed under IFRS and therefore should not be confused with, or used as an alternative for, performance measures calculated according to IFRS. Furthermore, these measures should not be compared with similarly titled measures provided or used by other issuers. Management believes that these measures provide additional insight into our operating performance and trends and facilitate comparisons across reporting periods. Certain non-IFRS and other financial measures are provided on a consolidated basis and separately for each of our segments (Civil Aviation and Defense and Security) since we analyze their results and performance separately. Reconciliations and calculations of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable measures under IFRS are also set forth below in the section of this press release. Operating income margin is a supplementary financial measure calculated by dividing our operating income by revenue for a given period. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income or loss is a non-IFRS financial measure that gives us an indication of the profitability of each segment because it does not include the impact of any items not specifically related to the segment's performance. We calculate adjusted segment operating income by taking operating income and adjusting for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ). We track adjusted segment operating income because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income on a consolidated basis is a total of segments measure since it is the profitability measure employed by management for making decisions about allocating resources to segments and assessing segment performance. Adjusted segment operating income or loss excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted segment operating income or loss excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Adjusted segment operating income margin is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing our adjusted segment operating income by revenue for a given period. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted segment operating income margin excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted segment operating income margin excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Adjusted effective tax rate is a supplementary financial measure that represents the effective tax rate on adjusted net income or loss. It is calculated by dividing our income tax expense by our earnings before income taxes, adjusting for the same items used to determine adjusted net income or loss. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of the impact of changes in income tax rates and the mix of income on our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted net income or loss is a non-IFRS financial measure we use as an alternate view of our operating results. We calculate it by taking our net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations and adjusting for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events, after tax, as well as significant one-time tax items. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ). We track adjusted net income because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted earnings or loss per share is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing adjusted net income or loss by the weighted average number of diluted shares. We track it because we believe it provides an enhanced understanding of our operating performance on a per share basis and facilitates the comparison across reporting periods. Adjusted EPS excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EPS excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure which comprises net income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes, finance expense – net, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA further adjusts for restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ). We use EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance, by eliminating the impact of non-operational or non-cash items. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our performance. Free cash flow is a non-IFRS financial measure that shows us how much cash we have available to invest in growth opportunities, repay debt and meet ongoing financial obligations. We use it as an indicator of our financial strength and liquidity. We calculate it by taking the net cash generated by our continuing operating activities, subtracting maintenance capital expenditures, intangible assets expenditures excluding capitalized development costs, other investing activities not related to growth and dividends paid and adding proceeds from the disposal of property, plant and equipment, dividends received from equity accounted investees and proceeds, net of payments, from equity accounted investees. Cash conversion rate is a non-IFRS ratio calculated by dividing free cash flow by adjusted net income. We use it to assess our performance in cash flow generation and as a basis for evaluating our capitalization structure. Adjusted ROCE is a non-IFRS ratio calculated over a rolling four-quarter period by taking net income attributable to equity holders of the Company from continuing operations adjusting for net finance expense, after tax, restructuring, integration and acquisition costs, and impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events divided by the average capital employed from continuing operations. Impairments and other gains and losses arising from significant strategic transactions or specific events consist of the impairment of goodwill (as described in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment of technology and other non-financial assets (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ), the impairment reversal of non-financial assets following their repurposing and optimization (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ) and the cloud computing transition adjustment (as described in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended ). We use adjusted ROCE to evaluate the profitability of our invested capital. Net debt is a capital management measure we use to monitor how much debt we have after taking into account cash and cash equivalents. We use it as an indicator of our overall financial position, and calculate it by taking our total long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, and subtracting cash and cash equivalents. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS ratio calculated as net debt divided by the last twelve months adjusted EBITDA. We use it because it reflects our ability to service our debt obligations. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts further excludes the impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. No such accelerated risk recognition on Legacy Contracts was recorded in fiscal 2023. Net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA excluding Legacy Contracts is also useful because it provides a better understanding of the specific and impact from accelerated risk recognition on the Legacy Contracts on our ability to service our debt obligations. Maintenance capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to sustain the current level of economic activity. Growth capital expenditure is a supplementary financial measure we use to calculate the investment needed to increase the current level of economic activity. The sum of maintenance capital expenditures and growth capital expenditures represents our total property, plant and equipment expenditures. Adjusted order intake is a supplementary financial measure that represents the expected value of orders we have received: Adjusted backlog is a supplementary financial measure that represents expected future revenues and includes obligated backlog, joint venture backlog and unfunded backlog and options: The book-to-sales ratio is a supplementary financial measure calculated by dividing adjusted order intake by revenue in a given period. We use it to monitor the level of future growth of the business over time. A FFS is a full-size replica of a specific make, model and series of an aircraft cockpit, including a motion system. In our count of FFSs in the network, we generally only include FFSs that are of the highest fidelity and do not include any fixed based training devices, or other lower-level devices, as these are typically used in addition to FFSs in the same approved training programs. SEU is a measure we use to show the total average number of FFSs available to generate earnings during the period. For example, in the case of a 50/50 flight training joint venture, we will report only 50% of the FFSs under this joint venture as a SEU. If a FFS is being powered down and relocated, it will not be included as a SEU until the FFS is re-installed and available to generate earnings. Utilization rate is a measure we use to assess the performance of our Civil simulator training network. While utilization rate does not perfectly correlate to revenue recognized, we track it, together with other measures, because we believe it is an indicator of our operating performance. We calculate it by taking the number of training hours sold on our simulators during the period divided by the practical training capacity available for the same period. For non-IFRS and other financial measures monitored by CAE, and a reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable measure under IFRS, please refer to Section 12 of CAE's MD&A for the year ended March 31, 2024 (which is incorporated by reference into this press release) available on our website ( ), SEDAR+ ( ) and EDGAR ( ). , Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Enterprise Risk Management, 1-514-734-5760, , Vice President, Public Affairs and Global Communications, 1-438-805-5856, SOURCE CAE Inc.",

        "content": "Does Bayern Munich have another possible Manuel Neuer replacement on the horizon? Replacing a GOAT is never easy, and Neuer, 38, is as generation-defining as they come. So despite still having options on hand like Alexander Nübel — who just had a fine season on loan at Stuttgart and received a provisional call-up to Julian Nagelsmann’s EURO 2024 squad for Germany — and last season’s signing Daniel Peretz, the Bavarians are still on the hunt. Now they have identified FC Köln keeper Jonas Urbig, a 20-year-old Germany youth international who spent the last season on loan at SpVgg Greuther Fürth. If Bayern gets him, he would likely be sent out on loan to gain experience — perhaps joining both Nübel and Peretz in that department next year. From Sport Bild, via @iMiaSanMia : Bayern are interested in Köln and Germany U21 goalkeeper Jonas Urbig (20), who spent the season on loan at Greuther Fürth. Walter Junghans, former Bayern goalkeeper and current scout, was in attendance in Fürth several times to watch Armindo Sieb as well as Urbig. Urbig is considered one of the biggest goalkeeping talents in Germany and his style is reminiscent of Manuel Neuer. Should he join Bayern, he could be loaned out to develop further. For now, Urbig will return to Köln although the club is preparing for his potential departure [@BILD] In Nübel (27), Peretz (23), and now Urbig (20), Bayern would have a strong and age-staggered pipeline of goalkeeper reinforcements for whenever Neuer decides to hang up his boots. If the Bavarians can pull this off, credit to the front office for long-term planning. Looking for more thoughts and analysis of Bayern Munich’s potential hiring of Vincent Kompany, plus the latest transfer rumors involving Bayern and VfB Stuttgart’s Chris Führich, AC Milan ’s Theo Hernandez, and...Jamal Musiala?

        "description": "A mysterious company has caused a stir for trying to auction Elvis Presley's Graceland property in a foreclosure sale.",
        "content": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The catalyst behind the failed gambit to sell off the iconic Graceland property in Memphis is a mystery. The self-styled investment company also is under fire from a lawsuit alleging fraud, an aggressive attorney general and Elvis Presley loyalists who consider the home-turned-museum of the the king of rock n' roll to be sacred ground. Among the many questions surrounding the attempt to auction Graceland is how often cases pop up in which an entity emerges to claim assets of older or dead people. Experts say it's more common than one might think. \"I have never heard of a fraud targeting such a well-known institution. So it's a bit surprising on that end,\" said Nicole Forbes Stowell, a business law professor at the University of South Florida's St. Petersburg campus. \"But I don't think it's surprising to everyday people that are the targets.\" Elvis Presley and his girlfriend Yvonne Lime are photographed around 1957 at his home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tenn. A public notice for a foreclosure sale of the 13-acre Graceland estate was posted this month. The notice said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Naussany Investments and Private Lending said Elvis Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Riley Keough, an actor and Elvis Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, died in 2023. Keough filed a lawsuit on May 15 alleging Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and asking a Memphis judge to block the sale. \"Lisa Maria Presley never borrowed money from Naussany Investments and never gave a deed of trust to Naussany Investments,\" Keough's lawyer Jeff Germany wrote in the lawsuit. \"It's a scam,\" actor Priscilla Presley, Elvis' former wife, declared on social media. On Wednesday, a judge halted the sale, which was planned for the next day, saying Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing Nausanny's attempt to auction Graceland is fraudulent. One reason is an affidavit from Kimberly Philbrick, the Florida notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents. Philbrick indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley or notarized any documents for her, according to the lawsuit. The judge said the affidavit brought the signature's authenticity into question. On the relevant documents, the signature blocks were not correct and the paperwork references an online notarization option that was not recognized in Florida until 2020, two years after the alleged notarization, Stowell said. \"That makes me wonder if these documents were created after Lisa Marie passed away,\" Stowell said. \"The whole thing does not pass the smell test.\" Fans get off a tour bus Aug. 11, 2010, at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tenn. Mark Sunderman, a University of Memphis real estate professor, questioned why the lender would foreclose now if it had not received payments years after the loan was issued. The lender's legitimacy also is in doubt after unsuccessful attempts by The Associated Press to verify its existence beyond an email address and court filing signed by a Gregory Naussany. Court documents included company addresses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hollister, Missouri. Both were for post offices, and a Kimberling City, Missouri, reference was for a post office box. The business is not listed in state databases of registered corporations in Missouri or Florida. \"I've never heard of that business,\" Kimberling City Clerk Laura Cather said. A search of online records for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority showed no registration for the company. No representatives of Naussany appeared in court, though the company filed an unsuccessful motion denying the lawsuit's allegations and opposing the estate's request for an injunction. After the sale was halted, Naussany issued a statement saying it would drop its claim because a key document in the case and loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning \"legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.\" It did not specify the other state. Naussany has not responded to emailed interview requests from AP. Online court records did not show any legal filings suggesting the claim was dropped. Sunderman said apparently fraudulent claims involving real estate asset disputes arise more often than people think, especially involving inheritances. \"It's very difficult for someone to say, 'Well, no, I didn't take out this loan, I didn't sign these papers,' when they're dead,'\" Sunderman said. Darrell Castle, a Memphis attorney not involved in the case but monitoring it, said he often sees cases where older people are targets of fraud. \"I get cases quite often where people who are really helpless in the final stages of life in a nursing home are financially victimized,\" Castle said. \"The human mind will think of some way to cheat and steal if it can.\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Thursday his office was looking into the case. It can investigate and bring civil lawsuits, including in instances of alleged consumer fraud. It could turn over evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the district attorney or federal authorities. Opened in 1982, Graceland became Memphis' most famous tourist attraction and a touchstone for fans of Elvis Presley, the singer, actor and fashion icon who died in August 1977 at the age of 42. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock annually to the museum and the entertainment complex across the street. Who would target it with a scheme that \"fell apart with the first email and phone call, or internet search,\" and what holes in the legal system let it got closer to the auction block than it should have, should be the focuses of the attorney general, said Nikos Passas, a Northeastern University criminology and criminal justice professor.

        "content": "The trial of a Summerland man was delayed for the third time after he started sharing ‘conspiracy theories’ while on the stand in a different case. Garret Cole Sedawie appeared in Penticton Provincial Court on May 27 for what was planned to be a trial for charges of assault with a weapon and mischief under $5,000 from an incident that occurred in August of 2021. It was the third trial date scheduled for the case, after a previous attempt in 2023 was canceled over disagreements that saw Sedawie seek out a different lawyer, and the most recent trial date on May didn’t make it much further. The court was told that on May 23, while on the stand for a different assault case, Sedawie had begun talking about how he believed that RCMP and the alleged victim had conspired together to bring the charges forward as part of a plan to get him a criminal record. “What I’m concerned about is the current circumstances, your honor, whether he is fit to stand trial at this time given his testimony that day with regards to the conspiracy theories,” Crown said. After some discussion, including the unusual nature of having Crown prosecution be the one to ask for an assessment instead of defence, the judge agreed to order Sedawie to undergo a fitness test. If Sedawie is deemed fit to stand trial, which means he is capable of understanding court proceedings and participating in the trial, he could still undergo a Not Criminally Responsible hearing at a later date. Sedawie is currently scheduled to appear in court on June 26 to confirm that the fitness assessment process is underway. According to court records, the case in which Sedawie spoke of the conspiracy theories is scheduled for a decision on June 3.",

        "description": "According to NBA insider Marc Stein, “it is believed” Darius Garland will request a trade if Donovan Mitchell signs an extension with the Cleveland Cavaliers.",
        "content": "According to NBA insider Marc Stein , “it is believed” Darius Garland will request a trade if Donovan Mitchell signs an extension with the Cleveland Cavaliers . Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group is Paul’s agent. “The Cavaliers remain hopeful that Mitchell, 27, agrees to a sign a four-year contract extension worth nearly $210 million after the NBA Finals ... though it is believed that scenario could prompt Rich Paul-repped Garland to seek a trade,” Stein wrote. Garland averaged 18.0 points, 2.7 rebounds and 6.5 assists for the Cavaliers this season while shooting 44.6% from the field, 37.1% from beyond the arc and 83.4% from the free-throw line. The Cavaliers signed Garland to a five-year, $197 million extension in July 2022. The guard will make $36.7 million next season. During an interview with NBA reporter Chris Haynes of Bleacher Report , Paul was asked if Garland would request a trade from the Cavaliers if Mitchell signed an extension this summer. Paul gave Haynes a detailed answer. “There is not much to say,” Paul said. “I think people have their own opinions of what works and what doesn’t work. For me, I think people around the league know and you definitely know this about me, I’m very matter of fact with my approach on everything. If there was something to be discussed, I would discuss it. “As of now, there’s nothing to discuss on that. My job is to evaluate every situation for every guy that we as a company represent. I’m a representative of players and I help advise them on business decisions. It’s a lot more to it than just negotiating a contract after four years. Some guys choose to do that and only focus on that. I’m different. I try to look at everything.” The Cavaliers drafted Garland with the fifth pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. The 24-year-old has career averages of 18.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 6.7 assists. “You try to position guys a certain way to continue to have value,” Paul said. “It’s the same way I go about the draft. I think you know that as well. I’m not really focused on certain things in terms of rankings. The league is one that is fluid. It doesn’t stop for nobody. It continues to move on. “And so these guys have to make sure they understand that having the talent they have, and the production, allows them to maintain value. That value transitions into compensation and when you sum it all up, it’s really just a good ass job and sometimes you have to protect that for as long as you can. That’s where my mindset is for all the guys. No matter if they’re a max player or a minimum guy. My job is to prepare, educate and execute for my clients.” Garland has been linked to the San Antonio Spurs, Minnesota Timberwolves and Los Angeles Lakers in NBA trade rumors.

The Blue and Orange are famous for victories by one-goal margins, and this one marks their ninth of the year, though Saturday's victory is unique in needing four goals to get it ( notched a brace and set up a third to achieve it). Cincinnati are consistent winners, but they'll rue allowing four goals at home, especially as they account for more than a quarter (28.5%) of the goals they've allowed this season. 3 By the 59th minute, RSL trailed 3-0 at Toyota Stadium in Texas, but resilience was key as they absconded with a draw. was first to take one back, kick-starting a three-goal response with off the bench for a banger and also off the bench to make it three. Despite the early setback, Pablo Mastroeni's squad showed grit and depth as they continue their 11-game unbeaten run. 4 picked up a brace in Orlando to seal a 2-0 victory on the road (their third straight win away from home) as the Crew wrapped up league play on a high note, before heading to Mexico for their clash with next weekend. 5 LAFC picked up their third straight win on the road in Atlanta after 's professional foul gave them a 1-0 lead from the penalty spot. It wasn't their cleanest game, but they're building momentum toward an end-of-season that could be scary. Somewhere across the ocean, wrapped up his season with as he readies to become the latest international star to join the Black and Gold. Mateusz Bogusz slots in the goal for LAFC 6 NYRB had a bye this weekend, allowing more time to nurse their wounds after falling to NYCFC in Rivalry Week. 7 Minnesota held sway over the game early but allowed Colorado to come creeping back. Loons' keeper made five saves and came up big at the penalty spot to keep from a brace, but allowed a flimsy goal just minutes later to end the game 3-3. 8 A 1-0 victory against the bottom-ranked team in the league isn't the most resounding victory. Still, a win is a win. This one comes complement of ' 81st-minute header assisted by . 9 The Galaxy came from behind to defeat Houston 2-1, breaking a five-game winless run with their first victory since April 21. and whipped in the goals to seal it. 10 Philly broke their six-game winless rut against the worst team in the league the weekend previous and took a point on the road with a 0-0 draw in Charlotte on Saturday. The team is still looking to get back toward their full potential, though a summer of uncertainty (the fate of could shift their season) and various international duties looms near. 14 Colorado clawed from behind to collect a draw after trailing 3-1 in the first half. Brazilian forward Rafael Navarro scored his fifth goal in five games to bring his season tally to nine, pressing his importance for Colorado as his loan nears its completion this June, with many hoping he'll stay in Colorado. 13 Another draw for Dean Smith's squad of formidable defending. Their visitors from Philly have scored 25 goals in 14 games, so a 0-0 clean sheet is yet more evidence of their firm foundations. Charlotte is tied with Columbus for the fewest goals allowed (13) in the league and ranked first for the fewest goals per game. 11 The scoreline was respectable for the Whitecaps, who fell 1-2 to visitors from Miami. But losing to the Herons before a record-setting crowd of 51,035 while Miami was missing Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Sergio Busquets is a missed opportunity. On the plus side: the crowd seemed to enjoy themselves as they feasted on half-price food, even if they did chant, \"Where is Messi?\" at the beginning of the game. 12 D.C. made it a three-game winless run this weekend, though this time it was a draw. D.C. still has so much going for them (An MVP-worthy player in , for example), but taking just a point from among the worst teams in the league (Chicago Fire) is a poor way to capitalize. 17 Seattle left St. Louis with a 2-1 win Saturday night to mark their fourth win of the season, moving just inside the playoff spots for the first time this year. With 15 games gone and a lot of season left before us, ye olde West Coast juggernauts will hope to build on that playoff position momentum. A perfect through ball from Albert Rusnák is finished off by Jordan Morris. 👏 15 Toronto lost to FC Cincinnati at the weekend but can be proud of how they played. With absent due to yellow card accumulation, John Herdman's squad collected three goals against a team that's allowed just 14 in 15 games this season. (That's the third lowest in the league, with only Charlotte and Columbus allowing fewer.) 19 In Orlando's defense, Columbus have among the best keepers in the league in . Despite registering four big chances, Schulte saved them all and kept a clean sheet for the formidable visitors who kept their win streak alive on the road. 23 Portland sit 19th in the Supporters Shield race but third in goals scored (28) across the league. Only top-ranked teams Inter Miami and RSL have put more past their opposition. The Timbers can score. But can they defend? Remarkably, they also rank third across the league for goals conceded (30). If nothing else, they make for entertaining games, and this time the result went in their favor as they defeated SKC 2-1. set up the first and scored the second. ( finished the first and assisted the second). 18 's first goal of the year wasn't enough to offset the Galaxy's attacking inevitability (LA's 27 goals are the fourth most in MLS), as Houston succumbed to a 2-1 loss in LA. Still, in search of reliable goalscorers, Houston sit opposite end of the goal tally spectrum from the Galaxy, as they've notched just 13 in 14 games (second fewest in the league behind only New England). 16 Brad Guzan's professional foul brought Atlanta down to ten men in the 60th minute. The ensuing penalty gave LAFC a 1-0 lead which they saw out to the end. The loss makes it 9 without a win. Next up? Miami. 21 Austin is a team with heart, and they showed some on the road to come from behind to snag a draw against the San Jose Earthquakes. Their offensive production was looking a bit woeful, though, as they registered just five shots and only one on target against the team that's allowed more goals (34) than anyone else this season. 20 St. Louis were a bit unlucky in their loss to Seattle, conceding by way of an own goal before popped in to make it 2-0. They took one goal back but not enough to draw level, marking their second loss in as many games. Herculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. 22 Nashville picked up a 0-0 draw in their second match under new interim manager Rumba Munthali. The jury is still out on how the post-Gary Smith era will look this season. Incidentally, that's their seventh draw this year, putting them in a three-way tie for most in the league. 25 Dallas looked ready to do the unexpected Saturday, as they led 3-0 at home against the top-ranked West Coast side, Real Salt Lake. Tragically for the , s 61st-minute goal kickstarted a comeback that ended 3-3 by the final whistle. Silver lining? If fans manage to forget how things started, a point against RSL is still a result to be proud of. 24 They held Portland off for most of the match but Evander struck twice (first with an assist then with a goal) to ensure Kansas City their fifth straight loss in league play. They host Vancouver next at home with their season hitting a bit of freefall. 26 San Jose took the initial lead and came within a hair's breadth of all three points, but the post stopped them in stoppage time from what could have been their fourth win of the year. Alas, what could have been! Still, a 1-1 draw with Austin is respectable for a team that's lost 10 of their 15 games. 27 1-1 on the road against D.C. United is decent enough for the Fire. completed a solid team goal built patiently from the back, bringing them level from behind and showing hints of more quality the Fire may be hiding. 28 Montreal broke a four-game string of losses with a draw against Nashville. That's progress, especially since the last time they faced Nashville (May 4) they lost 4-1. That said, they still haven't won a game since April 13. 29 The Revs are as bad as you think they are. Actually, they could be worse. They did fire off 16 shots against NYCFC in a 1-0 loss at home, though none were real quality chances.",

        "content": "Conservatives are asking the House of Commons to vote to remove Speaker Greg Fergus from the role over partisan language that appeared in an ad for an event in his riding. Conservative MP Chris Warkentin moved a motion Monday afternoon that, if passed, would find Fergus in contempt of Parliament and declare the Speaker's chair vacant. \"This Speaker has demonstrated countless times that he is unfit to be a non-partisan speaker,\" Warkentin said in the House chamber. \"He's a very, very effective partisan Liberal and ... we've lost trust in his ability to govern this place.\" Conservative MP Chris Warkentin rises during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Thursday, May 4, 2023. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press) Warkentin moved the motion after Deputy Speaker Chris d'Entremont ruled that the use of partisan language in the ad amounted to a prima facie question of MPs' privilege. The online posting for \"A Summer Evening with the Honourable Greg Fergus\" included a line that took aim at Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre. It accused him of pursuing Conservative policies \"that would risk our health, safety and pocketbooks\" and promoted a Liberal plan to \"grow an economy that works for everyone.\" The Liberal Party apologized to Fergus in a letter last week, saying the language posted on the event page was the auto-populated, standardized language the party uses for events on its website. The language was posted without Fergus's knowledge and \"as a result of a miscommunication between the Party and the riding association,\" said the letter from Azam Ishmael, the party's national director. \"The Liberal Party unequivocally apologizes to you for this mistake, and we take full responsibility.\" Analysis The Speaker is under attack again — maybe it's time for a more independent approach Liberal Party apologizes to Speaker after controversy erupts over partisan event posting Liberal MP Kevin Lamoureux accused the Conservatives of launching a partisan attack on Fergus. \"They have constantly ... had it in for this Speaker,\" he said in the House. The Speaker presides over the business of the House of Commons and is meant to act as an impartial arbiter of House proceedings. While the Speaker is elected as a member of a party, the role is considered nonpartisan — no Speaker sits in a party caucus. This is not the first time Fergus, who was elected to the chair in October, has had his impartiality questioned by MPs. Fergus initially lost the support of Conservative and Bloc Québécois MPs when he taped a video tribute to outgoing Ontario Liberal leader John Fraser while wearing the Speaker's robes. He also participated in a fundraising event in his riding last fall, something billed as a \"cocktail militant\" for Liberal supporters. Fergus held onto his job after the NDP backed him during the fracas over the video. He apologized and paid a fine for breaking Commons rules that forbid the use of parliamentary resources for partisan purposes. Last week, NDP MP Peter Julian said Fergus behaved appropriately in this most recent case by having the event cleared by the Clerk before proposing to host it. An NDP spokesperson told CBC News that the party's position hasn't changed in light of d'Entremont's ruling.",

OTTAWA – Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Advertisement",

        "content": "OTTAWA - Four university presidents conceded to members of Parliament today that antisemitism is a problem on their campuses. MPs questioned the presidents of the University of Toronto, McGill University, Concordia University and the University of British Columbia about their codes of conduct, responses to pro-Palestinian encampments and efforts to include Jewish students in equity, diversity and inclusion initiatives. When Liberal MP Anthony Housefather asked all four about whether antisemitism is a significant problem on their campuses, they all said yes. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said there have been “comprehensive and multifaceted” efforts to combat antisemtisim. “Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, he answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. Their testimony on Parliament Hill comes as Jewish leaders, students and faculty have been voicing concerns over an increase in hate speech and violence since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war last fall. Graham Carr, Concordia’s president, highlighted several incidents that have occurred at the school since Oct. 7, including what he described as a “disgraceful” attack on the Jewish group Hillel Concordia. Carr also noted there has been peaceful activism on campus such as pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli groups are running information tables next to each other without incident. “I share these examples both positive and negative to be transparent. Yes, tensions exist at Concordia but there has also been a remarkable calm.” Gertler said the school’s senior administration has been regularly consulting with Jewish faculty and students since Oct. 7 to hear their concerns and advice on how to support them. Gertler also highlighted an apology in 2022 by the university’s faculty of medicine and affiliated hospitals for the “disgraceful historical practice” of imposing quotas for Jewish medical students and hospital trainees from the 1940s to the 1960s. “Our efforts to combat antisemitism are comprehensive and multifaceted. Are they enough? Until there are no further instances of antisemitism, the answer for us and for society at large, must be no,” Gertler said during his open remarks. The appearance came as the universities are grappling with encampments of pro-Palestinian protesters. Conservative MP Melissa Lantsman questioned Gertler about the encampment on its campus, asking whether any students have been suspended for behaviour that has endangered Jewish students. Gertler said that while no one has been suspended yet, “processes are ongoing.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "description": "Fans spotted the sweet tribute.",
        "content": "Stevie Nicks just blew away fans with her performance at BottleRock Napa Valley – and eagle-eyed spectators spotted a subtle nod to Taylor Swift among the Fleetwood Mac icon’s accessories. Nicks, 76, was wearing a bracelet from Swift’s The Tortured Poet’s Department merch during her live performance, making it clear that she counts herself among the legions of Swifties who have kept TTPD as the number one album for weeks. Wearing all black and looking like an astrological witch as per usual, the Dreams icon sported layers of necklaces and bracelets, though the chunky gold-plated bracelet stood out among them. In a video a fan captured from the crowd, Nicks’ sleeve slipped back as she sang Gold Dust Woman, revealing the accessory. The bracelet is a chunky chain link that features the album’s logo and can be purchased for $40 from Swift’s official merch shop – a low price considering it can now technically be counted as a friendship bracelet with Stevie Nicks. Swift and Nicks have reportedly been friends for quite some time, and Swift even drops her name in Clara Bow on her new album, singing: ‘You look like Stevie Nicks / In ’75, the hair and lips / Crowd goes wild at her fingertips / Half moonshine, a full eclipse.’ The two singer songwriters first collaborated in 2010 when they duetted Rhiannon and You Belong with Me at the 2010 Grammys. It’s clear the friendship remains strong, as Nicks was intimately involved in the creation of TTPD, even writing a poem that tells the story of star-crossed lovers and is included in physical copies of the album. The poem, which is entitled For T and Me, reads in part: ‘He was in love with her / Or at least she thought so / She was brokenhearted / Maybe he was too / Neither of them knew / She was way too hot to handle / He was way too high to try / He couldn’t even see her.’ It continues: ‘He really can’t answer her / He’s afraid of her / He’s hiding from her / And he knows that he’s hurting her.’ Harry Styles and Taylor Swift among former celebrity couples AI created fake children for Taylor Swift fan Scarlett Oliver dies aged 9 after rare brain cancer diagnosis The surprise reason why Jurgen Klopp will be back at Anfield as soon as next month Taylor Swift’s expected Eras Tour setlist for UK after Paris changes Nicks has previously praised Swift, saying in 2010 in a TIME profile: ‘Taylor reminds me of myself in her determination and her childlike nature. It’s an innocence that’s so special and so rare,’ she said. ‘Taylor can do ballads that could be considered pop or rock and then switch back into country. When I turned 20 years old, I had just made the serious decision to never be a dental assistant. Taylor just turned 20, and she’s won four Grammys.’ Nicks also told Today in an interview last year that her and Swift have a lot in common in terms of their songwriting styles: ‘I never don’t tell the truth. And I think that’s something that if Taylor Swift, who is my friend, if Taylor got anything from me, that’s what she got.’ She continued: ‘I don’t ever lie in my songs,and if you broke up with me, I don’t put I broke up with you. I tell the truth, always.’ Got a story?

        "content": "He doesn’t even play in the same conference as the Cowboys, but it seems Dallas doesn’t have love for Travis Kelce. The Kansas City Chiefs star took in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals between the Dallas Mavericks and Minnesota Timberwolves and was roundly booed when shown on the video board. Kelce, who is dating Taylor Swift, looked surprised, though he might have just been playing the moment up. The mood of the crowd changed when Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany were shown when the camera panned over. The crowd roared and Mahomes stood up to encourage more cheering. Mahomes hails from the Dallas area. Travis Kelce got boo’d and the crowd went crazy for Patrick Mahomes. pic.twitter.com/ZSX9rLDg7a Star Mavericks player Luka Doncic was more welcoming toward Kelce than the fans were. As Kelce waited post-game near the locker room, Doncic came over and gave him a hug. The Mavericks have a 3-0 lead over Minnesota and are looking to return to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011 when they upset LeBron James and the Miami Heat for the only NBA title in franchise history. The series resumes on Tuesday in Dallas. Luka Doncic and Travis Kelce after the Mavericks take the 3-0 lead in the Western Conference Finals. pic.twitter.com/7VkS24A2M4 Kelce had attended the game between the Dallas Stars and Edmonton Oilers earlier in the week. Kelce played pee wee hockey for eight years as a kid in the Cleveland area and has posted about his love of the game. Mahomes had jokingly told Kelce to “get out of (his) arena” when Kelce attended the hockey game. Perhaps that’s why he joined him for some hoops action. The other Dallas Mavericks star, Kyrie Irving, famously helped bring Cleveland its first major sports title since 1964 when the Cavaliers won in 2016, so it’s likely Kelce is a big fan of Irving.",

        "description": "Karnataka MP Prajwal Revanna apologizes in a video for being incommunicado after facing sexual abuse allegations, vows to cooperate with investigators and trust judiciary for justice.",
        "content": "BENGALURU: A month since fleeing the country after allegations that he had sexually abused multiple women, Karnataka MP and former PM HD Deve Gowda 's grandson Prajwal Revanna released a purported video statement Monday apologising to his family for being incommunicado and announced he would appear before investigators at 10 am on May 31. \"I will cooperate with the investigation and respond to the charges. I have faith in judiciary and God. I am confident of emerging victorious from these false cases,\" the Hassan MP says in the three-minute video in Kannada. State home minister G Parameshwara said the Hassan MP could \"face arrest as soon as he lands here\" since warrants had been issued against him. Everyone claims they are not guilty... SIT , based on evidence, will say what they have to,state home minister G Parameshwara said. Prajwal says in the video that he “went into depression” and “isolated” himself after MP Rahul Gandhi and other Congress functionaries defamed him publicly. “I was watching a news channel on YouTube when I learnt (about the sex abuse allegations). After that, SIT also issued a notice. I sought a week’s time to respond to the SIT notice through my lawyers and X handle.” The suspended JD(S) functionary alleges that several people in his constituency conspired against him “as I was growing politically in Hassan”. “Looking at all these things, I was shocked; so I was a bit away. No one should mistake my absence for fleeing.” Prajwal, who is seeking re-election from Hassan, insists in the video that his trip was planned before the allegations surfaced. “There was no case against me at the time, and SIT was “not formed” either. Addressing his family and supporters, the son of former minister HD Revanna says, “I apologise to my parents, my grandfather, (uncle) Kumaraswamy and my party workers, and the people of the state. I have come before you to share information as I had (so far) not disclosed where I am abroad. Let the blessings of God, people, and my family be upon me. After arriving (in India), I will endeavour to put an end to all this. Have faith in me.” JD(S) patriarch Deve Gowda recently directed Prajwal to return to India and face the probe into allegations against him, while asserting there would be no interference from him or other family members. He said his grandson should be given the harshest punishment under the law, if found guilty. Congress govt in Karnataka wrote to Centre thrice, seeking revocation of Prajwal’s diplomatic passport. MEA then served him a show-cause.",

        "description": "The pauses come in the wake of the Ninth Court declining in January to rehear Berkeley’s ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first struck down by the court in April 2023.",
        "content": "Bay Area cities and counties are holding off on enforcing natural gas bans in new buildings following a recent federal ruling, a controversial move environmental groups worry will delay achieving key climate goals. The Sunnyvale City Council recently temporarily suspended its ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first adopted in 2022 to help cut Sunnyvale’s greenhouse emissions in half by the end of the decade. Recently, Cupertino announced the city will suspend its gas ban until this fall. In the East Bay, the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors earlier this month agreed to pause their all-electric building requirement and gas ban in unincorporated areas of the county. San Mateo County and San Luis Obispo also recently suspended their bans. The pauses come in the wake of the Ninth Court declining in January to rehear Berkeley’s ban on natural gas in new buildings, which was first struck down by the court in April 2023. A panel of judges ruled that Berkeley cannot prohibit natural gas due to a pre-existing federal energy law. Berkeley has since agreed to repeal the ban. The Ninth Court’s ruling doesn’t affect cities that have taken a building code-based approach to adopting natural gas bans — like Sunnyvale, Palo Alto and Mountain View — but those cities are also choosing to suspend bans to avoid possible litigation or other legal issues in the future. In 2019, the California Restaurant Association (CRA) sued Berkeley for implementing the gas ban claiming it was “passed with a disregard for available cooking technologies and ultimately for small businesses in the community that rely on gas-burning equipment for their cuisines.” But environmentalists say all-electric buildings — which have no natural gas or propane plumbing installed and use electricity as the sole source of energy for heating, cooking and other home appliances — are more affordable, energy-efficient and crucial for accomplishing California’s goal of achieving 100% zero-carbon energy by 2045. “Building electrification is a huge opportunity,” said Pamela Leonard, deputy director of marketing and communications for Silicon Valley Clean Energy. “There’s a climate benefit, of no longer polluting as you’re putting in new buildings that are going to last 50 to 100 years, but there is also a cost aspect — it costs more to build with gas.” Dashiell Leeds, conservation coordinator at the Sierra Club Loma Prieta Chapter, said using gas appliances contributes to poor air quality and exposes people to pollutants like nitrogen oxide. “Every new gas pipeline installed is a public health liability and step backward on climate change,” he said. “The more we can avoid the hazards of gas pipelines and gas appliances in new buildings, the better off we all are.” In the wake of the court decision, organizations like Silicon Valley Clean Energy, a Sunnyvale-based not-for-profit agency that provides clean electricity for 96% of residents and businesses across Santa Clara County, are looking for ways to encourage people to be eco-friendly. Zoe Elizabeth, deputy director of Decarbonization Programs and Policy at Silicon Valley Clean Energy, said more homeowners and housing markets are becoming aware of the benefits of electric buildings, and are choosing to use them without direction from local governments. Sunnyvale city spokesperson Jennifer Garnett said the city has other measures besides its suspended gas ban to encourage electric infrastructure, including allowing residential and commercial projects with all-electric designs to increase their floor area ratio. City staff will present the council with other ways to deter local builders from installing gas piping after six months. “We do not anticipate that this short pause will negatively affect our ability to meet our climate action targets,” Garnett said in a statement. “We’ll also continue to encourage all-electric adoption.” While cities and advocacy groups try to promote electric usage, some local business owners say they like gas better but are prepared to be flexible. “I enjoy cooking with gas more,” said Heirloom Chef co-owner and personal chef Erika Minkowsky. “I think there is more control with the temperature.” Heirloom is a personal chef service that caters mainly to the East Bay and San Fransisco region. The local chef team often uses their client’s gas and electric appliances to create meals. Still, Minkowsky said electrical appliances are better for the environment and supports using them, even if they take a while to get used to. “You can get used to anything if you practice enough,” she said. Claudio Bono, managing director for the Cupertino Hotel, also supports the idea of no-gas buildings but is concerned about the practicality of going all-electric. The building uses electricity to run appliances like laundry machines and gas for cooking in the kitchen. “If the switch was easy, we would love to have that,” Bono said. “But in a hybrid way, so if one thing falls we have another (power source) to sustain us operationally.”",

        "content": "Overwatch 2 devs indicated plans to buff Mercy in an upcoming patch and revealed that they’re listening to players about implementing a highly requested change for the support hero. Mercy has been one of the most popular heroes in Overwatch since the game’s release, with many players taking a liking to her kit. While not necessarily powerful offensively, Mercy’s healing, damage boost, and game-changing resurrection ability make her stand out from the rest of the cast through her utility. However, after , making it so dealing damage prevents enemies from receiving 20% of their healing, Mercy mains have been and believe their character needs some updating. In a in May, Hero Designer Alec Dawson explained the team is open to giving Mercy some love, especially with the DPS passive leaving some of Mercy’s healing on the weaker side. “I think we are more happy in the 20% DPS Passive world than the 15% (it cuts through a lot better, helps mitigate the healing more effectively) so Mercy is more worth a look when that world is permanent,” he said. Dawson also revealed that the team is currently taking a look at “how far” they can push Mercy’s movement, noting that it’s one of the “most requested changes” for the hero. Interestingly, the dev further added that Mercy remains one of the top-picked supports, especially on console, up until GM and Top 500 ranks. “Her performance follows a similar trend, where she’s in the top grouping for most ranks and remains above average at the highest ranks. Doesn’t mean that she won’t receive changes but that is where she is at currently,” Dawson explained. Although the dev provided no timeline for the buffs, he suggested a slew of changes to Reaper, Cassidy, and could be coming once Season 11 starts, so it’s possible that Mercy could be among the heroes getting an update in the coming weeks.

        "description": "Two days after the General Assembly was scheduled to adjourn its spring session, Democrats in the Illinois Senate advanced a $53.1 billion budget to the House Sunday night, where leaders expect it to pass without changes.",
        "content": "Two days after the was scheduled to adjourn its spring session, Democrats in the Illinois Senate advanced a $53.1 billion budget to the House Sunday night, where leaders expect it to pass without changes. The fiscal year 2025 spending plan, which came together over a stretch of late nights and closed-door dealmaking, spends $400 million more than what in his February budget address. Despite controlling the governor’s mansion and both chambers of the legislature, Democrats had a rocky time coming to an agreement, as evidenced during floor debate of the bill. In a rare move, a few Democrats publicly aired their disappointment with their party’s budget priorities before ultimately voting for it, while a pair of Democrats quietly voted no. “I wish this were a perfect budget,” lead budget negotiator Sen. Elgie Sims, D- , said before the vote. “I’ve been here many years and I have yet to see one. But...this budget is fair, it’s balanced, and it provides certainty for us investing in our future.” The budget, which is set to take effect on July 1, would increase spending by 5% from last year’s enacted budget, but just 1.6% when factoring in supplemental spending for the current year. It also reduced spending in several areas from ’s February budget proposal by a total of about $73 million, according to Sims, although Democrats did not provide a list of the cuts. The spending plan directs a $350 million increase for K-12 education and full funding for year two of Pritzker’s “Smart Start” plan aimed at adding 5,000 preschool seats across the state and providing workforce grants. The plan would send $198 million to the state’s “rainy day” fund and make the full pension payment required by law. The budget also includes a child tax credit for qualifying children under the age of 12, providing parents a credit of 20% of the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit in calendar year 2024 and 40% in 2025. That would come at a cost of $50 million in FY25 and $100 million the following year, up from the $12 million proposed by Pritzker. It includes the $182 million Pritzker committed months ago to provide shelter, health care and other services for recently arrived migrants, many of whom have been bused to the state from Texas. Two programs providing state-funded Medicaid-like benefits to noncitizens would receive $440 million from the General Revenue Fund, or $629 million total with other state funds. It’s an overall funding increase from what was allocated in this year’s budget, although the GRF commitment would be smaller in FY25. The spending plan on a 38-21 vote, with Democrats Patrick Joyce, D-Essex, and Suzy Glowiak-Hilton, D-Western Springs, joining Republicans in opposition. A third Democrat, Sen. Meg Loughran Cappel, D-Shorewood, later voted against a revenue bill that raised certain taxes. Republicans accused Pritzker of being driven by presidential aspirations and criticized him for growing state spending by about $13 billion since his first year in office in 2019. “But today, I’d like to say that Governor Pritzker is keeping his promise,” Sen. Sally Turner, R-Springfield, said during floor debate. “He’s keeping his promise to raise taxes on Illinois citizens by a billion dollars a year to fund the migrant crisis that he’s created.” But the GOP also criticized Democrats for underfunding state and federally mandated programs at K-12 schools by $135 million from what the state education board requested. And they panned the governor for allocating about 17% less than the current year to the Prisoner Review Board. “I’m a little confused,” Sims said during floor debate. “Because I couldn’t really understand if you want more spending or less.” Some Democrats also lamented that “finite resources” prohibited greater investments in youth-focused programing. “While I rise to acknowledge there are incredible things inside of this budget, many good things, I cannot – my conscience won’t allow me to sit in this seat and not lift up the fact that we have not gone far enough for a particular group, which are young, poor, Black people and Latinos,” Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, said. The budget includes a $1 per hour increase in wages for direct service professionals in community-based settings that serve individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Community Care Program workers who serve older adults who can’t live independently will see a rate increase as well. The budget anticipates $53.3 billion in revenue for the fiscal year that will begin on July 1, about $1.2 billion of which comes from various tax code changes. The revenue plan was part of why the spring legislative session went beyond Democrats’ May 24 self-imposed deadline written into the calendar months ago, as powerful Statehouse lobbying groups lined up against some of its components. But ultimately, it tracks closely with the governor’s proposal. “Every session I found has its own rhythm and each budget is its own beast. And this one was a doozy,” Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said just before the Senate adjourned. “There is no doubt about that.” It extends a cap on corporate net operating losses to generate $526 million and imposes a new graduated tax on sportsbooks, increasing it from the current 15% to a new range between 20 and 40%, which is estimated to generate $200 million next year. The tax rate on Illinois’ video gambling industry would also see a 1% increase, which goes toward infrastructure spending. Pritzker had also sought a $1,000 monthly cap on the “retailers’ discount,” which was included in the plan. The discount allows retailers to keep 1.75% of the sales tax they collect but capping it at $1,000 monthly would bring in $101 million for the state’s general fund. Third-party “re-renters” of hotel rooms will also be subject to the existing hotel tax under the plan. To appease retailers, lawmakers included a prohibition that bans financial institutions and credit card companies from charging fees on the sales tax portion of electronic transactions. The personal income tax was not affected by the law, as the approved budget didn’t decrease the standard deduction claimed by millions of Illinoisans, as Pritzker had proposed in February. The budget package also calls for transferring $150 million from the state’s Road Fund to public transit expenses, freeing up general funds for other purposes in a move that was opposed by the state’s road builders. The revenue proposal would also create a $5 million tax credit program for news outlets beginning in 2025 and claimable the following year, providing $15,000 per employee for certain newsrooms and another $10,000 for new hires. Another $50 million from the little-used Leaking Underground Storage Tank fund will be directed to public transit spending as well. the state’s 1% tax on grocery items as sought by Pritzker – a tax that benefits the state’s municipalities, rather than state government. Groups like the Illinois Municipal League pushed back against the repeal – though they supported the extra $85 million in revenue for local governments that would result from the retailers’ discount cap. The grocery tax repeal was also pushed back to Jan. 1, 2026, and the bill allows local governments to implement their own grocery taxes up to 1% without a referendum and without requiring state administrative fees. Municipalities with home rule authority would be allowed to increase their sales tax by up to 1% without a referendum. “Only in Springfield are we going to do a victory lap that really just reassigns the blame and responsibility to local municipalities and call it a tax cut,” Sen. Andrew Chesney, R-Freeport, said of the measure to increase local taxing authority. The House is slated to return as early as Tuesday to consider the spending plan and associated measures. In an interview after Sunday evening’s spending plan vote, Sims told reporters there was agreement between Democrats in the House and the Senate that there would be no further amendments. “So I would expect the bill that you just saw us vote on be the budget in the state of Illinois come July 1,” he said.",

        "description": "Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist on Memorial Day Parade and ceremony: \"These kind of gatherings give us a chance to remember and reflect, so I am proud to have my wife and youngest child out here to be in the community.\"",
        "content": "Clouds, puddles and a strong breeze greeted parade-goers on Monday during the Memorial Day Parade in Sterling Heights along Dodge Park Road. The cool temperatures — it was only 69 degrees when the procession left City Hall at 10 a.m. — likely were the cause of the diminished number of spectators who took up seats on the parade route down to Heritage Junior High School on 16 Mile Road. But that didn’t stop Todd and Allison Caruss from showing up. They came along with their daughter, Kayla, and family dog, Roxy, a five-year-old black Labrador who seemed to enjoy the snacks she received from those in the parade. “We were coming anyway,” Allison Caruss said of the rainy conditions that preceded the event. “We’ve come every year since we moved here. We just enjoy watching everyone in the parade, and we live on the other side of 16 (Mile), so we walk over and take it all in.” Now in its 45th year, the parade’s theme was “Salute to Service: Honoring Heroes & Innovations.” It featured military groups, service clubs, high school bands, elected officials, dance studios, towing companies, classic cars, and businesses. “It’s all about family,” said Macomb County Prosecutor Peter Lucido, who had relatives and volunteers join him walking behind a banana-yellow 2002 Ford Thunderbird convertible. Among the elected officials walking the route were Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist, Congressman John James, Sterling Heights Mayor Michael Taylor and members of the City Council, state representatives Nate Shannon of Sterling Heights and Thomas Kuhn of Troy, county commissioners Joe Romano and Don VanSyckel, and 41A District Court judges Annemarie Lepore, Douglas Shepherd, and Kimberly Wiegand. Gilchrist agreed that, regardless of the weather, he felt it was important to be in attendance. “These kind of gatherings give us a chance to remember and reflect, so I am proud to have my wife and youngest child out here to be in the community,” he said. “It’s important for us to mark this moment every year, it’s important for me to be present in the community and show our families of those have passed away during their service, but also for our veterans who are still here and still carry everything their service means to them on their shoulders and hearts. That’s why it’s important to me.” Before the parade, a ceremony honoring those who gave their lives in defense of the United States was held outside of City Hall. It featured remarks by dignitaries, music from the Motor City Blend Chorus, and a performance by the 1st Michigan Colonial Fife & Drum Corps, which are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year. Elsewhere in Macomb County, parades or solemn ceremonies were held Monday at Resurrection Cemetery in Clinton Township, and in Armada, Eastpointe, New Baltimore, Romeo, and Roseville.",

        "content": "Simon Cowell was the target of loud boos from the Britain's Got Talent crowd on Monday night, as he 'turned' on his own Golden Buzzer act Duo Stardust and gave them some negative feedback for their semi final performance. Just two days earlier, ITV viewers saw Simon 'break the rules' at the auditions, by hitting the Buzzer for the skating pair, who'd jetted over from Ukraine to try out for BGT. He cracked under pressure from the theatre audience to put Stardust through to the semi finals, having been massively impressed by their daring performance. However, he was far from their biggest cheerleader on Monday, with the other Britain's Got Talent judges stepping into defend them, as Simon took aim at Duo Stardust's semi final routine. The number saw then surrounded by dancers with flames, with Bruno Tonioli even roped in at the last minute to have a starring tole in the performance, as he was lifted in the air and spun round by the skaters. READ MORE: Britain's Got Talent ITV semi final backlash as viewers hit out at 'unfair' line-up Get all the latest TV and showbiz news and gossip from Chronicle Live with our free newsletter That happened in the final moment of the routine and, first to deliver his verdict, Simon first joked: \"That actually reminds me of the first night I met Bruno,\" before changing his jokey tone for a more serious one, as he then remarked: \"This was great, it wasn't as good as the audition though,\" with that comment alone prompting a chorus of boos from the capacity crowd inside the Hammersmith Apollo. Simon continued \"I'm disappointed and I'll tell you why. I think you let the production overshadow your talent tonight, which is a real shame.\" As the boos continued, he then added: \"And I'm saying this about an act I gave a Golden Buzzer to, but I can only say how I feel, which was that. We lost the focus of you.\"",

        "description": "(KTLA) -- The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health says a non-Los Angeles County resident with a confirmed case of measles had a connecting flight at LAX earlier this month. Now, officials are warning anyone who may have been at the airport on May 19 to check if they were exposed. The individual in question arrived at Gate 156 at Tom Bradley International Terminal on May 19 at 3:04 p.m. aboard Lufthansa flight LH452, which according to online flight tracking service FlightAware, is the airline’s Munich, Germany to Los Angeles route. After a five-hour layover, the traveler connected to Lufthansa flight LH7852 out of Terminal 7, Gate 82 around 8 p.m., the health department said. Flight LH7852 goes from LAX to Fresno; according to FlightAware, the route is operated by SkyWest Airlines as flight SKW5591. Massive fire at Oakland lumber warehouse under investigationThere are no other locations where possible exposures to this traveler may have occurred, public health department officials confirmed.“Individuals who were at LAX Tom Bradley International Terminal from approximately 3:04 p.m. to 9 p.m. may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to this traveler,” L.A. County Public Health officials said. Local health departments, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control, are notifying passengers assigned to specific seats that may have been exposed on LH452 on May 18-19 and LH7852 (SKW5591) on May 19. “Exposed individuals should confirm if they have been vaccinated against measles...if they have not had measles in the past and have not yet obtained the measles vaccine, they are at risk of contracting measles if they have been exposed,” L.A. County health officials said. “Unimmunized persons or those with unknown immunization status who were at this location during the date and time are at risk of developing measles from seven to 21 days after being exposed.” If potentially exposed victims do not show symptoms by 21 days after exposure – which would be June 9 – they are no longer at risk, the health department added. “Measles is spread by air and by direct contact even before you know you have it and can lead to severe disease,” Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County Health Officer, said. “Measles is highly contagious for those who are not immune to it...it can result in serious complications for young children and vulnerable adults.” According to public health officials, common measles symptoms include:High fever (higher than 101 degrees) Cough Runny nose Red and watery eyes Tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin Rash 3-5 days after other signs of illness; typically starts at the face and then spreads to the rest of the body Individuals who develop symptoms are urged to stay at home and avoid school, work and any large gatherings. Notify a healthcare provider immediately but do not enter any healthcare facility before calling them and making them aware of individuals’ exposure and symptoms, the health department said. Most health insurances cover the cost of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR); uninsured or underinsured children and adults can access free or low-cost vaccines at clinics enrolled in the Vaccines for Children and Vaccines for Adults programs.

        "content": "MUMBAI: The police team probing a woman's death in an accident involving a Sion Hospital doctor accessed a long CCTV video of the episode on Monday. It shows Dr Rajesh Dere speaking to a security guard pointing in the direction of Rubaida Shaikh (60) lying on the ground minutes before the accident and getting into his SUV. A few minutes later, he is seen starting the car and it runs over Shaikh. Police said they will review \"the new evidence.\" A source close to Dere, however, told TOI he waved at the guard who walked towards him to greet him. \"Dere was not pointing at the woman. He was waving back at the security guard. He hadn't seen the woman at any point before the vehicle went over.\" Dere, head of forensic medicine at the hospital, was arrested on Saturday for running over the woman Friday on the hospital premises. Police were informed about her death Saturday afternoon. In his initial statements, Dere claimed the woman had collapsed in front of his car. Police have booked him for negligence and rash driving. Cops have also invoked penal sections for providing false information. He was granted bail on Sunday. Cops said that they did not get access to the complete video until Monday. \"We will review the new evidence and inquire with BMC officials why the longer video, which includes minutes before the incident, was not shared with us earlier,\" said an officer. In the video, Dere is seen parking his car near the OPD block and walking inside, presumably to punch his attendance. On his way in, he exchanges greetings with a security personnel. \"A minute later, on his way out, Dere is again talking to the security personnel and drawing his attention to the woman on the ground, seemingly pointing towards her. The guard walks towards the woman and appears to speak with her before walking away. A minute later, Dere gets in his car and starts driving, at which point he runs over her,\" said a police officer.",

Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters Get the latest top news stories sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter We have more newsletters A kind-hearted vet has saved a dog that was about to be put down at the last minute after it was abandoned on the street by its careless owner. The pocket bully, named Pumpkin , was left tied to the gates of a council-run dog pound, where his life was soon about to end - but luckily an angel in disguise drove five hours to rescue him. After being looked after at the kennels for months Pumpkin was unexplainably and rapidly losing weight which the kennel staff 'suspected was cancer' and due to the cost of care, he was due to be euthanised. Luckily for Pumpkin, Vet Dr Sharon Williams, founder of Celandine Wood Animal Rescue (CWAR) was contacted and asked to take in the pup after saving another one in the past from the same kennels. Speaking to the ECHO she said: \"I phoned the woman and said yes, we can take Pumpkin. But she said, 'oh, you’re too late'. They’ve just sedated him and they’re now putting him to sleep.\" Sharon said she felt sick knowing she’d not been able to save him and explained: \"I’d been out cleaning my yard when I was text about saving Pumpkin. My heart sank, knowing that if I’d have just seen the text a few minutes before he would still be alive.\" But then Sharon’s phone rang again, and the vet told her \"We can’t find a vein\" and asked \"can you still take him?\" Sharon and a CWAR volunteer Paul jumped into her car and drove five hours to pick Pumpkin up. Sharon said: \"He had a little pumpkin-coloured jumper on him, which is where we got the name from, because he was actually called George. \"Although he was totally emaciated and looked tired, sad and ill, he wagged his tail when he saw us. You could just tell he just wanted to be loved.\" Under the care of Sharon, Pumkin had blood tests and a specialist ultrasound scan done which ruled out cancer. Suspecting he may have food allergies, she put him on a specialist hypoallergenic diet and he soon began putting on weight. Within weeks of the special diet, he was like a different dog. Sharon added: \"He was thriving and full of life.\" Get the latest news sent straight to your messages by joining our WhatsApp community today.

Sharon said Pumpkin has now been adopted by new owners who fell in love with him. Sharon said: \"One of our dog walkers took a shine to him, and she wanted to foster him, then she decided to keep him. His new owners take him for long hikes in the countryside, which he loves. He even has a wife, Ginny the miniature dachshund. He just loves people and is always happy when snuggled next to someone on the sofa.\" Sharon is now appealing for people’s help to grow the rescue. She said: \"We fundraise, but then with tests, medications and food, often one dog can cost thousands, and it wipes our funds out. \"We really need people who care about animals to help us so we can help them.\" To donate to CWAR, visit the GoFundMe here .

        "content": "Paris Saint-Germain finished the season with a domestic double after beating Lyon in Saturday’s French Cup final but will now start building for another assault on the Champions League next year, this time without Kylian Mbappe. The France captain brought the curtain down on his seven-year spell at PSG in the 2-1 win over Lyon, in which he failed to add to his club-record tally of 256 goals as Ousmane Dembele and Fabian Ruiz netted on the night. It was a deserved victory against a Lyon team who had been the best side in France in the second half of the season, after sitting bottom of the table in December. But PSG’s ongoing dominance of the French game simply reflects their crushing financial power compared to every other club. Going by the most recent detailed accounts published by the DNCG, the watchdog that oversees the finances of France’s professional clubs, PSG’s income in 2022/23 was roughly equivalent to that of the next five richest sides – Marseille, Lyon, Monaco, Rennes and Lille – put together. Their focus has long been on winning the Champions League, a trophy they have never managed to get their hands on over the years with Mbappe, Lionel Messi, Neymar, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and other superstars in their ranks. And coach Luis Enrique knows how big a task lies ahead as they look to build a team that can enjoy the Champions League success they never managed to achieve with Mbappe. “He is obviously a different player and we can’t replace him with one single player. Forget it. There is no substitute for Kylian Mbappe,” PSG’s Spanish coach said after Saturday’s final. “We will need to replace him with the team as a whole, and with maybe four, five or six new signings.” Whether PSG move for one big star – think Victor Osimhen or Rafael Leao – remains to be seen, but they may wish to avoid the kind of approach taken by Barcelona when they lost Neymar in 2017, or Tottenham Hotspur when they sold Gareth Bale to Real Madrid. Barcelona paid premium prices for several big names in an effort to replace the Brazilian, but most did not work out. Spurs employed something of a scattergun approach with a host of signings making up for the loss of Bale – again the success of that strategy was limited. “A great challenge for any player who might want to come here is that we want to make history,” Luis Enrique added. “This club will sooner or later win that long-desired Champions League title. It is difficult to win. It might take years but they will win it in the future without any doubt.” The Qatar-owned club are set to prepare for next season with a tour of China, where they will play Monaco in the French season-opening Champions Trophy in early August. The new Ligue 1 season begins on August 16, with the Champions League kicking off in mid-September. “This season is finishing but the negotiations and possibilities to improve the squad are already beginning,” said Luis Enrique, who will also rely on remaining stars such as Dembele, Achraf Hakimi, Portuguese midfielder Vitinha and teenage sensation Warren Zaire-Emery. “It is an impressive project when you consider what this club is capable of achieving,” added the coach before contemplating a summer break which he plans to spend at home, watching some of Euro 2024 on television. What of the rest of French football? Lyon will hope to build on their remarkable second half of the season under coach Pierre Sage, who is set to sign a new contract. Marseille are searching for a new coach after a poor season in which they failed to qualify for Europe, while Monaco and surprise package Brest are looking forward to Champions League campaigns. But the health of the league as a whole is uncertain, beyond the problems caused by PSG’s dominance. Ligue 1 still has no broadcast deal for next season, at a time when clubs continue to struggle financially in the wake of the collapse of a record contract with Spanish company Mediapro in 2020.",

        "description": "Gavin and Stacey star Mathew Horne has become a dad for the first time after secretly welcoming a son with his set designer wife Celina Bassili",
        "content": "A massive Gavin and Stacey star has become a dad for the first time ahead of this year’s highly anticipated Christmas Special. Mathew Horne , who plays Gavin on the hit BBC sitcom, was pictured pushing a pram through the streets of London over the Bank Holiday weekend as his wife Celina Bassili carried their son in her arms. Fiercely private Mathew has never publicly posted anything about his wife or son, as despite being a huge acting star and a household name for his appearances in Gavin and Stacey, The Catherine Tate Show and Bad Education to name a few, he has always preferred to keep his personal life out of the spotlight. But it is thought the 45-year-old actually became a dad shortly after he and Norwegian set designer Celina married in September 2021, so the lad could be nearly three already. And Mathew appeared to take fatherhood in his stride as he and Celina kept a low profile in casual outfits and shades as they enjoyed a stroll in the sunshine. Truth behind Gavin and Stacey stars James Corden and Mathew Horne's rumoured feud Mathew is best known for playing Gav in Gavin and Stacey ( Image: BBC/GS TV Productions Ltd/Tom Jackson) A source told The Sun , who obtained the photos: “Mathew is a brilliant dad and he and Celina love being parents. Celina’s brother has a son who is a similar age and they loved spending time together. Mathew kept the news quiet because he prefers to live his life out of the spotlight, even though he’s a household name thanks to Gavin and Stacey. All his Gavin and Stacey co-stars know about him being a dad, including James Corden and Joanna Page. They all have kids so you can imagine the talk on set for the Christmas special is going to centre a lot on their kids.” Fans were delighted when Gavin and Stacey creators James Cordon and Ruth Jones revealed they had secretly been working on a brand new episode – five years after the last one aired. Teasing fans earlier this month, both posed with a script that said: “Gavin and Stacey: the finale written by James Corden and Ruth Jones 2024.” Mathew and his wife Celisa Bassili married in 2021 and have now welcomed a son ( Image: Getty Images) Sharing the news with his six million followers, James – who went on to become a huge star in the US hosting The Late, Late Show and segments like Carpool Karaoke with famous stars – wrote: “Some news... It’s official!!! We have finished writing the last ever episode of Gavin and Stacey. See you on Christmas Day, BBC One. Love Ruth and James.” Filming is set to begin this summer with stars including Mathew (Gavin) and Joanna Page (Stacey) gearing up to take part, as well as Gavin’s parents played by Alison Steadman and Larry Lamb and Rob Brydon, who famously stars as Stacey’s Uncle Bryn. Last time viewers saw James (Smithy) and Nessa (Ruth), the show ended on a cliffhanger as Nessa, who shares ‘Neil the baby’ with Smithy, got down on one knee to propose. And fans will be dying to know if Smithy said yes and if there is set to be a Smithy and Nessa wedding. The 2019 Christmas special became the most-watched show in a decade after more than 18 million viewers tuned in. Since hearing the news another episode is on the way, fans haven’t been able to contain their excitement. Taking to X - formerly Twitter – they have already declared Christmas Day 2024 will be the best TV day. One said: \"Knowing there’s another gavin & stacey christmas special this year is what’s gonna get me through the year.\" Another echoed the same sentiment and wrote: \"Nothing this year is going to be able to beat the news of the return of Gavin & Stacey.\" A third added: “Just realised that this Christmas very well could see: New Gavin & Stacey Doctor Who Christmas Special & A New Wallace & Gromit That would be the best Christmas TV line up in recent memory.” Frankie Bridge fans obsessed with 'amazing' £45 linen River Island dress Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads Do you have a story to sell?

        "description": "Bill C-58 seeks to ban the use of replacement workers if there’s a strike in a federally regulated workplace, a key part of the Liberal-NDP supply-and-confidence agreement.",
        "content": "Canada’s legislation banning some replacement workers , known as the “anti-scab” bill, has cleared its final vote in the House of Commons. Bill C-58 seeks to ban the use of replacement workers if there’s a strike in a federally regulated workplace, a key part of the supply-and-confidence agreement between the Liberals and NDP. The bill was adopted in the House of Commons with 317 votes in support from all parties, and no opposing votes. It will now head to the Senate. “I think it is a real message to workers right across this country that they are valued and that parliamentarians have heard them, and that scab labour is wrong,” Labour Minister Seamus O’Reagan said following the bill’s passage. “So, this is a big moment for workers in this country. It’s a big moment for labour. And we’re thrilled that it passed unanimously.” Story continues below advertisement “We hope that not only will we make sure this is banned at the federal level, but we can inspire provinces and territories to put in place similar legislation so that we can, once and for all, ban scab workers at every level across this country,” NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said ahead of question period Monday, flanked by members of the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC). “That’s our ultimate goal.” Both British Columbia and Quebec have their own pieces of legislation banning the use of replacement workers on the books already.

Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. “You’re better to lead by example than necessarily hectoring provinces and territories. Best to show them that this works. And in fact, in B.C. and Quebec, it does work. So, we’ve learned an awful lot from those jurisdictions and it’s informed how we will go about this,” O’Reagan said. Even before the vote was officially tallied, leadership in the labour movement lauded the expected passage. “This is something that workers and their unions have been fighting for decades for. It’s incredibly important that we level the playing field at the bargaining table. And this legislation does exactly that,” CLC president Bea Bruske said Monday afternoon. Story continues below advertisement “The use of scabs really just drags out negotiations. And not only does it drag out negotiations, employers can decide that they will never actually get to a deal, that they’re just going to try to starve out their workforce.” At the same time, the Canadian Federation of Independent Businesses warned the move could have consequences, saying the legislation “tilts Canada’s labour laws even more heavily in favour of unions.” “If the legislation is passed and proclaimed, the current and future governments will deeply regret removing this important provision for employers keeping the economy moving during strikes or lockouts,” said Dan Kelly, president of the CFIB, in a statement. “Unions are already threatening a ‘summer of discontent,’ and what does the government and opposition do in response? They vote to make it worse.” Kelly added: “When work stoppages shut down essential services, such as federally regulated ports, railways and airports, it’s small businesses, their employees and Canadians who pay the price. CFIB is asking the Senate to provide the sober, second thought needed to seriously consider the implications this bill would have on Canada’s economy.” Trending Now 369 stolen vehicles from Ontario worth $33M recovered, many at Port of Montreal Space junk falling on Saskatchewan farmland prompts question: who’s liable? 1:33 ‘Summer of discontent’: PSAC blasts Trudeau government for change to in-office mandate Under this legislation, as part of job action both the employer and union would have to come to a “maintenance of services” agreement on what work could be done during a strike or lockout in the event an incident took place that threatens public or environmental health and safety. Story continues below advertisement If a union feels an employer is using replacement workers in a way that goes beyond this agreement, they can file a complaint with the Canada Industrial Relations Board. If the complaint is valid, the employer faces fines of up to $100,000 per day. In the 2021 election campaign, the Liberals committed to bringing in replacement worker legislation and it is also stated as a priority in Labour Minister Seamus O’Reagan’s mandate letter. Speaking on background, a government source says the maintenance of service clause is the key difference for the Liberals bringing this forward from past bills introduced by the NDP. At the time of its introduction, O’Reagan said he plans to implement the bill 18 months after its passage. However, the NDP introduced an amendment to speed up this timeline, and now the legislation is set to take effect 12 months after it is adopted. With this legislation applying to federally regulated workers, it covers a wide variety of workplaces including ports, airports, railways, telecommunications, broadcasting, banking and federal Crown corporations.",

        "content": "TORONTO — Canada's main stock index posted a small gain Monday, helped by strength in energy and industrial stocks. The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 52.51 points at 22,373.38. With U.S. stock markets closed for the Memorial Day holiday, things were relatively quiet north of the border since Wall Street has a lot of sway over Bay Street, said Les Stelmach, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Canada. In Canada, this week will bring earnings from major banks after TD kicked off the group last week. The bank reported lower profits for the quarter as it booked costs related to U.S. investigations into its anti-money laundering program. Investors will be looking for how much money the banks are setting aside for bad loans, said Stelmach. “I think bank earnings have been resilient through most economic cycles, but there's just a continuing theme about stress on the consumer, higher mortgage rates, rollover of mortgages, as we persist in this higher interest rate environment,” said Stelmach. “I don’t think you’ll see anything earth-shattering in the quarterly results,” he added. As has been the case in recent months, markets will be eyeing the banks’ outlooks for the rest of the year, said Stelmach, reflecting ongoing uncertainty after expectations for interest rate cuts have been rapidly dwindling as the year progresses. “Inflation is still a concern in the U.S. particularly, and so that might keep (the U.S. Federal Reserve) on the sidelines longer than people think,” he said. Heading into 2024, markets were pricing in about six rate cuts by the Fed this year, said Stelmach, but that's been pared back significantly. Now, many market watchers think it's possible that the central bank could cut just once in 2024, after a string of stronger-than-expected economic data has dampened hopes for lower rates. In Canada, the economic data is much more supportive of a rate cut, said Stelmach, but the Bank of Canada is in a tough spot because it doesn’t want to diverge too much from the Fed. Diverging too much could affect the Canadian dollar, he said, and put Canada in a difficult position if any economic surprises change the trajectory of rates in the U.S. or elsewhere. This week will also bring economic reports in the U.S. on consumer confidence, GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, which Stelmach said is another important indicator of inflation. “The U.S. economy more broadly has been stronger than people have expected it to be,” he said. The Canadian dollar traded for 73.34 cents US compared with 73.14 cents US on Friday. Commodity markets were also closed for the U.S. holiday.

        "content": "TORONTO — Canada's main stock index posted a small gain Monday, helped by strength in energy and industrial stocks. The S&P/TSX composite index closed up 52.51 points at 22,373.38. With U.S. stock markets closed for the Memorial Day holiday, things were relatively quiet north of the border since Wall Street has a lot of sway over Bay Street, said Les Stelmach, portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton Canada. In Canada, this week will bring earnings from major banks after TD kicked off the group last week. The bank reported lower profits for the quarter as it booked costs related to U.S. investigations into its anti-money laundering program. Investors will be looking for how much money the banks are setting aside for bad loans, said Stelmach. “I think bank earnings have been resilient through most economic cycles, but there's just a continuing theme about stress on the consumer, higher mortgage rates, rollover of mortgages, as we persist in this higher interest rate environment,” said Stelmach. “I don’t think you’ll see anything earth-shattering in the quarterly results,” he added. As has been the case in recent months, markets will be eyeing the banks’ outlooks for the rest of the year, said Stelmach, reflecting ongoing uncertainty after expectations for interest rate cuts have been rapidly dwindling as the year progresses. “Inflation is still a concern in the U.S. particularly, and so that might keep (the U.S. Federal Reserve) on the sidelines longer than people think,” he said. Heading into 2024, markets were pricing in about six rate cuts by the Fed this year, said Stelmach, but that's been pared back significantly. Now, many market watchers think it's possible that the central bank could cut just once in 2024, after a string of stronger-than-expected economic data has dampened hopes for lower rates. In Canada, the economic data is much more supportive of a rate cut, said Stelmach, but the Bank of Canada is in a tough spot because it doesn’t want to diverge too much from the Fed. Diverging too much could affect the Canadian dollar, he said, and put Canada in a difficult position if any economic surprises change the trajectory of rates in the U.S. or elsewhere. This week will also bring economic reports in the U.S. on consumer confidence, GDP and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, which Stelmach said is another important indicator of inflation. “The U.S. economy more broadly has been stronger than people have expected it to be,” he said. The Canadian dollar traded for 73.34 cents US compared with 73.14 cents US on Friday. Commodity markets were also closed for the U.S. holiday.

        "description": "\"We are not having the Met Gala,\" Senator Oluremi Tinubu scoffed.",
        "content": "In a bold address just weeks after Meghan Markle’s high-profile visit , Nigeria’s First Lady issued a stern warning to the nation’s women: Don’t lose yourself trying to emulate American celebrities. Senator Oluremi Tinubu, wife of President Bola Tinubu, didn’t hold back as she took aim at the pervasive influence of Hollywood’s risqué fashion trends . Speaking in Abuja to mark the first anniversary of her husband’s administration, Tinubu urged teenagers and young people to dress more modestly and reject the scantily-clad styles popularized by US stars. “We have to salvage our children,” she declared. “We see the way they dress. We are not having the Met Gala. And everyone, the nakedness, is just everywhere and the men are well-clothed.” She continued, “Tell them we don’t accept nakedness in our culture. That is not beautiful. It’s not beautiful at all.” While Tinubu didn’t explicitly criticize Meghan Markle, she referenced the Duchess’s recent visit to Nigeria where Markle emphasized her Nigerian roots , revealing she is 43% Nigerian according to a DNA test. “Why did Meghan come here looking for Africa? That is something we have to take home with [us]. We know who we are. Don’t lose who you are,” Tinubu stated. Markle and Prince Harry’s trip to Nigeria, intended to promote the Invictus Games, garnered mixed reactions. Some experts criticized Markle’s choice of expensive and revealing outfits, suggesting she could have shown “more modesty” in a country where just over half of the population are Muslim. One fashion expert noted that Markle “bared too much skin” and would likely have dressed more conservatively had the trip been organized by Buckingham Palace. During her speech, Tinubu emphasized Nigerian women’s beauty and urged them to be confident in their identity. “They’re all beautiful girls, but they should be confident in who they are,” she said. “We are fashionable, we see what is going on.” The First Lady also called on Nigerian women to become unifying forces in their homes and communities, promoting greater prosperity for the nation. “When mothers stand with you, the house is in order,” she asserted. “Looking ahead, we must endeavor to become the unifying force in our homes and our communities, to bring about greater prosperity for our nation.” The Sussexes’ three-day visit to Nigeria marked their first official trip to Africa since stepping down as working royals and relocating to California. Celebrating the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games, the couple received warm welcomes despite the controversy surrounding Markle’s wardrobe choices. Prince Harry praised Nigerian athletes, saying they represented their country extraordinarily at the last competition, winning medals and returning with smiles. The royal was moved by plans for a new Invictus Games center in Nigeria. At a reception hosted by Nigeria’s Chief of Defense Staff Christopher Musa, Harry expressed excitement over the upcoming facility in Abuja, aimed at assisting war veterans with rehabilitation. “Seeing the plans for the new Invictus Centre gives me goosebumps,” he said. The Duke and Duchess now reside in California with their children, Princess Lilibet and Prince Archie.",

        "content": "LOS ANGELES -- Mike Tyson suffered a medical issue Sunday during a flight from Miami to Los Angeles International Airport, a spokesperson for the boxing legend confirmed to ABC News. \"Thankfully Mr. Tyson is doing great. He became nauseous and dizzy due to an ulcer flare up 30 minutes before landing,\" the boxer's representative said in a statement. \"He is appreciative to the medical staff that were there to help him. \"However, it's false reporting that his medical attention caused the flight delay,\" the statement said. \"This two hour delay was due to air conditioning issue on the aircraft.\" American Airlines did not immediately respond to ABC7's request for comment. The incident, which was first reported by In Touch Weekly , comes as the 57-year-old Tyson is preparing for his planned summer fight in Texas with Jake Paul. On May 16, Tyson and Paul traded insults and expletives as they previewed the fight just a few football fields from the site of the planned July 20 bout, the 80,000-seat home of the Dallas Cowboys. Paul downplayed the suggestion that the 27-year-old social media star-turned-boxer still hasn't had a legitimate opponent, while Tyson simply refused to answer a question about his age. The former heavyweight champion will be 58 on July 20, when the fight is set for AT &T Stadium. Tyson retired in 2005, but most recently fought in an exhibition in November 2000 against Roy Jones at downtown L.A.'s Crypto.com Arena, which wouldn't declare it a pro fight. Tyson was mostly annoyed by the scene and the questions, including when asked what it meant to have a chance to fill AT &T Stadium. \"I was doing this years ago, so this is nothing new to me,\" said Tyson, who won 50 fights with 44 knockouts before retiring. \"This is new to this young boy over here.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "description": "The Michigan resident said that squatters did drugs in the backyard and brought \"beat up\" campers onto the property.",
        "content": "A Michigan man offered to pay $15,000 to tear down a nearby home occupied by squatters. A squatter is any individual who decides to inhabit a piece of land or a building in which they have no legal right to occupy, according to the American Apartment Owners Association. The squatter lives in the building or on the property they select without paying rent and without lawful documentation stating they own the property. Laws regarding squatters' rights are facing new scrutiny after property owners in several states found themselves embroiled in disputes, which sometimes turned violent, over people residing in their properties without their permission. Proponents of squatters' rights argue these laws prevent landlords from taking advantage of tenants. However, critics have argued the laws leave property owners with little remedy to deal with squatters. Demarko Smith, a resident of Dowagiac, Michigan, told Digital in an interview published Monday that he is offering to purchase a home to deal with squatters who have moved into a vacant property in his neighborhood. Smith's squatter situation began more than three years ago when his neighbor allowed a man and his friends to move into her backyard. The man, he told the outlet, brought in \"beat up\" campers and old appliances. Two years later, Smith's neighbor died. Her family was unable to take back the property due to squatter laws in the state, allowing the alleged squatters to take it over and making it more difficult to live next door to them, he said. They allegedly did drugs in the backyard, limiting the time Smith and his family could spend in their backyard due to the smell of drugs. He tried to build a fence around his property, but someone tore it down, he said. The bank was eventually able to evict the alleged squatters, but they moved to another home in the area that was listed for sale on websites like Zillow for more than $100,000 but had damage to the roof and wiring, he said. \"I'll offer them $15,000 for it. I just want to tear it down and have the property,\" Smith told the news outlet. reached out to Smith via message and the Dowagiac Police Department via email for comment. Stories like Smith's have drawn more attention to squatters' rights and prompted legislators across the U.S. to aimed at making it easier for homeowners to remove squatters. In April, the Biden administration to tackle the issue. \"My understanding is that this is obviously a local issue. We are certainly tracking that issue. The rights of property owners and renters must be protected, and we believe that ultimately, what needs to happen is the local government needs to make sure that they address this and they take action,\" White House press secretary said during a briefing in April. \"What I can say is that ultimately this is a local issue and it is critical that local governments take action to address it.\" Laws regarding squatters . Squatting is a crime in Michigan, but squatters do have some rights, like not being violently removed from a property. A first-time offense carries a penalty of up to 180 days in jail and up to a $5,000 fine.

        "content": "BRITAIN'S Got Talent fans have been left scratching their heads after one act appeared to return for the live semi-finals with 'new teeth'. Viewers of the ITV1 show are convinced the contestant had jetted off to Turkey for a new set of gnashers following her first audition. Taryn Charles, 39, made her BGT comeback for the first of this week's live semi-finals and was quick to show off her smile. The singer, who was one of judge Bruno Tonioli's Golden Buzzer acts, chatted to the cameras before belting out Teddy Swims' Lose Control. But watching at home, viewers were quick to point put Taryn's apparent bright new smile. One wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: \"Taryn’s teeth are looking a lot whiter this week!\" Another added: \"She's got new teeth!\" And a third joked: \"I wonder who paid for her Turkey teeth?\" Taryn first wowed Britain's Got Talent viewers by singing (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin for her initial audition. Judges Simon Cowell , Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon were impressed and gave her a standing ovation, but not as much as Bruno. The Italian star awarded music teacher Taryn the Golden Buzzer, which put her straight through to this week's live semi-finals. Taryn returned on Monday night and she looked a far cry from how she looked for her first audition. The singer had swapped her denim jumpsuit for a sophisticated black trouser suit and her hair had been styled into soft waves. Once again, Bruno was on his feet after listening to Taryn sing for a second time. Unfortunately, Taryn has found herself dragged into a 'fix' row since finding herself in the spotlight thanks to BGT. It came after it was revealed she had already appeared on another ITV singing show. Viewers recognised her from Starstruck, a singing contest where members of the public impersonate showbiz stars. Britain's Got Talent has been plagued with 'fix' rows over the years. How many of these do you remember? Jasmine Elcock - 2016: Teenage singer Jasmine Elcock stunned the nation with her version of Cher's Believe. But it then transpired she had already performed professionally in London's West End. Jasmine, 14, admitted: \"I’ve performed in Annie in the West End at about the age of nine or 10, but I really get nervous.\" IrShad Shaikh - 2017: BGT fans were left questioning the rule book when IrShad Shaikh auditioned. He got four red buzzers from the judges, which would usually mean an instant dismissal. Yet in a strange turn of events, they let him continue with his act...and put him through to the next round. Colin Thackery - 2019: Elderly war veteran Colin won BGT in 2019, but there was an outcry over the final. He warbled his place to win with a version of We'll Meet Again but fans were furious that escapologist Jonathan Goodwin didn't even rank in the top three. Viewers felt Jonathan - who almost suffocated while being buried alive in a gravel pit - should have won. Axel Blake - 2022: Comedian Axel Blake was given a Golden Buzzer in 2022 after making the judges laugh. But fans were fuming when they discovered Axel already had a show on worldwide streaming platform Amazon Prime. Despite this, Axel still went on to win the series. Loren Allred - 2022: The 2022 series of BGT was hit with another controversy when singer Loren Allred also received a Golden Buzzer. She performed Never Enough from the smash hit musical movie The Greatest Showman and got a standing ovation. It later transpired Loren was actually the original voice behind the track. Taryn Charles - 2024: Singer Taryn Charles is one of this year's hopefuls lucky enough to receive the Golden Buzzer. Bruno Tonilio put her straight through to the semi-finals following her performance of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman by Aretha Franklin , but it has now come to light that she is no stranger to TV. Viewers recognised Taryn from an episode of ITV1's Starstruck, where she impersonated Whitney Houston for judges Olly Murs, Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight . Olly Murs hosted the show with Sheridan Smith , Adam Lambert and Beverley Knight among the judges as ordinary people turned into Lady Gaga , Ariana Grande and Michael Buble among others. Taryn appeared as Whitney Houston and sang \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\" along with two other singers. But insiders told The Sun despite the acts taking multiple leaps at stardom, there is \"no unfair advantage\". \"The winner is crowned by the public vote,\" they said. \"It’s fair game, as all acts are voted for by the public. \"The show has never hidden the fact that auditions are open to everybody, irrespective of previous experience, and everybody is given the same opportunity on the show”. Taryn describes herself as a \"neurodivergent warrior\" on Instagram . Neurodivergence is an umbrella term that describes people whose brains develop or work differently to 'neurotypical' peoples' brains.",

        "description": "City council will decide at its next meeting if it will move forward with the first segment of the multi-phased civic esplanade project, which is now $6 million over budget.",
        "content": "City council will decide at its next meeting if it will move forward with the first segment of the multi-phased civic esplanade project, which is now $6 million over budget. Administration says that it will now cost $15 million to build the first phase, which includes an outdoor ice rink that can transition into a splash pad or water fountain in warmer months. Cost of ice rink phase of Civic Esplanade project balloons to $15M Windsor city council endorses plan for civic esplanade project Council was urged by staff to approve an increase to the $9.3-million budget on Monday but elected instead to defer the decision to its next meeting. West-end councillor Fabio Costante questioned why the report was a late addition to the agenda and after reviewing the report now says council should reconsider the project. \"As budgets increased considerably, facts have changed considerably and I think we need to have a thoughtful discussion and engage the public,\" said Costante. This concept drawing shows a design for the outdoor rink in front of city hall. (City of Windsor) Commissioner of community services Ray Mansour said that the approval process was rushed to council because key pieces of information related to the report were received last week. Mansour said that council needs to make a decision on the request as soon as possible if it wants to move forward with the rink in time for the upcoming winter. \"We needed it approved today to ensure that we have the opportunity to have the ice rink completed and ready for this season. This is the reason for rushing the report,\" said Mansour. \"It couldn't be deferred two weeks?\" replied Costante. \"For us to have the rink ready for the year, we wouldn't be able to delay it.\" Ray Mansour, commissioner of community services, responds to questions during a city council meeting. (Chris Ensing/CBC News) This outdoor rink would be built in front of City Hall and replace the rink that once operated at Charles Clark Square. Administration stated in its report that over a 14-year period, the number of weeks outdoor rinks can operate each year has dropped by three weeks on average because of climate change. \"Climate change has created different types of winters now where the actual timelines to use outdoor ice rinks have considerably shrunk,\" said Costante. \"You've got the timeline shrinking, the cost ballooning and you've got the substitute amenity, which is free ice skating (at city rinks), that I think will show has been proven popular and so with all that taking into account, we should reconsider this project, at least in the interim.\" Where the money would come from If council approved the recommendations in the report, the money would be pulled from three separate budgets. The biggest chunk at $3.2 million would be pulled from the 2025 Canada Community-Building Fund, which the city uses the bulk of to pay for road work and transit projects. The Corporate Inflation Mitigation budget would pay for $2.3 million and the remaining $576,055 would come from the Tourism Infrastructure, Development and Program fund. Mayor Drew Dilkens sees the project as a centrepiece of the civic esplanade, comparing it to the Campus Martius space in the core of Detroit. \"We understand that there are overages in capital budgets, which is why council approved a capital inflation project budget line item to be able to handle these things,\" said Dilkens, who called the inflationary amounts in municipal projects \"incredibly high.\" He said that this will be up to council to decide while noting that council has spent money on consultants and architects for the project. \"I hope we all want this to look very, very nice as the first investment into our civic esplanade and I'm sure it will hit the mark when it comes back.\" The item will head back to council at its next meeting.",

        "content": "Shania Twain is in the middle of her Come On Over tour, but the 58-year-old revealed on Monday that she is taking time off. Alongside a carousel of incredible photos taken on stage, Shania wrote: \"What a way to end the first leg of my Come On Over residency! Thank you to everyone for coming out and partying with us... Roll on August when we’re back for round two!!\" Shania has certainly left fans wanting more, with the collection of photos giving an insight into her sensational onstage outfits, with thigh-high boots, tiny shorts and cowboy hats a key component of her ensembles. Proving that she's as limber as ever, the 58-year-old performed a gravity-defying high-kick in one photo, with her slender leg high in the air – despite the fact she was wearing towering thigh-high platform boots. Another of her daring outfits saw Shania don a pink trench coat with matching silk lingerie underneath – perfect for her . A third outfit change saw the singer head back to her country roots, wearing a cowboy hat and glittering boots as she sits atop a saloon bar, strumming an acoustic guitar. In another outfit, Shania channels fellow country-turned-pop singer Taylor Swift in bejeweled boots that would look right at home on Taylor's Era's Tour. Taylor has spoken about how Shania inspired her move from country music to pop domination, so we bet she loves that her idol has taken inspiration from her in return. While she's performing, Shania makes sure to take good care of herself, sharing she follows a strict diet during her residency. \"I only drink fluids all day until after the show. I drink my food, so I blend my food. Lots of blended ­spinach and blueberries,\" she told The Sun. It's no surprise that Shania looks after herself given she had a which left her fearing for her voice. In her documentary, , she shared that in 2003 she was riding her house when she was bitten by a tick. \"The tick was infected with Lyme's Disease, and I did get Lyme's Disease and my symptoms were quite scary.\" The singer explained she experienced millisecond blackouts every 30 seconds, and while she recovered from these issues, she worried that her voice was never the same again. Shania eventually got her voice to a place where she felt comfortable enough to sing again, and a decade on, she took to the stage once more, signing up to do a Las Vegas residency in 2012 – she must have loved it, given she's in the midst of another one now!

The show that in addition to the 37 confirmed cases, there are also 16 suspected cases currently under investigation. Suspected cases of measles are tested in a laboratory, before being either officially confirmed as measles or denotified and several possible measles cases have been declassified in recent weeks. Six outbreaks have occurred so far in 2024, all of which occurred in private houses and involved between two and five cases in each outbreak. Of the 37 confirmed cases this year, 18 are male, 17 are female, and the gender has not been recorded for two cases. One case has been recorded within the 45-54 age group, and all the other cases are among people aged 34 and lower. Ten cases have been confirmed among those aged 25-34, four cases among those aged 20-24, and the other 22 cases are among people aged 1-19. Last Thursday, The Ryanair flight FR123 travelled to Ireland on 16 May at 8.10pm. The HSE said the alert relates to passengers and crew who were on board the aircraft, and those on the plane were asked to be “particularly vigilant for symptoms of measles for 21 days from exposure”. Measles is a highly infectious disease that can cause serious complications. Particularly vulnerable groups are children under one year of age, pregnant women, and people who are immunosuppressed. A measles infection tends to start with cold-like symptoms that develop about 10 days after a person is infected, followed a few days later by a rash. Symptoms include:",

        "content": "Goodful · Posted 17 minutes ago \"Pickleball Can Be Such A Mood Booster\": This Sport Has Some Major Health Benefits That You Should Know About A new study reveals that the popular sport may be more than just a fun workout. by Julia Ries HuffPost Contributor Link Facebook Pinterest Twitter Mail RichLegg via Getty Images By now, you’ve probably seen a headline or two (or 200) labeling pickleball the “ fastest-growing sport in the country .” Pickleball courts , clubs and leagues have popped up all over the country, and nearly 50 million people, or 19% of Americans, picked up a paddle last year, according to the Association of Pickleball Professionals . According to people who play, there are a ton of reasons why pickleball exploded in popularity: it’s fun and competitive. It’s a great way to make friends, plus it’s largely inclusive — people of all ages and skill levels can join in. But perhaps the biggest selling point for playing pickleball is how beneficial it can be for our mental health. A new report from Apple investigated the health benefits of pickleball using data gathered from Apple Watch users who opted into the study and found that playing pickleball is not only an impressive workout that can boost our cardiovascular and metabolic health, it’s also associated with lower rates of self-reported depression. Per the study, the self-reported scores of depressive symptoms were 60% lower among frequent pickleball players compared to the general group of study participants. Long story short: racket sports help people work out their body and their mind, making them one of the healthiest physical activities available. “The potential reasons for this observation could be attributed to a number of different reasons, including the sport’s impact on hormones, neuromuscular coordination, resilience and more,” principal investigator of the study Dr. Calum MacRae , a cardiologist and Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, told HuffPost. Why Pickleball Can Be A Powerful Mood Booster According to MacRae, sports, including pickleball, provide numerous physical and mental health benefits. When you participate in an aerobic activity like pickleball, your body releases endorphins , or hormones that relieve pain, reduce stress, and boost well-being. Playing pickleball is also a fun and efficient way of meeting the recommended guidance for physical activity (150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week). Physical activity is known to improve quality of life and promote healthy aging, especially in older adults, evidence consistently shows. And, as the Apple report revealed, pickleball games last roughly 90 minutes on average, helping you knock out half the amount of weekly physical activity needed in just one session. July Alcantara / Getty Images Pickleball also gives people the opportunity to stay connected with friends and family or develop new relationships. When people join leagues, for example, they might form a new sense of community and belonging. Plus, it’s inclusive: You can play with people of all ages, skill levels and backgrounds. “Humans thrive when we experience connection, and pickleball allows us to bond with one another through an activity that also physically makes us feel good,” said Emily Hemendinger , an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. It can also provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment. “Playing a sport, such as pickleball, can give people a goal to work towards, whether it’s winning a game, meeting people, or improving one’s skills,” Hemendinger said. Winning, in particular, can lead to a sense of pride and accomplishment, she added. Pickleball Keeps Your Brain Sharp, Too Another theory from MacRae as to why pickleball can be such a mood booster: playing pickleball outdoors may increase exposure to natural daylight. And the more natural light we’re exposed to, the better our sleep quality, activity levels, and overall quality of life are, research suggests. That’s not all. The game also requires people to pay attention and think quickly and strategically. If you get distracted, for example, you run the risk of getting hit in the face with the ball or letting down your partner. Physical activities that require strategic thinking promote cognitive functioning, which can help prevent cognitive decline . “Some studies have even found that sports like pickleball and racket sports can improve memory and processing speed,” Hemendinger said. In short: pickleball not only works out your body, it exercises your mind . Taking care of your brain through thinking and problem-solving activities can help decrease stress and anxiety. “Any type of mindful movement, especially with others, can improve mood and help your physical and mental health,” Hemendinger said. Visual Vic via Getty Images How To Start Playing Pickleball Landon Uetz , a physical therapist and pickleball instructor on TeachMe.To , said the pickleball community is very welcoming of new players. Before playing, it can be helpful to watch a video online to get a basic understanding of the rules. And if you’re hesitant about stepping onto a court — whether that be due to fear of not knowing the rules, getting hurt or failing — consider getting a lesson, Uetz said. Before you jump into a game, it’s worth warming up , either through dynamic stretching or movement exercises (think: jumping jacks, light jogging or lunges). When coming from a sedentary state — whether that’s at work, at home or after waking up — it’s important to increase circulation throughout your body. A warm-up loosens up your muscles, bones, ligaments and gets ready for activity, which can reduce the risk of pain or injury, Uetz said. Photodjo / Getty Images If you have any injuries, check in with a health care provider before you give pickleball a go. They may be able to provide some advice as to whether it’s safe for you to participate or if there are any modifications you can do during a game to protect from injury. According to Hemendinger, as with all things, moderation is key. “Doing any physical activity too much may lead to injury or exhaustion,” she said. Listen to your body — if certain muscles start to ache, consider ramping up more gradually. Instead of playing for two hours, for example, try to hit the ball around for 30 minutes, Uetz said. Even short bursts of activity can offer tremendous mental health benefits. “Whether it’s for 15 minutes or 90 minutes, getting out and moving your body mindfully and resetting your nervous system from a stressful day is a reliable stress reliever and coping skill,” Hemendinger said.

        "content": "Xavi Hernandez signed off as Barcelona coach with a 2-1 win at Sevilla on Sunday to close out the La Liga season, before warning his replacement the job “won’t be easy”. The Catalans, second, finish the campaign trophyless but were at least able to triumph in Xavi’s last match in charge after president Joan Laporta sacked him on Friday. Just weeks earlier, Barcelona announced Xavi was staying for next season after the coach said in January he had decided to resign in the summer. Appointed in November 2021, Xavi led Barcelona to the Spanish title last season, but this year his team finished 10 points behind champions and bitter rivals Real Madrid. German coach Hansi Flick is expected to be appointed as Xavi’s successor next week. Xavi warned of the struggle awaiting the next in line. “They should know that they’ve got a difficult situation, because Barca is a difficult club and there’s an adverse financial situation too – it won’t be easy at all,” he said. “I think the work we’ve done has not been valued enough given the adverse situation we came from. (Barca) were ninth in the table when we arrived, we finished second... (then) we won a double, and this year we weren’t up to the standard but because of four key games.” Barcelona lost both matches against Real Madrid in La Liga and against third-place neighbours Girona, as well as one other match to Villarreal. They ended on a positive note, with a victory at Sevilla’s Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan stadium.",

        "description": "DUP leader Gavin Robinson has backed calls for an agreed unionist candidate to run for Fermanagh-South Tyrone in the General Election, despite Doug Beattie saying it “cannot work”.",
        "content": "Mr Robinson called for the Ulster Unionist Party to . It comes after UUP chief Mr Beattie said yesterday that discussions for a joint candidate only took place on Friday and reiterated his stance in running Diana Armstrong for the seat. Meanwhile, on Sunday, , but suggested it would have to be a “non-party candidate” who does not take a “pro-protocol stance”. However, Mr Robinson said he has been “inundated with people” from across the constituency calling for a “non-party aligned pro-union candidate”. “The DUP has not contested this Westminster seat since 2005 despite being the largest party in the constituency,” he said. “Last week, when I became aware of people offering to run as a non-party candidate, I reached out to the UUP and TUV leaders to encourage them to follow our example and withdraw in favour of an agreed candidate. “Contrary to the UUP statement, the DUP engaged in discussions about an agreed unionist candidate in Fermanagh and South Tyrone last year, long before any election was called. “The people of Fermanagh and South Tyrone should know who was interested in returning a pro-Union voice to Westminster and those advancing selfish party interests, especially if there is a hung Parliament and Fermanagh and South Tyrone are once again left voiceless.” Mr Beattie said the Ulster Unionists came within 57 votes of winning the seat in 2019, adding that their candidate Ms Armstrong was selected to stand in the constituency four months ago. “Even with the boundary changes, Diana is the best chance of change in Fermanagh-South Tyrone,” he said. It comes as the TUV party officers were due to meet on Monday night to finalise candidates for the July 4 General Election, with an announcement imminent on the marginal East Belfast constituency seen as the most controversial. Alliance leader Naomi Long has confirmed she will be contesting the Westminster seat she won from Peter Robinson in 2010, before losing it in 2015 to the current DUP leader. The Justice Minister said in making the decision “there were a lot of variables I had to balance” but added that financial problems facing the Executive could be “tackled at Westminster”. “I will be continuing as Justice Minister. I think it would be very disruptive to the department for me to stand down and put someone else in.” Mr Robinson has held the seat since 2015, successfully fighting off an Alliance challenge in 2017 and again in 2019. However, the TUV did not field candidates in either election. They are expected to stand against the DUP leader, in protest against the deal to restore Stormont and implement post-Brexit arrangements. Mr Allister has ruled himself out of leaving his North Antrim constituency to stand for the marginal East Belfast seat. Sources say the TUV/Reform candidate in the election could be a non-party member selected as an agreed candidate. In 2019, Alliance increased their share of the vote from 36% in 2017 to 44.9%, with the DUP vote share dropping from a high of 55.8% to 49.2%. A ‘No Sea Border’ candidate would only need to take around 1,500 votes in order to jeopardise the DUP position. A TUV spokesman said the party officers were due to meet on Monday night to discuss candidate selection. They would then bring that to their party members before announcing it publicly. The party have already said they will not be fielding a candidate in North Down where they are backing independent MLA Alex Easton, who is trying to unseat Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry. The party may also stand aside in Fermanagh-South Tyrone for an agreed unionist candidate, where the current MP Sinn Fein’s Michelle Gildernew is not going forward and is instead standing in the EU elections in the Republic. The party are expected to agree a candidate for Lagan Valley, where the DUP’s Jonathan Buckley is standing in place of former MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, with a challenge from the Alliance Party’s Sorcha Eastwood. UUP MLA Robbie Butler ia also standing, splitting the unionist vote three ways.",

        "content": "Marcell Jacobs will be among the Italian athletes walking behind flag bearers Arianna Errigo and Gianmarco Tamberi at the Paris Games opening ceremony but he hopes successfully defending his 100m title could land him the honour in four years’ time. Jacobs, who became first Italian to win the men’s 100m in Tokyo and also won gold in the 4x100m relay, is set to compete at the World Athletics Continental Tour Gold meet in Ostrava today and the Oslo Diamond League two days later. Jacobs, who clocked a season’s best time of 10.07 seconds to win the 100m at the Roma Sprint Festival earlier this month, told Italian daily La Stampa that he would have loved to have carried the flag in Paris. “I would have been super happy, there was a lot of competition and Gimbo (Tamberi) is the captain of athletics, he has won everything, he is a motivator and he will certainly know how to play the role,” he said. “I will have to win again in Paris to put myself forward for Los Angeles 2028.” The 29-year-old has endured a series of injury issues since his Tokyo triumph in 2021. He split with long-time coach Paolo Camossi at the end of his 2023 season, the Italian now training under American coach Rana Reider in Jacksonville. “No Italian had ever reached an Olympic final in the 100 metres and to take our country where it had never been is crazy,” said Jacobs, who told the newspaper that one of his goals was still to go into space one day. “There, in the territory that the Americans identify as almost private property, where we saw (Usain) Bolt (dominate), it really is like ‘a space trip’. “I would really like to be able to see the Earth from the outside, the goal is concrete and remains.” Asked about the World Athletics’ (WA) plan to offer prize money to Olympic gold medallists in Paris and the criticism that it went against the Olympic spirit, Jacobs said it was right that athletes were getting the recognition they deserved. “Looking at it that way doesn’t work, then there are disciplines like tennis and football where you stay at a high level five or six years and you’re good forever, you and your children,” he said. “No, it’s right to give us the recognition we can, to grow up, I feel a different interest in athletics: the Netflix series dedicated to sprinters that is about to come out proves it.” Jacobs and Andre De Grasse, the reigning Olympic 200m champion, said they relished “sharing every moment” as they compete with each other during joint training sessions. The Florida-based group also includes American Trayvon Bromell and Japanese sprinter Abdul Hakim Sani Brown. “It’s amazing because in Rome I always worked alone,” Jacobs told reporters ahead of today’s Golden Spike meet in the eastern Czech city of Ostrava. “Now I am in a group so everything has changed... you have competition every day,” added the 29-year-old Olympic 100 metres and 4x100m relay champion. “For me it’s very important, working with Andre is a lot of fun, we can share every moment. I like it a lot,” Jacobs said. De Grasse, the reigning Olympic 200m champion and who took bronze behind Jacobs in the 100m, said he liked “to feed off the competition”. Jacobs “has come to Florida for five or six months, now I’m going to Italy where he’s at home to train with,” added the 29-year-old De Grasse, identifying himself as a spaghetti carbonara fan. They will be training in the central Italian town of Rieti. “Rome is not too far, it’s one of my favourite cities... and now it will be easier for me to go to competitions in Europe and not be too jetlagged and tired going into meets,” said De Grasse. Before the Olympic Games start in July, Jacobs is due to defend his European 100m title in Rome next month. De Grasse said he would be in the stands to cheer for his teammate. “I want to go. He told me he runs on Saturday so we won’t have training that day,” he added. Related Story Amir sends condolences to President of UAE UDST holds graduation ceremony for 861 students",

        "content": "As scattered showers have already made for a rainy Memorial Day in Hampton Roads, more bad weather is expected this evening. The National Weather Service at Wakefield issued a tornado watch Monday afternoon for parts of Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and the District of Columbia until 11 p.m. The tornado watch covers all of Hampton Roads and northeast North Carolina. Other locations impacted in Virginia include Richmond and Fredericksburg. NWS advises those under a tornado watch to choose a safe location and prepare to move quickly in case a warning is issued. A tornado watch means weather conditions could lead to the formation of a tornado, whereas a tornado warning means a tornado has been spotted or is about to occur. During a warning, people are advised to seek shelter in an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building and avoid windows. Scattered thunderstorms are also possible this evening. Allison Mitchell, a meteorologist with NWS, said hail and high winds are also possible threats. “As far as wind goes, we are looking at potential gusts of up to 70 miles per hour,” she said. “For hail, probably most quarter-inch sized, but there is potential for isolated incidents of ping pong size hail.” Mitchell said the weather in Hampton Roads is expected to clear up on Tuesday.

        "content": "EMMERDALE fans have been appalled by a recent storyline on the soap, and are now begging producers to bin it altogether after becoming frustrated while watching one character suffer. Tom King has been abusing his wife Belle Dingle, and things have escalated in recent weeks as he went from belittling her to all out violence. The tearful woman attempted to stand up for herself and kicked him out of the house after he brutally punched her , but Tom managed to worm his way back into her life. The vet soon convinced his wife she was the one really at fault as he began manipulating her to think she wasn't taking her medication. When he mocked the anniversary of her mother's death, Belle finally snapped and pushed him to the ground in front of other villagers, leaving him with scrapes and cuts. Horrified by herself, she called a mental health crisis team and ended up checking herself into an assessment centre overnight. In tonight's installment of the ITV soap the confused woman tried to make sense of what was happening between her and Tom, telling a crisis counsellor that the breakdown in their marriage was all her fault. She seems to have fallen for his gaslighting ways and kept insisting that her husband is her soulmate and she doesn't know why she tries to push him away. Viewers had been hoping that her time away from home would make her come to her senses, and were left frustrated to see that Belle is no closer to escaping from Tom's clutches. Emmerdale fans took to social media to complain about the drawn out storyline, with one asking: \"When are you going to get rid of that horrible man Tom? You don't realise how hard it is for someone with mental problems. He is a nasty person and does not make good watching.\" Another groaned: \"Hate this storyline. There is no way that Belle can be so naive and vulnerable given all that she’s been through. I’m so over Emmerdale . All the stories are miserable. Haven’t watched in 2 weeks and haven’t missed it a bit.\" A third begged: \"Please don’t prolong this storyline. It’s horrendous and Belle isn’t that stupid. You’re forcing her to be stupid.\" Things only went from bad to worse as Tom decided to take drastic measures to get Belle back home, fearing she would realise the extent of his abuse while receiving psychiatric care. He was shown threatening her dog Piper while preparing a syringe to inject the animal with. Horrified viewers made complaints to Ofcom , with some people who have been watching the soap for decades saying they will never turn it on again if he has killed the furball. One fan fumed: \"If Emmerdale shows piper dead tomorrow, and has detailed a healthy animal has been put down.. totally done with the soap, that's it! To screen such details tonight at 7.20pm with no on screen warning even thinking it wouldn't upset people bad mistake ITV.\" Another chimed in: \"Reported to Ofcom for showing this.\" A third chimed in: \"I agree as much as I love Emmerdale the whole story line in general has broke my heart but tonight’s episode went too far.\" Someone else warned: \"If Tom kills the poor cute dog I will never watch Emmerdale again. I have been a fan for over 40 years.\" A fifth blasted: \"This was really disgusting you’ve gone too far now, end this disgusting storyline.

        "content": "EMMERDALE fans have been appalled by a recent storyline on the soap, and are now begging producers to bin it altogether after becoming frustrated while watching one character suffer. Tom King has been abusing his wife Belle Dingle, and things have escalated in recent weeks as he went from belittling her to all out violence. 4 Emmerdale's Tom has been controlling Belle 4 She finally snapped and pushed Tom over earlier this week Credit: ITV 4 She checked herself into a psychiatric facility believing she was at fault Credit: ITV 4 This led to Tom's most sinister act yet Credit: ITV The tearful woman attempted to stand up for herself and kicked him out of the house after he brutally punched her , but Tom managed to worm his way back into her life. The vet soon convinced his wife she was the one really at fault as he began manipulating her to think she wasn't taking her medication. When he mocked the anniversary of her mother's death, Belle finally snapped and pushed him to the ground in front of other villagers, leaving him with scrapes and cuts. Horrified by herself, she called a mental health crisis team and ended up checking herself into an assessment centre overnight. In tonight's installment of the ITV soap the confused woman tried to make sense of what was happening between her and Tom, telling a crisis counsellor that the breakdown in their marriage was all her fault. She seems to have fallen for his gaslighting ways and kept insisting that her husband is her soulmate and she doesn't know why she tries to push him away. Viewers had been hoping that her time away from home would make her come to her senses, and were left frustrated to see that Belle is no closer to escaping from Tom's clutches. Emmerdale fans took to social media to complain about the drawn out storyline, with one asking: \"When are you going to get rid of that horrible man Tom? You don't realise how hard it is for someone with mental problems. He is a nasty person and does not make good watching.\" Most read in Soaps BALOGUN'S BACK Rangers star Leon Balogun signs new one-year contract GER HUNGARY Rangers 'in advanced talks' to sign winger who helped shock Real Madrid TOO FAR Inside Celtic star Greg Taylor's cup final spat with Rangers hero Todd Cantwell EUR ON Gers handed Champions League qualifying boost as Hearts discover Europa League fate Another groaned: \"Hate this storyline.

You’re forcing her to be stupid.\" Emmerdale's Belle finally escapes evil Tom Things only went from bad to worse as Tom decided to take drastic measures to get Belle back home, fearing she would realise the extent of his abuse while receiving psychiatric care. He was shown threatening her dog Piper while preparing a syringe to inject the animal with. Horrified viewers made complaints to Ofcom, with some people who have been watching the soap for decades saying they will never turn it on again if he has killed the furball. One fan fumed: \"If Emmerdale shows piper dead tomorrow, and has detailed a healthy animal has been put down.. totally done with the soap, that's it! To screen such details tonight at 7.20pm with no on screen warning even thinking it wouldn't upset people bad mistake ITV.\" Another chimed in: \"Reported to Ofcom for showing this.\" A third chimed in: \"I agree as much as I love Emmerdale the whole story line in general has broke my heart but tonight’s episode went too far.\" Read more on the Scottish Sun GO FISHING Inside Scots music legend's cottage with studio as it hits the market for £850k ISLE SAY Tiny Scots isle where only 15 people live offering rare job with accommodation Someone else warned: \"If Tom kills the poor cute dog I will never watch Emmerdale again.

        "description": "During the first day of an inquest into the 2015 death of her 14-year-old son, jurors heard from the boy's mother, Richelle Dubois.",
        "content": "Article content On the day he died, 14-year-old Haven Dubois asked his mother whether he could stay home from school. But Richelle Dubois decided her son needed to go because education is important, she told a jury of six on Monday as the first witness to testify at an inquest into her son’s death on May 20, 2015. “I sent him to school that day,” she said, struggling with emotions that would surface at times throughout the morning. Richelle could only speculate about why he wanted to stay home, testifying that she didn’t ask for an explanation and he didn’t elaborate. Later, Haven was found unresponsive in Pilot Butte Creek on the east end of Regina, and efforts to revive him failed. At the beginning of Monday’s proceeding at Royal Hotel Regina, coroner Brent Gough told those present that an effort would be made to select a jury comprised of three people with Indigenous ancestry and three people from the “general population.” When the jury had been selected, Gough instructed them that the proceeding is not a trial, but will seek to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death. Under questions from coroner’s councel Robin Ritter, the jury heard that Haven was in Grade 9 when he died. He’d only been attending F.W. Johnson Collegiate for a short time before his death, Richelle said, having told Ritter her son had previously attended two other schools during the same year. At the first school, she said, Haven told her he’d experienced pressure to participate in street gangs by getting into fights and wearing gang colours (often shown through the display of a coloured bandana). He was then moved to a private school, but later switched to F.W. Johnson because it was more convenient, Richelle told Ritter. The mother was asked whether she had conversations with her son about drug use, and she told Ritter that she and her son “had discussions.” “I did not come out and ask him if he was doing drugs,” she said. Richelle testified that, while she wasn’t aware her son was using drugs at the time, she now knows Haven used marijuana prior to his death. However, she said she’s unaware of how often he used the drug, or if he’d used it more than once. Ritter led her through the morning of the incident. Richelle testified that she’d been working when she was notified that some of her son’s possessions had been brought to her home by one of his friends and there was an uncertainty about Haven’s location. She described a frantic scene afterward that involved her calling the school in an effort to track down her son. As it happened, he was meant to be on a class field trip. After pressing the school, which had initially informed her Haven was at school, it was determined he was not on the field trip, she testified. Richelle spoke of speeding through the city to the school and then returning home on police advice. She became very emotional and asked for a break after describing how a police officer told her they would make an effort to track Haven’s cellphone. Her testimony had not concluded by press time. bharder@postmedia.com The Regina Leader-Post has created an Afternoon Headlines newsletter that can be delivered daily to your inbox so you are up to date with the most vital news of the day.

        "content": "Netanyahu admits 'tragic mistake' after Israeli strike in Rafah By Miriam Kuepper and Perkin Amalaraj Published: 16:23 EDT, 27 May 2024 | Updated: 16:24 EDT, 27 May 2024 e-mail Advertisement Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted 'tragic mistake' after an Israeli strike in Rafah has allegedly killed 45 people including displaced people who burned alive in tents. The Israeli Prime Minister said Jerusalem was investigating Sunday night's strike in which the IDF targeted a 'terrorist compound', killing senior Hamas officials Yassin Rabia and Khaled Nagar. Hamas claims the strike killed 45 people at a refugee centre by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees near Rafah, branding it a 'horrific massacre'. The IDF said earlier today that it was 'aware of reports indicating that as a result of the strike and fire that was ignited, several civilians in the area were harmed. The incident is under review.' The strike came two days after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to end its military offensive in Rafah, where more than half of Gaza 's population had sought shelter before Israel's recent incursion. The Palestinian Red Crescent said its ambulance crews transported 'a large number' of people killed and injured in the strikes. The Palestinian Authority presidency in the West Bank called it a 'heinous massacre', accusing Israeli forces of 'deliberately targeting' the tents of displaced people. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war's deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. 'We pulled out people who were in an unbearable state,' said Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the north-western neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan. 'We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal.' The Gaza Health Ministry said around half of the dead were women, children and older adults. On Monday, barefoot children poked at the blackened debris as searches continued. The Israeli military's top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur 'in a war of such scope and intensity'. Speaking to an Israeli lawyers' conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of 'violence, property crimes and looting' were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable the punishment is usually light. The attack, caught on tape by refugees on the ground, resulted in heavy destruction and flames last night. It left civilians reeling this morning, with photos showing Palestinians searching through burned out tents and makeshift camps for food. Israel's allies further condemned its methods of warfare in the region, with France saying it was 'outraged' by the violence. 'These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,' French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto said that bombings like the one in Rafah will have long-standing repercussions for Israel. 'Israel with this choice is spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren. I would have preferred another decision,' he told SKY TG24. Qatar , a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the strikes could 'complicate' talks. Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas's demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strikes. Egypt's Foreign Ministry described the strike on Tel al-Sultan as a 'new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law'. Jordan's Foreign Ministry called it a 'war crime '. The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said this morning as EU ministers met their Arab counterparts that a ruling made by a UN court for Israel to stop its invasion of Gaza immediately must be implemented. Borrell said today: 'We have to express not only respect, but to ask for the implementation of the decision of the court. This is really a dilemma how the international community can... force implementation of the decision.' He added that EU ministers were also set to discuss relaunching a mission suspended back in 2007 to monitor the crossing after calls for it to do so from regional players including Israel. The EU's top diplomat said he expected to get a preliminary mandate from ministers to press ahead with planning for the mission. 'But it's not only us who have to decide - the Egyptians, Palestinian Israelis,' he said. 'We need to increase the number of staff and we need to have an agreement with everybody involved.' Washington has also taken a tougher line with its close ally as outrage over the war and US support for Israel has become a major issue for President Joe Biden, seeking re-election in a battle against Donald Trump. The United Nations has warned of looming famine in besieged Gaza, where most hospitals are no longer functioning. Last Monday, the prosecutor at the ICC said he was seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his defence minister as well as for three top Hamas figures. And on Friday, the UN's International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt any operation in Rafah that could bring about 'the physical destruction' of the Palestinians. Hamas's armed wing said Sunday that it targeted Tel Aviv 'with a large rocket barrage in response to the Zionist massacres against civilians'. 'Hamas launched these rockets from near two mosques in Rafah,' Israeli military spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said. The salvo sent people scrambling for shelter but there were no reports of injuries. Israel's army said Sunday at least eight rockets were fired towards central areas of the country from Rafah, with strikes targeting the commercial hub of Tel Aviv for the first time in months. Fighting has recently centred on Rafah, where Israel's military launched a ground operation in early May despite widespread opposition over concerns for civilians sheltering there. Netanyahu vowed to pursue Israel's offensive ahead of a war cabinet meeting amid intense diplomacy to forge a truce and a hostage-release deal. He has long rejected Hamas's demand for a permanent end to the conflict triggered by the Palestinian militant group's October 7 attack. A senior Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the war cabinet would 'discuss a hostage release deal' on Sunday. Before the meeting, Netanyahu's office said Hamas's chief in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, 'continues to demand the end of the war, the withdrawal of the IDF from the Gaza Strip and leaving Hamas in place, so that it will be able to carry out the atrocities of October 7 again and again'. 'Prime Minister Netanyahu strongly opposes this,' a statement said. EU members Ireland and Spain, and also Norway, have said they will recognise a Palestinian state from Tuesday, drawing furious Israeli condemnation. 'In order to make peace, we need a strong Palestinian Authority, not a weaker one,' said the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who met in Brussels with Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa. Mustafa, whose government is based in the occupied West Bank, said the 'first priority' was to support the people in Gaza, especially through a ceasefire, and then 'rebuilding the institutions of the Palestinian Authority' in the territory after Hamas seized it from the PA in 2007. The Israeli official had said Saturday that 'there is an intention to renew these talks this week' after negotiations involving US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators stalled in early May. Around 80 per cent of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. Hamas triggered the war with its October 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Militants also took 252 hostages, 121 of whom remain in Gaza, including 37 the army says are dead. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 35,984 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry. As the war grinds on, the families of hostages still held by militants have piled pressure on Netanyahu to secure a deal to free them. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel must take over Rafah to eliminate Hamas' remaining battalions and achieve 'total victory' over the militants, who recently regrouped in other parts of Gaza where the military has operated.

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Leicester City have granted Chelsea formal permission to engage in discussions with their manager, Enzo Maresca, over the vacant head coach role at Stamford Bridge. This move comes after Chelsea identified the Italian as their leading candidate to succeed Mauricio Pochettino. On Monday, Chelsea made an official approach to Leicester, and they are now poised to hold talks with the 44-year-old manager. The discussions are expected to result in a contract spanning a minimum of five years. Leicester will receive compensation for the impending move, which is anticipated to be completed this week. Maresca joined Leicester ahead of the 2023/2024 season and promptly guided them to the Championship title, ensuring their return to the English Premier League at the first attempt. Other candidates considered for the Chelsea job included Kieran McKenna, who led Ipswich Town to promotion, and Thomas Frank, whose work at Brentford drew admiration. Chelsea initiated their search for a new head coach after the club and Pochettino mutually agreed to part ways last week, following a review of the team’s performance. The process of identifying Pochettino’s replacement has been led by co-sporting directors Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, ultimately settling on former Manchester City assistant Maresca as their preferred option. Maresca’s credentials include working under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, where he was part of the backroom staff during the team’s treble-winning season in 2022/2023. He also worked alongside Manuel Pellegrini at West Ham United in 2018 and had a short stint with Parma in Italy’s second tier at the start of the 2021/2022 season. If the move materialises, Maresca will become the sixth manager since the Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital-led takeover of Chelsea in 2022.

        "description": "The president went to visit his daughter-in-law on Sunday night. She's expected to testify in the trial set for June 3.",
        "content": "President 's surprise visit to Hallie Biden's home has raised eyebrows among conservative observers who pointed out that she's expected to testify in 's federal trial in the coming weeks. Users on X, formerly , questioned why the president made a nighttime visit to his daughter-in-law's home in Delaware on Sunday, noting that his son is scheduled to stand trial on June 3. But the White House pushed back on those observations, saying that Joe made the visit because it was approaching the anniversary of . Hallie was married to Beau from 2002 until his death in 2015. She began dating Hunter in 2016 while Hunter was in the process of separating from his then-wife Kathleen Buhle. Hallie and Hunter's relationship ended in 2019. Asked if the president discussed the upcoming trial with Hallie during the visit, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told the , \"No. He visited her because of the approaching 9th anniversary of Beau's passing.\" But that didn't stop from casting suspicion about the visit. \"What's a little witness tampering between ex in-laws?\" conservative lawyer . \"What's the legal term for this? Joe Biden visits Hallie Biden days before she testifies in Hunter's gun trial,\" . , \"A FATHER'S LOVE KNOWS NO BOUNDS, RIGHT?\" Hallie dated Hunter at the time of and is expected to be one of a dozen witnesses to appear in the first of his two scheduled criminal trials. Hunter is also set to stand trial in Los Angeles in September on tax-related charges. The president's son was expected to take a plea deal last summer, but that agreement quickly fell apart in real time as his attorneys clashed with prosecutors over whether the deal would grant Hunter immunity in the future. He pleaded not guilty. \"Biden crime family boss uses presidential muscle to pressure witness: Joe Biden visits Hallie Biden days before she testifies in Hunter's gun trial,\" columnist . \"Nothing to see. Move along. Hey look, a flag that became the worst possible thing in the world about four days ago,\" . In the Delaware gun case, special counsel David Weiss alleges that Hunter unlawfully purchased and kept a Colt Cobra 388PL revolver for 11 days and falsely stated on a gun purchase form that he was not an unlawful drug user. Hunter has been very open about his struggle with addiction and acknowledged his addiction to crack cocaine during that period. The Delaware trial is expected to include testimony from both Hallie and Buhle. Court filings show that in November 2018, Hunter texted Hallie, \"I'm a liar and a thief and a blamer and a user and I'm delusional and an addict unlike beyond and above all other addicts that you know and I've ruined every relationship I've ever cherished.\" The special counsel's office is also expected to show materials including text messages between Hunter and his daughter, photos and videos of him smoking crack cocaine and receipts of money spent on \"various women.\" But some legal commentators believe those materials are only being used to embarrass the Biden family. \"Not sure what he is accomplishing by filing it publicly, other than perhaps prompting the witnesses to urge Biden to plead guilty,\" former U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade told Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

In the episode of the said program this Monday, Chelsea was interviewed for the first time by the King of Talk, Boy Abunda. During their conversation, Boy asked Chelsea if it was true that she had planned to back out of the competition before. Chelsea Manalo replied, “I was on the verge of quitting na po dahil we have to face it Tito Boy, medyo matagal ‘yung competition this time, inabot siya ng four months.” “Ako po, I came in here as an independent wala akong resources, I didn’t have much...financial...So darating talaga sa point na mauubos ka and I was almost there to quit but because of the people who supported me.” “Magastos siya kasi ako I come back and forth to Bulacan, so siguro ‘yung transportation, dress, the makeup, everything, you have to provide it on your own,” she added.

She said, “Meron naman pong kakaunting naibibigay sa akin ‘yun po ‘yung pinagsasama-sama na lang namin just so that we can have a little food para lang maitawid ko ‘yung outfits ko.

Among those who helped her were her glam team, the local government of Bulacan, private individuals, and her parents. “Actually sila ‘yung nag-support sa akin when I almost gave up, they were there to support me.

        "content": "JENNIFER Aniston has shown off her fit figure in a new promotional ad for her favorite fitness brand, Pvolve. The Friends star got involved with the brand in 2023 which combines low-impact functional fitness with resistance-based equipment. In an ad posted on Instagram , Jen , 55, used a few exercise products in front of a brown background. The Morning Show actress rested one knee on a black padded exercise mat with her other leg stretched out while using an elastic band that hooked around her ankle. She leaned to one side while stretching her arm over her head while holding onto the other part of the band. The Just Go With It star looked onward while wearing a plunging white sports bra and high-waisted black leggings with white sneakers. \"Fitness, evolved,\" the ad read, \"Meet the innovative fitness method that will change the way you work out.\" The commercial encouraged users to check out the website and purchase the products. The A-list actress continued showing off her incredible abs to promote Pvolve. Earlier this month, Jen participated in a Spring challenge with the fitness brand. To introduce her challenge, the star showed off her fit figure in just a black sports bra and matching high-waisted leggings. She had a determined look on her face with half of her hair tied back and the other half resting on her chest. To cover up most of her top, she held onto a Pvolve exercise ball. In the comment section, fans sent nothing but praise to the star. \"Our powerful girl,\" one wrote. A second said, \"Body goals.\" \"I think it’s good to do something every single day, even if it’s just stretching, moving your body in some form, taking a walk, but a really good workout? Three to five times a week for me. \"Our biggest inspiration,\" stated someone else. \"This sounds fantastic,\" a fourth said, discussing the latest challenge. A few days earlier, Jen was featured in a video by Well+Good where she participated in a few exercises . The 55-year-old wore an all-black ensemble including a sports bra and skintight leggings to show off her stunning figure with her abs on full display. In the clip, Jen flaunted what her muscles were capable of including squats and leg lifts all while using a kettleball to add some more weight. \"What strength 'from the inside out' means to @jenniferaniston is not just focusing on superficial muscles like the six-pack, but instead working more internal layers of muscles, like the deep core,\" the brand's caption read. In a recent interview with Prevention , Jen discussed her fitness routine. \"I think I used to think ‘I have to work out every day,’\" she said. \"I think it’s good to do something every single day, even if it’s just stretching, moving your body in some form, taking a walk, but a really good workout? Three to five times a week for me.\" She also gave her advice to those wanting to start exercising, but having trouble staying motivated. \"If you’re struggling, if you find it hard, you can do anything for five minutes. Once you just get over that first hurdle of ‘I don’t want to’ it all kind of falls into place. I’m not a fitness guru. But that’s how I do it, if I’m really feeling unmotivated, say, ‘Just move at least for five minutes’ and then see where you could go.\"",

        "content": "THE US Postal Service has advised Americans to upgrade their mailboxes — and pay the price. USPS announced it wanted Americans to switch to wider, taller boxes to accommodate packages. Citing the rise of e-commerce giants like Amazon , USPS said people should “consider upgrading to one of the newer larger capacity boxes.” The push came as part of what the federal agency calls “ Mailbox Improvement Week .” This happens on the third week of May each year, USPS said. Postal officials said it’s meant to “encourage customers with box-on-post-delivery to examine and, where necessary, improve the appearance of their mailboxes.” Now, that includes replacing them with “jumbo” mailboxes. The broad boxes are available at many retailers, but some cost upwards of $100. Some options listed at Home Depot sell for around $60. USPS customers have taken issue with the request. One X user shared her frustration in a tweet. “The drivers are too lazy to walk packages to the doors,” she claimed. “Infuriating!” Others replied to a tweet about the jumbo mailboxes by CBS . “Is it because they don’t want to walk up to a front door?” they asked. “Just a wild guess.” “While we do that, can they deliver the regular mail consistently?” one quipped. Another said they simply did not want a new mailbox. “I don't want to go out and buy a new mailbox,” they said. “My small one is in good shape and will do just fine.” The Postal Service has suggested several spots to get a jumbo box. The Home Depot sells boxes ranging from $60 to $300. Budget Mailboxes is offering one for $129.95, with free shipping during the month of May. Lowe's has one for $89. Walmart's is $65.79. Prices can vary by location. See the USPS website for more places to buy jumbo boxes. The USPS has advised several other box changes during this Mailbox Improvement Week. The Service says these changes can help ensure smooth delivery. The USPS came under fire last month after announcing it would raise the price of a first-class stamp. An 8% price hike will be implemented in July. Last year, the service experienced an outage just before Christmas. USPS closes on some weekdays, including one this week .",

        "content": "Davis Riley shook off some early struggles to card an even par 70 and claim his second US PGA Tour title Sunday at the Charles Schwab Challenge, where honouring late colleague Grayson Murray gave him “a little extra to play for.” Riley, who started the day with a four-shot lead over world number one Scottie Scheffler, had three bogeys and three birdies to finish with a 14-under par total of 266 at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas. He finished five strokes in front of Scheffler and Keegan Bradley on a day when Murray was in the thoughts of all the golfers on the course a day after his death at the age of 30. Murray’s parents confirmed the two-time PGA Tour winner, who withdrew from the tournament late in Friday’s second round, had taken his own life. “Obviously super-sad day in the golf world,” Riley said. “My heart just goes to him and his family and there was definitely a little extra to play for today.” Riley said he’d expected a tough day playing alongside Scheffler, whose second Masters title in April was part of a run of four titles in five starts. After a bogey at the second he rolled in a 27-foot birdie at the fourth, but promptly bogeyed the fifth. But on a day when low scores were hard to come by, a birdie at the ninth saw him take a six-shot lead into the back nine, where he followed a bogey at 15 with a bogey at 17 on the way to adding another title to the one he claimed alongside Nick Hardy last year in the Zurich Classic two-man team event. “I knew coming into the into today it was going to be tough – a very tough golf course and when you’ve got the world number one breathing down your neck, you know it’s going to be difficult until the last hole. “So proud of the way I just stayed in it, fought some adversity early, just kind of hung in there and I played some really good golf coming down the stretch.” Scheffler had three bogeys before a pair of back-nine birdies saw him post a one-under 71 for 271. Bradley had five birdies in his three-under par 67, and had reached 10-under with a birdie at the 17th before he gave back a shot at the final hole. “My best round of the year probably,” said Bradley, whose six tour titles include the 2011 PGA Championship. He, too, played with a heavy heart, saying he was “heartbroken” to learn of Murray’s death. “I was thinking about him all day today,” Bradley said. “I had this pin on my hat. We’re such a family here and to walk into the locker room this morning and know he was in there two days earlier ...” Murray’s parents, Eric and Terry Murray, had asked golfers to wear ribbon pins in black and red to honour Murray, who wore the colours of his hometown NHL team, the Carolina Hurricanes, when competing on Sundays.",

        "content": "Toyota Gazoo Racing (TGR) World Rally Team (WRT) has taken home first place at the 2024 FIA World Rally Championship’s (WRC) Rally de Portugal after a thrilling battle across a series of fast, technical gravel stages. Sébastien Ogier’s performance alongside co-driver Vincent Landais, in the No. 17 Toyota GR YARIS Rally1 Hybrid Electric Vehicle, has resulted in a record-breaking sixth victory at the Rally de Portugal. Ogier now has more WRC victories in Rally de Portugal than any other driver, having matched Finnish legend Markku Alén’s tally of five wins back in 2017. TGR-WRT meanwhile has now won the last five editions of the event with four different drivers. Akio Toyoda, TGR-WRT Chairman, commented: “Seb, Vincent, congratulations on your two consecutive wins in Portugal! No matter how tough the gravel surface was, Seb was always calm. No matter how close and electrifying the competition was, Seb was always smiling to the fans. When something happened, he calmly informed the engineers about the situation and got back to the stages. Then he comes back to the finish line faster than anyone else. I am grateful to have such a “true professional” driver in our team. Seb, thank you again.” Toyoda added: This weekend the good thing which made me happy was that the team was calmer than before, whatever kind of problem they were facing. Many things happened during the weekend, but I heard everyone tried to stay calm and find a solution. It is nice to see the team grow. The team gets stronger as each member gets stronger, and as the team gets stronger, the Toyota GR YARIS Rally1 Hybrid Electric Vehicle will become ever better and stronger.” Just one second from the lead at the end of Day One, Ogier took over at the front on the morning of Day Two as others hit trouble and used all his experience to get through the longest day of the rally with an advantage of 11.9 seconds. He increased his margin with a storming foggy stage win on the morning of Day Three, allowing him to ultimately take victory by 7.9s. TGR-WRT is celebrating a double victory in Portugal after the first WRC2 win for the new Toyota GR Yaris Rally2 Hybrid Electric Vehicle on its gravel debut at this level. Over the years, Toyota has been participating in many different forms of motorsports, including Formula One, the World Endurance Championship (WEC), and the Nürburgring 24 Hours endurance race. Toyota’s participation in these events was overseen by separate entities within the company until April 2015, when Toyota established TGR, to consolidate all of its motorsports activities under one in-house brand. Representing Toyota’s belief that ‘the roads build the people, and the people build the cars,’ TGR highlights the role of motorsports as a fundamental pillar of Toyota’s commitment to making ‘ever-better’ cars. Harnessing years of experience gained under the extreme conditions of various motorsports events, TGR aims to forge new technologies and solutions that bring the freedom, adventure, and joy of driving to everyone. The sixth round of the 2024 FIA WRC is Rally Italia Sardegna (May 31 – June 2), known for its fast yet narrow gravel stages. High temperatures and abrasive surfaces throughout place significant stress on vehicles and tires.

The International Court of Justice in The Hague did in fact issue a strict decision against Israel but it didn't order a halt to the military operation in the southern Gaza Strip. Granted that the U.S. isn't satisfied with the Israel Defense Forces' operation in the city, but it's calming that Israel has managed, under threat, to evacuate about a million Palestinians from the city and there's still no American veto against entering it. But that hasn't spared another entanglement. In less than a day, dozens of Palestinian civilians were killed as a result of an Israeli airstrike and an Egyptian soldier was killed following exchanges of fire between an Israeli soldiers and the Egyptian army around the Rafah crossing area.",

        "content": "After a grueling three-setter against Karolina Muchova at the French Open last season, Aryna Sabalenka had yet again fallen at the semifinal hurdle on the Grand Slam stage. It was a frustrating afternoon which seemed to be turning into somewhat of an unwelcome pattern for the Belarusian. It marked her fifth Slam out of the last eight where she came just one match from the final. A year is a long time, though. Fast forward twelve months and she has doubled her Grand Slam tally in Melbourne and earned a runner’s-up medal at New York in the US Open . Her memories in Paris aren’t overly positive though. Last year’s semifinal was the first time in six attempts that she managed to get past Round 3. You sense though that the former World #1 has considerably grown in the last 18 months and is a different proposition to the player who used to struggle so greatly on the clay. Looking ahead to the tournament, she said on the official Roland Garros website , “I’m super happy to be back. I love playing here, and I had a couple of good results in Madrid and Rome. Feel quite confident going to Roland-Garros. I’m just super excited, as always, to start playing here. I’m focusing on myself, not own goals, but on things I have to improve and get better at so I have a chance against Iga on the clay court and especially here at Roland-Garros.“ Sabalenka has enjoyed a pretty solid clay court campaign up until now. She struggled in Stuggart losing early to Vondrousova. Although, with personal events of the court that could be understood. In Madrid, she came into her element gaining a pair of comeback wins against the in-form Danielle Collins (4-6 6-4 6-3) and Elena Rybakina (1-6 7-5 7-6). She would lose in the final to Iga Swiatek in all-time classic 7-5 4-6 7-6(7). Rome would be the real test, though. Due to the altitude of the Madrid courts, they play differently from the traditional red clay and aren’t representative of what to expect at Roland Garros. The Rome courts are a better gauge. She was excellent in Italy up until the final, losing just two sets overall against quality opponents such as Elina Svitolina, Jelena Ostapenko, and Collins. However, in the final Swiatek hammered her 6-2 6-3 proving on the clay the Pole has Sabalenka’s number. Now, we are at Roland Garros. Sabalenka’s draw is relatively fuss-free until the semifinal stage. Her probable line-up is Paula Badosa Round 3, Madison Keys Round 4, Maria Sakkari in the quarterfinal, Elena Rybakina in the semifinal, and Swiatek in the final. Up until Rybakina, you have to say that run suits her. The likes of Badosa, Keys, and Sakkari are all aggressive powerful players. They like to have time on the ball and strike it well and dictate on their own terms. Unlucky for them that’s also Sabalenka’s checkmate. We saw how Sabalenka struggled against Coco Gauff at last year’s US Open. The American played a more defensively tricky game, which ultimately frustrated Sabalenka. Elena Rybakina, of course, is the mouth-watering tie. This season they are one win apiece. However, with the fitness of the Kazakhstani unclear you would have to say Sabalenka goes into that one favorite. If she meets Swiatek that’s when it gets tough. Since winning in Madrid last season, she trails 5-1 in the previous six head-to-heads. Sabalenka’s power is unmatchable, but that becomes slightly muted on the clay courts in comparison to grass and hardcourt. Swiatek’s movement and counter-punching are the best we’ve seen in a long time and it’s that profile that Sabalenka often struggles against (see back to Coco Gauff). Sabalenka is definitely in with a shout of winning her first Roland Garros title. If Swiatek doesn’t manage, then she is the next favorite in my opinion. However, the World #1 seems invincible on the Paris clay , and it will take a massive effort and considerable improvement to knock her from her perch.

        "content": "May 27, (THEWILL) – Heartfelt words marked Anthony Martial’s farewell to Manchester United on Monday evening, as the French striker confirmed his departure after nine seasons at the club. The 28-year-old, who joined United from Monaco in 2015, expressed his “great emotion” at leaving Old Trafford, thanking the “best supporters in the world” for their “unwavering support”. Martial’s time at United was marked by both success and injury setbacks. He scored 90 goals across all competitions for the Red Devils, winning the FA Cup, League Cup, Europa League, and Community Shield. However, his final appearance for the club came in December’s three-goal home defeat against Bournemouth due to recurring injury concerns. Despite signing a new five-year deal in 2019, which included an option for United to extend his stay until June 2025, the club decided against exercising that clause. Martial’s struggles with form and fitness saw him score no more than 10 goals in a season since the 2019/2020 campaign, with just two goals in five starts across all competitions this term. The Frenchman spent the second half of the 2021/2022 season on loan at Sevilla, where he found the net only once. Martial, who has earned 30 caps for France, scoring twice, expressed his gratitude to Manchester United and the fans, stating: “This club has left its mark on my career and offered me an incredible opportunity to play in front of you.” Jude Obafemi is a versatile senior Correspondent at THEWILL Newspapers, excelling in sourcing, researching, and delivering sports news stories for both print and digital publications.",

        "content": "Go wild at the library this summer with Naperville Public Library’s Summer Reading Program! We invite you to celebrate conservation and sustainability with this year’s theme: “Read. Renew. Repeat.” Readers of all ages are encouraged to register for the program starting Saturday, June 1. You don’t need a library card to sign up — just hop over to your nearest library location or head to to start your summer reading adventure. The children’s Summer Reading Program is open to children from birth to fifth grade. This is a great opportunity for kids to continue to build and maintain their reading skills, even when school is not in session. Once registered online, children can pick up a Summer Reading Kit at the library, which will include a reading log and prizes for the first three levels of the program. Depending on the child’s age, they can win “turtle-y” cool prizes like an animal-themed toy, keychain or suncatcher craft! With the help of an adult, children can set their own daily reading goal. They can choose the number of pages, chapters, minutes or books they aspire to read each day, depending on their age and reading level. The program has four levels with 12 days of daily reading in each level. Once a child has completed a level, they can pick a prize from their Summer Reading Kit. Once they’ve filled their entire reading log, children can swing over to Naperville Public Library to pick out their final prize: a brand-new book to keep! They’ll also be entered into the grand prize giveaway for a Summer Reading Program prize basket. Adults and teens can create an online account to track their summer reading progress through the library’s online reading platform or pick up a print reading log from the library. Teens are encouraged to read at least 15 minutes a day throughout the summer. For every five hours they read, they’ll earn a prize. Any form of reading counts including audiobooks, graphic novels, eBooks, paperbacks and more. Roaring to read more? For every additional five hours of reading, teens can earn extra entries into our grand prize giveaway. Adults can also join in the fun this summer! The adult program is made up of three levels, which can be completed by reading three books per level. Adults and teens can both choose from a variety of prizes at the completion of each level. Sing, dance and celebrate summer with us at a Summer Kickoff Concert with Jim Gill! Known for songs like “Hands are for Clapping,” “Jumping and Counting” and “Silly Dance Contest,” Jim’s music is sure to have the whole family on their feet. Join us outside at the Wagner Family Pavilion near 95th Street Library at 6 p.m. Friday, June 7. For even more fun, check out our calendar to learn about other free library programs coming this summer. From a visit with Steve the Sloth and a rockin’ crocodile storytime to learning about mystic monsters during Cryptid Conservation Club, there’s something for everyone to enjoy!",

Ever since the elections came to Purvanchal, the people of the BJP are in shock. These people in the past were raising the slogan of ‘400 paar ‘ have forgotten this slogan ever since elections have come to Purvanchal. The region will deal the final blow to the BJP,” Mr. Yadav said in Chandauli, addressing a rally in support of the SP candidate Virendra Singh. In Chandauli, the SP candidate is locked in a tough contest with BJP nominee and Union Minister Mahendra Nath Pandey. The SP president added that the INDIA alliance would scrap the Agniveer scheme for the armed forces, and restore the old pension scheme. “Your vote is crucial. Not only will our party win, you will get employment, you (people) will get a permanent job in the Army, and the number of jobs will also increase, the old pension will be restored. Our youth, who wanted a permanent job, was given a half-hearted job as an Agniveer. After June 4, when the INDIA alliance government is formed, we will work to provide permanent jobs to the youth,” Mr. Yadav said. “The BJP government, which has been in power for the last 10 years, has been governing on the basis of loot and lies. They did not work. They wasted 10 years in the Centre and seven years in U.P.,” he said.

        "content": "The National Works Agency (NWA) has commenced work to rehabilitate sections of the Burnt Ground to Ramble and Mackfield to Ramble roads in Hanover at a cost of $36.5 million. This was disclosed by Community Relations Officer at the NWA's Western Office, Janel Ricketts, who indicated that the projects commenced last month and are expected to be completed by June. “The project involves extensive drainage improvement with the construction of a number of drains, including French, curb and channel drains. The work also includes the reshaping and resurfacing of the roadways using asphaltic concrete overlay,” she told JIS News. Ricketts said the current works follow the rehabilitation of another section of the Burnt Ground roadway at a cost of $17.8 million, noting that this formed phase one of programmed activities in the area. “The projects are being undertaken through the agency's Routine Road Maintenance Programme, and... will complement earlier works completed in February along another section of the Burnt Ground main road. This section of the roadway falls between the Shettlewood to Mackfield corridor, and in November of last year, work was started on that section of the road to include the removal of soft spots, reshaping sections of the roadway as well as the construction of additional drainage features,” she stated. Ricketts added that the corridor is an important one, which connects the parishes of Hanover and Westmoreland with St James, noting that citizens previously expressed dissatisfaction with the poor conditions along the corridor. “The government started from November [of last year] to upgrade particular sections of this corridor, and the works that are being undertaken now are an extension of that, in terms of having other areas along that particular stretch of roadway improved,” she further stated. - JIS News Follow The Gleaner on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram @JamaicaGleaner and on Facebook @GleanerJamaica.

        "content": "The sun may not have set on Kendall Jenner and Bad Bunny ’s relationship just yet. Earlier this month, photos showed the two getting awfully cozy at a 2024 Met Gala afterparty, giggling next to each other on a couch inside the crowded venue. And though some might’ve chalked the interaction up to a friendly reunion, new footage suggests they’re keen on spending more time together. On May 27, the celebrity news account Pop Base on X, formerly known as Twitter, posted a video of the 818 Tequila owner and the Puerto Rican rapper in Miami . The 14-second post featured Jenner, 28, and Bad Bunny, 30, walking alongside what appears to be a stage. In the clip, Jenner wears a grey sweatsuit, while the “I Like It” performer is clad in an unbuttoned short-sleeved white shirt and yellow shorts. The pair walked back and forth inside the Kaseya Center with the reality star hanging on Bad Bunny’s shoulders, wrapping her arm in his. Excited X users flocked to the comments section, musing about whether the pair could be rekindling their romance. “So the break up was lie?!” a perplexed fan questioned, while another confused user asked: “Are they dating?” One supporter wrote: “Good to see them again.” Amid the uncertainty and excitement, a few critics took to Pop Base’s post to slam the former couple’s connection. “Not with their shenanigans again,” one harsh user exclaimed. “This relationship made no noise lmfao,” another added, insinuating that Jenner and Bad Bunny’s previous relationship wasn’t anything special. According to a Daily Mail report , Jenner was present for two of Bad Bunny’s concerts at the Kaseya Center. What’s more, they were reportedly seen leaving a hotel together, dining at Gekko, the artist’s Japenese-inspired restaurant, on Friday, and eating together at Casadonna for lunch on Sunday. In December 2023, a source close to the pair told People magazine the two decided to part ways after about 10 months together. The international supermodel and music icon were first rumoured to be more than friends when they were spotted out at dinner with Hailey and Justin Bieber on 18 February 2023. A few months later, Jenner and Bad Bunny starred in Sabato de Sarno’s new Gucci campaign, Valigeria, resurfacing the brand’s emblem Savoy collection. Pictures and videos from the campaign shoot featured the duo gallivanting around the airport together with the luxury luggage.",

The calls come after the exclusive gentlemen's society The Garrick Club decided to change its 193-year-old men-only policy and allow women to join earlier this month. The Flyfishers' Club was established in 1884 and describes itself as a club for gentlemen interested in the art of fly fishing, with around 600 current members. It has a male-only guest policy, except in the case of events. But two keen fly fishing women have challenged the policy by publicly criticising it for being old fashioned. The Flyfishers' Club was established in 1884 and describes itself as a club for gentlemen interested in the art of fly fishing, with around 600 current members (stock photo) It is Britain's oldest fly-fishing club and even counts King Charles (pictured in 2021) as its patron King Charles is known to be a keen fisherman and took his sons on several fishing trips during the Royal Family's summer holidays in Scotland King Charles, then Prince of Wales, fishing with Prince Harry at Loch Muick on the Balmoral Estate during a family picnic in the summer of 1993 Marina Gibson, a fly fishing instructor and guide, and Lucy Mantle, the chairman and co-founder of the City Flickers fly fishing organisation, have called for the club to embrace change. Ms Gibson, who began fishing at the age of five and has written a book about her passion for fly fishing, said she would 'absolutely love' to join The Flyfishers' Club. She said during an event at the Hay Festival: 'I don't go to London that often but if I did, I would just love to go and sit and read a book and talk about fishing to other fishermen', according to The Telegraph . Ms Mantle posted an open letter to the club president on her Instagram which read: 'In light of the recent press reports on the Garrick Club, I thought the timing might be right to raise my concerns. 'I am of course aware that the club was founded in 1884 as a 'gentlemen's club for fly fishers', but it now seems increasingly anachronistic and archaic to continue to ban women given the vast societal changes that have occurred. 'There are many of us - both men and women - who view the policy as indefensible, unsustainable and, above all, unwise for a whole series of reasons.' Previous members of the club included author David Profumo, son of Sixties sex scandal Tory minister John, and TV's Loyd Grossman (stock image) King Charles fishing near Balmoral in Aberdeenshire in May, 1984 She said there was a widespread misconception that fly-fishing was for 'old fogeys' or wealthy, elderly men in the UK. She also said she was sceptical that the exclusion of women is the strongly-held position for the majority of members. In conclusion, she added: 'Most women anglers that I know have the exact same passion and knowledge of fly-fishing as many eminent current members. 'I am sure this issue has arisen on several previous occasions. But, as the Garrick experience has shown, it won't go away and momentum is building. Please help do the right thing. And yes, I would have liked to join.' Alastair Collett, president of the club, told The Telegraph the matter was under consideration and may be put to a membership vote. The matter was last discussed by the general committee in 2013 as members met on how it would deal with the Equality Act. The president of the club said the matter was under consideration and may be put to a membership vote King Charles, then the Prince of Wales, looks at a fishing magazine during a visit to Braunton in North Devon in 2012 But at the time it was not put to a vote and the men-only rule remained. Previous members of the club included author David Profumo, son of Sixties sex scandal Tory minister John, and TV's Loyd Grossman. King Charles is known to be a keen fisherman and took his sons on several fishing trips during the Royal Family's summer holidays in Scotland. The club has had several homes over its 140-year lifetime but is now based at the Savile Club in Mayfair. The row over The Flyfishers' Club membership rules is not the first issue around gender to raise its head in the fishing community recently. In 2020, the BBC Europe editor Katya Adler was ridiculed for referring to 'fisherpeople' rather than 'fishermen' during a package on Brexit talks. In 2020, the BBC Europe editor Katya Adler (pictured) was ridiculed for referring to 'fisherpeople' rather than 'fishermen' during a package on Brexit talks Critics at the time said people working in the industry on boats are overwhelmingly men, pointing to a study finding only 2.7 per cent are female. Piers Morgan railed against the use of the word and hit out at the BBC, saying on Good Morning Britain at the time: 'Here's the point, it's a rough old job, on the trawler boats on the rough high seas. 'I've never seen a woman on a trawler boat doing that.' Another row broke out last February when singer Sam Smith claimed they dreamed of becoming a 'fisher-them' on BBC's The One Show . The non-binary pop star, who uses the pronouns they/them, was asked about their fishing hobby before correcting a presenter who appeared to 'misgender' them by asking whether they would like to be a 'fly fisherman'. Ms Gibson said she was perfectly happy with the continued use of fishermen instead of fisherpeople.

The gentlemen's club landmark decision to admit women came after celebrity figures such as Stephen Fry and Sting threatened to quit the club unless the policy was changed. Top civil servant Simon Case and MI6 boss Sir Richard Moore resigned from the club after their names were published on a leaked list of members. The Garrick's 1,300 members, who include, King Charles, deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden and actor Hugh Bonneville, voted the change through with 60 per cent in favour in May.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport broke a traffic record on Thursday when 111,000 passengers, airlines crew and airport employees were screened at security checkpoints. The second busiest day followed on Friday when 109,960 people were screened, according to the TSA. With 104.6 million passengers, the Atlanta airport was the busiest in the world last year, according to Airports Council International. U.S. airlines expect to carry a record number of passengers this summer. Their trade group estimates that 271 million travelers will fly between June 1 and August 31, breaking the record of 255 million set last summer. AAA predicted this will be the busiest start-of-summer weekend in nearly 20 years, with 43.8 million people expected to roam at least 50 miles from home between Thursday and Monday — 38 million of them taking vehicles. The annual expression of wanderlust that accompanies the start of the summer travel season is happening at a time when Americans tell pollsters they are worried about the economy and the direction of the country. In what had long been celebrated every May 30 to honor America’s fallen soldiers, Memorial Day officially became a federal holiday in 1971, observed on the last Monday in May. Jason Redman, a retired Navy SEAL who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The Associated Press last year that he honors the friends he’s lost. Thirty names are tattooed on his arm “for every guy that I personally knew that died.”",

        "content": "TORONTO — Students and staff at a Toronto Jewish girls school that was the target of a shooting over the weekend are shaken but undeterred, the principal said Monday as police continue to investigate the incident. Rabbi Yaacov Vidal of the Bais Chaya Mushka Elementary School said some students were apprehensive about attending classes on Monday but everyone showed up. \"We are united, we're resilient, we're optimistic and we trust in God and we are not going to be deterred,\" Vidal said in a phone interview. Toronto police say two suspects fired shots at the school in the city's north end shortly before 5 a.m. Saturday. No one was injured, though there is damage to the building. Police have released video and images of a dark-coloured vehicle in which the suspects fled. Police say it's too early to say for sure if the shooting was hate-motivated, but politicians are condemning it as an antisemitic act. Members of the Jewish community, supporters and politicians gathered at the school Monday morning for a rally, with speakers calling for strength and solidarity. Daniel Held, chief program officer at the UJA Federation of Greater Toronto, said the rally was meant to show \"what it means to live with tolerance and peace and love for one another.\" \"(The shooting) was a deliberate attempt to spread fear across our entire Jewish community, to make us cower and hide who we are, but as you can see here today, the attackers completely failed,\" he said. \"We are more determined than ever to fight antisemitism wherever it happens.\" Vidal said the Bais Chaya Mushka school had never experienced an incident like this or vandalism in the past. \"We are in an industrial area. So that makes it a lot more shocking that they came to us,\" he said. \"It's not like we are in the heart of the Jewish community or anything like that.\" Vidal said the school is grateful for the funding it received through the federal government's security infrastructure program for communities at risk, which allowed for safety measures such as security film on the building's windows and a fenced perimeter. The fence was a \"huge deterrent,\" he said. \"(The gunmen) had to stand behind it, they could not enter the property. And we're grateful for that as well.\" Vidal said the school will be exploring other options to further beef up security in the aftermath of the shooting. In the meantime, he said students who are experiencing fear and anxiety are being encouraged to turn to their parents or a trusted adult. \"And if not, we are available – teachers, staff, myself – and we will definitely make sure that everyone gets the help that they need to cope with this kind of trauma,\" Vidal said. He said the school is also communicating with fearful parents, many of whom attended Monday morning's solidarity rally. Ontario Solicitor General Michael Kerzner was among the politicians who spoke at the rally. He said he is a third-generation Torontonian from a Jewish family, and that the city's Jewish community is not going anywhere. \"It's true, we are in a darker time,\" he said. \"It is true, we are subjected to unfortunate intimidation and acts of hate and antisemitism, which are completely unacceptable. And that's why we as a community must stand stronger now than ever, proud of our heritage proud of our culture.\" Ontario Education Minister Stephen Lecce called on everyone in the province and beyond to rally behind the Jewish community and stand up against hate. \"We stand together, we stand strong, because there is no bullet that can shatter our resolve as a country to stand up against this pernicious hate,\" he said. \"Our work will not end until every child in our province is able to go to school, and play in our streets without the fear of being attacked simply for being a Jew. The Canada we know and we love is a nation of people who come together for every faith and heritage.\" Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow said the students and teachers at the school deserve to be able to attend in safety. \"This is a place for a lot of joyous learning, with young children, and a place to deepen their understanding of the Jewish culture and faith, a place to learn math, science, history,\" she said. \"I came here to tell you you are not alone. We came to say that it's important that we come together.\" Vidal said he's thankful for the community's support and hopes incidents like this will serve as a reminder that the world needs more \"acts of goodness and kindness.\" Federal Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters Monday that the RCMP are \"working collaboratively\" with Toronto police on this investigation. \"I hope very much that the community in Toronto understands that they are bringing every law enforcement tool ... to hold those responsible for this hateful and violent crime to account,\" he said.

        "content": "Canadians feel both “optimism and concern” over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks, a new report says. The Leger study commissioned by Transport Canada found residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs) — drones’ larger, typically human-piloted cousins. Despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility’s potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services, the survey showed. Comfort with those three uses of the technology in urban areas hovered at around 80 per cent. Surveying, inspections _ of power lines, for example — and cargo shipment also had overwhelming support. Only transport of people, rather than things, notched below 50 per cent in favour. “If we are talking about emergencies, then it’s a no-brainer. We are going to save lives and put out fires. But when it comes to transportation, it’s a no,” one participant told the pollsters. Further concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impact and privacy tempered enthusiasm for the aerial vehicles. “The outlook on advanced air mobility (AAM) in Canada is a complex blend of optimism and concern,” the report stated. “Issues such as the safety and privacy risks associated with drone use, the environmental footprint of AAM operations and the readiness for autonomous functions are especially significant worries.” More than half of respondents had reservations around safety and potential crashes. Well over one-third pointed to security threats and privacy fears. And between a quarter and a third highlighted prices, noise pollution and the impact on the environment. The “cautious optimism” of respondents toward drones and eVTOLs underscores their perceived benefits, the authors concluded. “Yet it also sends a clear message about the necessity to tackle safety, environmental, and social issues.” In Canada, drones are deployed for tasks ranging from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions and wildfire detection. Meanwhile air taxis, long hyped as the next giant leap in short-haul passenger transport, are coming closer to being a public reality — even as skepticism lingers over their ability to change commuter behaviour and emissions output. In the U.S., electric air taxis will be cleared for the skies by 2028, according to a regulatory timeline laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration last July. Some manufacturers have 2025 as their target, such as Silicon Valley’s Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation. The whirly machines carry the promise of delivering people and goods across congested urban and suburban areas and between nearby cities. But headwinds around technology, regulation and investment remain, with Canada lagging behind some of its peers on policy. And whether aerial vehicles can move beyond a sleek slice of the ultrarich and the medical and cargo niches in the near term remains up in the air. Last week, Boeing Co. pledged $240 million toward a Montreal-area aerospace cluster that will include advanced air mobility research pertinent to its Whisk Aero subsidiary, which makes self-flying taxis. “The expertise here in autonomy is as good as, if not better than, pretty much everywhere else in the world,” said Boeing Global president Brendan Nelson in an interview, adding that certification is on the horizon. Despite ongoing innovation in Canada, more than three-quarters of respondents to the Leger survey had never heard of advanced air mobility. Awareness was higher among Canadians aged 18-34, those with a university diploma, men and Indigenous people and people of colour, the report found. The 99-page paper was based on two studies carried out between November and January, with a survey sample size of 2,717 participants as well as four focus groups. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

        "content": "ABUJA – The Foundation for Partnership Initiatives in the Niger Delta (PIND) says it’s collaboration with other stakeholders is leading to a sustainable peace in the Niger Delta region. Speaking after the release of the foundation’s annual report for 2023, PIND’s Executive Director, Tunji Idowu, said collaborative efforts of the organisation with other key players have led to equitable economic development. The annual report is titled “Advancing Frontiers for Greater Impact”. Idowu said about 100 service providers through the foundation’s market systems development project supported over 49,000 farmers with 46.35% of them being females. He said that collaborative efforts between farmers and MSME birthed a tremendous investment in the threshold of over N10 billion. According to him, despite the socioeconomic challenges, including rising inflation and foreign exchange rate fluctuations which affected purchasing power in the country, the foundation continued to exceed expectations in delivering on its mission to facilitate peace and equitable economic growth in the region. “I recall how together with our partners, [PIND] continued to find creative, people-centered ways to carry out our mission to facilitate peace and equitable economic growth in the Niger Delta. “Being a Niger-Delta-centric organisation, which started in 2010 we started out by giving out grants to other implementers, this has since evolved into a go-to resource, convener, and implementer of development programs and projects for other donors in the region. “We largely accomplished this through robust programs focused on community-driven, research-backed needs: prosperity and peace through economic growth and peacebuilding. “In 2023, PIND consolidated all the achievements from its previous and ongoing work in the Niger Delta while exploring new opportunities for improving livelihoods and ensuring lasting peace in a once conflict-ridden region,” Idowu said.",

        "content": "Cricket’s ability to grow its global presence beyond its heartlands, while still maintaining the quality at the highest level, will be tested over the coming month in the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the United States. The ninth edition of the tournament, in the fastest and most explosive form of the game, will be the biggest ever after the decision of the International Cricket Council (ICC) to expand the field from 16 nations to 20. It will also be the first ever major ICC event to be held, in part, in the United States, a country where attempts to grow the sport have consistently failed. Three American venues - in Florida, Texas and New York - will host 16 of the group stage games including the marquee match between India and Pakistan which will be played in Long Island, New York. The rest of the tournament will be held in the West Indies, including the Super Eight stage, the semi-finals and the final, which will be played at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados. While cricket is widely played at a recreational level in the United States, with strong presences in all three of the states that have been chosen for games, organisers are realistic about the chances of “converting” mainstream American sports fans. Instead, they expect that the large immigrant communities from cricket-loving backgrounds, including thousands of India fans in particular, will pack the stadiums. “I think, number one, we want to celebrate those that are already fanatical lovers of cricket. They deserve to see the best players in the world come into their backyard and have that chance,” T20 World Cup USA, Inc. chief executive Brett Jones told AFP. “Number two, I think it’s about spiking curiosity in the game,” he said. The ICC also sees the tournament as a launch pad towards the sport’s return to the Olympics for Los Angeles 2028, when the T20 format will be used. Major League Cricket, a T20 tournament, was launched last year and also stands to benefit from any growth in interest in the big-hitting, spectacular shortest form. But it is not only the American market that the ICC is focused upon - the expansion of the tournament has opened up opportunities for newer cricket nations to compete on the big stage. In recent years, the sport has been able to expand outside of its traditional strongholds with Ireland and Afghanistan earning places in the 12-strong elite with full Test status. But the ICC see the shortest format as the perfect vehicle for growing the game and this year’s edition will feature three T20 World Cup debutants in the USA, Canada and Uganda. Nepal, Papua New Guinea and Oman are among the other nations who are relatively new to the big stage and who will be looking to make their mark and grab some attention with an upset win. With the teams drawn in four groups of five teams, with just the top two advancing, none of the smaller nations are expected to progress beyond the group stage and there is a danger the pool stage could mainly be a ‘weeding out’ process. India favourites India, winners of the first edition in 2007, are the favourites, with their line-up packed with players steeled from the annual Indian Premier League. Veterans Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli could be playing in their final big tournament and are desperate to make up for defeat in the ODI World Cup final last year. Despite being the epicentre of the modern game, India have not won a major title since the 2013 Champions Trophy. Australia, winners of the ODI World Cup last year along with the World Test Championship, opted to leave out their veteran batsman Steve Smith but big-hitting David Warner with the bat and pacemen Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins provide plenty of experience. “There’s five, six or seven teams that can win it and we know that in tournament play it’s all about getting things right at the right time and winning in big moments,” said Australia captain Mitchell Marsh. Among those contenders, England are the defending champions, but will be without the star of their 2022 triumph Ben Stokes, with the all-rounder managing his fitness after a knee operation and they will look to skipper Jos Buttler to provide the fireworks with the bat. Co-hosts West Indies won the tournament in 2012 and 2016 and while the Caribbean team have struggled in the longer formats, they remain a threat in 20-over cricket and are hoping that they can benefit from familiarity with the surfaces in the region. South Africa, New Zealand and Pakistan will all fancy their chances of making an impact in a tournament which always produces surprises.

        "content": "Jos Buttler has left the England squad ahead of today’s Twenty20 international against Pakistan to be with his wife, who is about to give birth to the couple’s third child. The 33-year-old England captain struck a match-winning 84 as the hosts took a 1-0 lead in the rain-affected four-game series with a 23-run win in Birmingham on Saturday. But he is now set to miss today’s third T20 in Cardiff, with vice-captain Moeen Ali in line to lead England at Sophia Gardens instead. Ben Duckett could be brought in to open in Buttler’s absence or England could promote Will Jacks from No 3 after he made 37 off 23 balls against Pakistan at Birmingham’s Edgbaston ground. Surrey all-rounder Jacks recently returned from a stint in the T20 Indian Premier League, where he made a dashing unbeaten hundred to lead Royal Challengers Bengaluru to a nine-wicket win over Gujarat Titans. If he were to move up the order for England today, Jacks would be opening the batting alongside Phil Salt, a player he knows well from their time in franchise cricket. “I think we’re both very comfortable,” Jacks told Sky Sports. “Me and Phil have played a lot of cricket together - we’ve played franchise cricket together which definitely helps when we come to England. The 25-year-old added: “We understand each others’ games very well and we’re both that kind of free-flowing, top-order batters everyone has nowadays.” This series, which concludes at The Oval in London on Thursday, is serving as a warm-up for the T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the United States, with reigning champions England starting their title defence against Scotland in Barbados on June 4. Archer could be rested England fast bowler Jofra Archer could be rested for the Cardiff match ahead of the Oval finale. Archer has been beset by elbow injuries since his starring role in helping England win the 50-over World Cup in 2019. But the 29-year-old marked his long-awaited return to international cricket by taking two wickets at Edgbaston after a washed-out series opener in Leeds. Archer, on his first international appearance for 14 months, and first on home soil since 2020, bounced back from an expensive first over, which went for 15 runs, to finish with 2-28 as Pakistan were dismissed for 160. Fellow fast bowler Mark Wood is the most likely replacement for Archer but Jacks was pleased to see the Sussex paceman back in international action. “It’s great for all English fans, even cricket fans all over the world - everyone wants to see him (Archer) bowl,” Jacks said. “It’s been a while and to see him even come back from how he got hit in his first over is impressive. “He’s been bowling good speed in the nets, good speed in the middle, good yorkers at the death - he’s a massive asset for us and we love to have in him our team.” Related Story 2 Soldiers, 5 Militants killed in security operation in Northwest Pakistan PISQ signs MoU with Canadian college, university",

        "content": "Mitchell Starc dismissed fears the intense Indian heat might have drained him during his IPL-winning exploits, with the Australian declaring on Monday he was fit and ready for the T20 World Cup. The 34-year-old left-arm pace spearhead lived up to his record $2.98mn price tag with an opening burst of 2-14 to set up a third title triumph for the Kolkata Knight Riders against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday. At the end of the two-month tournament, largely played in relentless heatwave conditions, player-of-the-match Starc helped dismiss Hyderabad for 113 as Kolkata cruised to their target with 9.3 overs to spare in Chennai. “My body is fine,” Starc, who took 17 wickets in 13 matches, told reporters in a post-midnight news conference at the end of extended Kolkata team celebrations. “I’ve played enough cricket to manage that sort of thing. T20 is not as demanding as Test cricket. It’s been warm, it’s been humid, so that plays a part, but that’s fine,” he said. The T20 World Cup begins in the United States and the West Indies on Saturday, June 1, with Australia’s first match against Oman on June 6. “It will be cooler in the West Indies than it has been over here,” said Starc, who was also player of the match against the same opponents Hyderabad in the 44 Celsius heat of Ahmedabad last week. “I have thoroughly enjoyed this season, it’s been great,” he said. “It leads into a World Cup, so that’s the other side of the benefit of being here, against some amazing players in an amazing tournament. I look forward to being back next year.” Starc was less certain about playing in the next 50-over World Cup in 2027. “Moving forward, I am certainly closer to the end of my career than start, so one format may drop off,” Starc admitted. “It is a long time before the one-day World Cup,” he said, and was unsure “whether that format continues for me or not”. He also hinted that he might like to play more T20 leagues around the world. Over the last nine years, Starc said he had “prioritised Australian cricket”. He was looking forward, after the World Cup, to taking “time off, give my body a break and spend some time away from cricket with my wife.” Starc has taken 668 wickets in all three international formats after representing Australia in 89 Tests, 121 one-day internationals and 60 Twenty20 internationals. Starc does not expect batsmen to dominate in the World Cup. “I don’t see 270 (being scored) in the World Cup, just purely because you are one less batter without an impact player rule,” said Starc. “Time will tell. Batters have been brave in the powerplay, they’re striking the ball well. The wickets may not be the same in the West Indies, they may turn. Hopefully, the bowlers come into play a bit more than they have been through the IPL, but I am sure it will be an exciting World Cup.”",

        "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron has lifted the state of emergency in New Caledonia, aiming to foster political dialogue following recent unrest. The lifting of the state of emergency in New Caledonia, imposed after violent protests, aims to create a conducive environment for dialogue between pro-independence groups and local leaders. The unrest, sparked by and changes to voting lists, is testament to the ongoing tension between Indigenous Kanaks seeking independence and those favouring continued ties with France. Macron stated that lifting the state of emergency is \"the necessary condition for the opening of concrete and serious negotiations.\" Despite the end of the state of emergency, a curfew and bans on public gatherings, transport, and the sale of alcohol remain in place. The main international airport, La Tontouta, will stay closed to commercial traffic until 2 June. Security reinforcements are being sent, with 480 additional gendarmes arriving soon. As Macron pushes for dialogue, pro-independence leaders call for continued resistance against electoral reforms. The next steps involve negotiating between the French government and New Caledonia's various factions to address the underlying issues and find a peaceful resolution. Share 2 min read",

        "content": "Two police officers who broke rules when they surveilled a legislature member won’t face charges, even though there are reasonable grounds to believe they committed a crime, says the province’s law enforcement watchdog. In a letter to the lawyer for Lethbridge New Democrat MLA Shannon Phillips, the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team says the provincial prosecution service has declined to take the matter to court. “(The agency) determined that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two officers had committed criminal offences by accessing Ms. Phillips’ data,” reads the letter, dated May 17. “The investigative materials concerning two officers were forwarded to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether their test for prosecution was met. (The agency) received an opinion back that (the service’s) test for prosecution was not met and therefore these individuals will not be charged.” The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team has not yet filed its full report on the investigation. “(The agency) will soon be producing a public-facing report containing our investigative conclusions,” the letter says. In 2017, Phillips, who was then environment minister, was discussing a proposed new park with a constituent in a coffee shop and was overheard by Lethbridge officer Keon Woronuk. Woronuk, a local all-terrain-vehicle user, was concerned that what he heard might have an impact on his hobby. Woronuk subsequently posted photos of the meeting on a Facebook page under the name “Mike Corps,” which included identifying the stakeholders and a long caption criticizing Phillips and the NDP government. That prompted Phillips to complain to Calgary police, who found Woronuk had conducted an unauthorized database search. Calgary police then passed the investigation on to Medicine Hat police. Woronuk was later convicted of five counts of violating the Police Services Act. They included wrongly subjecting Phillips to a police database search, singling her and others out for traffic enforcement, misleading supervisors and using his position as an officer for political reasons. The other officer, Jason Carrier, also an off-road enthusiast, was convicted on two counts of the police act — being an accessory to Woronuk’s offences and failing to report them. In 2020, both men received temporary demotions. Woronuk was demoted for two years and Carrier for one year. Phillips appealed the sentences, but they were upheld. She has also filed a lawsuit against the Lethbridge Police Service. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024.",

A new canine-only airline called BARK Air is not only getting them out - but away. The dog-only airline made it's maiden flight from New York to Los Angeles on Thursday, May 23. According to its CEO Matt Meeker, the new airline will transport dogs of all sizes and their people 'in comfort and in style,' aiming for stress-free flights for both owners and pets. 'We cater everything to the dog, trying to lower their anxiety and their stress,' he explained in a press preview. 'It's a first-class experience for the dog, a business-class experience for people.' The dog-only airline made it's maiden flight from New York to Los Angeles on Thursday, May 23 According to its CEO Matt Meeker, the new airline will transport dogs of all sizes and their people 'in comfort and in style,' aiming for stress-free flights for both owners and pets BARK, the pet company founded in 2011, announced the launch of the dog-centered plane experience in April as a way 'to revolutionize flying for dogs.' The furry passengers fly better than most humans, with amenities on board including a lounge filled with treats and toys, speedy check-ins, and even an on-board spa for pups. The luxury aircraft can accommodate up to 14 people, however the airlines doesn't want to sell more than 10 tickets to make room for 10 dogs. At the moment, BARK Air offers routes between metro areas in New York City from White Plains Airport to Los Angeles's Van Nuys Airport. Internationally they fly to London's Biggin Hill Airport. The flight will set a pet and their human companion back $8,000 for a one-way international flight and $6,000 for a domestic trip. Children are not allowed to fly BARK Air and all human passengers must be at least 18 years old. However Meeker said the figures could change as the flights gained popularity.

'And that means serving as many routes as we can, making the costs more affordable, more attainable for every family or most families.' The airline is so far popular, with BARK Air receiving more than 15,000 requests for new destinations. They're now considering adding flights to Paris, Milan, Chicago, Seattle, and seasonal destinations in Florida and Arizona. 'We've got a long way to go, but this is step one,' the CEO pointed out. He added: 'Just to make it that everyone can travel with their entire family and not leave one behind.'

        "content": "NEW YORK — Nine months since his last time atop a big league mound, there is one thing about pitching Shohei Ohtani misses most. The nerves. “There’s a distinct nervousness on start days,” Ohtani said in Japanese on Monday , after updating reporters on the latest in his progression back from his second Tommy John surgery last year. “I think that’s the same for everyone,” he added. “There’s a nervousness. So if I have to say whether I miss it — I miss it.” For now, it’s a feeling Ohtani will have to continue to do without. In his first year with the Dodgers , he has faced plenty of other pressure over the season’s first couple of months. Dodgers The Dodgers’ three-game series against the New York Mets at Citi Field will now start with a doubleheader Tuesday after Monday’s game was postponed. As a hitter, Ohtani has thus far delivered on the expectations that came with his staggering $700 million offseason contract . Entering Monday, he was leading the majors in batting average (.336), the National League in slugging percentage (.621) and OPS (1.024), and was emerging as an early-season MVP frontrunner, with only teammate Mookie Betts holding shorter betting odds currently. Off the field, the two-way star has also navigated the gambling and theft scandal involving his former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara — a situation that remains a topic of questioning in Ohtani’s sporadic media availabilities. “I don’t think the mental side affects my play,” Ohtani said. “I think that as long as you have solid technique, you can hit regardless of your mental state. I want to separate that [off-the-field problems] from what I have to do on the field. In recent weeks, Ohtani has played through a couple minor injuries, too. Dodgers Shohei Ohtani is off to his best two-month start during his MLB career. A look at how he has managed to do it with great expectations and off-field distractions. May 18, 2024 Earlier this month, he was battling back tightness that forced him to miss one game. Then, last week, he was hit in the back of the leg by a pickoff throw at first base, resulting in a right hamstring contusion that has limited his ability to run full speed on the bases. Manager Dave Roberts said over the weekend that Ohtani is playing at about 90% physically right now, though Ohtani noted Monday that his hamstring is “getting better day by day” and hasn’t been impacting his swing. “I think the condition is improving,” Ohtani said. “I don’t feel my pivot foot has been affected much [in my swing].” Still, pitching has been the missing piece of Ohtani’s season so far, with the two-time MVP remaining limited to moderate-intensity catch play of about 60-70 throws every other day. Ohtani hit a milestone last week, clocking 80 mph in his flat-ground throwing drills from 60 feet. But, with Ohtani not expected to complete his recovery as a pitcher until next season, he said he’d “like to take [the progression] step by step, and take the next step without any feeling of panic.” There could, of course, be a silver lining to Ohtani’s inability to pitch this year. Entering the season, some Dodgers officials and industry evaluators believed that , as a designated hitter only, Ohtani could achieve even more production at the plate than he did during his final three seasons in Anaheim, when he was twice an MVP winner. So far, Ohtani’s hot start has given that dynamic increasing credence. The 29-year-old is not only holding career-highs in batting average, slugging percentage and OPS, but is also setting personal bests in underlying metrics such as average exit velocity (94.8 mph), hard-hit percentage (he is hitting 59.3% of his batted balls more than 95 mph) and strikeout rate (19.2%, by far a career low). Plus, he has become more of a stolen base threat, tied for eighth in the majors with 13 steals already. So, is Ohtani’s ability to devote more focus to just the offensive side of his game leading to better results? The player wasn’t ready to decide Monday. “Until I finish the season,” Ohtani said, “it’s something I can’t say.” When posed the same question last week, Roberts gave a more insightful answer. While the manager acknowledged his personal belief that Ohtani’s singular role has bolstered his performance, Roberts also emphasized the team’s plan to use Ohtani as a two-way player again next year. California Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has paid $7.85 million for a modern mansion in the foothill city of La Cañada Flintridge, real estate records show. May 22, 2024 “Hopefully, when he’s pitching next year, he can mirror somewhat what he’s doing offensively,” Roberts said. “But I think there’s something to just, the kind of focus on the one aspect of the game.” So far this season, that’s been fine for the Dodgers. Even without Ohtani on the mound, their starting rotation has been a strength, currently ranking eighth in the majors with a 3.54 ERA. Even with his thunderous bat in the lineup, their offense has been a bigger area of recent concern, going cold during the team’s current five-game losing streak and 7-9 slide in their last 16 games overall — a stretch in which they’ve averaged only 3.5 runs per game. Ohtani has been part of the problem lately, batting just .211 over his last 10 games. But given his gaudy overall numbers, his offensive impact on this year’s team remains monstrous. A return to pitching — and reacquaintance with the pre-start nerves Ohtani has come to miss this year — will have to continue to wait.",

        "content": "Las Vegas Raiders star edge-rusher Maxx Crosby has been assembling an impressive resume five years into his NFL career. However, that elusive First Team All-Pro designation continues to evade No. 98. Is 2024 the year he finally breaks through? Ever since Crosby’s memorable rookie campaign (10 sacks, 16 tackles for a loss, and four forced fumbles), the Eastern Michigan disciple has been on a tear. The three-time Pro Bowler is easily the face of the franchise now—general manager Tom Telesco reaffirmed that notion with his recent contract restructuring. The accolades are also piling up; Crosby has seen 2nd and 1st team designations from Pro Football Focus, Sporting News, and the Pro Football Writers of America. The one honor that’s not been bestowed upon “The Condor” is the AP’s 1st Team . He’s been in the Top 10 for sacks in the entire league the last two seasons, with 12.5 and 14.5, respectively. PFF has consistently graded him near the top of all defensive categories. For example, he’s had a grade of 90.0 or better each of the last three years. Missing out on the elusive title of First Team All-Pro isn’t due to a lack of effort. The numbers speak for themselves at this point. Recently, Bleacher Report validated this idea, identifying Crosby as one of six league players poised to take that next step. “With more financial security and a strong offseason under his belt, Crosby will be in the running to lead the league in sacks and finally break through as a first-team All-Pro superstar.” Adding Christian Wilkins could lead to a special year from Maxx Crosby Despite playing at a consistently high level, Crosby has largely done everything on his own. 2023 marked a turning point, however. The emergence of Malcolm Koonce, opposite Crosby, has given the Raiders a potential lethal duo in the edge position. Missing a true disruptive force inside has also hindered Crosby. Well, the Raiders finally addressed that when they splurged on free agency, signing Christian Wilkins to a four-year contract. With nine sacks (and 30 pressures, according to Pro Football Reference) to his credit last season in Miami, Wilkins could end up becoming the difference-maker that helps Crosby reach that next plateau—perhaps he’ll finally get the respect that many refuse to give him. Thoughts, Raider Nation? Is this the year that Maxx Crosby gets that elite award? This article first appeared on The Raider Ramble and was syndicated with permission.",

        "content": "TOWNSHIP OF ELBA, Wis. — Four teens are dead and another is in serious condition after a crash involving a pick-up truck and semi-tractor on a highway in Dodge County early Monday morning. According to a press release from the Dodge County Sheriff's Office (DCSO), the crash happened around 4 a.m. on State Highway 16/60 at the intersection of County Road TT in the township of Elba, about three miles east of Columbus. According to an initial investigation, a Ford F150 failed to stop at a stop sign on County Highway TT at State 16/60. That's when the DCSO says a semi-tractor without a trailer struck the car. Three of the five occupants in the Ford were pronounced dead at the scene, including a 17-year-old boy, and a 19-year-old man, the driver, both from Sun Prairie. A 16-year-old teen boy from Madison was also pronounced dead at the scene. An 18-year-old woman also a passenger of the Ford, later died at UW Hospital. Another 18-year-old woman, also a passenger of the Ford, was taken to UW Madison Hospital with life-threatening injuries. The driver of the semi-tractor, a 57-year-old man from La Farge Wisconsin, was taken to Prairie Ridge Hospital in Columbus with minor injuries. The crash remains under investigation by the County Sheriff’s Office Crash Investigation Team. Assisting at the scene was the Beaver Dam Paramedics, Columbus Fire Department, Life Star EMS, Dodge County Emergency Response Team, the Dodge County Medical Examiner’s Office, and the Dodge County Sheriff Chaplains. //",

        "content": "More than a third (35%) of registered South African voters feel no political party fully aligns with their views and opinions, market research company Ipsos said on Monday. It said this sentiment posed a significant challenge for voters as they grappled with their party choices in the upcoming national and provincial elections. Ipsos based its findings on the views of 2,545 registered voters. Interviews were conducted by trained Ipsos interviewers in the homes and home languages of respondents. Interviews were conducted from March 9 to April 15. A scientific process of multi-stage stratified random selection distributed interviews in all areas of the county, including deep rural areas. Ipsos said this methodology ensured the results were representative of the views of South Africans eligible to vote. Ipsos said while firm supporters of the three major political parties expressed high levels of trust in their own chosen parties, the broader South African populace exhibited low levels of trust in these same political parties. It found that 77% of ANC supporters, 82% of DA supporters and 81% of EFF supporters were likely to trust their own parties. Only 39% of South Africans registered to vote are likely to trust the ANC and only 25% each of voters were likely to trust the EFF and the DA. Ipsos found political leaders themselves garnered little confidence from the electorate. “When registered voters were asked to rate how they are performing as political leaders on the national scene on a scale of 1 to 10, only President Cyril Ramaphosa managed to secure a score slightly above the midpoint of 5.” Former president Jacob Zuma scored 3.7, DA leader John Steenhuisen 3.3, EFF leader Julius Malema Malema 3.5, ActionSA leader Herman Mashaba 3.2, IFP leader Velenkosini Hlabisa 3.1 and FF+ leader Pieter Groenewald 2.7. “However, a starkly contrasting picture emerges when considering the views of supporters aligned with each political leader's party. Among these partisan subgroups, evaluations of their respective leaders are markedly more favourable.” Supporters of the MK Party ranked Jacob Zuma 8, the same ranking that FF+ supporters gave its leader Groenewald, with ANC supporters ranking Ramaphosa 7.5, EFF supporters ranking Malema at 7.3, DA supporters ranking Steenhuisen at 6.7, IFP supporters giving Hlabisa 6.1 and ActionSA giving Mashaba 5.9. “As the nation approaches the upcoming elections, these findings underscore the complex dynamics at play, with a significant portion of the electorate feeling unrepresented and a clear divergence between the views of committed party supporters and the general public. “The outcome of the elections will likely hinge on how effectively parties and leaders can bridge this gap and appeal to the broader South African populace,” Ipsos said.

        "content": "Canadians feel both \"optimism and concern\" over the prospect of flying cars and drones whizzing between remote communities and above city blocks, a new report says. The Léger study commissioned by Transport Canada found residents hold a broadly positive attitude toward so-called advanced air mobility, which refers to both drones and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOLs) — drones' larger, typically human-piloted cousins. Despite limited knowledge of the futuristic transport mode, respondents liked advanced air mobility's potential for search and rescue, firefighting, medical use and other critical services, the survey showed. Comfort with those three uses of the technology in urban areas hovered at around 80 per cent. Surveying, inspections — of power lines, for example — and cargo shipment also had overwhelming support. Only transport of people, rather than things, notched below 50 per cent in favour. “If we are talking about emergencies, then it’s a no-brainer. We are going to save lives and put out fires. But when it comes to transportation, it’s a no,” one participant told the pollsters. Further concerns over safety, affordability, environmental impact and privacy tempered enthusiasm for the aerial vehicles. \"The outlook on advanced air mobility (AAM) in Canada is a complex blend of optimism and concern,\" the report stated. \"Issues such as the safety and privacy risks associated with drone use, the environmental footprint of AAM operations and the readiness for autonomous functions are especially significant worries.\" More than half of respondents had reservations around safety and potential crashes. Well over one-third pointed to security threats and privacy fears. And between a quarter and a third highlighted prices, noise pollution and the impact on the environment. The \"cautious optimism\" of respondents toward drones and eVTOLs underscores their perceived benefits, the authors concluded. \"Yet it also sends a clear message about the necessity to tackle safety, environmental, and social issues.\" In Canada, drones are deployed for tasks ranging from aerial photography to search-and-rescue missions and wildfire detection. Meanwhile air taxis, long hyped as the next giant leap in short-haul passenger transport, are coming closer to being a public reality — even as skepticism lingers over their ability to change commuter behaviour and emissions output. In the U.S., electric air taxis will be cleared for the skies by 2028, according to a regulatory timeline laid out by the Federal Aviation Administration last July. Some manufacturers have 2025 as their target, such as Silicon Valley's Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation. The whirly machines carry the promise of delivering people and goods across congested urban and suburban areas and between nearby cities. But headwinds around technology, regulation and investment remain, with Canada lagging behind some of its peers on policy. And whether aerial vehicles can move beyond a sleek slice of the ultrarich and the medical and cargo niches in the near term remains up in the air. Last week, Boeing Co. pledged $240 million toward a Montreal-area aerospace cluster that will include advanced air mobility research pertinent to its Whisk Aero subsidiary, which makes self-flying taxis. \"The expertise here in autonomy is as good as, if not better than, pretty much everywhere else in the world,\" said Boeing Global president Brendan Nelson in an interview, adding that certification is on the horizon. Despite ongoing innovation in Canada, more than three-quarters of respondents to the Léger survey had never heard of advanced air mobility. Awareness was higher among Canadians aged 18-34, those with a university diploma, men and Indigenous people and people of colour, the report found. The 99-page paper was based on two studies carried out between November and January, with a survey sample size of 2,717 participants as well as four focus groups. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian Press",

        "content": "Kingston, Jamaica: The West Indies completed a 3-0 sweep of their T20I series with South Africa after an eight wicket crushing of the Proteas at Sabina Park on Sunday. Set 164 to win, the Caribbean side raced to the target with 6.1 overs to spare and for the loss of just two wickets. Openers Brandon King and Johnson Charles put on 92 in 6.4 overs with Charles in particular punishing the tourists as he battered 69 off just 26 balls. Charles hit 14 of those 26 balls for boundaries including five sixes. Kyle Mayers came in and kept up the momentum and when stand-in skipper King departed for 44 (28 balls), West Indies were 130-2 with 9.1 overs remaining. Mayers ended on 36 not out as the West Indies ensured they head into the T20 World Cup, which they will co-host with the United States, in confident mood. “Happy with my own performance,” King said. “I would’ve liked to carry my bat through the end though. It was an important 3-0 win, last series before the World Cup, so important preparation and good momentum going into the World Cup. “Our bowling performances were very pleasing, we had consistency throughout,” King added. “Gudakesh Motie and other different contributors. Speaks well that a lot of our main players are missing. I can’t wait to meet with the other boys before the World Cup.” The West Indies squad for the tournament will feature several players who missed this series such as skipper Rovman Powell and Andre Russell. South Africa had their stand-in captain Rassie van der Dussen to credit for even setting a half-decent target. Van der Dussen hit five sixes in his crucial innings, putting on 77 in 8.1 overs in a fifth wicket partnership with Wiaan Mulder. West Indies left-arm pace-man Obed McCoy, called into the World Cup squad on Sunday to replace the injured Jason Holder, took 3-39 in four overs. Fast bowler Shamar Joseph took 2-26 in four overs while Motie took for 2-21 in his three overs. Van der Dussen was unsparing in his analysis of the series loss. “Thoroughly disappointing. Not what we had in mind coming here,” he said. “From the first game they were all over us. We couldn’t adapt, and today we couldn’t find answers with the ball. Not happy with that. “We were caught off guard how they played with the bat and they were better with the ball as simple as that. We were taught a few lessons.” BRIEF SCORES West Indies 165 for 2 (Charles 69, King 44, Mayers 36*) beat South Africa 163 for 7 (van dur Dussen 51, McCoy 3-39, Motie 2-21, S Joseph 2-26) by 8 wickets",

        "description": "The UCLA athletics department is mourning the loss of the legendary Bill Walton, who led the men's basketball program to back-to-back national titles in 1972 and 1973.",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES — The UCLA men’s basketball team and athletics department are mourning the loss of two-time NCAA champion Bill Walton, who died at the age of 71 following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced Monday. Walton, a UCLA basketball icon, led the Bruins to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, with two straight 30-0 records, which was part of the program’s historic span of seven consecutive NCAA championships from 1967 to 1973, under legendary UCLA coach John Wooden. Walton still stands No. 1 on UCLA’s career rebounding list at 1,370 and was three-time Naismith College Player of the Year and Academic All-American during his three years on varsity (1972-74). “On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men’s basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA men’s basketball coach Mick Cronin said. “My deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones. It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball. Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him. Our athletics department, our team and this university will miss him dearly.” The San Diego native, who attended Helix High School, was Coach Wooden’s starting center for three seasons (1971-74). In his three varsity seasons, Walton never lost a game at Pauley Pavilion (49-0). He was a consensus first-team All-America selection in all three varsity seasons, as freshmen were not allowed to play varsity when enrolled at UCLA in 1970. Walton, a UCLA Athletics Hall of Famer since 1984, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993, six years after his NBA career that spanned from 1974-1987 ended. The college basketball star was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and helped lead them to the 1977 NBA championship and was named the NBA MVP in 1978. He battled injuries in his professional career. After leaving Portland, he played for the San Diego Clippers and the Los Angeles Clippers, before retiring with the Boston Celtics, where he helped win the 1986 NBA championship. “We are stunned and saddened about the news of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond said. “Bill represented so many of the ideals that our university holds dear and embodied multiple traits on Coach Wooden’s Pyramid of Success. “He loved being back on campus at UCLA, calling games in Pauley Pavilion, and being around our teams. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family, and we take solace in knowing that Bill made each day his masterpiece.” Walton’s No. 32 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s No. 33 (known in college as Lew Alcindor) became the first two UCLA men’s basketball players to have their jersey numbers retired on Feb. 3, 1990. Since then, UCLA has retired the jersey numbers of 10 former men’s basketball players. Walton, who passed surrounded by family, is survived by his wife of 33 years, Lori; his four sons, Adam, Nathan, Luke and Chris; and his three grandchildren, Olivia, Avery Rose and Chase.

        "description": "The UCLA athletics department is mourning the loss of the legendary Bill Walton, who led the men's basketball program to back-to-back national titles in 1972 and 1973.",
        "content": "LOS ANGELES — The UCLA men’s basketball team and athletics department are mourning the loss of two-time NCAA champion Bill Walton, who died at the age of 71 following a prolonged battle with cancer, the NBA announced Monday. Walton, a UCLA basketball icon, led the Bruins to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, with two straight 30-0 records, which was part of the program’s historic span of seven consecutive NCAA championships from 1967 to 1973, under legendary UCLA coach John Wooden. Walton still stands No. 1 on UCLA’s career rebounding list at 1,370 and was three-time Naismith College Player of the Year and Academic All-American during his three years on varsity (1972-74). “On behalf of everyone with the UCLA men’s basketball program, we are deeply saddened to learn of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA men’s basketball coach Mick Cronin said. “My deepest condolences go out to his family and loved ones. It’s very hard to put into words what he has meant to UCLA’s program, as well as his tremendous impact on college basketball. Beyond his remarkable accomplishments as a player, it’s his relentless energy, enthusiasm for the game and unwavering candor that have been the hallmarks of his larger than life personality. “As a passionate UCLA alumnus and broadcaster, he loved being around our players, hearing their stories, and sharing his wisdom and advice. For me as a coach, he was honest, kind, and always had his heart in the right place. I will miss him very much. It’s hard to imagine a season in Pauley Pavilion without him. Our athletics department, our team and this university will miss him dearly.” The San Diego native, who attended Helix High School, was Coach Wooden’s starting center for three seasons (1971-74). In his three varsity seasons, Walton never lost a game at Pauley Pavilion (49-0). He was a consensus first-team All-America selection in all three varsity seasons, as freshmen were not allowed to play varsity when enrolled at UCLA in 1970. Walton, a UCLA Athletics Hall of Famer since 1984, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993, six years after his NBA career that spanned from 1974-1987 ended. The college basketball star was the No. 1 overall pick in the 1974 NBA Draft by the Portland Trail Blazers and helped lead them to the 1977 NBA championship and was named the NBA MVP in 1978. He battled injuries in his professional career. After leaving Portland, he played for the San Diego Clippers and the Los Angeles Clippers, before retiring with the Boston Celtics, where he helped win the 1986 NBA championship. “We are stunned and saddened about the news of Bill Walton’s passing,” UCLA athletic director Martin Jarmond said. “Bill represented so many of the ideals that our university holds dear and embodied multiple traits on Coach Wooden’s Pyramid of Success. “He loved being back on campus at UCLA, calling games in Pauley Pavilion, and being around our teams. We offer our deepest sympathy to his family, and we take solace in knowing that Bill made each day his masterpiece.” Walton’s No. 32 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s No. 33 (known in college as Lew Alcindor) became the first two UCLA men’s basketball players to have their jersey numbers retired on Feb. 3, 1990. Since then, UCLA has retired the jersey numbers of 10 former men’s basketball players. Walton, who passed surrounded by family, is survived by his wife of 33 years, Lori; his four sons, Adam, Nathan, Luke and Chris; and his three grandchildren, Olivia, Avery Rose and Chase.

        "content": "A recent study by Lund University in Sweden has shed light on a potential link between tattoos and lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The research, while preliminary, suggests that individuals with tattoos may have a slightly elevated risk of developing lymphoma compared to those without. The study followed a large group of people in Sweden, analyzing their medical history and tattoo status. Researchers found a 21% increased risk of lymphoma among those with tattoos. It’s important to note that lymphoma is a relatively rare cancer, and even with this increase, the overall risk for tattooed individuals remains low. The researchers emphasized that their findings highlight an area requiring further investigation. They acknowledge that more studies are needed to confirm the association and pinpoint the underlying cause. One hypothesis suggests that tattoo ink particles might trigger an immune response, potentially influencing lymphoma development. The body’s immune system naturally targets foreign substances, and tattoo ink, when deposited into the skin, could be perceived as such. Another possibility researchers are exploring is the link between tattooing practices and hygiene standards. While tattoo regulations and safety measures have significantly improved in recent times, some older tattoos or those applied in unsanitary conditions could pose a higher risk of infection. Certain infections have been linked to an increased risk of lymphoma. The study underscores the importance of prioritizing safety during the tattooing process. Opting for reputable tattoo parlors that adhere to strict hygiene protocols and using sterilized equipment are crucial for minimizing health risks. While the findings of this study have generated interest, it’s vital to maintain perspective. The absolute risk of lymphoma for tattooed individuals remains low. However, the research paves the way for further exploration into the long-term health effects of tattoos and emphasizes the significance of safe tattooing practices.",

        "content": "Luke Shaw has admitted he is not ‘100 per cent’ fit heading England ’s Euro 2024 campaign but hit back at those questioning his commitment to the Manchester United cause. Shaw has endured an injury-hit season having been limited to just 15 starts in all competitions with his last appearance coming back in February. Despite his lack of game time, the left-back was named in Gareth Southgate’s provisional 33-man squad – although the Three Lions boss later admitted his chances of making his final squad of 26 are ‘a long shot’. Shaw was again absent as United lifted the FA Cup on Saturday after a thrilling win over Manchester City, In a fiery social media post, the defender hit back at those who have questioned his loyalty to United and defended his absence over the last three months, insisting he is ‘constantly working’ to get back into the side. ‘Happy for the boys to lift the trophy at the weekend and finish this season on a positive. As much as it was the result I wanted it was hard to watch from the stands,’ he wrote on Monday. ‘This has definitely been the most frustrating season for me, I have had set back after set back and have worked so hard to get back to fitness but things just haven’t gone my way. ‘I pushed so hard to get back before the end of the season and the final but some things just aren’t meant to be. ‘There’s nothing I want to do more than play and win with Manchester United I don’t normally react to things I see on social media but there’s a lot of people questioning my loyalty to this club and asking how I am fit for England but not United. ‘The reality is I am not 100% fit for either right now but I am doing everything I can and constantly working to be. Gary Lineker questions if Man Utd star faked injury to get out of FA Cup final Man Utd star told Erik ten Hag he did not want to play in FA Cup final Chelsea make final decision on Kieran McKenna with only two options left Will Chelsea decline Europa Conference League place and who can they face? ‘I have been at this club for 10 years through highs and lows and for anyone to question my loyalty is obviously frustrating. ‘I appreciate I haven’t updated you all with my injuries and where I’m at with my recovery but equally the most important thing to me is that we’re supporting the team playing. ‘My biggest focus right now is being fit and then whatever happens this summer I will be ready.

        "content": "With high inflation eating into your pocket, one can look to earn a stable passive income to overcome the impact. Investing in high-yielding would be one of the cheaper and convenient ways to earn passive income. Meanwhile, you can earn a passive income of over $2,000 annually by investing $9,000 in each of the following three high-yielding dividend stocks. TC Energy ( ) operates a diversified utility-like business, with around 97% of its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) generated from rate regulation and long-term contracts. Thus, its cash flows are less susceptible to economic fluctuations, allowing it to raise dividends at an annualized rate of 7% since 2000. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.96/share, with its forward yield at 7.32%. Meanwhile, the company expects to make a capital investment of $8-$8.5 billion this year and is confident of putting $7 billion of projects into service. Further, the company’s management expects to make capital expenditure of $6-$7 billion annually after 2024. It also focuses on divesting non-core assets, which could strengthen its balance sheet. The company’s management hopes to generate $3 billion through asset sales this year, which could help lower its debt levels. Given its healthy growth prospects and improving financial position, TRP’s management is confident of raising its dividends by 3-5% annually for the next three years. BCE Over the last two years, the telecom sector has been under pressure due to rising interest rates and unfavourable regulatory decisions. Despite the near-term weakness, the sector’s growth prospects look healthy, given the growing demand amid digitization and remote working and learning. So, I have chosen ( ), one of the three top Canadian telecom players, as my second pick. It has lost around 26% of its stock value compared to its 52-week high, with its NTM (next 12 months) declining to 13. Meanwhile, BCE is expanding its 5G infrastructure, which could increase its customer base. The company and its peers are working with regulatory authorities to derive a middle ground that could retain competition without disincentivizing companies that have made substantial capital investments in expanding broadband infrastructure. Further, interest rates could eventually fall, thus helping the company to lower its interest expenses. Notably, the recent correction has increased its dividend yield to 8.7%, making it an attractive buy. NorthWest Healthcare Properties REIT ( ) is another high-yielding dividend stock to have in your portfolio due to its defensive healthcare portfolio, long-term lease agreements, and inflation-indexed rent. After two tough years, the company has witnessed healthy buying over the last few weeks amid an improvement in its financial position and operating metrics. Over the last four quarters, NorthWest Healthcare has sold 27 properties, generating $696 million. It utilized these net proceeds to pay off debt with higher interest rates, thus improving its financial health. Further, its occupancy and collection rates in the first quarter stood at 96.5% and 98%, respectively. The aging population could increase healthcare demand, thus benefiting the company. So, I believe NorhtWest Healthcare is well-positioned to continue paying dividends at a healthier rate. Its of $0.03/share translates to a forward yield of 7.1%.",

        "description": "While it's true that Cameco stock (TSX:CCO) looks like a strong clean energy solution, it's not actually even a renewable energy stock.The post Is Cameco Stock the Best Renewable Energy Stock for You? appeared first on The Motley Fool Canada.",
        "content": "When it comes to market gainers this year, ( ) has been one of the top choices. The uranium producer has seen shares climb even as other companies see their prices slump. However, that was then, and this is now. And now, some renewable energy stocks are coming back. So, with that in mind, is Cameco stock really the best renewable energy stock for your portfolio? The bull side Cameco stock is considered a strong investment in renewable energy for a variety of reasons. Nuclear energy is recognized as a key player in the transition to a low-carbon future. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power generates electricity without emitting greenhouse gases during operation, making it a critical component in the fight against climate change. Cameco stock is one of the largest producers of uranium, which is essential for nuclear power generation. Furthermore, it is a leading company in the uranium mining sector, with significant expertise and long-term contracts with utilities around the world. Its established market presence and experience provide a competitive edge. It even operates some of the world’s largest and highest-grade uranium mines. What’s more, Cameco has a strong balance sheet and prudent financial management, which are critical for navigating the cyclical nature of the uranium market. The company has a history of maintaining liquidity and controlling costs effectively. And with the addition of its Westinghouse operations, it looks like this should continue for at least the next several years. However, there could be some reasons why investors may want to be a bit wary or at least consider other renewable energy investments. The bear case There are a few reasons to consider Cameco stock as less of a long-term buy and more for the next few years. Despite being a low-carbon energy source, nuclear power is often not classified as “renewable energy” because it relies on uranium, a finite resource. Many investors looking to invest in renewable energy prefer companies involved in truly renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower, which utilize inexhaustible resources. Plus, as we’ve seen in the past, public perception of nuclear energy can be negative due to concerns over nuclear accidents, radioactive waste disposal, and the potential for catastrophic failures, which can deter some investors. This could cause a sudden drop in share price even overnight. What’s more, the nuclear industry is heavily regulated, and changes in government policies, particularly in response to public opinion or environmental movements, can impact the industry significantly. Countries may shift away from nuclear power due to safety concerns or political pressures, as seen in Germany’s phase-out of nuclear energy post-Fukushima. Then there are the basics. The management of nuclear waste is a significant challenge. High-level radioactive waste requires secure, long-term storage solutions that are not only costly but also face strong public opposition and regulatory hurdles. Furthermore, the price of uranium is volatile. Cameco’s financial performance is closely tied to the price of uranium, which can be highly volatile due to factors such as geopolitical events, supply disruptions, and changes in demand. This dependency can result in fluctuating revenues and profits, adding an element of risk for investors. Bottom line So, while Cameco has a pivotal role in the nuclear , its alignment with the broader category of renewable energy investments is debatable. Investors focused strictly on renewable energy might find companies involved in solar, wind, or other renewable technologies more aligned with their investment goals due to fewer regulatory risks, more favourable public perception, and true renewability of the energy sources. In the end, it all comes down to your own investment portfolio and risk profile.",

The government expressed concerns about Guo’s supporters, while Guo, a sharp critic of the Chinese government, says it’s the Communist Party that poses the threat. Investors spent more than $US400 million buying stock in social media platform GTV Media Group through an allegedly illegal private stock offering, the US says. Guo skimmed $US100 million off the top and placed it in a Kyle Bass hedge fund for a high-risk bet against the Hong Kong dollar, the government says. The wager led to a $US30 million loss. Guo was an associate of former Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The next alleged scam was G Clubs, an exclusive private members club with a minimum $US10,000 buy-in. Investors were told the membership could earn them stock in GTV and other perks, including a discount at G Fashion, “which sold expensive clothing to the defendant’s followers,” according to the government. In his statement to the jury, Fergenson rattled off a list of Guo’s more extravagant purchases, including a Lamborghini worth almost $US1 million, a $US4 million Ferrari for his son, even a $US35,000 mattress. The US claims he bought these assets with investor funds. Fergenson also cited “an $US800 pair of sweatpants” Guo sold through his fashion brand. But his lawyer told the jury that Guo, one of eight children in a family that amassed a fortune in Chinese real estate, lived that life long before he was alleged to have committed these crimes. “The government would like you to draw many negative inferences about a person who spends thousands on a TV or a mattress,” Shroff said, urging the jurors to put the indulgences in context. Guo had devoted his life to a whistleblower movement, Shroff said, and it came at a cost. His phones and computers had been hacked by the Communist Party, his wife and daughter had been detained for two years in China, and he had an Interpol arrest notice against his name, she said. The party had also deposited money into Guo’s bank accounts under the names of people subject to US sanctions, triggering banks to close his accounts, she said. The Chinese Communist Party “had a thousand different ways to mess with Guo and stop a political movement that was really the essence of his entire being,” Shroff told the jury. Guo, who applied for asylum in the US in 2017, also forged ties to former president Donald Trump’s inner-circle. When former Trump campaign chairman Bannon was arrested for fraud in 2020, he was on board Guo’s 150-foot “Lady May” yacht off the Connecticut coast. Since his arrest at his $US67.5 million penthouse in the Sherry-Netherland hotel in March 2023, Guo’s court appearances have attracted a steady throng of supporters and detractors. Outside the courthouse on Friday morning, a woman stood next to a speaker playing sound bites about regulators seizing the assets of Guo, who was a billionaire at the time of his arrest. Since then he has been held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Centre. Bloomberg The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

        "description": "A backwards glance at the hundreds and thousands of lives lost in military service to conflicts dating back to the civil war",
        "content": "Memorial Day in downtown Washington has an eerie feel: the normally bustling Connecticut Avenue, which dissects the city on its route past the White House, has a sleepy Sunday vibe but something is off: too many low-flying aircraft in the sky, too many siren bursts and the tail-end of the tornadoes ripping through the central states is in the swirling breeze. Down at the Vietnam Wall, a black granite curved memorial bearing the names of 58,000 US military people killed in that war, the crowd is gathering for a lunchtime service. The mood is of hushed reunion and observance. It’s just one of countless acts of parades and pageantry taking place across the country. “I was here in 1982 when it opened,” says Gary Galloway, a 75-year-old veteran from Hardinsburg, Kentucky, who served in Vietnam in 1969-1970. “I have been here for the last 15 years every Memorial Day and Veterans Day. I’ve four guys on the wall there. And I know a lot of others on the wall. I had eight months in Vietnam. I got messed up over there. I was 21. I was one of the older guys.” READ MORE Amid rising animosity, Macron honours Nazi-hunting couple in Germany Memorial Day at Arlington: A mood of hushed reunion and observance ‘I’ve changed this party, permanently’: Keir Starmer promises red renewal in Tory party’s blue backyard It could be described as the US’s strangest day: the official beginning of summer, with attendant larks and beach plans, but it is also a sombre and solemn backwards glance at the hundreds and thousands of lives lost in military service to conflicts dating back to the civil war from 1861 to 1865 that shattered the idea of the United States. On a Sunday of searing heat, a steady crowd had lined in the tree-shaded approach to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldiers, which sits on a crest in Arlington Cemetery. It’s the only day of the year when the public are permitted to walk across the plaza where the crypts hold bodies of unidentified soldiers disinterred from distant graves and transferred to the memorial, each representing unknown soldiers from the first and second World Wars, and the Korean and Vietnam wars. In 1998 the Unknown American from the Vietnam era was exhumed from the tomb and, using newly available science, was identified as a first lieutenant in the US air force named Michael J Blassie: he was then laid to rest in Missouri in accordance with his family’s wishes. But Arlington has more than 4,000 headstones marked “Unknown”. When the former estate and home to Robert E Lee, who resigned from the US army and became the commander of the Confederate army and the shimmering figure of the South’s Lost Cause mythology, was repurposed as a burial ground, the original graves were marked with white wooden clapboards. Early visitors described how, when walking up to Arlington, the entire scene looked like fields of white flowers. In time, marble replaced the boards, but the effect remains the same. A monument in what was the rose garden of Arlington House marks the location where the remains of 2,111 soldiers gathered after the Battle of Bull Run at Manassas. Arlington House itself is open to the public and the only change to the interior, preserved since the day Lee hurriedly departed, are electric fans rotating to cool the stream of visitors filing through and taking photographs of the actual red velvet furniture set bought by Lee, of the table where the family set still laid. More than 400,000 people are buried at Arlington in 70 sections which are oddly haphazard in layout. Section 13 is where the white civil war dead are buried. Section 27 was reserved for African-American union soldiers. A short walk away is section 60, where most of those buried were born in the 1990s. Of course, not all died in combat. A family relative, my mother’s uncle, Martin Sweeney, who left Connemara as a young man, joined the US army and served in the second World War and Korea, was buried in section 67 in the winter of 1984. As military lives go, his was blessed: he lived until old age. It’s a disorientating place, Arlington, with its prevailing peacefulness (birdsong like the Masters golf tournament) and dignity and the heavy mystique of the big house on the hill framed by the overwhelming, inescapable deluge of violence and death beneath it all. The civil war has become the framework around which the US’s narrative is told. The World Wars are revered as the good wars. But the more recent conflicts in Vietnam and the Gulf and the mismanaged invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan generate complex and conflicting emotions. “How do you memorialise the dead of a failed war?” asked Phil Klay, the novelist who served in the marine corps in Iraq in a New York Times essay this week. “At Arlington, it’s easy to let your heart swell with pride as you pass certain graves. Here are the heroes who ended slavery. Here are the patriots who defeated fascism. We think of them as inextricably bound up with the cause they gave their life to. The same can’t be said for more morally troubling wars, from the Philippines to Vietnam. And for the dead of my generation’s wars, for the dead I knew, the reasons they died sit awkwardly alongside the honour I owe them.” The names on the Vietnam Wall are limited to those who either died in the conflict or, within 120 days, of injuries or illnesses inflicted by time in the combat zone. That limited window has caused its own controversies, raised its own questions about the unnumbered who suffered health problems in later life. One of the most disquieting statistics about the aftershocks of the US military life concerns later-life suicide: in 2020, more than 6,100 veterans took their own lives – and that figure marked a decrease on preceding years. Many others continue to suffer the after-effects of Agent Orange, including Gary Galloway, who has been diagnosed with cancer. His way of dealing with it is to keep going: he’s an avid motor biker and tries to walk 8km each day. “I don’t have PTSD. I think the reason I don’t is that I stay active. I knew a guy from home who was in the second World War, at Iowa Jima. A marine. He was 90 years old. He had a Mustang convertible. He travelled all over the country. I said: ‘Why do you do that?’ He said: ‘If I slow down, the shellshock is going to hit me.’” At Arlington on Monday morning, president Joe Biden invoked the name of William Christman, a Pennsylvanian who became the first soldier buried there in June of 1864, seven weeks after enlisting. He was not alone for long. Like many presidents before him, Biden’s address was cloaked in the language of military myth. His sentiments were genuine but sit uneasily in a year when the US government is sponsoring Israel’s ongoing slaughter in Palestine. “One thing I see that’s changed here: all school kids who came here, they would hand you letters and greet you,” Gary Galloway says as a light rain begins to spit and the umbrellas are raised before the ceremony at the Vietnam Memorial Wall. “I’m not seeing that so much any more. Just every once in a while some young kid will say thank you for your service. But that’s it. I don’t have any idea why that is.

        "content": "The Massachusetts knifeman accused of stabbing six people, including three children, and suspected of killing another, appears to have been in the process of changing their identity. Jared Ravizza, 26, swapped shirtless selfies showing off a gym-honed torso as recently as September 2023 for ones wearing lipgloss, face glitter and painted pink nails. Ravizza also describes themselves as “she” on Instagram and court documents obtained by The Post show paperwork was filed for a legal name change from Jared Christian Ravizza Jones to Jared Love Jones just last month. In the application, Ravizza wrote the reason as: “Honoring my beloved grandmother Priscilla Jones,” and “honoring the creative brilliance and magical beauty of my entire Jones family lineage,” on their maternal side. Ravizza also asked the name change not be made public because “this has been a deeply personal journey for me,” in the papers dated April 8. The request was granted and signed off on by a judge the following day. Ravizza is being investigated over a murder in Connecticut after cops found a body in the tiny town of Deep River around 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to Boston 25 news . The identity of the victim has not been revealed. Ravizza is then accused of laughing as he stabbed four little girls aged between 9 and 17 as they watched the movie “IF” at a theater outside Boston — then attacking two other people at a McDonald’s, according to cops. None of the victims’ injuries were life-threatening and they were treated at a hospital, according to local reports. The alleged attacker’s Instagram page shows dozens of images and videos where they are wearing large sunglasses, posing in model-esque fashion and displaying artwork. In some of the images, Ravizza poses with a black Porsche which appears to be the same one crashed in a police pursuit following the stabbing frenzy over the weekend. One video posted just two weeks ago shows Ravizza walking up to the car and creepily looking back at the camera. On April 5 Ravizza posed a series of pictures with artwork, a pipe for smoking and a dollar bill. Five days later Ravizza posted a photo pointing to a hand-drawn picture of their new name surrounded by pink hearts on his Instagram page. The Plymouth County District Attorney said Sunday Ravizza is facing counts of assault with intent to murder, and two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon after the attack on the girls at Braintree AMC and then an attack on two employees at a Plymouth McDonald’s an hour away. Ravizza has yet to enter a plea. Describing the first attack, Braintree Police Department said: “Without saying anything and without any warning, he suddenly attacked and stabbed the four young females. “The attack appeared to be unprovoked. After the attack, the man ran out of the theater and left in a vehicle.” A movie theater concessions worker described the suspect as wearing “an oversized trench coat, sunglasses, and a long blonde wig,” according to CBS Boston. According to local media reports and Ravizza’s Instagram page, their blond flowing hair is real and not a wig, as initially reported by police. Ravizza then fled in a Porsche SUV and drove 30 miles to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where he allegedly stabbed the two employees of a rest-stop McDonald’s on Route 3, according to authorities. According to the DA’s office, surveillance video shows Ravizza reaching through the fast food chain’s drive-thru window and stabbing a 28-year-old male employee with a large knife. Officials say Ravizza then parked his black Porsche, went inside the McDonald’s and stabbed a second employee, a 21-year-old woman. Both victims suffered non-life-threatening injuries and were taken to nearby hospitals. Ravizza then allegedly fled the plaza, eventually totaling the car in a fiery crash on Cotuit Road in Sandwich. Ravizza was taken into custody shortly afterward and is being treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. The suspect is due to be arraigned in Plymouth District Court Tuesday.",

        "content": "In a wave of nostalgia sweeping through the Sultanate, memories of the late 90s resurface, bringing with them images of two iconic landmarks of entertainment: Hassanal Bolkiah and Borneo movie theatres. Long before the age of multiplexes, these single-screen cinemas stood as pillars of cinematic delight, etching themselves into the collective consciousness of a generation. The Hassanal Bolkiah Theatre, situated in the heart of the capital, was more than just a building; it was a cultural institution. With its grand facade and imposing marquee, it drew moviegoers from far and wide, promising an evening of enchantment and escapism. Inside, the air hummed with anticipation as patrons settled into their seats, eager for the magic of the silver screen to unfold before them. Across town, the Borneo Theatre casts its own spell, beckoning cinephiles with its distinctive charm and old-world allure. From its ornate architecture to its intimate ambiance, the theatre exuded a sense of nostalgia, transporting audiences to a bygone era of glamour and romance. Here, movie buffs revelled in the timeless allure of cinema, immersing themselves in stories that spanned the gamut of human experience. For those who frequented these beloved theatres, it was about more than just watching movies – it was about community, camaraderie, and shared moments of joy. Whether catching the latest blockbuster or attending a special screening of a local production, patrons forged bonds that transcended the confines of the silver screen. However, as the dawn of the new millennium approached, winds of change swept through Brunei’s entertainment landscape. Multiplex cinemas began to emerge, offering audiences a wider selection of films and state-of-the-art amenities. While these developments signalled progress, they also marked the end of an era for traditional single-screen theatres. Today, the memories of these iconic theatres live on in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to experience their magic. Though their doors may have closed long ago, their legacy endures as a testament to the power of cinema to captivate, inspire, and unite us all. As Brunei continues to embrace the future of entertainment, let us pause for a moment to reflect on the rich tapestry of history woven by the Hassanal Bolkiah and Borneo theatres. In remembering the past, we honour the stories that have shaped us and celebrate the enduring legacy of two beloved institutions that will forever hold a special place in our hearts. – Fadley Faisal ABOVE & BELOW: The Hassanal Bolkiah Theatre; and Borneo Theatre.

        "description": "The two countries are at an impasse in their bilateral free trade talks",
        "content": "A British official called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to ratify the ’s entry into a by the end of the year, despite opposition from some Canadian agriculture groups. The two countries are at an impasse in their bilateral free trade talks, which may also be delaying Canadian action to help the U.K. join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, known by the acronym CPTPP. The U.K. signed onto the latter accord last July, and its Parliament formally ratified the deal last week. But before it can start enjoying the benefits, the U.K. needs six of the CPTPP’s 11 members to ratify its accession — and so far only Singapore, Japan, and Chile have done so. Canadian Trade Minister Mary Ng has yet to introduce a ratification bill in the country’s House of Commons. Jennifer Fagan, head of economics and trade at the U.K. High Commission in Canada, said her country is especially keen to have Canada’s support, given their close ties as allies and Canada’s status as chair of the CPTPP Commission this year. “We understand that it’s a busy parliamentary season for Canada, but we’re hoping that it’ll be imminent that Canada will put that legislation forward,” Fagan said in an interview. Fagan said she believes the U.K. will get enough other countries to ratify before the end of 2024, but would hope that Canada does so given that it was “an early champion of the U.K. accession.” Fagan made the comments shortly before British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called an election for July 4, which polls suggest the Labour Party will win. Under Sunak, the U.K. suspended free trade talks with Canada after Trudeau’s government allowed some post-Brexit trade provisions to expire. Those included a temporary arrangement that permitted low-tariff exports of British cheese to Canada and another that affected British auto exports to Canada. Canadian and British officials insist those issues are separate from discussions around CPTPP. But there may be other reasons Canada is dragging its heels. An alliance of Canadian agriculture groups is lobbying against the U.K.’s accession to the Pacific pact, arguing that it doesn’t give enough access for producers currently blocked from the U.K. market. “This agreement does not achieve any meaningful market access for the Canadian beef and pork industries and creates significant barriers for Canadian farmers, ranchers and producers,” the coalition says on its website. Ng said Canada still supports the U.K.’s entry into CPTPP but remained non-committal on a timeline for a vote in parliament. “It’s definitely in the queue,” she said in a phone interview while attending a trade forum in Peru. “It’s certainly something we’ve committed to doing, and we intend to.”",

        "content": "Palestinians search for food among burnt debris in the aftermath of an Israeli strike on an area designated for displaced people, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. Photo: Reuters Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after a strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety metal shelters ablaze. Israel's military, which is trying to eliminate Hamas in Gaza, said it was investigating reports that a strike it carried out against commanders of the Islamist militant group in Rafah had caused the fire. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike had not been intended to cause civilian casualties. \"In Rafah, we already evacuated about 1 million non-combatant residents and despite our utmost effort not to harm non-combatants, something unfortunately went tragically wrong,\" he said in a speech in parliament that was interrupted by shouting from opposition lawmakers. Survivors said families were preparing to sleep when the strike hit the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago. \"We were praying...and we were getting our children's beds ready to sleep. There was nothing unusual, then we heard a very loud noise, and fire erupted around us,\" said Umm Mohamed Al-Attar, a Palestinian mother in a red headscarf. \"All the children started screaming... The sound was terrifying; we felt like the metal was about to collapse on us, and shrapnel fell into the rooms.\" Video footage obtained by Reuters showed a fire raging in the darkness and people screaming in panic. A group of young men tried to haul away sheets of corrugated iron and a hose from a single fire truck began to douse the flames. More than half of the dead were women, children, and elderly people, health officials in Hamas-run Gaza said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise from people with severe burns. Medics later said an Israeli airstrike on Monday on a house in Rafah had killed seven Palestinians, with several others wounded. Israel's military said Sunday's strike, based on \"precise intelligence\", had eliminated Hamas' chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind deadly attacks on Israelis. That followed the interception of eight rockets fired towards Israel from the Rafah area in Gaza's southern tip. Israel has kept up its offensive despite a ruling by the top UN court on Friday ordering it to stop, saying the court's ruling grants it some scope for military action there. The court also reiterated calls for the immediate and unconditional release of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas. The US urged Israel to take more care to protect civilians, but stopped short of calling for a halt to the Rafah incursion. \"Israel has a right to go after Hamas, and we understand this strike killed two senior Hamas terrorists who are responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians,\" a National Security Council spokesperson said. \"But as we’ve been clear, Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians.\" French President Emmanuel Macron said he was \"outraged\" over Israel's latest attacks. \"These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians,\" he said on X. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the International Court of Justice ruling must be respected. \"International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel's conduct of the war,\" Baerbock said. NO SAFE ZONE More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. By daylight, the camp in Rafah was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings. Fire rages in an area designated for displaced Palestinians, in Rafah. Photo: Reuters Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah's western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze. \"The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,\" he said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs based in the West Bank condemned \"the heinous massacre.\" Egypt also condemned Israel's \"deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people\", state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law. On Monday, the Israeli military said it was investigating reports of an exchange of fire between Israeli and Egyptian soldiers close to the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Egypt's military spokesperson said that shooting near the Rafah crossing led to the killing of one person and authorities were investigating. Israeli tanks stepped up the intensity of bombardments of eastern and central areas of Rafah on Monday, killing at least eight, local health officials said. Two medical workers were killed by a missile fired from a drone as they left the Kuwaiti hospital in Rafah, medics said. In Al-Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, an Israeli attack killed three Palestinian police officers, Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said. Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area. But it faces global condemnation for failing to spare civilian lives. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange. Senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan told reporters in Beirut on Monday that there were no plans for ceasefire talks and the group's demands to achieve an accord, which include a permanent ceasefire, remain unchanged.",

        "description": "The latest documentary from the director of Whitney skirts around the issues raised by the anti-Semitism and subsequent revival of former Dior and Givenchy creative director John Galliano.",
        "content": "Models throwing fresh mackerel at audience members; impersonating a lion while naked in a hotel elevator for four hours straight; a signature style of cutting fabric on the bias, giving birth to the iconic black slip dresses that took over in the 90s and forever after. Fashion designer John Galliano has made headlines for his virtuosic, generation-defining work on the catwalk as much as for his ludicrous antics offstage. Fast facts about High & Low — John Galliano : The rise, fall and revival of one of fashion's most mercurial and controversial figures. : John Galliano, Anna Wintour, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Charlize Theron. : In cinemas from May 30. : Ambivalent. But for a documentary that recounts the divisive figure's inexplicable fall from grace and everything that preceded it, High & Low is structured rather conventionally. Interspersing archival footage with talking head interviews and snippets of a six-day-long conversation with Galliano himself, the documentary unfolds largely chronologically. As he traces the career of a larger-than-life figure, director Kevin Macdonald (Whitney; The Last King of Scotland) has to contend with what Galliano is most infamous for: successive anti-Semitic outbursts that resulted in him being prosecuted by a French court and sacked as creative director of Dior in 2011. And that is how the documentary opens – Galliano's recorded racist tirade is presented in all its jaw-dropping horridness. As Macdonald charts Galliano's life, it's almost as though he's excavating it for clues, signs, justifications as to what transpired. We're thrust into Galliano's troubled childhood and the halcyon days of his youth. Growing up within a cloistered Spanish-Gibraltan migrant family who moved to London when Galliano was six, the budding creative learns to live in his head as he comes to terms with his queerness, while living in a homophobic household intent on quashing it. The liberatory, fashion-forward subversiveness of the underground New Romantic movement in London arrives as a breath of fresh air after the repressiveness of Galliano's childhood. Macdonald expertly evokes the trend through the reverberations of 80s synth-pop and the quaint sheen of low-resolution photographs. The documentary hurtles along the trajectory of his career, including Galliano cutting his teeth as a fresh-faced ingenue straight out of the famed art school Central Saint Martins. The graduate fashion show that put him on the map – the French Revolution-inspired Les Incroyables – leads to multiple career-defining runway productions, before Galliano is offered the role of creative director at Givenchy and is promptly whisked away to be creative director at Dior. This is where he gains unprecedented levels of fame and adulation, and when his mental health precipitously declines. The theme of escapism and the salve of an imagination are mainstays of Galliano's work, but as his fashion shows become increasingly elevated flights of fantasy, with models more like actors than exhibitors of clothing, his grip on reality also loosens. Addictions to work, substances and exercise begin to take hold as Galliano suffers devastating losses in his personal life – first his father, then his life anchor and right-hand man Steven Robinson – while the unrelenting demands of being a fashion designer never abate. In one particularly revealing section, Galliano describes working on more than 32 collections a year. Exacerbating the melancholy are black-and-white clips from the 1927 silent film Napoléon – in part underlining Galliano's growing godlike complex, his \"Napoleonic display of ego\", in part a homage to Galliano's lifelong preoccupation with the figure. The dichotomy between the high and low is ever-present throughout the documentary. Galliano, the son of a plumber and the unlikely face of Dior, is seen as \"everything but a bourgeois\" by the French fashion establishment — even as he's flanked by Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss and Anna Wintour and is picketed for appropriating the aesthetic of homelessness in one of his shows. The dizzying, meteoric highs of delivering yet another critically acclaimed runway production are followed by the lowest of lows and multiple-day benders. The staggering, unattainable beauty of the clothes, narratives and fantasies that Galliano creates is complicated by the market imperative for art to be commodified and accessible to the very people that keep fashion houses in business. High & Low doesn't offer easy, or even compelling, answers to the reasons and consequences of a public figure behaving in a morally objectionable way. Galliano is once again a working designer, this time for small but reputable fashion house Maison Margiela, and he staged a hyperbolically received couture show in January. In Galliano, Macdonald has a theatrical, animated subject who's incredibly adept at narrativising his own life. But he also has an unreliable narrator whose testimonies are directly at odds with the word of many people who surrounded him at key junctures of his life. Right at the start of High & Low, Galliano boldly utters, \"I am going to tell you everything\", but in truth, he doesn't tell us much – whether due to inability or unwillingness is unclear. The coterie of high-profile models and tastemakers who stand by him attribute his anti-Semitism to his illness, to his addiction. Sidney Toledano, the Jewish chief executive of Dior at the time, muses that it may be because of his Catholic upbringing. Galliano himself doesn't know, and scarcely remembers two of the three inciting incidents. Washington Post critic Robin Givhan doesn't have an answer, but comes closest to articulating the consequences, or lack thereof, when people including Galliano behave objectionably: \"He's a white man.\" There are some pressing questions around Galliano: Does creative genius exempt moral shortcomings? Can we, should we, separate the art from the artist? Should people get second chances (or in Galliano's case, fourth chances)? And who gets to decide who deserves a second chance? Unfortunately, High & Low skirts around them all.",

Read unlimited articles for free today: Already have an account? The fate of a historic but structurally unsound 140-year-old downtown church is in question, but the property’s future won’t be. So says Bishop of Rupert’s Land Geoff Woodcroft, who recently granted permission to Holy Trinity Anglican Church’s congregation to explore the possibility of selling the property. The current cost of repairing the structure at 256 Smith St. — which is designated a Historic Site of Canada and a protected historical property by the city — is in the neighbourhood of $7 million. “I quite clearly have said it’s conditional on any buyer, partner, investor or developer to first, preserve and maintain the historic structure, second, to make space available for Holy Trinity to hold worship services, and third, to secure space and opportunity for the church to continue its important mission work,” Woodcroft told the , adding there are ongoing conversations to make those things a reality. “I want every effort to be made to ensure it continues to provide space for a worshipping body and to continue to do its mission work in the downtown.” The conditions of any sale include enabling parishioners to meet for Sunday services and also for the church to offer its weekly neighbourhood lunch program — which serves more than 10,000 meals a year — providing a regular social connection in addition to food for the hungry. A 1989 geographical survey determined the building, which was built without a foundation, has significant structural deficiencies. Woodcroft said he understands the serious nature of the problem, but is adamant the diocese will not accept bids to redevelop the site for a new condo tower, for example. The bishop would not say whether the building would be saved from demolition. “The minute the article came out (last week in the my inbox was flooded with emails from developers inquiring about buying the building,” he said. The bishop is looking at the situation from a theological perspective. “What does God want for the body of Christ in downtown Winnipeg?” he said. “I’m pretty sure it’s not another skyscraper so we can sell it and make money off to balance our budget.” He said he believes the diocese should think about ways it can continue to serve “people, nature and creation” downtown, perhaps in partnership with other area churches or businesses. Quoting Jesus in the Gospel of John, he said “we want everyone in the downtown to have life and have it abundantly, whether that’s through worship, music, meals. That’s our call.” And while he appreciates the beauty and historical significance of the building — considered a fine example of 19th-century Gothic Revival style — it would be a shame if it is only seen as a matter of losing a historic landmark, he said. Monday mornings The latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week. “It’s not just a building, but a way that God is using the body of Christ to serve people in the city, about God’s vision of abundance for the world,” he said. One model for Holy Trinity could be what happened at St. Matthews Anglican Church — now the WestEnd Commons — which was transformed into housing while keeping space for worship, he said. “But first we want to allow the church and others to dream about what Holy Trinity could be,” he said. According to Anglican church policy, all parishes own their own buildings and property, but need permission from the bishop to sell. All proceeds from the sale of churches goes to the diocese. faith@freepress.mb.ca John Longhurst has been writing for Winnipeg's faith pages since 2003.

        "description": "Here's what you need to know about Jalen Brunson's contract extension before he becomes eligible to put pen to paper",
        "content": "Jalen Brunson has the decision of a lifetime on his hands. If Brunson foregoes a contract extension with the Knicks this summer, he could be in line for a significant raise should he wait another season before inking a new deal. A massive pay raise worth the risk, however, is not a foregone conclusion. Here’s what you need to know about Brunson’s contract extension before he becomes eligible to put pen to paper when the season is over. July 12 marks the two-year anniversary to the date Brunson signed a four-year, $104 million contract leaving the Dallas Mavericks for the Knicks in free agency. The deal, along with many others for the Knicks front office, has been viewed as a large success. The Knicks have secured back-to-back second-round playoff appearances since Brunson signed. His 28.73 points per game in the 2023-4 season ranks third all-time in Knicks single-season scoring behind only Bernard King and Richie Guessing, meaning yes: Brunson’s campaign outpaced vaunted Knicks scorers Carmelo Anthony and Patrick Ewing. He also captained one of just 14 Knicks teams to ever reach the 50-win mark, powering New York to the Eastern Conference’s No. 2 seed for just the second time since Ewing in 1994 and the first time since Anthony in 2013. Not bad for a player whose salary ranked 53rd in all of basketball last season. Next season, Brunson will fall to 56th on the league-wide payroll list because his contract with the Knicks was frontloaded. He earned more in Year 1 ($27.73 million) than he will in Years 3 or 4 ($24.96 million). In fact, Brunson’s upcoming contract extension would be north of $17 million more lucrative if his contract was structured in a traditional manner paying more on the back end as opposed to the front. Instead, he will be eligible for a 40 percent raise on the final year of his deal, or a four-year contract extension worth $156.5 million. The payout schedule could look as follows: In this instance, Brunson would decline the player option on the fourth and final year (worth $24.96 million) of his current contract and these extension years would follow Year 3 on his current deal (also worth $24.96 million). His contract would essentially become a five-year deal in New York worth $181 million. The Knicks will own Brunson’s Larry Bird rights at the conclusion of his third full season played in New York. This will allow the Knicks to exceed the salary cap to re-sign Brunson to his maximum salary, which is 30 percent of the cap for players with seven-to-nine years of experience, and 35 percent of the cap for players who meet the higher-max criteria of making All-NBA either the year before signing the extension or two of the three years prior to the season before singing the extension. Brunson, for example, would be eligible for the supermax of 35 percent of the cap if he earned All-NBA honors again next season. That would be a five-year, $314.85 million deal, worth more than double the amount of the four-year, $156.5 million extension currently awaiting the All-Star guard this summer. All-NBA honors, however, are not a foregone conclusion. Brunson, for example, made Second Team All-NBA this season, but here are the players at his position who failed to qualify for the voting process due to not meeting the NBA’s new 65-game requirement for end-of-the-season awards and honors: And since All-NBA teams are now positionless, you can add Joel Embiid (Philadelphia 76ers), Karl-Anthony Towns (Minnesota Timberwolves), Kristaps Porzingis (Boston Celtics) and New York’s own Julius Randle as players who did not play 65 games last season that Brunson would now be competing against for All-NBA honors. If Brunson failed to make an All-NBA team next year, he would remain eligible for a deal worth 30 percent of the cap, a five-year deal worth $269.8 million. It’s about $114 million more than he could get if he signs the extension this summer. Brunson’s season ended on a fractured left hand , and an injury next season without a contract guarantee would put the star Knicks guard in a disadvantageous bargaining position. Brunson might not earn what his All-Star caliber peers are generating, but Jeff Van Gundy once famously said while calling a game “comparison is the thief of joy,” and few things bring Brunson more joy than winning basketball games. Taking a pay cut, though it’s a 40 percent raise, will give the Knicks more flexibility to pursue an additional max-salary level player after Brunson’s extension kicks in. Brunson is only one player the Knicks have decisions to make on this offseason. After trading Immanuel Quickley, R.J. Barrett and pick No. 31 in the upcoming 2024 NBA Draft, the Knicks must re-sign OG Anunoby to a long-term deal. They must figure out what the center position looks like with Isaiah Hartenstein entering free agency with his value having doubled since the season began and Mitchell Robinson undergoing his second stress reaction surgery on his left ankle in a five-month span. The Knicks must also decide on a course of action with the pair of first-round picks (Nos. 24 and 25) in the upcoming draft. They must also make a decision on Randle, the three-time All-Star perpetually included in trade rumors. Brunson signing the extension now gives the Knicks and their fans one fewer thing to worry about. Though you can’t fault someone for betting on themselves. After all, there’s $114 million on the table if Brunson decides he wants to go and get it. And there’s $181 million staring him in the face the moment he becomes eligible to sign the extension on July 12.",

        "description": "The company, which is a minority-owned federal contractor, will pay a penalty and be monitored to ensure compliance with U.S. anti-discrimination laws.",
        "content": "The U.S. Department of Labor and the Justice Department have reached an agreement with a Virginia-based IT staffing firm after finding a job posting discriminatory. Here, the Labor Department building is seen in Washington, D.C. Alex Edelman/AFP via Getty Images hide caption A job posting that included race and citizenship requirements — and the stipulation, “Don’t share with candidates” — has resulted in settlement agreements between Virginia-based IT staffing firm Arthur Grand Technologies Inc. and the U.S. government. Under the arrangement, Arthur Grand will pay a civil penalty of $7,500, along with a total of $31,000 to 31 people who complained about the posting. The company — which is minority-owned and a federal contractor designated a disadvantaged business — will also be monitored to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws. “It is shameful that in the 21st century, we continue to see employers using ‘whites only’ and ‘only US born’ job postings to lock out otherwise eligible job candidates of color,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, which announced the agreements . Arthur Grand “neither admits nor denies any violation,” the Department of Labor’s agreement states . But in a message to NPR, Arthur Grand CEO Sheik Rahmathullah said his company \"vehemently denies any guilt or wrongdoing.\" The job posting was made by a rogue employee, he said. The job posting sparked outrage and accusations of discrimination when it circulated online last year , reading, “Only Born US Citizens [White] who are local within 60 miles from Dallas, TX [Don’t share with candidates].” The words in brackets are not paraphrases; they appeared in brackets in the posting, the Justice Department noted. Arthur Grand Technologies was seeking someone to work in a “Salesforce Business Analyst and Insurance Claims position,” the Labor Department said. The job was to be based in Dallas. The business analyst position \"would serve two clients, HTC Global an information technology company based in Troy, Michigan, and Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational holding company based in Omaha, Nebraska,\" the DOJ stated, citing the job listing. The DOJ said Arthur Grand’s listing in March of 2023 violated the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Labor Department said the company also violated a long-standing executive order barring federal contractors from discriminating based on race, national origin and other protected characteristics. In its separate agreement with Arthur Grand , the Labor Department says it also found other violations, saying the company didn’t have records tracking demographic characteristics of job applicants, such as their gender, race or ethnicity; and that the company didn’t post a notice of workers’ equal employment opportunity rights in conspicuous places. “We are committed to holding federal contractors accountable for outrageous discriminatory practices like this advertisement,” said Acting Director Michele Hodge of the Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). “Companies like Arthur Grand, that accept federal contracts, cannot have a ‘whites only’ hiring process.” The Labor Department's agreement with the company includes a form letter to be sent to people who complained about Arthur Grand. They're told that if they want to take part in the agreement, they must sign a document reading in part, “I understand that AGT denies that it treated me unlawfully or unfairly in any way.” By signing the document and receiving payment, the letter states, the complainants also agree not to file a lawsuit against the company. Rahmathullah emphasized that Arthur Grand did not admit any guilt or wrongdoing, telling NPR that the staffing firm agreed to the DOJ and Labor deals \"solely to avoid the significant financial toll and prolonged disruption that litigation would impose on our company.\" \"Arthur Grand Technologies vehemently denies any guilt or wrongdoing in relation to the discriminatory job posting,\" Rahmathullah said. The job notice was an \"unauthorized posting,\" he added. When the company became aware of what had happened, Rahmathullah said, \"we took immediate and decisive action to ensure that this type of incident will never happen again, including the immediate termination of the responsible employee.\" The CEO added, \"we sincerely apologize for any harm caused by this incident and are committed to making meaningful changes to maintain the trust and confidence of our community and stakeholders.\" The Justice Department acknowledged in its settlement agreement that the company had denied approving the job posting, with Arthur Grand asserting “that the posted advertisement was generated by a disgruntled recruiter in India and was intended to embarrass the company,” according to the DOJ. It’s an IT staffing firm, based in Ashburn, Va., a suburb of Washington, D.C. The company's listed address corresponds to a two-story office complex about 10 miles north of Dulles International Airport. Its neighbors include dental and orthodontics offices, and an insurance company. \"We take pride in the fact that all the senior leadership positions in our company are held by persons of color, and over 80% of our staff are also people of color,\" Rahmathullah told NPR. According to U.S. government records , Arthur Grand is certified as a Small Disadvantaged Business in the roster of federal contractors. To qualify for that status, a majority of the company must be owned by “one or more disadvantaged persons,” who must also be “socially disadvantaged and economically disadvantaged.” “Each year, the Federal Government awards about 10% of all federal contract dollars, or roughly $50 billion in contracts, to Small Disadvantaged Businesses,” according to the Small Business Administration .",

        "content": "AS Jarvis Cocker and Pulp once sang, Do You Remember The First Time? Well, the great and the good of British pop are recalling their rocky first gigs, early feuds and years of slumming it in dingy squats in a new documentary series. The Disney+ show, called Camden, charts a course through the heyday of Britpop and explores how North London district Camden became a musical Mecca for those looking to make their name. It is executive-produced by local girl turned superstar Dua Lipa , 28. The singer, who was ten when she moved to Camden from Kosovo , reveals in the show how nearby club Koko — the first UK venue to host a Madonna gig in 1983 — was “like my home base”. There are also contributions from Boy George , Will.i.am and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who says that in the Nineties, the scene felt like “an indie X Factor”. He adds: “One night, at one of our gigs, it became clear at about 7pm that all the record companies were going to come because a load of young to middle-aged white men, all on cocaine and drinking beer , showed up. “They looked like a tribe, which they were, because they were all friends with each other and all competed for the same artists.” Here, we share recollections from some of the biggest bands from over the decades about making their name in what has been dubbed the “most rock’n’roll neighbourhood on Earth”. DUAL frontmen Pete Doherty and Carl Barat formed the Libertines while living together in Camden Road, topping and tailing in a single bed with no covers. And the pair would often put on impromptu “guerilla gigs” at their flat, sometimes with less than an hour’s notice. Carl, 45, says: “Peter’s parents were in an Army base so they’d always come home and bring supplies, like crates of beer and cigarillos, cigars and frankfurter sausages. “So we made a bar and invited everyone in Camden.” Pete, 45, adds: “I’d say to Carl, ‘Look, don’t get the hump, but I’ve put online we’re doing a gig in the front room in an hour’. “He’d be fuming, like, ‘What are you talking about? I’ve got my washing drying!’. “Like basic things, perfectly reasonable, but he’d still do it.” As the Libertines got more popular, fans would cram into the living room and the police would turn up. Carl says: “The front door ended up broken and we had to climb through a window. “We finally got booted out when we nicked all the money out of the electricity meter. I do look back and think, ‘Jesus, that was disgusting, I wouldn’t do that again’. “But then also think, if you’re an artist, you need to live your life before you can write about it. “And those formative times you have are everything.” THE Good Mixer was the place to be for anyone in the Britpop crowd during the Nineties. The toilets in the small, two-roomed Irish bar are even said to be where Oasis and Blur’s feud first began — with Oasis singer Liam Gallagher saying to Blur guitarist Graham Coxon: “Nice music, s**t clothes.” Liam’s brother Noel, 56, says: “As I remember it, we were just good-naturedly ribbing Graham Coxon. “But it turns out it probably wasn’t that good-natured.” And Blur were not the only band Liam, 51, clashed with there. The Libertines’ Pete Doherty and Carl Barat recall seeing Oasis propping up the bar there during their heyday. But when they went over to try to talk to Liam, Carl says: “He kept knocking me out the way, like it was his defence mechanism.” Pete adds: “I was like, ‘Liam, we’ve got a basement round the corner, you should come and play some stuff’. “He goes, ‘Mate, I don’t do that sort of thing because I’m the devil’s d**k’. “That was the best thing I’d ever heard. But a bit disappointing, as well.” THE singer, who died in 2011 at the age of 27, lived in the borough and was a regular drinker at The Hawley Arms, where she would hop behind the bar to pull pints. Amy’s former manager, Nick Shymansky, says in the documentary: “Genuinely, from the moment I heard her voice, and met her, I was completely convinced. “I had no doubt she was the best of the best.” He adds: “The big record at the time was the Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill and not long after I heard Amy’s demo, I remember instantly going this is as good as Lauryn Hill, if not better. “So whatever I do, I have to work with this artist. “The first deal we did was a publishing deal and she got her cheque and was like, ‘Right, I’m going to buy a flat in Camden’, and then a whole new thing opened up. “Her idea of a good night would be to see someone live, play some pool, have a cocktail, go back, roll a spliff, play music until 2 or 3 in the morning, and not get up until lunchtime the next day.” Nick adds that when success came for Amy, however, it wasn’t enough. He explains: “The first record wasn’t full of hit songs and maybe it hadn’t fulfilled her in the way she was hoping it would. “That was the moment where this void opened up and as an artist I think she wanted to be seen as someone a little bit more exciting and edgy. “Camden at that point was probably quite a dangerous place for someone like her to live. “She started to go out to the pubs , the drink maybe turned into a line. It was her nature of drinking people under the table, the ‘I can do more drugs, I can be more wild, I can be more dangerous’ attitude. “She got lost in it.” IRISH pub The Dublin Castle is famous for having hosted everyone from Blur to The Killers and Arctic Monkeys. Its legendary status dates back to 1979 when the late Alo Conlon, landlord at the time, decided to indulge seven teenagers claiming to be a jazz band. That band was a local rabble known as Madness. Frontman Suggs, 63, recalls: “We’d been into a lot of pubs, so this was like our last chance. We walked in and it was like being in Cork. “They asked what sort of music we played and we said country and western, thinking it’s going to go down better with an Irish crowd. “Then Woody, at the back, helpfully chipped in with, ‘And a bit of jazz’.” They were given a trial slot for that Wednesday — and “they packed us out,” says current landlord Henry Conlon. He adds: “I remember being in the back bar peeping over at these young skinheads.” Madness then got a residency at the pub, with queues out the door every Wednesday. Suggs says: “It was 75p to get in, so we’d get a fiver each. “One night I put my foot through the monitor and that was 40 quid so we all went home skint.” The band later filmed the video for hit 1979 single My Girl at the pub. In it, Alo can be seen at the start, referring to himself as “the governor”. ALONG with their Oasis bandmates, Noel and Liam Gallagher moved to London just as they were becoming famous in the early Nineties. “We were all pretty broke,” Noel says. “I loved it in Camden, in pubs drinking Guinness, f***ing talking s**t. “There’s a bit where we were in the same circumstances as the crowd coming to watch our gigs, and roughly the same age. “You all wear the same clothes, you’re in your 20s, no baggage, no kids. No one’s coming in because they’ve heard Wonderwall on the radio.” He adds: “We were into making money and having a good time and all of the girls and drugs and all of that”. But they soon hit the big time. Liam and his then-wife Patsy Kensit , 56, moved to posh Primrose Hill, while Noel and his then-wife Meg Mathews, 58, were in nearby Steele’s Road. Their seven-bedroom mansion, affectionately named Supernova Heights, was where the Primrose Hill set — which included actor Jude Law and model Kate Moss — would throw outrageous parties, packed to the brim with A-list stars. But Noel recalls that one time fans managed to gatecrash. He says: “Someone thought they were my mates, and I thought they were someone else’s. “Turns out they were a random group of indie kids who’d followed us back from the bar, wearing Doc Martens and jackets. “They’d just wandered in and sat there for hours. I was like, ‘Can you f*** off then?’.”",

ALONG with their Oasis bandmates, Noel and Liam Gallagher moved to London just as they were becoming famous in the early Nineties. “We were all pretty broke,” Noel says. “I loved it in Camden, in pubs drinking Guinness, f***ing talking s**t. “There’s a bit where we were in the same circumstances as the crowd coming to watch our gigs, and roughly the same age. “You all wear the same clothes, you’re in your 20s, no baggage, no kids. No one’s coming in because they’ve heard Wonderwall on the radio.” He adds: “We were into making money and having a good time and all of the girls and drugs and all of that”. But they soon hit the big time. Liam and his then-wife Patsy Kensit, 56, moved to posh Primrose Hill, while Noel and his then-wife Meg Mathews, 58, were in nearby Steele’s Road. Their seven-bedroom mansion, affectionately named Supernova Heights, was where the Primrose Hill set — which included actor Jude Law and model Kate Moss — would throw outrageous parties, packed to the brim with A-list stars. But Noel recalls that one time fans managed to gatecrash. He says: “Someone thought they were my mates, and I thought they were someone else’s. “Turns out they were a random group of indie kids who’d followed us back from the bar, wearing Doc Martens and jackets. “They’d just wandered in and sat there for hours. I was like, ‘Can you f*** off then?’.”",

        "content": "Nicki Minaj is performing in Amsterdam the night before her newly rescheduled show at Manchester's Co-op Live. The American rapper announced that she would be bringing her Pink Friday 2 tour back to Manchester on the new date of June 3 . It comes after the 41-year-old was detained by authorities at Amsterdam airport on Saturday night (May 25) for allegedly 'possessing soft drugs' when police searched her luggage, as she was set to fly to Manchester . She was later fined by Dutch police. She said spent around six hours in custody after being arrested at the Schiphol Airport, before eventually being able to fly to the UK for her gig at Co-op Live arena. READ MORE Nicki Minaj confirms new date for postponed Co-op Live show But over two hours after fans had been let into the music venue, promoter Live Nation then announced to thousands of fans already inside the concert was being postponed and would be rescheduled . Posting to X on Monday (May 27), the star wrote: \"OK guys, I was JUST RE-ADVISED that we actually CAN NOT do any other date for the make up #gagcityMANCHESTER date besides JUNE 3rd. So JUNE 3rd is the new official date for all ticket holders who originally had tickets to the MAY 25th #Manchester show. \"I apologize for all the inconvenience this has caused. I really hope you can make the #JUNE3rd show. It’ll be really special. Ticketmaster will contact you to advise officially.\" However fans then comically pointed out that Minaj is actually back in Amsterdam again the night before, at the Ziggo Dome, on June 2. \"And she’s in Amsterdam on the 2nd June too...\" one person commented on social media as another wrote: \"Don’t get arrested now.\" A third posted: \"The venue and her ...What could possibly go wrong.\" After the announcement of the new date, fans also took to X, as one wrote: \"June 3rd is gonna be another Manchester date after Amsterdam...I’m kinda scared.\" Another posted: \"Amsterdam police have the opportunity to do the funniest thing ever\" as a third shared: \"Nicki your in Amsterdam the day before we don’t wanna have the same problems I think you should change it.\" The rapper's gig, at the Co-op Live in Manchester on Saturday, had been first thrown into doubt after Minaj posted on X that she had been detained by police for items in her luggage at 3pm. Six hours later, fans were still waiting inside the venue for an update as to whether she would make it or not. Crowds leaving the Co-op Live Arena following the postponement of Nicki Minaj's concert (Image: Lottie Gibbons) During the chaos, Minaj put a series of social media posts on X saying 'they're trying to keep me from MANCHESTER'. In a string of posts on her profile, she said that her luggage has been taken at the airport while travelling from Amsterdam to attend the gig. The star has since promised an 'added surprise bonus' for fans at the newly scheduled gig on June 3, and said she was 'looking forward' to returning to Manchester for an already planned second night at Co-op Live on Thursday.",

        "content": "AS Jarvis Cocker and Pulp once sang, Do You Remember The First Time? Well, the great and the good of British pop are recalling their rocky first gigs, early feuds and years of slumming it in dingy squats in a new documentary series. 9 Pete Doherty, left, recalls meeting Liam Gallagher in a new Disney+ documentary about the music scene in Camden Credit: PA 9 Rocker Liam pictured with then-wife Patsy Kensit Credit: Getty The Disney+ show, called Camden, charts a course through the heyday of Britpop and explores how North London district Camden became a musical Mecca for those looking to make their name. It is executive-produced by local girl turned superstar Dua Lipa , 28. The singer, who was ten when she moved to Camden from Kosovo , reveals in the show how nearby club Koko — the first UK venue to host a Madonna gig in 1983 — was “like my home base”. There are also contributions from Boy George, Will.i.am and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who says that in the Nineties, the scene felt like “an indie X Factor”. He adds: “One night, at one of our gigs, it became clear at about 7pm that all the record companies were going to come because a load of young to middle-aged white men, all on cocaine and drinking beer, showed up. “They looked like a tribe, which they were, because they were all friends with each other and all competed for the same artists.” Here, we share recollections from some of the biggest bands from over the decades about making their name in what has been dubbed the “most rock’n’roll neighbourhood on Earth”. Camden is available to stream on Disney+ from tomorrow.

And the pair would often put on impromptu “guerilla gigs” at their flat, sometimes with less than an hour’s notice. 9 Pete Doherty and Carl Barat formed The Libertines together in Camden Credit: Getty Iconic Nineties band reveal new music and tour as they reunite with Oasis star 30 years after split Carl, 45, says: “Peter’s parents were in an Army base so they’d always come home and bring supplies, like crates of beer and cigarillos, cigars and frankfurter sausages. “So we made a bar and invited everyone in Camden.” Pete, 45, adds: “I’d say to Carl, ‘Look, don’t get the hump, but I’ve put online we’re doing a gig in the front room in an hour’. “He’d be fuming, like, ‘What are you talking about? I’ve got my washing drying!’. “Like basic things, perfectly reasonable, but he’d still do it.” As the Libertines got more popular, fans would cram into the living room and the police would turn up. Carl says: “The front door ended up broken and we had to climb through a window. “We finally got booted out when we nicked all the money out of the electricity meter. I do look back and think, ‘Jesus, that was disgusting, I wouldn’t do that again’. “But then also think, if you’re an artist, you need to live your life before you can write about it. “And those formative times you have are everything.” BLUR MIX WITH THE ENEMY THE Good Mixer was the place to be for anyone in the Britpop crowd during the Nineties. The toilets in the small, two-roomed Irish bar are even said to be where Oasis and Blur’s feud first began — with Oasis singer Liam Gallagher saying to Blur guitarist Graham Coxon: “Nice music, s**t clothes.” 9 Dave Rowntree, Graham Coxon, Damon Albarn And Alex James of Blur - the series looks into their feud with Oasis Credit: Getty Liam’s brother Noel, 56, says: “As I remember it, we were just good-naturedly ribbing Graham Coxon. “But it turns out it probably wasn’t that good-natured.” And Blur were not the only band Liam, 51, clashed with there. The Libertines’ Pete Doherty and Carl Barat recall seeing Oasis propping up the bar there during their heyday. But when they went over to try to talk to Liam, Carl says: “He kept knocking me out the way, like it was his defence mechanism.” Pete adds: “I was like, ‘Liam, we’ve got a basement round the corner, you should come and play some stuff’. “He goes, ‘Mate, I don’t do that sort of thing because I’m the devil’s d**k’. “That was the best thing I’d ever heard. But a bit disappointing, as well.” DANGEROUS PLACE FOR AMY THE singer, who died in 2011 at the age of 27, lived in the borough and was a regular drinker at The Hawley Arms, where she would hop behind the bar to pull pints. Amy’s former manager, Nick Shymansky, says in the documentary: “Genuinely, from the moment I heard her voice, and met her, I was completely convinced. 9 Singer Amy Winehouse, right, was a regular drinker at the Hawley Arms pub in Camden Credit: Alamy 9 Her former manager admits the district became a dangerous place for someone like her to live Credit: Alamy “I had no doubt she was the best of the best.” He adds: “The big record at the time was the Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill and not long after I heard Amy’s demo, I remember instantly going this is as good as Lauryn Hill, if not better. “So whatever I do, I have to work with this artist. “The first deal we did was a publishing deal and she got her cheque and was like, ‘Right, I’m going to buy a flat in Camden’, and then a whole new thing opened up. “Her idea of a good night would be to see someone live, play some pool, have a cocktail, go back, roll a spliff, play music until 2 or 3 in the morning, and not get up until lunchtime the next day.” Nick adds that when success came for Amy, however, it wasn’t enough. He explains: “The first record wasn’t full of hit songs and maybe it hadn’t fulfilled her in the way she was hoping it would. “That was the moment where this void opened up and as an artist I think she wanted to be seen as someone a little bit more exciting and edgy. “Camden at that point was probably quite a dangerous place for someone like her to live. “She started to go out to the pubs, the drink maybe turned into a line. It was her nature of drinking people under the table, the ‘I can do more drugs, I can be more wild, I can be more dangerous’ attitude. “She got lost in it.” MADNESS EVERY WEEK IRISH pub The Dublin Castle is famous for having hosted everyone from Blur to The Killers and Arctic Monkeys. Its legendary status dates back to 1979 when the late Alo Conlon, landlord at the time, decided to indulge seven teenagers claiming to be a jazz band. 9 Suggs and the Madness gang pictured outside The Dublin Castle in 1981 Credit: News Group Newspapers Ltd That band was a local rabble known as Madness. Frontman Suggs, 63, recalls: “We’d been into a lot of pubs, so this was like our last chance. We walked in and it was like being in Cork. “They asked what sort of music we played and we said country and western, thinking it’s going to go down better with an Irish crowd. “Then Woody, at the back, helpfully chipped in with, ‘And a bit of jazz’.” They were given a trial slot for that Wednesday — and “they packed us out,” says current landlord Henry Conlon. He adds: “I remember being in the back bar peeping over at these young skinheads.” Madness then got a residency at the pub, with queues out the door every Wednesday. Suggs says: “It was 75p to get in, so we’d get a fiver each. “One night I put my foot through the monitor and that was 40 quid so we all went home skint.” The band later filmed the video for hit 1979 single My Girl at the pub. In it, Alo can be seen at the start, referring to himself as “the governor”. SUPERNOVA STARS ALONG with their Oasis bandmates, Noel and Liam Gallagher moved to London just as they were becoming famous in the early Nineties. “We were all pretty broke,” Noel says. 9 Noel Gallagher and then-wife Meg Matthews moved to Steele's Road after Oasis hit the big time Credit: Reuters “I loved it in Camden, in pubs drinking Guinness, f***ing talking s**t. “There’s a bit where we were in the same circumstances as the crowd coming to watch our gigs, and roughly the same age. “You all wear the same clothes, you’re in your 20s, no baggage, no kids.

        "content": "Wildlife enthusiasts ending up capturing more adventure than they bargained for on camera Sunday, when a foal got precariously close to a cliff near Sundre , Alta. Debbie McGauran and her grandson drove to the area near Mountain Aire Lodge, west of Sundre, which is about 120 kilometres northwest of Calgary, on Sunday afternoon. They were hoping to photograph some wild horses. The weather was unpredictable — it was pouring rains at times, McGuaran told Global News. Sometime between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., her grandson spotted a mare and a very new foal stuck on a steep hillside. The foal stumbled and got tangled in some branches, rolling dangerously close to the edge of a steep cliff. Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email, as it happens. Several other people were in the area taking photos of the wild horses. Story continues below advertisement A bystander, a man named Dustin, scrambled up the hillside and was able to carefully approach the stuck foal. In a video provided by McGauran, the man is seen waiting for the mare to retreat before pulling the baby horse away from the cliff edge and helping it get back on its feet. He then retreats and the mare returns, slowly guiding the foal around the hill and down to flatter ground, where several other horses were waiting. 1:46 Dramatic horse rescue west of Sundre, Alberta captured on video Dramatic horse rescue west of Sundre, Alberta captured on video Horse rescue group could see busiest year if economy doesn’t rebound Southern Alberta animal sanctuary struggles to feed rescue horses amid hay shortages Previous Video Next Video Related News Horse rescued after being stuck up to 10 hours in muddy ditch Alberta horse rescued from sewage pit dies with owners petting his neck Alberta horse rescue asking for help amid high quality hay shortage",

        "content": "Tweet Facebook Mail A banking code of conduct that would regulate branch closures similar to regulations in the UK would be a crucial way to safeguard access to cash for regional communities, according to a finance expert. A senate report released on Friday found more than 2100 bank branches were closed in Australia between 2017 and 2023 - almost 40 per cent of branches. It also found while the use of cash is declining across the economy, cash ﻿and face-to-face banking services remain important in regional and remote areas, during times of crisis and by the vulnerable, elderly and disabled.

(Reuters/Edgar Su/File Photo) The report listed eight recommendations including that ﻿the government recognises access to financial services as an \"essential service\" and that it creates a mandatory banking code of conduct, citing the UK model as an example. RMIT University finance researcher and associate professor Dr Angel Zhong supports a mandatory banking code of conduct in Australia that would require banks to consult with the community and seek regulatory approval before closing a branch. She cited the UK's \"three-mile rule\", where ﻿banks are required to provide free cash services within three miles (4.8km) for rural residents and one mile (1.6km) for urban dwellers. This doesn't necessarily have to be via a bank branch or ATM, but can also include shops that offer cash-out transactions for free and other alternatives.﻿ Introduced last year, the legislation aims to maintain current levels of access to cash across the UK by fining banks that fall below a minimum level of service.﻿ \"The UK's approach recognises that while digital payments are on the rise, cash remains essential for certain transactions,\" Zhong said. \"﻿By safeguarding access, they address the concerns of rural communities and vulnerable individuals.\"﻿ Australia's geography and distribution of population makes the three-mile rule difficult to replicate in Australia, an Australian Banking Association spokesperson told 9news.com.au. \"Australia has unique geographical challenges with cash distribution that many other countries don't face,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"Australia for example is 32 times the size of the United Kingdom. \"The banking sector remains committed to ensuring cash continues to be accessible to customers. \"Banks provide fee-free ATM withdrawals at 85 of Australia's most remote communities. \"Banks also pay for cash services to be available at around 1800 regional Bank@Post locations.\" The senate report's recommendations also include the expansion of Bank@Post services with Australia Post as well as the establishment of a community banking program and examining the feasibility of a publicly owned bank.﻿ Given the history of state-owned banks within Australia, Zhong said that option should be a \"last resort\". \"I think (the mandatory code of conduct) is a better approach to strike a balance between preserving the value of taxpayers' money and also ensuring that within Australia, Australians have access to cash and banking facilities.\"",
