        "content": "The Nigerian Senate, on Monday cleared Dr. Emomotimi Agama as the Director-General of the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). President Bola Tinubu had on April 19 this year appointed Agama as the DG of SEC to take over from Lamido Yuguda. The Senate Committee on Capital Market, chaired by Senator Osita Izunaso, also approved the nomination of all three Executive Commissioners namely: Frana Chukwuogor, Legal and Enforcement; Bola Ajomale, Operations; and Mrs. Samiya Usman, Corporate Services. Agama’s appointment has been hailed by capital market stakeholders who described him as a technocrat that would boost the birthing of the Tinubu administration’s $1 trillion economy. Speaking shortly after his confirmation, Agama, a technocrat and insider of the commission said he will accelerate the development of the capital market in a manner that would boost wealth creation, attract investments and create jobs for Nigerians. According to him, he was appointed to change the narrative of the capital market and reposition it to the path that would boost economic growth, stressing that “we are bringing on board innovation, development. We are going to change the narrative of the Nigerian capital market. We are going to turn it around. That is the essence of our appointment by Mr. President. With this team, we assure Nigerians that we’re going to do the best that the President has the desire to do. “So, we should all wait to see what is going to happen. Our desire is to move this market forward. And to help in achieving the President’s $1tn economy in the shortest possible time. “Yes, the President is going to be a year in office in a few days. That is remarkable because as an anniversary giver, the President has given us to Nigerians to do the best to change the market,” he added The new DG noted that the commission would implement innovative policies and programmes that will create world-class companies in such a way that will ensure redistribution of wealth. Continuing, Agama said: “you must understand that the capital market is actually the barometer of any economy. And without a strong capital market, then, of course, the economy will not do very well. The intention of this management is to make sure that we mainstream the capital market in the Nigerian economy. “And in doing that, we’re going to be able to provide employment, change the narrative, and create companies that are going to be top world-class companies in such a way that there will be what we call redistribution of wealth. “The President has an intention to change the lives of Nigerians. And the capital market is one of the vehicles that the President intends to use to achieve that. That is why the President has set up a team like this to be able to do that,” he stressed.",

In a statement to mark the 2024 children’s day celebration made available to newsmen by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Nsa Gill, he quoted the Governor saying, “You are the future of our state and the pillars of our society. Your innocence, creativity, and boundless energy bring joy and hope to our lives. Our responsibility is to nurture and guide you so you can reach your full potential and contribute positively to our state’s growth and development.” Governor Otu maintained that he wants the Children to know that as the Governor, he is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for all to thrive. “My administration’s continuous investment in education, healthcare, and infrastructure is to ensure children can access the best opportunities and resources. “Our State is richly endowed in agriculture, and this administration has already taken steps to make agriculture the mainstay of our economy.” The Governor, in his statement, urged the children to continue to dream big and work hard towards achieving their goals. In his words, he said, “Remember that there is no limit to what you can achieve with determination, resilience, and a positive attitude. “I also want to express my gratitude to all parents, teachers, and caregivers who play crucial roles in shaping the lives of our children. Your dedication and love are instrumental in their growth and success. “As we celebrate this year’s Children’s Day, I charge you to remember the less fortunate children in our society and strive to impact their lives positively. “Once again, I wish you all a happy Children’s Day. May you continue to be a source of joy and inspiration to us all. Keep shining bright and making us proud,” Governor Otu concluded.",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 Tourism in Japan has witnessed an unprecedented surge, with the country’s rich heritage, breathtaking landscapes, and unique experiences attracting visitors from across the globe. However, this influx of travellers has brought about unforeseen challenges, as Japan grapples with the delicate task of preserving its cherished cultural traditions while accommodating the growing tourism demand. As iconic destinations bear the brunt of overcrowding and disrespectful behaviour, the nation finds itself at a crossroads, seeking to strike a balance between welcoming guests and safeguarding its way of life. As per a news channel, recently, tourists have been banned from certain private streets in Kyoto’s famous historic Gion district, traditionally home to the teahouses where geisha (geiko) and maiko (apprentice geiko) performers work, largely due to antisocial behaviour. A video titled “Don’t do this in Kyoto” shows a tourist intruding on a geisha’s privacy by filming her persistently.",

        "content": "A Tory MP who is leaving Parliament has quit the party and backed Reform UK in the seat she is vacating. Outgoing Telford MP Lucy Allan said Reform’s Alan Adams would offer an alternative to “more of the same politics and more of the same politicians”. The Tory Party responded by suspending her with immediate effect, but she said she had resigned to support Mr Adams rather than Conservative Hannah Campbell. I am supporting Alan Adams to be Telford’s next MP. If you want to help Alan or donate to his campaign, sign up on his website — Lucy Allan (@lucyallan) Ms Allan said: “I have resigned from the Conservative Party to support Alan Adams to be Telford’s next MP. “I have known Alan for many years and he is genuinely the best person for the job. I want the best for Telford and I can’t just let the Labour candidate have a walkover.” She won Telford in 2019 with a majority of 10,941, but in 2017 the Conservatives won by just 720 – and she first won the seat in 2015 with a majority of 730. Ms Allan said: “Alan is not in it for personal advantage, power, or control over people. Alan’s motivation for standing for election is profoundly honourable. He will be honest with Telford and put Telford first. “Alan gives Telford a choice, so that Telford does not have to settle for more of the same politics and more of the same politicians.” A Conservative Party spokesman said: “Lucy Allan has been suspended from the party with immediate effect. “The people of Telford now have the chance to vote for a dedicated and hardworking new candidate who will put Telford first. A vote for Reform is a vote for Keir Starmer.” A Reform spokesman said: “Of course we are absolutely delighted that she is backing our candidate in Telford. “She, like many Conservatives, feels that the Reform party represents traditional centre-right values and priorities in a way that the Conservative Party has long forgotten.” It is the latest sign of unrest within the Tory ranks following Rishi Sunak’s decision to call an early General Election.

Asked about the claim he would move to California, he told ITV News: “It’s simply not true. I mean, it’s just simply not true.” Southampton fan Mr Sunak added: “This is my home. I mean, my football team just got promoted back in the Premiership and I hope to be watching them for years to come in the Premier League.”",

        "content": "Some concerned natives of Amichi in Nnewi South Local Government Area (LGA), Anambra State have sought intervention of governor Chukwuma Soludo to end an alleged intimidation and harassment of the community’s traditional ruler, Igwe Dr. Ofobuike Ezeoke by land grabbers. According to them, a certain land the monarch inherited from his father, Igwe Alphonsus, is being dragged by some prominent indigenes of the town who were allegedly bent on using the law enforcement agents and thugs to intimidate him and his supporters, especially his Personal Assistant, Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke. They spoke in a statement signed by their leader, Chief Ogbonna Ogbonna, adding that a High Court in Nnewi had on 14th of May 2024 issued an order restraining some persons from entering the land which the Igwe claims to had inherited from his late father through a Supreme Court judgment believed to have been delivered in November 1961 under Suit No. FSC 27/61. “Unfortunately, the prominent persons had even gone ahead to start selling parts of the land for building an estate. A transporter from the community in connivance with political appointee and others had also contracted a Catholic Bishop to build on the disputed land despite court orders. On Saturday, 18th May 2024, they arrested Chief Eric Ume-Ezeoke on trumped up charges and had been dragging him around. “They tried installing another Igwe just to humiliate and oust Igwe Ofobuike but Anambra State government turned them down. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi. “Our Igwe is a peaceful man. He told us that he does not want to waste the blood of any individual in Amichi because of the land regardless of the temptation to do so. He had called on the court to ward off trespass from the land since the Supreme Court adjudged and decreed that it rightly belonged to his father,” the statement alleged. We are calling on other prominent stakeholders in Amichi to rise to protect their Igwe against two or three rich men that are trying to pull him down because of land. The town has been torn apart because the rich men feel that Igwe Ofobuike should not inherit such massive 6,000 plots of land. Our governor, Professor Chukwuma Soludo should also investigate this matter and take appropriate steps towards calling the perpetrators to order for peace to reign in Amichi.",

        "content": "The Kasturba Marg Police in Mumbai arrested a 46-year-old man on Sunday for allegedly impersonating a officer and demanding money from a ration shop owner in Borivali East, the police said. The accused, identified as Wardhan Salunkhe, was produced in court on Monday, where he was remanded to police custody for four days, an official said. ADVERTISEMENT According to the Kasturba Marg police, a week ago, Salunkhe had approached 77-year-old Dinanath Kaluste's shop at Shanti Niwas in Borivali East and threatened to fine him Rs. 1 lakh, accusing him of selling ration illegally. Kaluste pleaded with Salunkhe not to impose the fine, at which point Salunkhe demanded Rs. 20,000. Kaluste negotiated and paid Salunkhe Rs. 10,000 after Salunkhe flashed his ID card, the police said. On Sunday, Salunkhe returned to Kaluste's shop and began recording a video on his mobile phone, accusing Kaluste of irregularities. This time, Kaluste sensed foul play and asked Salunkhe to show his ID card again. \"Kaluste saw that the government stamp on the ID card was missing, which raised his suspicion,\" said a officer. Kaluste then gathered a few other rationing shop owners, who discovered that there was no one named Wardhan Salunkhe working at the FDA. The shop owners alerted the police, who arrested Salunkhe under sections 420 (cheating) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.",

        "content": "Alstom – Coradia iLint, the first hydrogen-powered train in service in the Americas, finalist in Fast Company’s 2024 World Changing Ideas list. Alstom, global leader in smart and sustainable mobility, announced today that , the first hydrogen-powered train in revenue service in the Americas, ranked finalist in Fast Company’s 2024 World Changing Ideas list. Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas list highlights ambitious projects that are helping shape the world. “We are proud that the Coradia iLint, the first hydrogen train in revenue service in the Americas, has been recognized on the list of Fast Company World Changing Ideas,” said Michael Keroullé, President Alstom Americas. “This is a testament to green energy innovation happening across the Americas, and to the expertise of suppliers and staff at Alstom who are working every day to bring low-carbon transportation options to communities around the globe.” “I was struck this year by the global sweep of the honorees,” says Fast Company editor-in-chief Brendan Vaughan. “It’s endlessly inspiring to see how the world is coming together to devise inventive solutions to our most challenging problems. We need ideas from everywhere, and this year’s World Changing Ideas Awards are an extraordinary encapsulation of the innovation and creativity that is so abundant around the globe.” President Alstom Americas, said: We congratulate the winner in the Transportation category, as well as other finalists and nominees. We are delighted to have been ranked in the top 5 among such innovative transportation projects. Alstom’s Coradia iLint is the first hydrogen-powered train to carry ticketed passengers in the Americas. It transported over 10,000 passengers in a demonstration project in that ran from mid-June to the end of September 2023. Alstom’s Green Innovation Centre partnered with Train de Charlevoix, Accelera by Cummins, HTEC, Harnois Energies and institutional partners, as well as the Quebec Government and the Hydrogen Research Institute of the Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières. These partnerships created an agile turnkey operation and ecosystem, enabled to deliver this successful demonstration project. The hydrogen fuel cell-powered train emits only water and can produce its electricity through green hydrogen made from renewable resources. The Coradia iLint enables sustainable train operation while ensuring the highest levels of performance and comfort. Over the span of four months, the Coradia iLint saved 8,400 liters of diesel and averted the emission of 22 tons of CO2 in comparison to the same number of trips made by a diesel train in the UNESCO’s Biosphere Reserve of Charlevoix, where Train de Charlevoix operates. In addition, Alstom and its partners welcomed thirty-four commercial, governmental and regulatory delegations from all over North America to experience this hydrogen-propulsion technology, setting the stage for wider implementation of green transit across North America. The Coradia iLint was also the first hydrogen-powered train in the world in passenger service, and we have now reached 2.8 million km in service in total on hydrogen. Alstom was listed as one of Fast Company’s World’s in March 2024, and the Coradia iLint demonstration project in the Americas also won the Environmental Sustainability Award, and the 2023 from the Canadian Hydrogen Convention.

The bloc wants to ditch Russian natural gas ideally by 2027, but it will not have weaned off all natural gas by that date, so it could hit the suppliers on which it would depend the most for gas later this decade. “With Europe importing a large part of the fossil energy it consumes, the regulation will also help to reduce methane emissions from imported fossil fuels,” the European Commission said today after the Council adopted the rules. “The regulation will progressively introduce more stringent requirements to ensure that exporters gradually apply the same monitoring, reporting and verification obligations as EU operators,” the Commission added. “To meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and achieving climate neutrality by 2050, we must cut methane emissions in the oil, gas, and coal sectors. This legislation ensures proper monitoring and addressing of emissions across these value chains,” said Tinne Van der Straeten, the Energy Minister of Belgium, which holds the EU rotating presidency in the first half of the year. if(window.innerWidth ADVERTISEMENTfreestar.config.enabled_slots.push({ placementName: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\", slotId: \"oilprice_medrec_btf\" });`;document.write(write_html);} The European Commission for Energy, Kadri Simson, said, “With the final EU adoption of the methane regulation we now have means to get clearer insight into the main sources of methane emissions in the energy sector. This will increase transparency and provide the tools necessary to reduce these potent emissions, both in the EU and globally.” The Commission will review the application of the regulation in 2028, including the level of emissions reduction achieved.

        "description": "A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century.",
        "content": "Want to get to Broadway? Go into the Army first. That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” Follow this link for a complete list of upcoming performance locations and ticket information. “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Christian Douglas stars as Christian in the national touring company of \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” Christian Douglas and Gabrielle McClinton play lovers in the Tony-winning \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” Still running in New York, \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical\" is currently crossing the country in a North American touring edition. Set at the turn of the 20th century it features plenty of 21st century songs and an elaborate set (complete with elephant). The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.” Bruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.

        "description": "While the pendulum seems to have swung to the ‘life’ side, some wonder if it has gone too far.",
        "content": "Does anyone want to work anymore? Since 2020, we’ve endured a stream of supposed work trends. “Quiet quitting” is among the most prominent. According to TikTok, it’s when you “ .” Gallup recently that “‘quiet quitters’ make up at least 50 per cent of the U.S. workforce — probably more.” Canada is purportedly , with two-thirds of workers quiet quitting. Quiet quitting supposedly reflects a new age of anti-ambition, where “decentering” work is celebrated. As Simone Stolzoff proclaims in his recent book , work-life balance needs a recalibration. “Go for good enough” is now inspirational advice. The message: Work less — and care less about it. While the pendulum seems to have swung to the “life” side, some wonder if it has gone too far. Is work ethic fading? To find out, we partnered with the research firm YouGov to conduct a survey of 5,000 Americans in November of 2023. We then partnered with research firm Angus Reid to replicate that same survey with 2,500 Canadians in May of 2024. We call our study the MESSI ( ). Directly measuring work ethic is challenging. As one indicator, we asked respondents: “How much effort do you put into your job beyond what is required?” If work ethic is waning, most people should answer “none.” But that wasn’t the case — not even close. Even more striking is that the numbers are similar for American and Canadian full-time workers. In both surveys, roughly 52 per cent said “a lot,” 35 per cent said “some,” 10 per cent said “a little,” and a mere 3 per cent said “none.” Has work ethic changed over time? To check, we excavated data from the classic and found Americans were similar to our 2023 MESSI. In 1977, 57 per cent said “a lot,” 36 per cent said “some,” 5 per cent said “a little” and 2 per cent said “none” when asked the same question. As much as things change about the organization and culture of work, the average worker’s willingness to go above and beyond has barely budged. But how can we explain the disconnect between all the these days and workers’ responses about their own work ethic? To find out, in both MESSI surveys we asked: “How much effort do you think the ‘average [American/Canadian] worker’ puts into their job beyond what is required?” In a surprise to likely no one, most people think they work harder than others. While 52 per cent of American and Canadian workers say they personally put a lot of effort into their job beyond what is required, only 13 per cent of all workers believe that the average American or Canadian worker does the same. So, to answer the question about if anyone wants to work anymore, the simple answer is yes. But there is a major disconnect between how hard we say we work and how hard we think others work. We really got a sense of the bad vibes — how lousy it is “out there,” for everyone else — when we asked workers about work ethic. Here’s just a sampling of what people told us. A caterer declared that people “in general these days hate their jobs and don’t want to work at all.” A janitor lamented: “Not many people want to work, and if they do, most of them complain about their work or other people they work with.” And a locksmith added: “Most people are just not interested in working more than they have to.” “I feel attitudes have changed a lot,” a cook explained. “People used to work hard to get their jobs done and were happy with their paycheque. Now a lot of people don’t care, choose when they feel like working, and complain a lot.” A CEO of a roofing company amplified the point: “In an era of rampant poor work ethic, chronic victimhood mentality and the worst combination of self-entitlement with intense envy of what is perceived that everyone else has, most people are unnecessarily miserable at their jobs.” Despite what most Americans and Canadians think, most workers say they are still willing to go above and beyond. On balance, that’s a good thing. Working hard is anchoring for our and motivation. A 67-year-old custodian told us: “Most people, if truthful, don’t work for the money; rather, people derive their satisfaction from the things that come from steady work — pride, personal responsibility, satisfaction and the ability to determine what they want to achieve or accomplish.” The residual aftershocks of the and the so-called have sullied work’s reputation. We believe that a perception-reality check about the state of work ethic is needed to correct the prevalence inflation that sustains the pessimism. Cutting into those bad vibes would be a small step toward repairing work’s damaged reputation.",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12.

Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet.

That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” Follow this link for a complete list of upcoming performance locations and ticket information. “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had. It just so happened they had an opening for a tenor the summer I graduated from school.” Douglas auditioned, got the gig and, yes, went through two-and-a-half months of boot camp. “Looking back now, it felt like a crazy dream,” he says. “It allowed me to lay some foundation financially and I got to perform with the Army Band. I grew as a singer. When I decided to leave and moved to New York, I felt I was a little more mature and equipped to step into that musical theater world.” Christian Douglas stars as Christian in the national touring company of \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" Once out of the Army, Douglas started his professional career in the ensemble with the “Pretty Woman” tour, then covered for the lead. In no time, he was the star of the reboot of “Kinky Boots” off-Broadway and now finds himself playing Christian in the Tony-winning musical, “Moulin Rouge.” Christian as Christian? “I always had it in the back of my mind that it’d be so cool to play Christian...so the universe really seemed to answer: Christian the songwriter playing Christian the songwriter.” A mash-up of more than 70 contemporary songs, “Moulin Rouge” tells the story of a young poet who has moved to Paris at the turn of the 20th century. He falls in love with a night club star and, together, they try to save the failing club. Based on Baz Luhrmann’s 2001 film, it tests the talent (and range) of its stars. “Christian goes through quite a vocal journey,” Douglas says. “It’s a big lift in terms of high belting. The emotional stakes are high, so it’s a matter of just trying to stay healthy, keep the energy up and deliver.” Christian Douglas and Gabrielle McClinton play lovers in the Tony-winning \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical.\" To be able to sing eight shows a week, Douglas limits his activity, works out and realizes “a lot of my choices revolve around the show: ‘Will I be able to do my show tonight if I do this?’” Touring for more than a year-and-a-half, Douglas is contracted through September, then regroups. “I haven’t decided yet what I want to do but I’m in the process of writing a show with two playwrights based in New York. That’s on the back burner for me. We’ve done a couple of Zoom readings and, hopefully, in the fall we’ll do a full-fledged workshop.” A bucket list of shows looms, too. “I’ve always wanted to play (‘Newsies’) Jack Kelly, but I might be aging out of that one. I played Tobias in ‘Sweeney Todd’ in college and I’ve been grateful to be cast in these awesome pop/rock shows but my chops are more operatic.” A return to that world, however, is unlikely. “I was never super keen on opera,” Douglas says. “I liked singing arias and mastering the vocalism of it but, in terms of story, I always gravitated toward musical theater.” Last summer, he played “West Side Story’s” Tony at the Muny in St. Louis and “that was such a blast to get to sing. I sang ‘Maria’ a number of times in recitals but to get to do it in a production for 10,000 people was pretty surreal.” Still running in New York, \"Moulin Rouge! The Musical\" is currently crossing the country in a North American touring edition. Set at the turn of the 20th century it features plenty of 21st century songs and an elaborate set (complete with elephant). The mission, of course, was to trust that he had what it takes to hold the audience’s attention. “Whether it’s 300 people or 10,000 people, you just have to stand in your power and say, ‘All right, I’m going to trust that this B flat is going to come out’...and it will.” Bruce Miller is editor of the Sioux City Journal.

        "description": "Vancouver-based HTEC to build up to 18 hydrogen fuel stations in B.C., two in Alberta",
        "content": "A project worth $900 million establishes hydrogen refueling stations across western Canada with most of them in B.C. Premier David Eby and Josie Osborne, B.C.’s minister of energy and mines, joined Jonathan Wilkinson, federal natural resources minister, Friday (May 24) in North Vancouver to help announce plans by HTEC to build up to 20 stations with 18 in B.C. and two in Alberta. The Vancouver-based company represented by CEO Colin Armstrong operates five hydrogen stations in B.C. and is receiving government support to expand that network.Canada Infrastructure Bank represented by chief investment officer John Casola is loaning the company $337 million toward the project. B.C. is supporting the project through four Low Carbon Fuel Standard Initiative Agreements valued at $133 million. Under these agreements fuel suppliers receive credits for increasing the use of low-carbon fuels or reducing the carbon intensity of low-carbon fuels. Three new electrolyzers located in Burnaby, Nanaimo and Prince George supply the hydrogen. The stations plus the electrolyzers are estimated to create more than 280-full time jobs and expected to stimulate the emergence of regional hydrogen hubs. Eby said the project will not only help B.C. fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also create a cleaner economy. “We can’t afford to miss this economic opportunity,” he said. “That’s why we’re supporting job-creating clean-energy hydrogen projects that will drive new investment and reduce pollution.” Armstrong welcomed the funding. “Ambitious, transformative projects like H2 Gateway would not happen without a strong strategic and foundational partnership like the one we have with (B.C.).” RELATED: Former B.C. premier Horgan helps sell Canadian hydrogen in Germany RELATED: B.C. eyes green hydrogen economy with cross-country partnership RELATED: Opposition worried gov is pressuring hydrogen company over PG proposal RELATED: Canada’s first renewable diesel and hydrogen complex to open in Prince George Friday’s announcement is the latest hydrogen-related announcement, which has seen Eby take a lead. In 2021, B.C. became the first province in Canada to launch a hydrogen strategy, because of hydrogen’s economic and environmental potential. It increasingly replaces climate-change-causing materials across multiple sectors, including steel-making and transportation. Government argues B.C. can become a leading producer of “green” hydrogen because almost all of the electricity needed to create hydrogen comes from renewable, hydro-based energy. According to government, B.C. is home to 50 per cent of Canada’s hydrogen and fuel-cell companies, accounting for about 60 per cent of research investment in hydrogen and fuel-cell development. Some 50 projects representing what government calls billions of potential investment are in the pipeline. B.C.’s Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation Ministry, however, could not provide specific figures about hydrogen’s share in the provincial energy mix. It instead pointed to the hydrogen strategy. It estimates that B.C. could produce more than 2.2 million tonnes per year by 2030. By comparison, B.C. produces 5.38 billion cubic feet natural gas per year, according to federal figures. The ministry said that B.C. companies, such as Powertech Labs, the University of British Columbia and Tidewater Renewables currently produce a limited amount of hydrogen, primarily for research and design purposes or in the production of biofuels. The ministry added that hydrogen will play an important role in the future, but available figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggest that future might be some time away. According to IREA, all available hydrogen produced around the world would meet about three per cent of global energy demand. Barriers limiting the widespread adoption of hydrogen include the cost of electricity and the absence of infrastructure. RELATED: Infrastructure bank lends $75M to BC Ferries for zero-emission vessels Friday’s announcement is also the third major announcement this week in B.C. involving the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation designed to help companies overcome high upfront costs. On Thursday, CIB announced a $150 million loan to Prince Rupert Port Authority toward the creation of a new logistics hub in Canada’s third-largest port. On Wednesday, CIB announced that it is loaning B.C. Ferries $75 million to help purchase four zero-emission ferries and install the required charging infrastructure. The electrified Island class vessels replace diesel-hybrid vessels currently serving smaller routes.

That’s what Christian Douglas did and now he’s the star of the national touring production of “Moulin Rouge.” “I started opera singing as an undergrad and I didn’t immediately know what direction I wanted to go in,” he says. “I had only done a couple of musicals by then, but I heard about the military bands and the choral ensembles they had.

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "WASHINGTON: Josef Newgarden of Team Penske denied a late challenge from Mexican Pato O’Ward to win a thrilling and incident packed Indianapolis 500 on Sunday, becoming the first back-to-back winner in 22 years. New Zealand’s Scott Dixon finished third in the race which had been delayed by four hours due to heavy rain and lightning in the area. The crowd were rewarded for their patience during the storm delay with a dramatic finale to the race. O’Ward, whose best finish in the race was runner-up in 2022, looked to have timed his push perfectly, grabbing the lead in turn one on the final lap. But Newgarden powered back to pass him going into turn three and claim a record-extending 20th victory in the Indy 500 for Penske. Newgarden finished 0.341 ahead of Arrow McLaren’s O’Ward and celebrated by jumping into the crowd. “There is no better way to win a race than that. I’ve got to give it up to Pato as well,” Newgarden told race broadcasters NBC. “He’s an incredibly clean driver. He could have easily won this race, too, but it just fell our way and I am so proud of everybody, proud of the whole team,” he said. The last driver to win back-to-back in the fabled race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway was Brazilian Helio Castroneves, who triumphed in 2001 and 2002. So close O’Ward was distraught after again getting so close to the prize he has sought for so long. “It’s hard to put it in words. I’m proud of the work that we did today. We recovered. we went back, we went forward, we went back,” he said. “Some people were just driving like maniacs. We had so many near race enders and just so close again, so close,” he said. “I put that car through things I never thought he was going to be able to do. Oh man, it’s just so painful when you put so much into it and then two laps short, or two corners short,” he added. Alexander Rossi of Arrow McLaren, had jousted with Newgarden for the lead but finished fourth with Spaniard Alex Palou of Chip Ganassi Racing in fifth. Penske’s Scott McLaughlin, who started on pole, finished sixth. The lead changed 87-times over the 500 miles with 16 different race leaders. The opening lap was a chaotic one when British rookie Tom Blomqvist caused a crash on the opening lap that collected 2022 winner Marcus Ericsson of Sweden and Brazilian Pietro Fittipaldi. Blomqvist lost control after touching the curbing and span across the track colliding with Andretti Global’s Ericsson. “I can’t believe it,” said Ericsson after completing a medical check. “It’s unbelievable. It’s so frustrating. I don’t know what to say. We had to work so hard. We fought all last weekend. We fought all week and this happens,” he said. Penske redemption Marco Andretti failed to finish after his car made wall contact as he was approaching O’Ward on turn one of lap 114 after a restart following a yellow flag. “I don’t really trust half the guys I’m around, but you’ve just got to go for it and whatever happens, happens,” said Andretti. The victory for Newgarden was a sweet moment for Penske who have endured criticism and sanctions after a cheating scandal. Team president Tim Cindric, race engineer Luke Mason and two others were suspended for two races including the Indy 500. The suspension came after IndyCar uncovered a set-up on three Penske cars at Long Beach last month allowing drivers to utilize a “push-to-pass” button on starts and restarts in violation of series rules. Newgarden was stripped of his win in St. Petersburg, Florida, in the season opener and he didn’t miss the chance to respond to the critics. “They can say whatever they want at this point, I don’t care anymore,” said the Tennessean. “I’m just so proud of the team, they crushed it. They came in with the fastest cars and we’ve worked our tails off,” he added. “Luke, Tim, they are not here today but they are a huge part of this,” he added. — AFP",

        "description": "Vancouver-based HTEC to build up to 18 hydrogen fuel stations in B.C., two in Alberta",
        "content": "A project worth $900 million establishes hydrogen refueling stations across western Canada with most of them in B.C. Premier David Eby and Josie Osborne, B.C.’s minister of energy and mines, joined Jonathan Wilkinson, federal natural resources minister, Friday (May 24) in North Vancouver to help announce plans by HTEC to build up to 20 stations with 18 in B.C. and two in Alberta. The Vancouver-based company represented by CEO Colin Armstrong operates five hydrogen stations in B.C. and is receiving government support to expand that network.Canada Infrastructure Bank represented by chief investment officer John Casola is loaning the company $337 million toward the project. B.C. is supporting the project through four Low Carbon Fuel Standard Initiative Agreements valued at $133 million. Under these agreements fuel suppliers receive credits for increasing the use of low-carbon fuels or reducing the carbon intensity of low-carbon fuels. Three new electrolyzers located in Burnaby, Nanaimo and Prince George supply the hydrogen. The stations plus the electrolyzers are estimated to create more than 280-full time jobs and expected to stimulate the emergence of regional hydrogen hubs. Eby said the project will not only help B.C. fight climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but also create a cleaner economy. “We can’t afford to miss this economic opportunity,” he said. “That’s why we’re supporting job-creating clean-energy hydrogen projects that will drive new investment and reduce pollution.” Armstrong welcomed the funding. “Ambitious, transformative projects like H2 Gateway would not happen without a strong strategic and foundational partnership like the one we have with (B.C.).” Friday’s announcement is the latest hydrogen-related announcement, which has seen Eby take a lead. In 2021, B.C. became the first province in Canada to launch a hydrogen strategy, because of hydrogen’s economic and environmental potential. It increasingly replaces climate-change-causing materials across multiple sectors, including steel-making and transportation. Government argues B.C. can become a leading producer of “green” hydrogen because almost all of the electricity needed to create hydrogen comes from renewable, hydro-based energy. According to government, B.C. is home to 50 per cent of Canada’s hydrogen and fuel-cell companies, accounting for about 60 per cent of research investment in hydrogen and fuel-cell development. Some 50 projects representing what government calls billions of potential investment are in the pipeline. B.C.’s Energy Mines and Low Carbon Innovation Ministry, however, could not provide specific figures about hydrogen’s share in the provincial energy mix. It instead pointed to the hydrogen strategy. It estimates that B.C. could produce more than 2.2 million tonnes per year by 2030. By comparison, B.C. produces 5.38 billion cubic feet natural gas per year, according to federal figures. The ministry said that B.C. companies, such as Powertech Labs, the University of British Columbia and Tidewater Renewables currently produce a limited amount of hydrogen, primarily for research and design purposes or in the production of biofuels. The ministry added that hydrogen will play an important role in the future, but available figures from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggest that future might be some time away. According to IREA, all available hydrogen produced around the world would meet about three per cent of global energy demand. Barriers limiting the widespread adoption of hydrogen include the cost of electricity and the absence of infrastructure. Friday’s announcement is also the third major announcement this week in B.C. involving the Canada Infrastructure Bank, a federal Crown corporation designed to help companies overcome high upfront costs. On Thursday, CIB announced a $150 million loan to Prince Rupert Port Authority toward the creation of a new logistics hub in Canada’s third-largest port. On Wednesday, CIB announced that it is loaning B.C. Ferries $75 million to help purchase four zero-emission ferries and install the required charging infrastructure. The electrified Island class vessels replace diesel-hybrid vessels currently serving smaller routes.",

        "description": "If goat yoga is a trend, piglet yoga may not be far behind. Yoga classes in Massachusetts are selling out within hours and people come from far away to participate.",
        "content": "SPENCER, Mass. — Three little piggies went to a yoga class. Their human companions had a blast. In this image taken from video, piglets interact with yoga class participants, May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Wilbur, Charlotte and Bluey fit right in to a growing trend of yoga with animals, adding some fun to the usual physical and mental wellness exercises at a class in central Massachusetts. Darting and strolling among the yoginis making downward dog, crow and cobra poses, the piglets also dug up a backyard with their soft pink snouts as two rabbits and a goat named Munchie searched for the tastiest shoots. The experience was well worth a nearly two-hour drive to the town of Spencer for retired New Hampshire dentist Stacey Delbridge and her daughter. \"The best thing about the piglet yoga was, of course, the piglets and how cute they are,” Delbridge said with a jubilant smile. “They were funny, you know. Just when you were getting to a point where you needed a break, you had a great visitor come see you, and you could quit without looking like a quitter. Yeah. They’re adorable.” In this image taken from video, piglets interact with instructor Ashley Bousquet during an outdoor yoga class May 17 in Spencer, Mass. Beyond Yoga & Wellness owner Ashley Bousquet teaches piglet yoga, and says there is such demand that online registrations typically sell out within hours. The classes begin with Bousquet inviting participants not to fret over interrupting their flows to interact with the piglets, who come from a friend’s farm. “During the class you have piglets causing mischief and running on you, on top of you or cuddling with you,\" Bousquet said. \"It's super cute.” Amy Finkel brought her two daughters with her, smiling broadly while snapping photos of piglets as the girls hugged a rabbit. “Seeing them so joyful and happy” was the high point, she said. The low point? \"When it was over, because it just seemed to go so quickly.” Practicing yoga with animals can produce unexpected benefits. If done with shelter animals, it may even encourage adoptions, said Rebecca Purchase of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell. “Is yoga stressful to animals that join? It can be if it’s not the right animal,\" Purchase said. “But for animals that really thrive being around people and getting to socialize with them, it absolutely can be a benefit.” Finkel is a big fan of animal yoga — she said it helped keep her mind from wandering. \"I’m really focused on to what’s going on presently around me. And I think in today’s day and age, that’s very hard to do.” “I just wanted to sit with them,” Delbridge said. “I could have skipped yoga and gone just piglet. All piglet.” It's that special day that moms everywhere look forward to – Mother's Day 2024 will be celebrated on May 12. Way.com presents some amazing destinations to head to for a momcation – a much-needed break from the demands of motherhood. Yes, we don't need a special day in particular to celebrate moms and motherhood. But it feels good to be pampered and made the center of attention once in a while. On such a mom-entous day, it makes sense for you to take a momcation of your own. You'll want to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life! A momcation is a break from motherhood and the responsibilities that come with being a parent. In short, a vacation for mothers. It gives you time to relax, unwind, and catch up with your friends at a spa, resort, or vacation destination. While you can spend a momcation without leaving your house too, we highly recommend you jet off to a new place. Why not take that solo trip you always wanted to go on? Or rope in your female friends to have a girl's trip together. We suggest the following five spectacular destinations you can visit if you're a mother looking for a short getaway or if you're someone looking to gift a trip to your mother. Be warned, though – these places will make you go \"Mamma Mia!\" Napa Valley, California We know what you're thinking – what better way to take a break from mom life than a trip to wine country? Napa Valley in California is known as one of the best wine regions in the world. Nothing but the best for mothers to unwind. Checking into one of the famous Napa Valley hotels here could be the best momcation idea you could ever have. You could even go on a 'glamping' experience – short for glamorous camping. You will be pampered with luxurious accommodation in the woods. While sipping on world-class wines will be at the top of your bucket list, you can also reconnect with nature by taking long walks in the pleasant weather of the valley. Also, try out the healing effects of the famous hot springs in the region, and you'll have hit the mother lode of relaxing vacations. Beaufort, South Carolina If you're looking for a momcation on a budget, look no further than this quiet city with a storied history in the American South. This one's for moms who prefer a quiet getaway, with an itinerary that includes museums, art, and culture. Beaufort is located on the eastern coast, on one of South Carolina's Sea Islands. Apart from the coastal climate and the island attractions, the city is also known for its antebellum architecture. It is also a designated National Historic Landmark. If you're on a momcation, you can find the most value for your time on a guided tour of the historic city's mansions and plantations. Don't forget to visit the Seaside Plantation and Huntington Island State Park while you're there. Beaufort also has a place among America's best art towns and hosts a prolific Performing Arts Center. The Kazoo Museum, which has the world's largest collection of kazoos (a musical instrument used to create vocal effects), will also make for interesting viewing. If you can't make it to Beaufort during May, there are tons of events that you can visit later in the year. The Home Water Festival happens in mid-July and the Shrimp Festival in October (when you can try out the delicious local cuisine). The Beaufort International Film Festival is held every year in mid-February. Hershey, Pennsylvania You can't pamper someone without satisfying their sweet tooth. And mothers are no different! A momcation to Chocolate Town, Hershey will probably be unlike anything most people have ever experienced. While there are the usual chocolate outlets like Hershey's Chocolate World to explore, a momcation here is not complete without staying at the famous Hotel Hershey. Apart from the splendid view of the Hershey Flower Gardens, the hotel is also famous for its chocolate-themed spa packages. Fancy a relaxing Chocolate Spa? Hotel Hershey is where you have to be. The treatments include a Whipped Cocoa Bath, Chocolate Bean Polish, and the Cocoa Facial Experience. The hotel has a Mother's Day special with discounts on several chocolate treatments. Once you're relaxed and refreshed, you can even get a taste of fine wine at the Cullari Vineyards, Hershey's very own winery, to top off a memorable trip. With excellent service and amenities, this is one experience where you will get opti–mum rest. Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts We know, we know – one wine destination just wasn't enough. But don't let the name fool you; Martha's Vineyard is less about liquor and more about luxury. A resort island located off the Massachusetts coast, Martha's Vineyard is a popular summer destination for the rich and famous – a perfect place to spend your momcation and be treated like royalty. Many luxury hotels offer momcation packages where you can be treated to lavish brunches, relaxing spa treatments, and on-demand yoga sessions. Get your girl gang along and prepare for a few days of being pampered to the max. Walk along the sandy beaches while feeling the cool sea breeze, and climb up to the Aquinnah Cliffs for a wonderful ocean panorama. The Oak Bluffs Campground is where you can tour the Gothic-designed summer cottages of former residents. You can also visit Chappaquiddick Island, where you can go on a walking trail. But that's not all. If you're lucky, you might even spot your favorite celebrities on vacation on the same island– think Oprah Winfrey or Bill Gates. Cannon Beach, Oregon Not picking a momcation destination on the Pacific coast would be a mom–umental mistake. But Cannon Beach fits all the criteria for a cozy, coastal getaway. A solo trip here will be the best antidote to the hectic, urban life most moms are used to. You won't regret choosing this seaside resort city for your momcation. It is most famous for Haystack Rock, a 235-feet-tall sea rock that is surely Instagram-worthy enough to make the trip worthwhile! National Geographic has listed it as one of the most beautiful places in the world. It still retains a small-own charm, perfect for moms to relax and unwind. The Ecola State Park is three miles away, where you can walk among old forests and greenery. It also has several hiking trails that lead to viewpoints from where you can whale watch. If you'd rather do a road trip, you can go on the Oregon Coast tour and explore the many cliffs and beaches along the shoreline. One of the prominent cultural festivals here is the Spring Unveiling, an annual arts festival held on the first Sunday in May.

        "content": "Exhibitors from five continents will be taking part in this year’s Food & Beverage West Africa trade exhibition, the largest edition yet. More than 300 exhibitors representing brands and businesses from more than 50 countries will be on show from June 11 to 13 at the Landmark Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos. Nine countries will have exhibitor pavilions and they include Turkey, Dubai, China, India, USA, Indonesia, Italy, Egypt and Tunisia. In addition, sizeable delegations from UAE, UK, Thailand, Ukraine, Ghana, Algeria, Malaysia, Netherlands and many more will use the show to launch new products into Nigeria and West Africa as well as to meet new business partners. Now in its fifth edition, Food & Beverage West Africa is the continent’s largest food and beverage trade show. More than 6,000 visitors are expected to attend over the three days. The exhibition is organised by BtoB Events. Brad Smith, Exhibition Manager, said: “This year’s exhibition is featuring more exhibitors, more countries and more products than ever. If you are seeking new and exciting products that have yet to be seen in the West African market, then FAB is simply unmissable. “FAB 2024 is bringing even more countries and exhibitors than ever before. Our brand-new USA, China and Italy pavilions are joining our regular pavilions from Turkey, Dubai, India, Indonesia and Egypt. “We are also welcoming exhibitors for the first time from countries such as Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Turkmenistan and Nepal.” The event is recognised for the number and range of overseas exhibitors which attract visitors from the West African region and beyond. “We pride ourselves on the international standard quality that our exhibition represents. It is a unique exhibition where we are bringing the global food and beverage industry to Nigeria, with both exhibitors and visitors attending and all looking to do business within the West African region,” said Smith. One of the international exhibitors, Xena’s Food Group, is a Platinum Sponsor of FAB West Africa. Based in London, Xena’s is a wholesale food distributor specialising in premium-grade fresh condiments, oils and ingredients. The company sees huge potential with the Nigerian market, noting the growing demand here for high-quality ingredients. “FAB West Africa offers a unique opportunity to connect with key players in the food industry specifically within the West African region,” says Mr Kochhar, Head of International Trade. “We believe that this targeted approach aligns perfectly with our goal of expanding our presence in Nigeria and neighbouring countries. We see this event as a strategic platform to showcase our offerings. “Our primary objective is to establish Xena’s Food Group as a trusted supplier of premium food products in the African market. We aim to forge partnerships with distributors, wholesalers, hotels, and restaurants, showcasing our extensive range of high-quality mayonnaises, ketchups, flours, cooking oils, poultry, eggs, and grains.” Another of the international exhibitors is Linc Drinks, also from London, and a manufacturer of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Zoryana Slater, Linc Drinks’ Export Manager, is delighted to be coming to Food & Beverage West Africa. “We recognize the immense potential of the African market, particularly Nigeria, and view FAB West Africa as a strategic platform to showcase our premium beverages. We aim to establish strong connections with industry stakeholders, distributors, and consumers, fostering brand recognition and market penetration,” says Zoryana Slater. “We aim to forge strategic partnerships, secure distribution channels, and generate substantial interest in our products, including our private label options. Participation in FAB West Africa presents a prime opportunity to elevate the visibility and reputation of Linc Drinks in the African market.”",

        "content": "Petrit Alijaj, 23, jumped in front of his fiancée Saturday while riding a New York City subway, protecting her from a man who allegedly tossed flaming liquid, the New York Post reported. Alijaj was sitting on the No. 1 train Saturday afternoon with his fiancée and cousin as they hoped to head to the Statue of Liberty, to the outlet. When the train pulled into a lower Manhattan station, however, the suspect, identified as Nile Taylor, was allegedly holding a cup in his hand which contained a flaming liquid, according to the outlet. “He had a cup,” Alijaj told the outlet, describing the insides of what Taylor had “like oil, he made fire and he threw it all.” A 23-year-old man named Petrit Alijaj, who comes from Albania, was badly burned in a subway attack in New York City. He bravely jumped in front of his fiancée to protect her from a man who threw a flaming liquid at them. Toxic Masculinity for the win! The incident happened... — Old School Eddie (@Old_SchoolEddie) As Taylor allegedly tossed the liquid towards Alijaj’s fiancée and cousin, Alijaj was able to turn his body to shield the two, the outlet reported. Alijaj’s shirt immediately caught on fire, prompting him to flee the train and attempt to put out the fire by slapping himself, according to the outlet. Following the arrival of first responders, Alijaj was photographed without a shirt, his upper torso and face appearing to be a bright pink, according to the outlet. New York Fire Department (FDNY) showered Alijaj’s burns with water, according to the New York Post. Alijaj was not initially concerned with their severity but changed his mind after being taken to New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Hospital and realizing he was covered in blisters, the outlet reported. Doctors later revealed to Alijaj that 30% of his body “was burnt” as he suffered from burns on his “neck, ears, chest, arms and left hand,” according to the New York Post. Following the incident Taylor allegedly attempted to flee the scene, only to be apprehended shortly thereafter by police who tracked a cellphone he had picked up on the train, the New York Post reported. The incident is the second time in four months in which someone tossed flaming liquid onto a passenger, the outlet reported. In early March 2024, following a surge in crimes on the public transportation, Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul her plan of bolstering the city’s subways with 750 National Guard troops and 250 state troopers in order to allow passengers to feel safer. Since the announcement, however, crime continues on the trains, with one of the more deadly incidents resulting in a 36-year-old being shot during an altercation with another male in mid-March 2024.",

        "content": "Marian Rivera with (from left) Bianca Gonzalez and Andi Manzano —CONTRIBUTED Mother’s Day may be over but a mom’s job never ends, as Marian Rivera explained last week. The actress and her husband Dingdong Dantes starred in the top-grossing movie “Rewind” in last year’s Metro Manila Film Fest, and she now appears in the GMA TV series, “My Guardian Alien.” Still, she makes it a point to be a hands-on mom with their two school-aged kids, Zia and Sixto. She constantly frets about their health, especially now that they’re both in their formative years. “I always worry that they might get sick so we try our best to avoid any illness,” Marian said. “In school, they might catch a cold from their classmates, so I talk to them about how they can protect themselves.” She makes sure that they eat well and that their diet includes an assortment of vegetables. She also sees to it that they take their vitamins, explaining to them why they need to do so. “Of course, I’m not a perfect parent, but my husband and I do our best to raise our children well,” Marian said. When it comes to exercise and playing outdoors, she is all for it—provided it’s not too hot. “My son loves to play basketball and other games, but it really depends on the weather. If they want to play outside, they have to be mindful of the time; around 4 or 5 p.m. is best. Rivera (second from left) with husband Dingdong Dantes and their children, Sixto and Zia —MARIAN RIVERA/INSTAGRAM “If it’s raining or too sunny, we stay indoors and do arts and crafts. I join in the activity so all three of us end up learning something new,” Marian said. The actress and celebrity endorser was the featured guest at the 50th anniversary celebration of Ceelin, a vitamin supplement from pharmaceutical company Unilab “My family, especially my kids, are my number one priority. Minsan lang sila maging bata kaya I promised to be the kind of mom who shows up and supports them in all that they want to do and achieve,” Marian said. “To working moms like me, alam ko hindi madali to manage your time for work and for your family pero magagawan at magagawan ito ng paraan. Sigurado din ako na it will all be worth it.” To mark its 50th anniversary, Ceelin launched its latest ad campaign with the song “Nais Ko,” that was written by National Artist Ryan Cayabyab and popularized by Basil Valdez. At the press launch held last week, the Mandaluyong Children’s Choir performed the song for an audience that included other celebrity moms like Andi Manzano and Bianca Gonzalez. The two later joined Marian onstage for an informal panel discussion. “Through the years, it has always been our mission to help Filipino children have strong immunity, as we believe this is the key to enriching their lives,” said Ceelin brand manager Rachel Mistal.

A U.S. congressional delegation met Taiwan's new leader on Monday in a show of support shortly after China held drills around the self-governing island in response to his inauguration speech. AP/Taiwan Presidential Office via AP hide caption TAIPEI, Taiwan — A U.S. congressional delegation met Taiwan's new leader on Monday in a show of support days after China held drills around the self-governing island in response to his inauguration. Rep. Andy Barr, the co-chair of the Taiwan caucus in the U.S. Congress, said the United States is fully committed to supporting Taiwan militarily, diplomatically and economically. \"There should be no doubt, there should be no skepticism in the United States, Taiwan or anywhere in the world, of American resolve to maintain the status quo and peace in the Taiwan Strait,\" the Republican from Kentucky said at a news conference in the capital, Taipei, after the delegation met Taiwan President Lai Ching-te. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must come under its control, by force if necessary. The U.S., like most countries, does not have formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is bound by its own laws to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The Chinese government expressed strong opposition to the congressional visit, saying it undermined China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, referring to the waterway between China and Taiwan. The lawmakers' five-day visit \"ran against the political commitment of the U.S. government to maintain only unofficial relations with Taiwan, sending a seriously wrong signal to the separatist force of Taiwan independence,\" Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said in Beijing. Lai, who took office one week ago, is expected to continue the policies of Tsai Ing-wen, his predecessor from the same Democratic Progressive Party. The new foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, noted the recent Chinese drills and called the American delegation's visit \"an important gesture of solidarity\" at a critical time. The delegation included four Republicans and two Democrats and was led by Rep. Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Last year, China sanctioned the Texas Republican after he visited Taiwan in April. \"America is and always will be a reliable partner, and no amount of coercion or intimidation will slow down or stop the routine visits by the Congress to Taiwan,\" he said. McCaul cited congressional approval last month of a military aid bill for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. China firmly opposes the U.S. arming Taiwan, Mao said. The other delegation members were Republicans Young Kim from California and Joe Wilson from South Carolina and Democrats Jimmy Panetta from California and Chrissy Houlahan from Pennsylvania.",

And this can increase the value of our exports by perhaps 10 times,\" Go said during the Philippine Economic Briefing in Pasay City on Monday.A report from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) showed that the country's metallic mineral production value sustained growth and rose by 4.79 percent in 2023.In the latest report released by DENR's Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB), the value of domestic metallic mineral production increased to P249.05 billion from the P237.66 billion logged in 2022 due to the outstanding performance of gold and nickel.Currently, the country's nickel ore is being exported to China, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia, with China getting 98 percent of the total or 17.6 million dry metric tons in 2023.Go also emphasized the need to complete the country's geo mapping of critical mineral resources, led by the DENR, which he said would also help attract investments into the mining sector.Earlier this month, the government said it was planning to cut the processing time of mining permits from six years to one to three years via digitalization.Moreover, Go said that he was optimistic on fostering the development of the mineral industry, which in turn would create an industry for electric vehicles.\"Processing electric vehicles in the Philippines would be our end goal, at least for today, that should be our end goal,\" he said.",

And the 14-time winner here must now decide if this was his last match here. Fellow superstars Novak Djokovic , Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek along with Manchester City ’s Rodri packed into the main Court Philippe-Chatrier for the biggest match-up of the first round. But just like Andy Murray on the same court on Sunday night , the King of Clay could not turn back the clock and find his old form with any consistency after two years dogged by hip injuries. Related articles Rafael Nadal at serious risk of early French Open exit after fiery umpire row Andy Murray makes sad admission after disappointing French Open exit The Spaniard has been close to unbeatable here since winning his first French Open title as a teenager in 2005.

After the defeat, Nadal said: “I would love to thank you all it’s difficult for me to talk I don’t know if it’ll be the last time I’m going to be here in front of you, I don’t know if it is the last time, I have enjoyed it. The crowd have been amazing the whole week. For me it’s so special to feel the love of the people the way I have felt. \"I have been going through a very tough two years in terms of injuries, I went all through this process with a dream to be back here at Roland Garros. The first round wasn’t the ideal one, but I was competitive, I had my chances, but it was not enough against a great player. For me it’s tough to say what’s going on in the future. \"There’s a bg percentage I won’t be back here, but I can’t say 100%. The body is feeling a little bit better also. Maybe in two months it’s enough, I can’t give anything else, but it’s something I don’t feel yet. I hope to be back on this court for the Olympics, that’s motivation. \"The amount of feelings I had on this amazing court through all my tennis career is unbelievable – I could never have imagined when I was a kid, I could be here 38 years old with all the success I had here, winning so many times, something I could never dream about and it’s been a beautiful process. Every year has been different and what it makes it seem so special are the people behind the scenes who have helped me. It’s been unforgettable. The feelings you have made me feel here are unforgettable, thank you from the bottom of my heart.\" All the attention was on Rafael Nadal on day two of the French Open (Image: Getty) The 22-time Grand Slam champion served for the second set at 5-4 after a hot streak but was broken to love and lost the tiebreak and any realistic chance of a shock win. Nadal would have beaten most other players in this tournament yesterday but not the solid Zverev in his current form. The German, who is nearly 11 years younger, was quicker and stronger and confirmed his status as one of the favourites for the title. He served superbly and made 77% of first serves while showing no emotion despite cheers for his every mistake. And disciplined Zverev ruthlessly punished short balls like Nadal in his prime. Winning his first Grand Slam here would be a big image problem for men’s tennis with Zverev appealing allegations of assault against his former girlfriend in a Berlin court this week. There was no doubt who was the crowd favourite here. Nadal’s huge ovation for his walk on to the court was followed by a smattering of boos for the 2020 US Open runner-up. When the stadium MC then read out the years of all 14 of the Spaniard’s wins here, the crowd was whipped into a frenzy. But hopes for a fairytale shock win in only Nadal’s fifth event of the season did not last long. The world No.275 was broken to love in the opening service game and the biggest early cheers when Zverev served a double fault. He took 13 minutes to win his first game but Zverev took his third set point after 50 minutes when Nadal steered a forehand into the net. Don't miss...

When he held for 2-2, he jumped and punched the air in celebration. WIth chants of “Rafa, Rafa” ringing around the arena, took his first break point with a forehand drop shot to lead 3-2 - and spark the loudest cheers of the match after 75 minutes. He then held to win three games in a row to lead 4-2. But Nadal could not close out the set at 5-4 and his forehand found the net on the first of three break points. The 2022 semi-final here saw the match go to a second set tiebreak before Zverev fell and ruptured his ankle ligaments after three hours and 13 minutes. Nadal produced a magical forehand winner to bring the score in the tiebreak to 4-5 before a weak backhand service return into the net gave Zverev the second set after two hours. Nadal came for a final time to break to lead 2-0 in the third set with a trademark forehand running pass. But Zverev broke straight back after finding the corner of the court with a high backhand volley off the top of his racket. The Spaniard saved three break points in the fifth game but he was broken to trail 3-4 when Zverev passed him as he attempted to serve-and-volley on break point. The German saved two break points at 4-3 before taking his first match point when Nadal sprayed a forehand long for his sixth break of serve. A planned post-match ceremony to honour Nadal was cancelled on Sunday after the Spaniard claimed it is “a big, big chance” this is his final French Open but he said: “I don't want to close 100% the door.” Stay up-to-date with the latest Tennis news Join us on WhatsApp Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

        "content": "Article content A former high school quarterback from Sherwood Park has been sentenced to five years in prison for killing a senior couple while drunk driving. Justice Shaina Leonard passed the sentence Monday on Taylor Yaremchuk, 30, for driving his car into Jim and Annie Macdonald while twice the legal limit. Leonard expressed frustration about the prevalence of drunk driving despite a “decades long” public education campaign about the dangers of being impaired behind the wheel. “A strong message must be sent to denounce and deter such conduct,” she said. Yaremchuk killed the Macdonalds Aug. 14, 2022, after drinking at a Sherwood Park golf course. He drove his Kia Optima for nine kilometres on Highway 628, at one point veering “completely into oncoming traffic,” Leonard said. He struck the Macdonalds near the intersection of Range Road 231, where they were riding their motorcycle. Crown prosecutors asked Yaremchuk be sentenced to five years in prison, while the defence sought three to five. Yaremchuk — who was once starting quarterback for Bev Facey High School and the Edmonton Wildcats — has been in custody since his sentencing hearing April 19. Yaremchuk will be prohibited from driving for seven years. Leonard declined to impose a $55,000 restitution order sought by the Crown, saying such issues are better handled in civil court.

        "description": "Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced that 18-year-olds would be made to do national service if the Tories win the next general election",
        "content": "A National Service programme has not run in Britain since the 1960s. But that could soon change. As the Tories propose bringing it back for 18-year-olds , we look at how it works in other countries. In the UK, compulsory national service required all physically fit British men, aged between 18 and 26, to serve in the armed forces. It offered several roles at home, such as clerical work, and abroad, including fighting on the frontline. Students and apprentices could defer until they had completed their education or training. National Service chaos as surprise Tory policy descends into farce The announcement has been widely mocked ( Image: James Veysey/REX/Shutterstock) According to the World Population Review, 80 countries globally currently have some form of national service or conscription in place. In total, 66 counties have made military service mandatory. In Switzerland, 18 weeks of military service training is mandatory for all able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 30, as well as yearly refresher courses. Those who object can take part in civilian service, which is longer, and focuses on social welfare, healthcare and environmental protection. In Sweden, all citizens must complete a military enlistment form after turning 18 and, if selected, enrol in basic military training. Conscription in Denmark is mandatory for all physically fit men over the age of 18. Only around 5,000 undergo basic training, but people remain eligible for further conscription until the age of 50. Top Tory fails to rule out fining parents if kids don't do National Service In Estonia, men aged 18-27 must partake in mandatory military or government national service. The duration is eight to 11 months, depending on a person's education and rank. Reservists must attend military training courses every five years. In 2015, the Lithuanian Armed Forces reintroduced compulsory military service for men aged 19-26. Conscripts must serve for a minimum of nine months. All men in Russia aged between 18 and 30 must complete twelve months of military service or join the ‘alternate civil service’ for 21 months in jobs such as nurses, cleaners, and postal workers. Conscription takes place twice a year during spring and autumn. Norway has technically had compulsory military service since 1907, with men and women aged between 19 and 44 (or 18 to 55 in times of war) ordered to complete nineteen months of service. But it is highly competitive in reality - in 2023, 9,840 people were accepted - just over a quarter. Citizens who aren’t medically fit, or are conscious objectors are exempt. All able-bodied men in South Korea must serve between 18 to 21 months in the armed forces by the time they are 28. The length varies per branch, with those in the Army or Marines serving 18 months, conscripts in the Navy or firefighting service serving 20 months, and any conscripts in the Air Force required to serve 21 months. Conscientious objectors struggle to gain employment and can be forced to carry out 36 months of service working in the prison system Most Israeli men and women must enrol in military service at 18. Men are expected to serve a minimum of 32 months and women a minimum of 24 months. What is National Service plan and will the Tories force your teenager to serve in the Army Celebs who have served Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot, 39, served two years of national service in the Israeli army as a combat fitness instructor. In Norway, Princess Ingrid Alexandra who is second in line to the throne, was conscripted in January this year. The 20-year-old is serving as an engineer. Tottenham forward Son Heung-min, 31, only had to do four weeks' service as a reward for helping South Korea win football gold at the 2018 Asian Games. Meanwhile, all the members of the K-pop group BTS - one of the world’s top-selling bands with millions of fans - are currently serving in South Korea's armed forces and plan to reunite in 2025. In 2020, the South Korean parliament passed a bill allowing the group to delay their compulsory military service until the age of 30. The eldest member, Jin, joined in December 2022, followed by J-Hope a few months later. Suga and RM, the group’s leader, joined near the end of December 2023, followed by Jimin and Jungkook. Currently, Suga is fulfilling his requirements as a social service agent, while the rest of the group is serving in the army.

        "content": "Oil prices saw a slight increase in subdued trading due to public holidays in Britain and the United States. This followed a week marked by concerns over U.S. interest rates amidst persistent inflation. The Brent crude July contract rose by 76 cents to $82.88 per barrel by 1411 GMT, while the more active August contract increased by 80 cents to $82.64. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures climbed by 78 cents to $78.50. Brent decreased approximately 2 per cent last week. In comparison, WTI saw a nearly 3 per cent decline following the release of Federal Reserve minutes, indicating that certain officials might consider further interest rate hikes if deemed essential to manage persistently high inflation. Also read: “Oil prices have started the session slightly higher, but moves are expected to be in range as the U.S. and U.K. markets close today. However, in the week ahead, prices could see high volatility with the focus on the U.S. fuel demand during the current summer driving season, U.S. oil inventory data due on Wednesday, and the OPEC+ members meeting on 2nd June, where they are expected to roll-over current output cuts till year-end,\" said Pranav Mer, Vice President, EBG - Commodity & Currency Research, JM Financial Services Ltd.

        "description": "Only 107 of more than 20 000 polling stations were unable to open on Monday for special votes",
        "content": "D ay one of special voting for the national and provincial elections got off to what the Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) described as a “good start”, despite disruption in the Mthatha area. IEC deputy chief electoral officer Masego Sheburi told journalists on Monday afternoon that by 2pm, more than 200 000 of the 1.6 million registered special votes had been cast at the country’s 22 000 voting stations. Sheburi said that “factors external to the electoral programme” had prevented the operation of 107 polling stations in the OR Tambo region, because of a taxi strike and resultant violence in the Mthatha area. A total of 435 polling stations out of 22 626 had experienced delays in opening, but only those affected by the disruptions at Mthatha had been unable to open at all, he said. “Owing to the good preparations, the commission was able to open the majority of voting stations in the Eastern Cape, in the face of protests which had nothing to do with elections,” he said.“The commission continues to work with stakeholders to have them open tomorrow.” The IEC said 624 593 voters would cast their special votes at home or in places of confinement, while prisoners who had registered would get to participate on 29 May. Sheburi said the commission believed “good progress” had been made with the process thus far and that the special votes would be stored securely and then added to the ballots cast on Wednesday before counting begins. The IEC was aware of the disinformation and misinformation taking place on social media, including a video portraying ballots being filled in, he said, adding that the video being circulated was “clearly” not of a South Africa ballot paper. “We urge voters and candidates to be vigilant of misinformation and disinformation,” he said. Sheburi said the difficulties the electoral body faced were “not comparable” to the huge number of voting stations and that the number of those with problems was “insignificant”. Deputy IEC chief executive Mawetu Mosery said 170 organisations had been accredited as election observers, 18 of them international, with both the African Union and South African Development Community missions already on the ground at polling stations. Mosery said the IEC had met the leaders of the uMkhonto weSizwe party following the breaching of a commission warehouse by its members and had “established rules of engagement” for their conduct. The matter was still being “processed” by the police and the IEC as to whether a criminal case would follow. Mosery said the IEC “responds reluctantly” to complaints by the MK party over the presence of its founder — Jabulani Khumalo — at the results operations centre (ROC) last week despite his expulsion from the party. “We cannot always be speaking about one political party amongst the 70 plus parties that are contesting these elections,” Mosery said. He said members of the public were allowed to enter the results operations centre on day passes in limited numbers and Khumalo had been present at the centre in terms of this arrangement.",

        "content": "BARRY Keoghan has revealed the real reason he turned down a role in the Gladiator sequel and admitted \"it's a shame\". The Saltburn actor was originally cast to be a part of the highly-anticipated sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator - expected to be released this November. However, Barry has now revealed that it was a simple conflict of schedules that led him to walk away from the role. Speaking at the Cannes Film Festival , the Irish actor shared his regrets about not taking the role as he said: \"I am a massive fan of Gladiator and a massive fan of that cast. \"It’s a shame you can’t do both. But that happens in this game. You can’t do both... It always happens.\" The Dublin man explained how at the time, he was \"shooting in two different countries\" and added \"that always makes it really difficult\". The new Gladiator sequel will see fellow Irish man Paul Mescal play the leading role and is set to be released in cinemas on November 22, 2024. And Barry recently paid a sweet tribute to his late mum with a special item at the Cannes Film Festival. The Saltburn actor attended the star-studded event for a second day to promote his latest film Bird last week. The Hollywood star looked super smart as he posed on the red carpet alongside his fellow cast mates. The 31-year-old wore a simple white t-shirt tucked into a pair of pinstriped tailored trousers. The Irish star finished off the look with some cool black sunglasses and black dress shoes. And the Dublin lad also paid a heart-warming tribute to his mum by wearing a silver bracelet which had her name engraved onto it. Barry kept her memory alive as he proudly showed off the jewellery while strutting down the red carpet. The Love/Hate star's mother died over 19 years ago from a heroin overdose. Barry and his brother went on to spend time in over 13 foster homes before they were taken in by his grandmother and aunt. The Irish actor has been open about his mother's addition and tragic death, and he told GQ magazine that he still thinks about her often. He said: \"My mother, always. She’s many years passed now, but I always think about her anyway. \"It’s always just in and around achievements that it’s really prominent cause you’d like to celebrate that with her you know?.\"",

The Blues lost 31-22 to Toulouse after extra-time in an all-time classic game at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday. The province were chasing the French side throughout but were still heartbroken to lose as it felt like their name was on the cup. During normal time, neither side scored a try though it was Leo Cullen’s men who dominated possession and territory. They also had the better opportunities. And it was Leinster who had the chance to win it in 80 minutes when Ciarán Frawley’s drop-goal attempt was just off target. After that Toulouse took advantage of James Lowe’s sin-binning to score ten points before Leinster clawed seven back after Richie Arnold was sent off. Yet, with a man advantage and a three-point deficit with ten minutes to go, it was Leinster who lost their discipline and gifted Toulouse two kickable penalties. Henshaw (below) said: “It’s a tough one to take. Hard to summarise it. “It was a game that had everything. “Probably, looking back we were a little bit, I don’t know, not ourselves in that first period. “In that first half we had loads of chances and a few balls just didn’t go to hand whereas it usually would. “It will be tough to look back on it and see where it was lost. We had loads of chances. “We didn’t hit our full performance. We let ourselves down a little bit around the ruck, the breakdown, they came hard there at us and that stopped the momentum at crucial times. “It was probably just down to our own little bits of errors that let us down and a few balls didn’t go to hand. “We hold on to them and keep building pressure and score, I think.” The fact that it was Leinster’s third Champions Cup final defeat in a row means it hurts more. And it raises questions about the side’s big-game ability. Last year, they led by 17 points but had a terrible second-half performance against Ronan O’Gara’s La Rochelle. But Ireland and Lions star Henshaw argued that being so close this year shows they will be back. He added: “The difference between this year and last year is we fully believed, even up to the last few minutes, that we were going to go and win. “There is full confidence in the group that we will win. “Obviously not this year but we’ll keep building and keep building. “We can’t look back, you have to keep going forward.” And he insisted that the best tonic for the Champions Cup loss is to ensure that 2024 is not the third trophyless season in a row for Leinster. Now they will turn their focus on the URC. The Blues, currently third in the table, host Connacht at the RDS on Friday. He added: “We have a chance to go out next week and put our best shot into the URC and try and win a trophy this year.”",

        "content": "Fourteen years after an innocent couple was murdered outside of Cranbrook, family and relatives are still yearning for justice. On May 29, 2010, Leanne MacFarlane and Jeffrey Todd Taylor were killed in a rural residence east of Cranbrook in a horrific case of mistaken identity, as authorities theorized the same home’s previous occupant — a man with alleged gang ties — was the intended target. MacFarlane and Taylor were engaged and had just moved to Cranbrook from Salmon Arm, as they were in the process of opening up a cellphone store with a life of promise and opportunity ahead of them. “She was such a special soul,” said Wendy Holland, MacFarlane’s sister. “She always found something good in everyone and everything. She had such a great love for animals and never lived without them and her main love was dogs and horses. There are so many special and funny stories of her growing up and things that she did. She had such a great sense of humour and zest for life.” Taylor was a man who “loved my sister and her kids immensely,” said Holland. Eight years passed before arrests were made in the case. Colin Correia and Sheldon Hunter were charged with murder in 2018, however, they were acquitted after a lengthy 150-day trial that took over three years to prosecute due to pandemic-related delays. In a Vancouver courtroom on April 25, 2022, Justice Silverman delivered a not guilty verdict based on three factors. According to Silverman’s ruling, evidence established that the intended victim did not live at the home at the time and further, there was reasonable doubt whether the two accused knew that the intended target did not live at the residence and hadn’t for months. Secondly, the credibility of a key witness was “suspect,” while thirdly, cellphone and alibi evidence raised reasonable doubt that Hunter could have been in a different location at the time. “I am not satisfied that the two accused persons are innocent,” wrote Silverman, in his decision. “However, I am also not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they are guilty.” Crown signalled an intent to appeal, filing notice a month after the decision and an amended notice last summer. Crown lawyers made submissions to the Court of Appeal over two days in March, with a decision yet to come. If the Crown appeal is successful, a new trial could be ordered. On the grounds for appeal, the Crown argues that the trial judge erred in law by excluding as involuntary statements that the defendant had made to police. The Crown also submits that the trial judge erred by excluding law enforcement evidence regarding measurements taken of the defendant’s shoes. A B.C. Prosecution Service spokesperson confirmed the Crown’s appeal applies only to Correia, and that the appeal of Hunter’s acquittal was abandoned.",

        "content": "ROME: Tadej Pogacar won the Giro d’Italia on Sunday, crossing the finish line in Rome in glorious sunshine and with the biggest winning margin in almost six decades. The 25-year-old UAE Emirates rider won six of the 21 stages on the 3,400km tour that began in Turin, finishing 9min 56sec ahead of Colombia’s Daniel Martinez of Bora while Geraint Thomas of Ineos was 10min 24sec off the winning pace in third. The overall triumph was sealed Sunday on the 21st stage around Rome, which was won by Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier, who picked up his third stage win of the 2024 Giro. Billed as a champion in waiting, Pogacar proved peerless taking the lead as early as stage two and rampaging across the peaks, plains and picturesque panoramas to triumph by the largest margin at any of cycling’s grand tours since Vittorio Adorni won the Giro by 11min 26sec in 1965. The swashbuckling Slovenian showman was decked out in the iconic pink leader’s jersey, riding a pink bike and even arriving on a pink bus as the route raced south. Hoping to become the first rider to win both the Giro d’Italia and the Tour de France since Marco Pantani in 1998, Pogacar resembled more another rider, Eddy Merckx, also known for wanting to win as many stages as possible. He won the opening time-trial, and the following day’s first major summit finish and would go on to romp home on the Queen stage in the Dolomites, doubling his lead in the process. Italians took to Pogacar, cheering him through the dramatic port of Genoa, the chic Tuscan town of Lucca and the southern port of Naples and Pompei in the shadow of the volcanic Mount Vesuvius. The two-time Tour de France winner had extended his lead slowly up the Adriatic coastline before the third week’s relentless series of ascents and descents in the Alps. Out to prove Merckx wrong Should Pogacar pull off the ambitious Giro-Tour double he will join a list of legends in Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil, Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Stephen Roche, Miguel Indurain and Pantani. Pogacar burst onto the scene winning three stages at the Vuelta a Espana in 2019 and coming third. The following year he pulled off one of cycling’s biggest ever surprises when he overhauled a 90-second gap on Primoz Roglic to take the lead at the very end of the Tour de France in 2020. In 2021, Pogacar dominated the Tour to claim back-to-back triumphs, before a rival emerged in the form of Danish Visma rider Jonas Vingegaard. The wispy Dane has dominated Pogacar on the very toughest mountain stages, allowing Pogacar to tack up the stage wins as he himself remained firmly focused on the overall. Merckx stated in 2023 that for now the Dane was the best Grand Tour rider, but Vingegaard is scrambling to achieve top fitness for the Tour de France after a nasty crash at the Tour of the Basque Country. While Pogacar had no visible rival at the Giro, Vingegaard will be just one hazard to watch out for on the French roads, with Belgian maverick Remco Evenepoel, Colombian climber Egan Bernal and old foe Roglic all muddying the waters on a wide-open roster ripe for surprises this July. — AFP",

        "content": "According to a reliable source, Samsung plans to bring a considerable upgrade to the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s camera array, delivering better secondary sensors. Samsung’s formula for the “Ultra” series hasn’t changed a whole lot in the past couple of generations, especially when it comes to the camera. A super high-resolution main sensor is backed up by a trio of telephoto and ultrawide lenses, typically with much lower resolution. The Galaxy S24 Ultra uses a 200MP main camera, 50MP 5x telephoto camera, 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and a 12MP sensor for ultrawide shots. It’s not all that different from the years prior. The S23 Ultra was nearly identical, except both its telephoto cameras had 10MP sensors, and the only difference on the S21 Ultra and S22 Ultra was the use of a 108MP main camera. That may be changing this time around, though, as some considerable upgrades are coming. Ice Universe says on Weibo that the Galaxy S25 Ultra will use the same 200MP resolution camera as the S24 Ultra, but with 50MP cameras used on both telephoto cameras as well as the ultrawide. The language used, mainly due to translation, leaves a little bit of room for confusion, but it sounds like a whole lot more resolution is coming to Samsung’s next flagship camera setup. We’re still quite a ways out, though. Samsung usually launches its flagship Galaxy S series in January, meaning we’re several months from that launch, and things could change in the meantime. Still, it sounds like a welcome upgrade. Hopefully, it’ll also come with some software improvements, as that’s always been the bigger problem .

        "content": "To improve your local-language experience, sometimes we employ an auto-translation plugin. Please note auto-translation may not be accurate, so read article for precise information. In Brief SSV.Network plans to decrease hardware demands by 75-90%, employing cryptography, consensus, and network optimization. Ethereum staking infrastructure unveiled its roadmap outlining the upcoming developments for the project. Over the course of the next year, SSV Labs aims to progressively decrease hardware demands by 75-90% through a series of phases, employing cryptography, consensus, and network optimization. SSV.Network initiated cryptography optimizations earlier this year, with plans for consensus adjustments slated for the third quarter, necessitating a fork in the process. The overarching objective of the project is to enable the network to accommodate over 200,000 validators, all while maintaining hardware prerequisites at 4-core CPUs. SSV.Network builds a permissionless zero-coordination (DVT) network, permitting individuals to run an operator and register a validator without requiring any off-chain coordination. During the latter half of the year, the project has identified crucial bottlenecks and potential ways of improvement, facilitating the expansion of the network’s overall scale while adhering to the 4-core per operator entry threshold. These enhancements include reducing the time (CPU cycles) required to process a message, minimizing the number of messages each new validator contributes, and reducing the amount of non-committee messages received by operators. Reducing message processing time was critical due to the necessity for node operators to verify all received messages. A recent implementation of transitioning to RSA signatures resulted in a 98% reduction in message signature verification time. Further enhancement in cryptography entails transitioning from RSA to a more concise signature scheme, which remains significantly faster than BLS12–381. Options such as EDSA + ECIES are being evaluated for potential adoption. Moreover, the optimization, referred to as committee-based consensus, has been a focal point for the SSV Labs team. It is expected to be integrated into the mainnet by Q3 of 2024, necessitating a fork. Upon implementation, the project foresees a reduction in the total number of messages exchanged within the network to just 13% of the current volume. While efforts are being made to reduce the number of messages added by each new validator, the focus also remains on how many operators need to process each message. This number can potentially be decreased. The SSV Labs team is actively researching network topology, with one solution being to group validators by cluster. This approach would ensure that all validators within a specific cluster belong to the same topic, maintaining the same upper-bound topic count. Such a change in network topology could reduce message processing by approximately 98%, as operators would need to process significantly fewer non-committee messages. Over the next 12 months, SSV.Network aims to surpass 50,000 validators. The solutions implemented are expected to support this growth without raising the entry barrier by requiring expensive hardware. is a fully decentralized, open-source Ethereum staking network utilizing Secret Shared Validator (SSV) technology, also referred to as . This technology facilitates an open and straightforward infrastructure for dividing and distributing a validator key into multiple KeyShares, allowing an Ethereum validator to operate across several non-trusting nodes. Recently, SSV.Network shared some milestones, highlighting the network’s growth over the past few months. Notably, the network now boasts nearly 500 operators and over 21,000 validators. Additionally, the project has recorded a total of 678,000 staked ETH, translating to over $2.7 billion in total value locked (TVL).

        "content": "Ireland has joined a European-wide effort to underscore the importance of plant health; part of which focuses on educating people to not bring back any plants, flowers, seeds, fruits or vegetables from outside the EU when returning from their travels, lest they introduce plant pests or diseases detrimental to native flora. The #PlantHealth4Life campaign is led by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Commission (EC), and is active in 22 European member states. Senator Pippa Hackett, Minister of State for Land Use and Biodiversity with special responsibility for Horticulture at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine said: “We are proud to stand alongside our European partners to raise awareness of the profound interdependence between plant health and our collective well-being. This collaborative effort is a unique opportunity to engage citizens from all walks of life — be it the intrepid traveller, the conscientious gardener, or the vigilant parent — in safeguarding plant health.” Louise Byrne, Chief Plant Health Officer for Ireland, added that the Department of Agriculture, Food & the Marine conducts comprehensive inspections on imports of regulated plants and plant products. Importantly however, a critical element is educating the public across all spectrums, from commercial importers to amateur gardeners on the need for heightened awareness of the issues at stake and to not attempt to import unchecked plants and plant products that pose a risk to Ireland. The campaign urges travellers not to bring back any plants, flowers, seeds, fruits, or vegetables from outside the EU, as these items may harbour plant pests or diseases detrimental to native flora. Additionally, consumers are advised to buy plants and seeds online only if accompanied by a valid phytosanitary or plant health certificate. Embracing good plant hygiene practices and promptly addressing signs of plant pests or diseases in home gardens and communal outdoor spaces will also prevent their spread to neighbouring plants and natural habitats. Speaking on Ireland’s involvement in the campaign, leading Irish garden designer Diarmuid Gavin, who was appointed as the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations’ Goodwill Ambassador for Ireland in May 2022, said: “Safeguarding Irish plant health is paramount. As gardeners, we hold the power to effect change — by allowing our gardens to flourish naturally, propagating your own plants from seeds, sourcing plants responsibly, and vigilantly monitoring for abnormalities, we can collectively protect our botanical heritage.” © ITTN.ie",

        "content": "Professional cycling is back in the mainstream spotlight with the second season of Tour de France: Unchained on Netflix , this time with Tadej Pogačar among the riders featured. The series is due to air on June 11, 2024, on the video streaming platform. While the short English trailer for the second season did not show Pogačar, the extended version published on Netflix France's YouTube channel features interviews with Pogačar and new footage of the aftermath of Pogačar's crash in Liège-Bastogne-Liège and interviews from his home with partner Urška Žigart and in a studio. \"2022, I gave everything that I could, but in the end, Jonas was better,\" Pogačar says before Žigart describes Pogačar's stinging defeat at the hands of Jonas Vingegaard in 2022 , saying, \"It wasn't the easiest because it's this realisation 'Oh, I'm not the best anymore' ... but then it brought back the hunger that he really wants to prove that he is the best again.\" Tour de France: Unchained debuted in 2023 as a series along the lines of the successful Drive to Survive Formula 1 show. Drive to Survive gave F1 a huge surge in popularity, and it appears that Tour de France: Unchained has yet to do the same for cycling. The 2023 Tour de France had only a small increase in viewership over 2022. The second season of Tour de France: Unchained will serve as a teaser for quite a different rematch between Vingegaard and Pogačar in July.

Pogačar just capped off a start-to-finish domination of the Giro d'Italia , winning by almost 10 minutes over Dani Martínez (Bora-Hansgrohe), while Vingegaard spent 12 days in hospital in April after a heavy crash in the Itzulia Basque Country left him with broken ribs, a collapsed lung and a fractured clavicle. This year's Tour de France will also be the first time that Vingegaard will face off against former teammate Primož Roglič, who is now with Bora-Hansgrohe, and have Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-Quickstep) as a rival.",

        "content": "Objections have been lodged against fresh plans to build a high-rise hotel near Galway Docks. Previously, Summix BNM Developments Limited was refused permission for a 10-storey hotel at the site by city planners. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The site at the corner of Lough Atalia Road and Bother na Long is currently occupied by a vacant industrial building. Among the reasons given for the previous refusal by An Bord Pleanala were the scale and density of the project, and the impact on nearby Forthill Cemetery. The latest plans are for an even taller building, offering 189 bedrooms across 15 storeys. An Taisce has now lodged a submission, saying the priority should be homes for students and workers, rather than even more tourist bed spaces. It also notes the increased height of the latest proposal, claiming the grounds for refusal of the previous project should be even more applicable in this case. A local priest of the Augustinian Community has also lodged a submission, raising concerns over the impact on a boundary wall at Forthill Cemetery. It says the site is of immense historical and archaelogical importance, and it’s a very sensitive issue given it’s still an active cemetery. A decision is due from city planners next month. 2460108 The post Objections to fresh plans for high-rise hotel near Galway Docks appeared first on Galway Bay FM . © Copyright 2023 - Ourside Agency",

        "description": "A beautiful UK beach named one of the country's best is also the beach most impacted by erosion in the UK, meaning it is destined to tumble beneath the waves over the coming years",
        "content": "One of the UK's best beaches, known for its orange cliffs and serene sand, could soon disappear and be washed away into the sea. Known for its peacefulness and remote location, Covehithe beach in Suffolk has been named as one of the best beaches in the UK by the The Sunday Times. However, the under-the-radar beach may not be around for much longer as it suffers from the highest rate of erosion in the country of any beach. Between the 1830s and 2001, the cliff-face has lost over 500 metres and according to the area's Shoreline Management Plan, Clovehithe's cliffs erode around 4.5 metres a year. The Environment Agency has warned that the main part of the settlement at Covehithe - which is roughly 250 metres from the shoreline - is expected to be claimed by the sea by 2110. However, it could tumble beneath the waves as early as 2040. As a consequence, the cliffs in the area pose a constant risk to members of the public who visit the beach. Have you visited somewhere that is a beautiful under-the-radar location? Email us at webtravel@reachplc.com Beautiful UK seaside town named 'by far the cleanest' and 'happiest place' Covehithe Beach suffers from extreme erosion, losing 4.5 metres a year Despite their fast erosion, the orange cliffs at Covehithe still offer a picturesque landscape, that benefits from little crowds. The beach can be accessed via a lane, which leads to fields before abruptly stopping at the cliff edge. Walk further along the beach and you'll find the ruins of the medieval St Andrews Church, which became too expensive for the parish to maintain and was eventually left for ruin, before a new smaller church was built within its grounds. The beach is also home to Southwold's old Victorian pier and Benacre Broad Bird Hide, a bird watching area. One review of the beach reads: \"My favourite beach in Suffolk. It’s so unique, there are broads on the beach so you can be between two bodies if water which is quite surreal if you ask me. Lots of wild life such as birds and the occasional seal. The beach is very sandy with the odd stone/pebble nearer the shore.\" While there isn't much to do at the beach itself, further along the coastline is the town of Lowestoft. The seaside town has a rich heritage and culture, including attractions like The Gulliver wind turbine, Marina Theatre, Pleasurewood Hills and a 100-acre zoo, Africa-Alive. Slightly further along the coast is also Great Yarmouth — home to the Golden Mile of beaches. Both are easily accessible by car. If venturing out in a car is not for you, walking further south will get you to the town of Southwold. Located next to Covehithe beach, Southwold offers an array of accommodation and a selection of eating establishments. Still Southwold accommodation is closest to the beach, with various holiday homes available. The Listening Station is a custom-built beach household, with views towards the cliffs and beaches of Covehithe. It can sleep up to four people and one small dog. The Watch Room looks out towards Southwold Pier, also sleeping up to four people. Alternatively, if only two of you, you could stay in The Easternmost Cabin , which is built on the site of three former Victorian workers' cottages. For bigger parties, The Warren House sleeps up to eight people and one dog and was originally was built as a farmhouse in 1925. A minimum stay of three days is required, starting at prices of around £600. Covehithe might not be the place for a holiday with children, or if you fancy the typical tourist attractions usually found at seaside towns. But it is perfect for those wanting to see beautiful scenery in a quiet and remote location. Check out more of Daily Mirror's latest travel stories by signing up to our free weekly newsletter.",

This commitment comes amidst growing awareness of the potential of Nigeria’s non-oil industry to diversify the economy.

        "content": "One of Europe’s most popular tourist spots is aiming to reduce the number of cruise ships (Image: Getty) One of Europe ’s most popular tourist spots is aiming to reduce the number of cruise ships able to dock in an attempt to limit the number of tourists in their already crowded city. The city’s mayor said he wanted to negotiate with the city’s port authorities to reach a new agreement which would reduce the number of terminals where cruise ships could arrive. Last year, 803 cruise ships docked in Barcelona , carrying 3.5 million passengers. This figure is a rise of 13.7 percent compared with pre-pandemic figures in 2019. Of these visitors, 46 percent - 1.6 million - only spent one day in the city before returning to the ship.

We want to propose a new agreement with the port about the number of terminals,” Jordi Valls, head of tourism for Barcelona city council, told El País newspaper. “Each year the number of cruise tourists rises about 9 per cent and that is not acceptable for the city.” Every time a ship docks, on average 3,000 people then descend on the already crowded city , which has a population of only 1.6 million in a space only 39 square miles - six times smaller than London. Adding insult to injury, the cruise industry argues that each passenger contributes an average of £78 per day to the local economy. “If we exceed the capacity that Barcelona can support,” added Valls, “what the visitors contribute no longer has value.” Currently, two new cruise terminals are being planned, adding to the five already operational. The city’s mayor, Jaume Collboni , said he instead wanted to see this reduced. Don't miss... Valencia and Barcelona 'to limit and even BAN' mega cruise liners in backlash [LATEST] Major cruise line cancels trips to island destination [LATEST] Popular cruise line forced to change route due to restrictions [LATEST] Trending Didac Navarro, of the Stop Cruises campaign group, said if nothing was done then Barcelona would soon receive 5 million cruise tourists each year. “The roads and pavements in the centre of the city and near the Sagrada Familia are already saturated with cruise tourists and this model is unsustainable,” he told i . He applauded the council’s move to limit the number of ships, something, he said, they had been asking for “from the start”. In October, Barcelona announced it would restrict access of cruise liners to its congested city centre in an attempt to combat over-tourism. Most arrivals at the Mediterranean port will now have to dock away from the World Trade Center pier, which is just a short walk from La Rambla Boulevard, the busiest street in the city. The move comes as protests take place against over-tourism , which has been pricing out locals from towns and cities across Spain. About 10,000 people protested in the Balearic Island of Palma de Mallorca on Saturday, Spanish police said, with smaller protests in Menorca and Ibiza. Barcelona is the next to follow in the footsteps of other European cities in limiting cruise ships. In 2021, Venice banned cruise ships from its centre and Palma in Mallorca cut the number of ships arriving to three per day until 2026 with only one being allowed to carry more than 5,000 passengers.

        "description": "LOCAL analysts surveyed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) expect the Monetary Board to cut policy rates every year until 2026.",
        "content": "LOCAL analysts surveyed by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) expect the Monetary Board to cut policy rates every year until 2026. In the latest Monetary Policy Report, analysts said by the end of this year, the monetary authorities could cut policy rates by 25 to 150 bps. For 2025, the analysts said, the BSP could loosen its policy stance by a range of 25 to 250 bps; while in 2026, analysts expect an additional reduction of about 50 to 150 bps in the policy rate. “The results of the survey showed that most of the analysts anticipate current monetary policy settings to remain unchanged in Q2 [second quarter] 2024,” the report stated. This outlook on policy rates is consistent with expectations that inflation will slow to 3.7 percent in 2024 from the initial estimate of 3.8 percent. Inflation forecasts by analysts for 2025 remains unchanged at 3.5 percent but higher in 2026 at 3.5 percent from the initial outlook of 3.4 percent. “Analysts expect within-target inflation over the policy horizon, although settling at the upper end of the target range as uncertainty lingers. Upside risks continue to dominate due mainly to supply chain disruptions,” the report stated. The local analysts said the primary upside risks to inflation are higher oil and food costs, including rice. The price of these basic goods, the report stated, are affected by supply-side pressures due to geopolitical conflict in the Middle East. In April 2024, rice inflation slowed to 23.9 percent from the 24.4 percent posted in March 2024. Rice inflation has been above 20 percent since January 2024. The list of upside risks also includes the impact of extreme weather events such as El Niño in the first half of 2024 and the La Niña in the second semester. Based on the latest report of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), the severe dry spell affected 175,063 farmers and fisherfolk and cost the economy P9.496 billion in damages. On Monday, the NDRRMC also reported that Tropical Cyclone Aghon has affected 19,373 Filipinos and displaced 5,343 residents. While estimates of the damage are not yet available, 22 damaged homes and 13 flooded areas were initially reported. “A few analysts cited downside risks from easing albeit still elevated food and non-food inflation, such as rice and oil; and waning inflationary pressures on prices as El Niño and base effects weaken in the near term,” the report added. The report also noted that 15 out of 20 respondents said there is a higher chance, 77.2 percent, that inflation will settle within the 2 to 4 percent inflation target of the BSP. In April, analysts said there is only a 71.5-percent this can happen this year. However, analysts said there is a 22.8-percent probability, lower than the 28.3 percent posted in April 2024, that inflation will breach the upper end of the target range. For 2025, analysts said the probability that inflation will fall within the target band increased to 85.3 percent, higher than the 78.2 percent expectation in April. The report said that for 2026, there is a 73.5-percent probability, lower than the initial 76.5 percent, that inflation will settle within the target band. More expensive rice and vegetables and higher transport costs caused inflation in April to accelerate to 3.8 percent, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said last May 21. The National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) and the Department of Finance (DOF) said the government is now fast-tracking interventions to beef up food supply to shield consumers from the ill effects of El Niño as well as La Niña. Data released by the PSA indicated that inflation quickened for the third consecutive month in April. The inflation rate last month was faster than the 3.7 percent recorded in March, but slower than the 6.6 percent in April 2023. Citing data from the PSA, Neda noted that April witnessed a “surge” in food inflation, which rose to 6.3 percent from the previous month’s 5.7 percent. Key contributors include vegetables, up by 4.3 percent; fish, up by 0.4 percent and ready-made products up by 4.8 percent.",

        "content": "Monday, May 27, 2024 China ‘s first domestically built large cruise ship Adora Magic City has completed 34 journeys and received nearly 150,000 tourists so far since its maiden voyage. In the meantime, China ‘s second homegrown large cruise ship entered a shipyard in Shanghai for final assembly on April 20, signifying that China has developed the capability to engage in bulk production of cruise ships. The cruise industry, with a long industrial chain and high degree of internationalization, is often called “the golden industry that floats.” Over 1,000 domestic and foreign manufacturers were involved in the building of Adora Magic City. The cruise ship is 323.6 meters in length, has a gross weight of 135,500 tons, and can accommodate up to 5,246 passengers across a total of 2,125 guest rooms. The number of parts is equivalent to five times that of the C919 large aircraft and 13 times that of the Fuxing high-speed train. China has since become the fifth country in the world with the ability to design and build large cruise ships. The commercial success of Adora Magic City also demonstrates that China is capable of complete and independent operation of large cruise ships, according to Liu Hui, general manager of CSSC Cruise Technology Development Co Ltd. In comparison to Adora Magic City, the new ship boasts a larger size, with a tonnage of over 140,000 tons, a length of 341 meters, a width of 37.2 meters, and features 2,144 cabins. Two sets of desulfurization systems and five sets of selective catalytic reduction equipment will be added, making the entire ship more environmentally friendly. Also compared with Adora Magic City, the area of public spaces, and for outdoor activities and leisure has increased by 735 square meters and 1,913 square meters, respectively, to 25,599 square meters and 14,272 square meters, further improving the comfort and experience of passengers. Although the ship is larger, the construction speed has been accelerated thanks to a series of scientific research achievements, management experience and methods. It is expected to be delivered by the end of 2026. In addition to the large cruise ship, the Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co Ltd has also stepped up the research and development of ultra-large as well as medium and small cruise ships. A large domestic cruise fleet is on the way.",

        "description": "Jacks struck an unbeaten century off just 41 balls and helped RCB chase down 200 to beat Gujarat Titans in an IPL match with Kohli looking on from the other end.",
        "content": "Will Jacks hopes to put the on-field “coaching” he received from Virat Kohli to good use when England bids to retain its T20 World Cup title next month. Jacks goes into the third game of England’s warm-up series against Pakistan having helped propel the hosts to a 23-run win at Edgbaston on Saturday. The Surrey all-rounder struck a quickfire 37 in what proved to be a decisive stand with captain Jos Buttler as England went 1-0 up in the rain-hit four-match series ahead of Tuesday’s game at Cardiff’s Sophia Gardens. It was another example of Jacks’ power hitting after he recently struck an unbeaten century off just 41 balls -- including 28 runs from one Rashid Khan over -- as Royal Challengers Bengaluru chased down 200 to beat Gujarat Titans in a high-pressure situation, with India star batsman Kohli looking on from the other end. “The big thing with the IPL is that every game is such an occasion, the crowd, the atmosphere,” Jacks told reporters on Monday, just over a week from England’s World Cup opener against Scotland in Barbados. “Every game you feel like you’ve got to step up and that’s similar to international cricket.” As for batting with Kohli, the 25-year-old added: “He’s a very good role model. The way he approaches all the training and every aspect of the game off the field, his intensity, everything he does is a 100 percent attention. “He’s done it for such a long time and I can appreciate that as a young guy who often doesn’t want to do the hard yards, but you see him doing it and want to copy that.” “When we were batting together, he was coaching me through there. I learned some valuable things about chasing in that innings and pacing the game, which was really helpful,” Jacks added. “I was really proud of the way I stayed in the partnership, didn’t throw it away.” Now Jacks, whose England career currently consists of a mere two Tests, seven one-day internationals and 12 T20s, is looking forward to a major global tournament. “Playing in a World Cup is something I’ve dreamed of since I was a little kid. I’m really excited to do it,” he said. “It’s getting closer now and we’re building in the right direction.” Jacks labelled his England T20 record of 218 runs at 18.16 a “mixed bag”, although his cause has not been helped by switching between opening the innings and batting at three. “I’ve probably opened half my games and batted number three in the other half,” he said. “It’s no lie that I’m new to batting at three, I’m learning on the job.” He added, “I’ve been getting starts every game and it’s about how do I change those into match-winning scores. That’s more of a mindset thing. It doesn’t matter what I’m averaging: if the team’s winning, then it’s good.” Comments Related stories Related Topics",

According to investigators, a woman finished bathing her 18-month-old daughter on Sunday when she heard a knock at the front door.

        "content": "The Lagos State Police Command, on Monday, repelled attack on a station in the state, arresting some of the attackers and impounding over 200 motorcycles used by the attackers. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Lagos State Command, Ikeja, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, in a statement on Modnay @LagosPoliceNG indicated that Officers of Ipaja Police Division successfully repelled an early morning attack on their division by motorcycle operators. According to the PPRO, the attack came after police officers commenced the day’s enforcement of the existing ban on motorcycles in Lagos State. The attackers, who came in their hundreds, stormed the station with dangerous weapons, shooting at the officers and attempting to overrun the station. He added that while officers and men of the division held their ground, reinforcement came from the Area Command and the Rapid Response Squad (RRS). Two of the attackers were fatally injured during the attack, Hundeyin said. However, this did not deter the officers from accomplishing their mandate as over two hundred motorcycles were impounded and some of the attackers arrested, with one locally made firearm retrieved. “The Lagos State Police Command will not be cowed into abdicating its responsibilities of enforcement of all duly passed laws and maintenance of law and order within the society,”the PPRO declared.",

        "description": "His family want accountability to be taken as they struggle to come to terms with the 'unfathomable' medical error",
        "content": "A \"cheerful, affectionate family man\" died in hospital after going for a planned check-up, when a prescription mistake meant he was given 10 times the amount of pain medication he should have received, an inquest has heard. Kingston dad Chandrakant Patel's death has led to his family demanding accountability, as reported by our sister site Surrey Live. The fatal dose occurred after he had been admitted for a planned check-up for his chronic kidney disease on October 27, 2022,. The disease causes gradual loss of kidney function over a period of months and years. Chandrakant became unsteady and fatigued, so he was referred to the Same Day Emergency Care Unit for observations. It was decided by doctors that he would stay overnight for monitoring and could be sent home the next day if his kidney function was stable. REACH MORE: London nurse who cut off man's nipple 'for sexual pleasure' is struck off register However, Chandrakant didn’t leave the hospital the next morning, after his health rapidly deteriorated. The decline in his health was triggered after he was issued 500mg of Pregabalin at 10pm on October 27, 2022, instead of 50mg. He was rushed to the intensive care unit, where he spent 43 days. Sadly Chandrakant died on December 8, 2022, leaving his family struggling to accept what had happened. The error was made when a doctor relied on a letter dated July 13, 2022 that incorrectly recommended the inflated dose. Shortly after he was given the 500gm Pregablin dose, Chandrakant lost consciousness, and on October 28, 2022, suffered severe respiratory failure. The prescription Chandrakant was given had been approved by a doctor at the Renal Medicine Outpatient Clinic, before the medicine was administered. An internal investigation revealed the hospital was in breach of its medicine management policy because the letter was dated four weeks before Chandrakant’s admission and should have been reviewed, considering his renal function deterioration. During an inquest on May 2, 2024 at the London Coroner’s Court, Coroner Hannah Hinton revealed Chandrakant’s death was attributed to multiple organ failure, and that he suffered severe respiratory failure, lung infection and too much acid in the blood. Following the grave error, the hospital has worked to make changes to the prescription system. It has also held additional training measures for staff. Mr Patel is survived by his widow, Kailasben, as well as his three children. In a tribute to Chandrakant, the Patel family, supported by law firm Simpson Millar said: “Our beloved father was a cheerful, affectionate family man with a contagious laugh and a wonderful sense of humour. It's still unfathomable to us that he's been taken from us; it simply wasn't his time, and we struggle to accept how such a preventable mistake could claim his life in such a horrific manner. “The 43 days he spent in the hospital were filled with immense suffering, and even now, we remain devastated and traumatised by the pain he endured and what we witnessed. We never imagined that our father wouldn't return home after what should have been a routine check-up in the capable hands of hospital staff. “Hospitals are meant to be places of healing, but in our case, it was the opposite. The entire experience feels surreal, like a nightmare turned reality. “We've been seeking answers and were hopeful that the inquest hearing would offer us some clarity. However, a year and a half later we are still unclear.\" A spokesperson for Kingston Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: “The Trust identified that an incorrect dose of medication had been administered in October 2022. The Trust offers condolences to the family and since then, changes have been made to the medication prescribing system, and staff training in this area has been enhanced.” You can sign up to get the latest news, top stories and exclusives sent straight to your WhatsApp from the MyLondon team.

        "content": "The public mood is tough to read this time and while the BJP will get majority, one can expect the unexpected: This was what a group of experts at NDTV concluded this evening as the massive celebration of democracy in the country draws to a close. There will be tough fights, some in the BJP bastions of the north but the ruling party will gain from non-BJP states, including Telangana, Odisha and Bengal, the experts said. As for the 370-seat target, it could represent an ideal, said one of the experts at NDTV Battleground, anchored by Editor-in-Chief Sanjay Pugalia. The 2024 election has bucked the trend of the last 10 years, because of an absence of any wave or public anger, the experts agreed. What has hit the country instead is a sense of discontent, which the Opposition has failed to capitalise on. Senior journalist and political expert Neerja Chowdhury said this election has been \"complex\" and \"difficult to decode\". \"At some level, we are not seeing that Modi wave. On a different level, there are some fence-sitters. Modi Wave cannot control the Opposition, who have local issues. The Opposition is giving a fight but that doesn't equal victory,\" she added. Pointing out that a wave is seen \"after an election\", political strategist Amitabh Tiwari said, \"Voting is an emotional decision. There's discontent. Last time, the BJP got 40 per cent votes... But converting discontent to anger is important (for the Opposition). It's not easy to understand the psyche of the voter\". Public mood after six phases This election had started with some issues but deviated from them soon enough. The BJP had started the polls with a focus on national issues, but ended up responding to the Opposition agenda including change in constitution, said Sanjay Kumar, psephologist from CSDS. But barring the noise on social media, there is also the silent majority that makes up is mind about which way to go even before the election begins. Asked whether the Opposition has got got sidetracked and misled by the illusion created by social media, Mr Tiwari agreed. \"One has to think what is the issue at the heart of every election,\" he said. \"People vote for the bright future of themselves and their children... There are two key sections missing from the social media chatter -- women and the beneficiaries of welfare projects. These are the two sections who have decided which way many of the elections went,\" he added. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com The BJP is hoping to win 370 seats in the ongoing election, which has reached the last stretch. The party has given its NDA allies a target of 30-plus seats, which will take the score of the ruling alliance to 400-plus. The last phase of election will be held on June 1, the counting of votes will take place on June 4.",

        "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday an air strike in the area of Rafah in southern Gaza that killed dozens of Palestinians was not intended to cause civilian casualties and would be investigated.",
        "content": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged Monday that a \"tragic mistake\" had been made after an Israeli strike in the southern Gaza city of Rafah set fire to a tent camp housing displaced Palestinians and killed at least 45 people, according to local officials. Israel has faced surging international criticism over its war with Hamas, with even some of its closest allies, particularly the United States, expressing outrage at civilian deaths. Israel insists it adheres to international law even as it faces scrutiny in the world's top courts, one of which last week demanded that it halt the offensive in Rafah. Complete coverage of the Israel-Hamas war Israel's military had earlier said that it launched an investigation into civilian deaths after it struck a Hamas installation and killed two senior militants. Sunday night's attack, which appeared to be one of the war's deadliest, helped push the overall Palestinian death toll in the war above 36,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and noncombatants in its tally. \"Despite our utmost efforts not to harm innocent civilians, last night, there was a tragic mistake,\" Netanyahu said Monday in an address to Israel's parliament. \"We are investigating the incident and will obtain a conclusion because this is our policy.\" Mohammed Abuassa, who rushed to the scene in the northwestern neighbourhood of Tel al-Sultan, said rescuers \"pulled out people who were in an unbearable state.\" \"We pulled out children who were in pieces. We pulled out young and elderly people. The fire in the camp was unreal,\" he said. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service. The ministry said the dead included at least 12 women, eight children and three older adults, with another three bodies burned beyond recognition. In a separate development, Egypt's military said one of its soldiers was shot dead during an exchange of fire in the Rafah area, without providing further details. Israel said it was in contact with Egyptian authorities, and both sides said they were investigating. Rafah, the southernmost Gaza city on the border with Egypt, had housed more than a million people -- about half of Gaza's population -- displaced from other parts of the territory. Most have fled once again since Israel launched what it called a limited incursion there earlier this month. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps in and around the city. Netanyahu says Israel must destroy what he calls Hamas' last remaining battalions in Rafah. The militant group launched a barrage of rockets Sunday from the city toward heavily populated central Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no injuries. The strike on Rafah brought a new wave of condemnation, even from some of Israel's close allies. \"These operations must stop. There are no safe areas in Rafah for Palestinian civilians. I call for full respect for international law and an immediate ceasefire,\" French President Emmanuel Macron posted on X. Italian Defence Minister Guido Crosetto, in a TV interview, said such bombings are \"spreading hatred, rooting hatred that will involve their children and grandchildren.\" Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas in attempts to secure a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas, said the Rafah strike could \"complicate\" talks, Negotiations, which appear to be restarting, have faltered repeatedly over Hamas' demand for a lasting truce and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, terms Israeli leaders have publicly rejected. Neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, which made peace with Israel decades ago, also condemned the Rafah strike. Egypt's Foreign Ministry called it a \"new and blatant violation of the rules of humanitarian international law.\" Jordan's Foreign Ministry called it a \"war crime.\" The Israeli military's top legal official said authorities were examining the strikes and that the military regrets the loss of civilian life. Military Advocate General Maj. Gen. Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi said such incidents occur \"in a war of such scope and intensity.\" Speaking to an Israeli lawyers' conference, Tomer-Yerushalmi said Israel has launched 70 criminal investigations into incidents that aroused suspicions of international law violations, including the deaths of civilians, the conditions at a detention facility holding suspected Palestinian militants and the deaths of some inmates in Israeli custody. She said incidents of \"violence, property crimes and looting\" were also being examined. Israel has long maintained it has an independent judiciary capable of investigating and prosecuting abuses. But rights groups say Israeli authorities routinely fail to fully investigate violence against Palestinians and that even when soldiers are held accountable, the punishment is usually light. Israel has denied allegations of genocide brought against it by South Africa at the International Court of Justice. Last week, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, a ruling that it has no power to enforce. Separately, the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three Hamas leaders, over alleged crimes linked to the war. Israel says it does its best to adhere to the laws of war and says it faces an enemy that makes no such commitment, embeds itself in civilian areas and refuses to release Israeli hostages unconditionally. Hamas triggered the war with its Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and seized some 250 hostages. Hamas still holds about 100 hostages and the remains of around 30 others after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire last year. Around 80 per cent of Gaza's 2.3 million people have fled their homes, severe hunger is widespread and UN officials say parts of the territory are experiencing famine. ------ Magdy reported from Cairo.

        "description": "South Lanarkshire school leavers are exceeding national benchmarks.",
        "content": "South Lanarkshire school leavers are exceeding national and local benchmarks. New data has revealed that young people leaving school across the region are stronger in comparison to their peers in the West Partnership of nearby local authorities as well as nationally. The data, which has been released by the Scottish Government for the session 2022/23 relates to four national benchmarks which highlight the performance of pupils at the point of exit from school. The four national benchmarking levels are attainment in literacy and numeracy, attainment for all, and attainment vs deprivation with an emphasis on closing the gap and post-school participation. Across South Lanarkshire, young people who left school in 2022/23 achieved literacy levels which were better than those achieved nationally and in the West Partnership. At all levels, attainment in literacy has improved since 2019. Young people who left school in 2022/23 also achieved numeracy levels which were better than those achieved nationally and were in line with the West Partnership. At levels three and four, attainment in numeracy has improved since 2019 and at levels five and six, attainment in numeracy remains in line with the 2019 levels and remains higher than the virtual comparator. The overall attainment of the middle 60 per cent of school leavers in South Lanarkshire is in line with the West Partnership and virtual comparators. It is also above the national level and is higher than in 2019. The overall attainment of the upper 20 per cent of leavers is also in line with the West Partnership and national levels and it is also higher than in 2019. The data also shows that some measures in the attainment gap remain high, and there is evidence of more young people from less affluent backgrounds leaving school earlier. Their attainment levels are generally improving but are not increasing at the same rate as their peers. Both the staying-on rate and the attainment of young people from deprived backgrounds are a focus for schools in the upcoming session. Leavers’ destinations and post-school participation is still a key strength for South Lanarkshire school and support services, and positive destination rates continue to improve and remain above all comparator measures. The West Partnership - which South Lanarkshire education data is being compared to - is a collaboration of eight local authorities across the West of Scotland, including East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow City, Inverclyde, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire.",

        "description": "\"Data science’s power lies in the ability to connect theoretical knowledge and real-world actions,\" remarks Aditi Goyal, a data engineer at AmazonThe post Forging the link between data science and practical application appeared first on Digital Journal.",
        "content": "Opinions expressed by Digital Journal contributors are their own. “Data science’s power lies in the ability to connect theoretical knowledge and real-world actions,” remarks Aditi Goyal, a data engineer at Amazon . The global big data market is set to reach a valuation of $234.6 billion in 2026, creating a demand for professionals who can translate complex data. Like other data science professionals, Goyal’s contributions to her field largely revolve around helping businesses make better decisions through data analysis and collation. With a background in computer science and information systems, Goyal’s technical skills and business sense allow her to turn complex data challenges into actionable solutions. Her work prompts decisive action and efficiency across Amazon, impacting teams throughout the organization. Goyal has developed machine learning (ML) models that analyze customer buying patterns, allowing Amazon to gain insights into purchasing trends for events like Prime Day. This project aimed to improve sales and customer satisfaction through personalized content and recommendations. Furthermore, her work has involved deploying real-time analytics systems to enable Amazon to respond to market changes. Other Amazon teams now use data pipelines and analytics tools developed by Goyal’s team. These tools optimize performance, reduce costs, and enhance customer experience. Goyal has also worked on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with Amazon’s data analytics frameworks. These systems leverage AI-driven forecasts to help maintain optimal stock levels, avoiding overstock and understock situations. Goyal has also employed ML models aimed at identifying user preferences among Smart devices to improve customer satisfaction. Moreover, Goyal’s team has developed sentiment analysis algorithms. These algorithms analyze customer feedback and online interactions to extract insights into customer emotions and preferences. This data-driven approach enables Amazon to tailor its customer service and product offerings more effectively. It aims to fortify customer loyalty and brand strength. However, not all of Amazon’s data handling is done in the name of customer service. A 2015 study by BARC Research indicates that companies that analyze big data report an average of 8% increase in revenues, largely owing to enhanced decision-making by leaders. One notable example of Goyal’s contributions in this vein is her contributions to Amazon leadership surrounding high-severity issues, where her high-performance dashboards and deep data analysis methodologies aided in major decision-making. In these cases, Goyal’s expertise allowed her to produce visualizations and concrete facts related to Amazon warehouse performance and progress tracking on the renowned sub-same-day delivery program. One of the critical challenges facing the data science community is the need for more clarity between academic research and practical application. Machine learning and AI continue to push the possibilities, but translating their output into tangible business value remains a hurdle. Goyal addresses this challenge through collaboration and cross-functional teamwork. By working closely with stakeholders across the organization, from product managers to software engineers, she ensures that data science initiatives are aligned with business objectives and deliver measurable results. Goyal has worked on translating technical concepts into language that non-technical stakeholders can understand, with the goal of making data science more accessible and actionable. Goyal envisions integrating data science into every aspect of business. “There is great potential for data science to transform industries,” says Goyal. “Capitalizing on analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence will let us discover previously hidden insights and drive development we never thought possible. Like the mathematicians of old, pure data can also teach us about the universe itself.” Goyal, however, argues that realizing this potential requires drastic changes in how organizations approach data science. She believes businesses must embrace sharing data across teams and using it to drive strategic initiatives. “The future of data science isn’t just about technology. At its heart, it’s about people,” emphasizes Goyal. “We need to build a team of data scientists with the skills to communicate insights effectively to stakeholders at all levels of the organization.” Goyal’s work has aimed to bridge data science and practical application to advance developments that could reshape industries.",

        "content": "The family of a stroke victim have thanked volunteers from a national construction charity who have built him a ground-floor extension so he can sleep in his own bedroom for the first time in more than two years. Keith Parry, 70, has only left his house three times after suffering a severe stroke in late 2021, which left him in hospital for seven months. The joiner, from Gaer, Newport, South Wales, was only able to return home after his wife had a specialist bed and lifting equipment installed in the lounge. But he was left without any privacy or facilities and effectively lived under the stairs in his lounge, prompting the comparison by local healthcare professionals to fantasy character Harry Potter, who had to live in a cupboard under the stairs in the world-famous books. In an emotional handover, Mr Parry’s wife Linda thanked the volunteers from Band of Builders. They built the extension – which includes a bedroom and wet room – as well as all the national and local companies that rallied around by donating everything from materials for the project to food and drinks for the volunteers. “What Band of Builders has done will change our lives forever,” she said. “Our gratitude will never be enough – and from the bottom of our hearts we thank all the volunteers who travelled from far and wide to build the extension with a bedroom and bathroom to give Keith his dignity back. “The work has been of the highest standards and long may Band of Builders continue helping people like us.” The father-of-three suffered a stroke in an upstairs bedroom at his home in late 2021 which robbed him of his speech and mobility. Mr Parry spent seven months in different hospitals in South Wales undergoing rehabilitation. He went home after a hospital bed and lifting equipment were installed in the lounge of their home, where he has slept ever since. Because their house is at the bottom of a steep bank, his family cannot get him out of the house, so he has only left three times in the last two years. When Mr Parry needs to attend medical appointments, two ambulance crews are required, and often the fire service is on hand to help as well. Nearly 50 tradespeople – including plant workers, bricklayers, builders, roofers, plumbers, electricians and decorators – and other Band of Builders supporters volunteered on the three-week project, which was sponsored by Tarmac Blue Circle. Garry Gregory, from Tarmac Blue Circle, added: “We’re extremely proud to once again be supporting Band of Builders with its latest project for Keith. “We hope that this project has brought some comfort to him at this difficult time. “The work the team is doing is extremely important for the industry and we look forward to continuing to make an impact with Band of Builders.”",

        "content": "OTTAWA — Immigration Minister Marc Miller is increasing the number of applications that will be processed under a much-criticized program to reunite Palestinians with Canadian relatives. The move comes as he testifies about measures introduced months ago that were meant to bring relatives of Canadians from conflict zones in the Gaza Strip and Sudan to safety. The Gaza program initially had a cap of 1,000 applications that could be “accepted into processing,” but Miller is now increasing that number to 5,000, each of which can include multiple family members. Palestinian Canadians have complained about inconsistent messaging and onerous requirements that left people unable to leave Gaza before Israel effectively closed access to Egypt. Civil war in Sudan broke out last spring, yet family members say officials expect their relatives will not reach Canada until the end of this year, citing delays with fingerprinting and other biometric requirements Miller is providing a briefing about both programs today at the House of Commons immigration committee. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it has issued 179 temporary-resident permits through the Gaza program as of April 29, but the department doesn’t know whether anyone has actually reached Canada. In a statement, Miller said that Canada has been sending the names of approved temporary residents to Israeli and Egyptian authorities, even though they can’t currently exit the Gaza Strip. “While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time,” Miller said. “With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves.” There continue to be reports of Palestinians paying thousands of dollars to cross into Egypt amid uncertainty over their resettlement status. Relatives in Canada say they were given mixed information from Ottawa about whether those who paid to cross could still access the Canadian program. The Gaza program involves temporary residency permits, while the Sudan program is for permanent residency. The NDP has accused the government of bungling both programs, and not learning from other conflict situations, such as the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

        "content": "The family of a stroke victim have thanked volunteers from a national construction charity who have built him a ground-floor extension so he can sleep in his own bedroom for the first time in more than two years. Keith Parry, 70, has only left his house three times after suffering a severe stroke in late 2021, which left him in hospital for seven months. The joiner, from Gaer, Newport, South Wales, was only able to return home after his wife had a specialist bed and lifting equipment installed in the lounge. But he was left without any privacy or facilities and effectively lived under the stairs in his lounge, prompting the comparison by local healthcare professionals to fantasy character Harry Potter, who had to live in a cupboard under the stairs in the world-famous books. In an emotional handover, Mr Parry’s wife Linda thanked the volunteers from Band of Builders. They built the extension – which includes a bedroom and wet room – as well as all the national and local companies that rallied around by donating everything from materials for the project to food and drinks for the volunteers. “What Band of Builders has done will change our lives forever,” she said. “Our gratitude will never be enough – and from the bottom of our hearts we thank all the volunteers who travelled from far and wide to build the extension with a bedroom and bathroom to give Keith his dignity back. “The work has been of the highest standards and long may Band of Builders continue helping people like us.” The father-of-three suffered a stroke in an upstairs bedroom at his home in late 2021 which robbed him of his speech and mobility. Mr Parry spent seven months in different hospitals in South Wales undergoing rehabilitation. He went home after a hospital bed and lifting equipment were installed in the lounge of their home, where he has slept ever since. Because their house is at the bottom of a steep bank, his family cannot get him out of the house, so he has only left three times in the last two years. When Mr Parry needs to attend medical appointments, two ambulance crews are required, and often the fire service is on hand to help as well. Nearly 50 tradespeople – including plant workers, bricklayers, builders, roofers, plumbers, electricians and decorators – and other Band of Builders supporters volunteered on the three-week project, which was sponsored by Tarmac Blue Circle. Garry Gregory, from Tarmac Blue Circle, added: “We’re extremely proud to once again be supporting Band of Builders with its latest project for Keith. “We hope that this project has brought some comfort to him at this difficult time. “The work the team is doing is extremely important for the industry and we look forward to continuing to make an impact with Band of Builders.”",

        "description": "FIRST Gen Corp. subsidiary Energy Development Corp. (EDC) on Monday listed the second tranche of its Asean green bonds, amounting to P10 billion, at the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp. (PDEx).It was the final tranche of a P15-billion shelf registration and was comprised of three-year bonds due in 2027, five-year bonds due in 2029, and seven-year bonds due in 2031.EDC said that strong demand enabled the company to exercise an oversubscription option and raise an additional P4 billion.The bonds were priced at the lowest end of the credit spread range, fetching rates of 6.7478 percent, 6.8873 percent and 7.0626 percent for the three-year, five-year and seven-year series, respectively.EDC President and COO Jerome Cainglet noted that the \"dangerously high heat indices\" experienced in the country over the past weeks had led to a surge in demand for electricity, particularly for cooling, \"which has significantly reduced our reserve levels and has put upward pressure on electricity prices.\"\"We look forward to adding renewable energy capacity to address these and, through the green bonds, present the public with the opportunity to participate in financing clean and renewable energy projects,\" he added, in line with EDC's mission of forging pathways for a \"decarbonized and regenerative future.\"EDC Chief Finance Officer Erwin Avante said the proceeds from the bond offer would be used mostly for geothermal projects, maintenance of other green projects, and for battery energy storage systems.\"Our capital expenditure [budget] for this year is around P40 billion, and this P10 billion [bond offering] is just part of that, so we're still talking to the banks for the balance,\" he added.Avante said that half of the capex budget was intended for growth projects that were expected to be completed within the year, while the other half \"is for our [geothermal] drilling, as we are drilling a lot of wells this year.\"EDC was granted the go-ahead for its second tranche green bond offer by the Securities and Exchange Commission last May 10. The first tranche, amounting to P5 billion, was issued and listed in June 2021.BDO Capital and Investment Corp. and BPI Capital Corp. acted as joint issue managers and were also joint lead underwriters and joint bookrunners together with China Bank Capital Corp. and SB Capital Investment Corp.RCBC Trust Corp. and RCBC Capital Corp. were the trustee and selling agent, respectively, for the transaction.EDC parent First Gen's shares dropped 1.53 percent to P17.98 each on Monday.",

        "description": "FUEL and power costs in the Philippines are higher because the country does not provide subsidies compared to its neighbors, according to one of the country’s top businessmen.",
        "content": "FUEL and power costs in the Philippines are higher because the country does not provide subsidies compared to its neighbors, according to one of the country’s top businessmen. In the Philippine Economic Briefing (PEB), San Miguel Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer Ramon S. Ang said gasoline in Malaysia costs P20 per liter, P40 per liter more than the average P60 per liter price in the country. Ang traced this mainly to the Malaysian government’s subsidizing a third or 30 percent of fuel costs in their country. In contrast, he said, the Philippine government, apart from not subsidizing fuel costs, also imposes excise taxes that make up another one-third of pump prices in the country. “If you look at it on an equal basis, our prices without the subsidy and without taxes is even lower than Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. It’s also the same as power,” Ang said at the open forum at the PEB’s first plenary session on Monday. “Our power generation compared to our neighboring countries are lower. But we impose taxes on the power sector of fuel. And we also...don’t give subsidy on power. That’s why our power prices are higher,” he added. Meanwhile, Ang said that despite the high fuel and power costs, investors must not use this as a reason why they will not invest in the Philippines. If investors are keen on putting up businesses such as factories in the Philippines, they should consider putting up their own power generation facility to serve their power needs, he added. “If you are a foreign investor that wants to come to the Philippines, that [high power costs] is not a reason for not coming. You should come and put up your own power generating plant in your factory. Which is very easy to put up. And the Philippine government encourages all big energy consumers to put up,” Ang said. The SMC executive also said the country should fight for its sovereignty when it comes to the West Philippine Sea. The country has a lot of reserves in the WPS and could allow the production of more natural gas to help bring down energy costs. “Our oil production is only 6,000 barrels per day. Compared to our neighboring countries, average 1 million barrels a day. That’s why they can put in subsidy. [In the] Philippines, we don’t have oil,” Ang said. “But we have a very big reserve in West Philippine Sea. That’s why they are very interested in the Philippines. So let us start. Let go of it. We should protect our territory,” he stressed. Asked whether subsidies are a good idea to bring down the cost of fuel and power, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan said subsidies may not be the best way forward. Balisacan explained why: the main subsidy recipients will be the rich, who are the biggest consumers of fuel and power. However, he said, the government already has programs to subsidize the fuel and power needs of the most vulnerable. The National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) Secretary said targeting mechanisms can be improved through the government’s digitalization program and the national ID. “That way we can save a lot of fiscal resources and avoid potentially serious problems like a fiscal crisis. That’s what happened in the past when we had the Oil Price Stabilization Fund [OPSF] that became so unsustainable and caused a lot of fiscal problems,” Balisacan recalled. In a discussion paper published in 2022, PIDS Senior Research Fellow Adoracion Navarro said reviving the OPSF would be anti-poor. If the OPSF is revived, Navarro said it disproportionately benefits the rich more than the poor. This will be complicated by the government’s lack of expertise when it comes to “managing the fund, and controlling the deficits of the fund.” She, instead, recommended oil stockpiling instead of reviving the OPSF. Keeping strategic oil reserves, Navarro said, is common practice by net oil importing countries. While this is not yet part of the National Energy Plan, stockpiling is proposed to be done by the state-owned Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC).",

Now, McKenna has made the bold decision to stay with Ipswich. According to various reports, he will sign a new long-term contract in Suffolk. It was reported the Tractor Boys were willing to offer McKenna the biggest contract in the club’s history . It would see him earn around £5m per year - around four times what he currently banks. Transfer news live - Chelsea in 'advanced' Maresca talks, Man Utd deal confirmed Erik ten Hag sacking verdict reached after Man Utd's FA Cup final victory Ipswich had also made an effort to keep McKenna last year by slotting a £4m release clause into his deal.

The Seagulls will now be forced to look elsewhere as they aim to appoint a new manager ahead of next season. Sir Jim Ratcliffe now has a decision to make over the future of Ten Hag.

The Red Devils beat the odds to claim the trophy against neighbours Man City with a 2-1 victory . While he stayed quiet on his position after the final whistle at Wembley, he had previously hinted that he had already held talks with Ratcliffe . “They said they want to change everything and that they want to rebuild WITH me. This is what they told me directly,” he said to Dutch outlet Vi.NL. “INEOS will change things in the club and certain projects have already started. Carrington will get be completely destroyed, a new training ground will come. “We need to sign an extra striker in the summer. And if we can sign another central midfielder and a replacement for Varane, things will look good again.

        "content": "DOZENS of accommodation centres for Ukrainian refugees are set to close, the Taoiseach has said. Almost 70 contracts for Ukrainian refugee accommodation will expire “shortly”, according to Simon Harris . Mr Harris said that many hotel and community facilities which were being used as refugee accommodation will made available again for local use. Speaking to Ireland AM on Virgin Media , Mr Harris said that the state needs to move “beyond this emergency response” to migration. He added: “Firstly, we need to stop taking the only hotel in the town and there is some good news in relation to this. “In Co Kerry , for example, we’ve been able to put two hotels that had been used for migration back into use. \"There are 68 contracts currently being used for Ukrainian accommodation that will not be used shortly and that we’ll see many hotels and other facilities coming back into their community, that’s important for communities to see and to know. “The second thing though is, and I’ve been very honest about this, we have to stop the conversation about migration only being about accommodation. “If you do that you’re going to completely lose the people in this country, you’re going to see a breakdown in social cohesion. “I believe very strongly that Irish people are compassionate. I really believe it. Irish communities have done an incredible job. “We have taken a number of measures to show people that there’s a rules based system, that if you come here and you don’t have a right to be here, you’re going to find out about that quicker and be asked to leave, that our welfare system is there to support you, but it’s never open to abuse.” In recent months the Government has introduced tighter rules around welfare supports for asylum seekers and Ukrainians. Last week, the Government announced plans to means-test asylum seekers . Social Protection Minister Heather Humphreys is currently looking at means-test plans to be introduced next month, following a recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General. Under the plans, international protection applicants will have their welfare payments cut if they are employed and earning more than €125 a week. The Government has already reduced the social welfare payments for Ukrainian refugees who arrived after March from the job seekers’ rate of €232 to €38.80 per week. Last week, it announced Ukrainians who fled to Ireland between 2022 and early 2024 and are living in state-provided accommodation will also have their allowances cut in the next three months. The changes will not affect Ukrainians living in pledged accommodation and the private rental sector who arrived in Ireland before March this year.",

        "content": "I have learned that it may not be a good idea to go shopping online when you are tired. And it is the middle of the night. And you may, or may not, be shopping in your sleep. Because that is how I recently ended up placing a bid of $100 on a $1 Matchbox car for our grandson’s first birthday. My intentions were honorable. It was a good idea at the time. Except the time was somewhere between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. The auction clock was ticking. I had around 45 seconds to place my bid. Somehow, I typed in $100 instead of $1. And for the next 421⁄2 seconds I held my breath and hoped nobody ran up my stupid bid. Well, now I know I can hold my breath for at least 421⁄2 seconds. This chain of events started when I received the newest catalog from our favorite discount bookseller. Those catalogs are eagerly anticipated, and we order so many books that the FedEx drivers draw straws to see who has to deliver the books to our porch. We seldom see the same driver twice. I favor buying large and glossy art books. They are full of pictures, and not a lot of words. Art books are invariably in a large hardcover format, and 200 pages of art can weigh about five pounds. Art is a heavy subject. ADVERTISEMENT My history-loving husband buys big fat books that are chock-a-block full of words and dates and people. Not a lot of pictures. His books are heavy by the sheer weight of all the words in them. Eight hundred pages of history weigh about the same as 200 pages of art. My art books are way prettier to look at, though. The company has flat-rate shipping, and we always figure, “Why buy ten books, when we can buy 15 or 20, and they ship for the same price?” Okay, we usually stop at about 30 books per order. That is how I ended up with “Vroom” on the kitchen table. “Vroom” is a toddlers’ picture book about a little boy who likes fast cars. Perfect for a first birthday. But one needs a fast car to go with a book about fast cars. What is the best fast car around? A Corvette. Particularly, a red Corvette convertible. Especially because I have one. And that is why I was cruising eBay at 2:30 in the morning, looking for a 1987 Corvette Matchbox car. Vroom-Boom. Now JJ will have a hot car, just like his Gamma’s. I admit to shopping online for books in the middle of the night, too. Fortunately, I am not bidding at auction for them. But I do sometimes end up with strange volumes. Like my illustrated book on the complete history of political picture postcards from 1900 to 1945. I am giving that one to a friend. I suppose I will have to browse eBay to find some postcards to go along with it.",

        "content": "MICHEAL Martin blasted the overnight Israeli strikes on a refugee camp in Rafah as “barbaric”. The Tanaiste said UN agencies had predicted that Israel’s assault on Rafah would have dire consequences. Martin was speaking during a joint news conference in Brussels with his Spanish and Norwegian counterparts, ahead of this week’s recognition by the three governments of the State of Palestine . Gaza and West Bank officials said Israeli strikes on a centre for displaced people killed dozens in a “massacre” near Rafah over the weekend, while the Israeli army insisted it had targeted Hamas militants. Martin said: “All of this was predicted by all the UN agencies and humanitarian groups that I met. “They predicted that any military operation in Rafah would have dire consequences for the population in Gaza and that is exactly what is happening right now. “This is on top of the hunger, on top of the starvation, the refusal to allow aid in sufficient volumes. What we witnessed last night was barbaric.” Spanish Foreign Minister José Manuel Albares said the attack came after the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to order Israel to halt its assault on Rafah. He added: “If Israel continues to pursue [its actions] against that opinion of the International Court of Justice, that we try to take the right measures to enforce that decision and back one of the most important bodies of the UN Charter.” Martin told reporters that this week’s recognition of the state of Palestine reflected the determination of Ireland, Spain and Norway to bring about a fundamental paradigm shift in the approach to the Middle East conflict. He added: “The international community, including the European Union , have been talking about support for a two state solution based on the 1967 borders for decades, but we are no nearer to getting close to that desired end state. “We firmly believe that without changing our approach we will never get there. Some have said our decision to recognise the state of Palestine as a move to impose an outcome on the parties or, as somehow a reward for terror. “Nothing could be further from the truth.”",

        "content": "Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's aide Bibhav Kumar, accused of assaulting Aam Aadmi Party MP Swati Maliwal, has been denied bail by a city court. The order came after Ms Maliwal broke down in court and alleged that his bail would place her and her family in danger. In its judgment, the court said, \"The allegations raised by the victim have to be taken at face value and cannot be swiped away\". There is no evidence that Ms Maliwal's actions were pre-meditated, as argued by the accused. If it was, there would not have been a four-day delay in filing the complaint with the police. It would have been done the same day. That she was assaulted has been borne out by medical examination, the judge said. Given the investigation is at a nascent stage, the possibility of evidence tampering or witness influencing remains and so, bail cannot be granted at this stage, the court said. Ms Maliwal -- whom AAP has accused of being part of a BJP conspiracy to malign Mr Kejriwal -- had told the court that with the party siding with the accused, there was a threat to her life if Bibhav Kumar is released. She also told the court that a video by a YouTuber has already made her a target on social media and she has been receiving rape threats since. Ms Maliwal, a member of Rajya Sabha and former chief of Delhi Women's Commission, has alleged that Bibhav Kumar assaulted her at the Chief Minister's residence on May 13. She said she was waiting to meet the Chief Minister inside the house, when Bibhav Kumar came and attacked her. He rained blows and kicks on her and had even tried to tear off her shirt, she alleged. Mr Kejriwal's aide has accused Ms Mailwal of attempting to barge into the Chief Minister's residence and said he had just tried to stop her. During today's arguments, his counsel also questioned the delay in filing the police complaint, tagging it an \"afterthought\". He also questioned the police contention that an attempt was made to disrobe a woman. \"There was no intent to disrobe her. The only intent was to prevent her from entering the CM's residence... All that can be seen is that during the scuffle, her shirt was torn. It is an incidental situation,\" he had told the court. Promoted Listen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com A couple of videos from the Chief Minister's residence that surfaced on social media, showed Ms Maliwal having an argument with the security personnel. AAP, which earlier said Bibhav Kumar \"misbehaved\" with Ms Maliwal and will face action, has now accused her of being part of a BJP conspiracy against Mr Kejriwal. The party said in a statement today that Bibhav Kumar will challenge the bail refusal in High Court.",

        "content": "Libertarians have crowned former Georgia Senate hopeful Chase Oliver as their 2024 presidential nominee after a grueling eight hours of voting at their convention over the weekend. Oliver, 38, who managed to fend off outside attempts to usurp the Libertarian Pary endorsement, now joins the likes of independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and independent Cornel West as a third-party force in the 2024 arena. “We did it! I am officially the presidential nominee,” Oliver posted on X after clinching the party nod. Oliver now appears to be the first millennial to clinch a significant third-party presidential nomination. During the Libertarian Convention over the weekend in the Washington Hilton, former President Donald Trump and Kennedy delivered entreaties to the liberty-loving party, seeking to join forces. Trump sought to woo libertarians with a promise to pardon Ross Ulbricht, a darknet black market operator who was arrested in 2013 and is serving out a life sentence. The 45th president also said that he would put a libertarian in his cabinet. Ultimately, Trump’s vows fell flat and he was forced to power through a chorus of boos at times during his speech Sunday. “If you want to lose, do that. Keep getting your 3% every four years,” Trump chided to the raucous crowd at one point. Libertarians drew their largest share of the presidential vote in 2016 when they nabbed 3.3% support nationally. Oliver suggested to CNN that amassing over 2% of the national vote is a reasonable objective. Scores of libertarians have been keen on distinguishing themselves from the duopoly, despite some overlap on vaunted small government talk with conservatives. During the voting process, Trump attained six write-in votes in the first round. Kennedy, who was nominated by a delegate, scored 19 votes and was eliminated in the first round. Despite his defeat, Trump, 77, was adamant that he could’ve won the Libertarian nod if he actually wanted it. “The reason I didn’t file paperwork for the Libertarian Nomination, which I would have absolutely gotten if I wanted it (as everyone could tell by the enthusiasm of the Crowd last night!), was the fact that, as the Republican Nominee, I am not allowed to,” he wrote on Truth Social . Oliver initially came in second place, behind Michael Rectenwald, who held the lead during the early rounds of voting. But eventually, Oliver cut a deal with Mike ter Maat, who was among the top three, which helped propel him over the finish line during the seventh round of voting with about 60% of the vote. Ter Maat later won the Libertarian Party’s vice presidential nod after two rounds of voting. Here is what we know about Oliver, the Libertarian Party’s millennial nominee. Oliver, who has been described as “ armed and gay ,” grew up in Nashville, Tenn. He was briefly a Democrat from roughly 2003 to 2009, before switching his party affiliation to Independent. In 2020, he vied for Georgia’s 5th congressional district special, which was won by former Rep. Kwanza Hall (D-Ga.). Oliver then jockeyed for the 2022 Georgia Senate race. That contest ultimately went to a runoff, something that some analysts blamed on him as he garnered over 2% support during the first round. Now that Oliver is the party’s nominee, he is hoping to mount a campaign in all 50 states and is keen on trying to peel off younger voters. “I wanted to demonstrate to the delegates and to the voters that we have the drive and energy to push ourselves everywhere to grow our party’s foundation in every state,” Oliver told Politico . Like many libertarians, he has distanced himself from both Democrats and occasionally even Republicans on many economic issues. But he has also roiled conservatives on social issues. After he clinched the nod, right-leaning accounts quickly slammed him for defending the right to host drag queen story hours. Libertarian nominee Chase Oliver: 99% of drag queen story hours are fine for kids. If he had children, he says he'd bring them to one and leave them there. \"It's just like the Wiggles\" pic.twitter.com/grNYFtAVHQ Earlier this year Chase Oliver, the Libertarian Party Nominee, went to the border to advocate for open borders. With everything we've seen happen to our country because of Biden's policies, this guy is arguing to open the border even more. Naive. Foolish. Anti-American. pic.twitter.com/rAZvtVVZVw They’ve also seethed at him for pushing back against GOP goals for shutting down the US-Mexico border. Chase is also pro-abortion rights. Polling has sparsely gauged libertarian influence in the 2024 presidential election given the lack of a nominee until now. Nationally, Trump is up in front with 41.2%, followed by President Biden at 39.4%, Kennedy at 10.6%, Stein at 1.8%, and West at 1.8%, per the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls.",

        "content": "GREENHILLS Shopping Center (GSC) has committed to gradually move 100 percent of its merchants away from selling intellectual property (IP) infringing products by 2027, according to the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL). The intellectual property rights watchdog said, in its statement on Monday, the commitment was made after it met with the shopping mall, as well as brand owners and enforcement agencies on May 9. It unveiled developments in its campaign to encourage the flea market traders to shift away from counterfeit products. At the meeting, GSC Assistant Vice President and Trade Fairs and Exhibits Head James Candelaria presented the mall’s 10-year roadmap, which aims to gradually move 100 percent of its merchants away from selling IP-infringing products by 2027. According to IPOPHL, starting in 2020, GSC management decided to reduce the number of stalls to 1,412 from 1,771. Candelaria also reported that as of October 2023, at least 80 percent of the traders have gone through the transition program and are now selling local products, Halal items, jewelry, antiques, furniture pieces and artworks. He also showed that over the years since the implementation of the roadmap, the mall was able to “weed out” nearly 299 stores by suspension. “The GSC suspends stores that violate its rules, including [intellectual property] IP rules, and majority of the suspended sellers, according to Candelaria, do not return to GSC,” IPOPHL noted. According to Candelaria, the shopping mall has so far educated its traders to tell them that “it’s time to change and that there are other products to profit from.” The GSC official said some of the mall’s recent education initiatives include a learning event with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), attended by over 400 merchants, and “Bagsakan” events where the GSC showcases local products traders could explore selling. IPOPHL said that since 2022, the mall has refused to accept applicants who intend to sell bags, watches and similar products, except where local manufacturers or labeled products are involved. “The category usually makes up a big share of the counterfeit products seized by the National Committee on IP Rights [NCIPR],” said IPOPHL. The country’s intellectual property rights body said Greenhills also provided incentives to stores that sell local delicacies and items, placing them at “premium” locations in various entrances of the building where the flea market is located. IPOPHL said the meeting was also attended by legal representatives of luxury brands, who discussed solutions with GSC for their teams to better monitor stores. The dialogue was followed by a brief tour, through which GSC showed the new mall building, filled with well-known apparel brands and food stores, and the flea market, said the IP rights body. For his part, IPOPHL Director General Rowel S. Barba reminded stall owners on the importance of selling original products, noting IPOPHL will soon conduct an IP briefing with these stall owners to help them transition to “legitimate goods.” “We laud the commitment of the GSC to work together with its merchants to create a fairer and more IP-conscious business environment. We look forward to seeing more positive outcomes from this transition program,” Barba said. IPOPHL is one of DTI’s attached agencies. Trade and Industry Secretary Alfredo E. Pascual for his part called on other malls to look at the Greenhills Shopping Center as an “example and see how good business practices can be done gradually.” While the GSC is the lone physical market flagged in the United States Trade Representative Notorious Markets Lists, it is joined by the Cartimar Shopping Center and the markets of Baclaran and Divisoria in the European Commission’s Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List.",

        "content": "Lahore: As many as 33 suspects arrested in connection with the attack on the minority Christians, their properties and police personnel on the issue of alleged desecration of a religious book in Pakistan’s Punjab province were sent to jail on judicial remand on Monday, police said. An enraged mob led by radical Islamist Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists on Saturday attacked the Christian community members in Mujahid Colony, Sargodha district of Punjab, some 200kms from Lahore, and injured two Christians and 10 policemen. The mob burned and ransacked the homes and properties of Christians. According to a statement of the Punjab police on Monday, 44 suspects have been arrested so far in the Sargodha incident and of them 33 sent to jail on judicial remand. It said the police are thoroughly investigating the case and those involved in instigating the people to violence will not be spared. Police have booked over 450 people under terrorism and other charges. According to the FIR, a mob surrounded the residence and shoe factory of Nazir Masih (an elderly Christian) accusing him of desecration of the Quran. The enraged mob set fire to the shoe factory, some shops and a couple of houses. “It also brutally torched Masih but timely arrival of a heavy contingent of police saved the life of Masih and 10 other members of the Christian community,” the FIR says. Although the family of Masih denied desecration of the Quran but the mob wanted to lynch him. “The enraged mob pelted stones at police personnel when they resorted to baton charge to disperse it. At least 10 policemen including officers have been injured,” it says. A police statement said: “There was no loss of life in the mob attack. More than 10 police officers and personnel have been injured due to stone pelting by the angry people. The police risked their lives to rescue the families and pulled them out of the crowd. Thanks to the timely action of the police, Sargodha is spared a great tragedy.” “The situation in the city is completely peaceful and under control,” it said. It added that the injured Christian, Nazir, has been shifted to the Combined Military Hospital in Sargodha for treatment. Police said that a case will be instituted against Nazir if he is found guilty of desecration of the religious book. The Punjab police said currently over 2,000 policemen have been deployed in Sargodha Mujahid Colony to maintain law and order. Last year at least 24 churches and over 80 houses belonging to Christians in Jaranwala tehsil of Faisalabad district, some 130 km from the provincial capital, were burnt down by a mob enraged over reports that two Christians had desecrated the Quran.",

        "description": "Minnesota's young superstar believes his team's season is far from over.",
        "content": "The ' season is at a breaking point. After winning the first two games of the series on the road, the got a chance to push the series with the Timberwolves to the edge of a cliff on their own homecourt. They did just that. Dallas won the game 116-107 to take a commanding 3-0 series lead over Minnesota. Any fan will be familiar with just how damning these circumstances are for and his team. No squad has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit in the long, storied history of the league. Despite the overwhelming odds and being tasked with doing something that has never been done before, Edwards is not short on confidence about how the rest of this series will turn out. The good news for Edwards and his team is that, despite the 3-0 deficit, every game in this series has been relatively close. Each Mavericks' victory has been by single digits. Furthermore, two of the three final scores were decided by three points or fewer. The bad news for the Wolves is they still have a lot to figure out if they can live up to the lofty statement tossed out by Edwards. Minnesota's stars have struggled to handle the defense that Dallas has thrown their way. The averages for Edwards, , and have been less than impressive in this series. Minnesota's Stars In The Western Conference Finals Category Edwards Towns Gobert PPG 22.0 15.0 12.3 RPG 8.3 8.3 7.7 APG 8.0 2.7 1.7 FG% 38.6 37.5 63.6 3P% 33.3 13.6 DNQ Edwards has struggled to put the basketball in the net on a consistent basis. Shooting under 40 percent from the field as your team's primary offensive option is never going to be a formula that leads to success. Considering how underwhelming Edwards' performances might be, Towns is the player who is absolutely shooting the Timberwolves out of this series. Dallas' defense has absolutely stifled his offense. His lack of secondary scoring only makes Edwards' job as the top option harder than it already is. Gobert's struggles in this series, somewhat surprisingly, on the defensive end have resulted in Minnesota turning to the more consistent Naz Reid. The 6th man of the year has provided Minnesota with consistent offense when others on the team have struggled. On the other hand, Dallas' stars have shined brightly. and have both taken on the challenge of facing the tough Timberwolves defense and have thrived. Dončić is averaging 32.7 points, 8.7 assists and 7.7 rebounds per game in this series. Whatever defense the Wolves have thrown at Luka, he has had an answer for it. Irving has an easy argument for being the second-best player in this series. His averages of 27.7 points (on 52.5 percent from the field), 4.7 assists, and 4.0 rebounds per game have shown him to be a consistent and reliable star all series long. Kyrie's most impressive statistic heading into Game 4 isn't any of the ones listed above. Irving is 14-0 in closeout games during his NBA career. A stat that could spell doom for the confident Edwards and his team.",

        "content": "New Delhi [India], May 27 (ANI): The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) led the development of two healthcare technologies to reduce the reliance on imports, MeitY said in a statement. Both the healthcare instruments namely, a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner and a 6 MEV Linear Accelerator are developed with the participation of the Society for Applied Microwave Electronics Engineering and Research (SAMEER) as the implementing agency, in collaboration (MRI) with Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Trivendrum and Kolkata, Inter University Accelerator Centre (IUAC) and Dayanand Sagar Institute (DSI). The 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner is a non-invasive medical imaging test used to visualise soft tissues, while the Linear Accelerator (LINAC) is utilized for cancer treatment using high-energy X-rays or electrons. Both projects have received financial support from MeitY, to make India move towards import substitution. MeitY has funded these projects to boost domestic technology capabilities in healthcare, the statement added. \"In order to ensure that these technologies are accessible and affordable to the public, it is absolutely crucial to swiftly translate research into practical applications, expedite their development and deployment and fully leverage the benefits of indigenous health technologies for the benefit of people,\" the ministry further added. The ministry emphasised the importance of industry engagement. The early engagement between the government and industry can identify synergies, enhance efficiencies and create impactful collaborations, the statement noted. SAMEER has signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) for MRI and Transfer of Technology (ToT) for LINAC with B-MEC Imaging Pvt Ltd, Medirays Imaging Pvt. Ltd., Adonis Medical Systems Pvt. Ltd., INOXCVA Inox India Ltd., and Paras Defence and Technologies Ltd. among others. Speaking on the occasion, Secretary, MeitY highlighted the importance of crucial medical technologies and devices, its ever enhancing scope, challenges as well as the opportunities that India presents to the manufacturers. He informed that industry engagement is encouraging and reflects on MeitY sustained efforts in developing indigenous technologies. (ANI)",

        "description": "The family of a stroke victim have thanked volunteers from a national construction charity who have built him a ground-floor extension so he can sleep in his own bedroom for the first time in more than two years.",
        "content": "Keith Parry, 70, has only left his house three times after suffering a severe stroke in late 2021, which left him in hospital for seven months. The joiner, from Gaer, Newport, South Wales, was only able to return home after his wife had a specialist bed and lifting equipment installed in the lounge. But he was left without any privacy or facilities and effectively lived under the stairs in his lounge, prompting the comparison by local healthcare professionals to fantasy character Harry Potter, who had to live in a cupboard under the stairs in the world-famous books. In an emotional handover, Mr Parry’s wife Linda thanked the volunteers from Band of Builders. They built the extension – which includes a bedroom and wet room – as well as all the national and local companies that rallied around by donating everything from materials for the project to food and drinks for the volunteers. “What Band of Builders has done will change our lives forever,” she said. “Our gratitude will never be enough – and from the bottom of our hearts we thank all the volunteers who travelled from far and wide to build the extension with a bedroom and bathroom to give Keith his dignity back. “The work has been of the highest standards and long may Band of Builders continue helping people like us.” The father-of-three suffered a stroke in an upstairs bedroom at his home in late 2021 which robbed him of his speech and mobility. Mr Parry spent seven months in different hospitals in South Wales undergoing rehabilitation. He went home after a hospital bed and lifting equipment were installed in the lounge of their home, where he has slept ever since. Because their house is at the bottom of a steep bank, his family cannot get him out of the house, so he has only left three times in the last two years. When Mr Parry needs to attend medical appointments, two ambulance crews are required, and often the fire service is on hand to help as well. Nearly 50 tradespeople – including plant workers, bricklayers, builders, roofers, plumbers, electricians and decorators – and other Band of Builders supporters volunteered on the three-week project, which was sponsored by Tarmac Blue Circle. Garry Gregory, from Tarmac Blue Circle, added: “We’re extremely proud to once again be supporting Band of Builders with its latest project for Keith. “We hope that this project has brought some comfort to him at this difficult time. “The work the team is doing is extremely important for the industry and we look forward to continuing to make an impact with Band of Builders.”",

It also serves around 17 international carriers that bridge Cebu to multiple foreign destinations.\"For us to meet this increasing demand brought about by the boom of travel and tourism, real estate investments [have] now become a center of attention because we believe that there is still a huge opportunity that Cebu still has to offer,\" Manigsaca said.This year, AppleOne is looking to launch The Fairfield by Marriott Cebu Mactan and targets another luxury brand hotel in Cagayan de Oro to expand its presence in Mindanao.AppleOne, added Manigsaca, will continue to elevate industry standards in residential, commercial, and hospitality sectors by bringing in global brands to promote Visayas and Mindanao.The firm's investments there were said to have produced around 5,000 direct employment opportunities, which helped boost local tourism and economic growth.Since its entry into the country's property market, AppleOne has widened its portfolio of residential, hotels and resorts, and commercial developments.It also has two tertiary health care facilities — one in Cebu and the other in Davao — and a primary hospital in Tacloban.",

        "content": "THE Joint Foreign Chambers (JFC) called on legislators on Monday to approve critical bills aimed at overhauling the governance framework of the country’s airports. According to the JFC, there are three urgent reforms that will enhance the safety, efficiency, and quality of domestic and international airports across the country. These three legislative reforms are the following: amendments to the Civil Aviation Authority Act of the Philippines (Caap) Law; the creation of the Philippine Airports Authority; and the establishment of the Philippine Transportation Safety Board. “These reforms are essential to enhancing the safety, efficiency, and overall quality of both domestic and international airports in the Philippines,” the JFC said in its letter to the Philippine Senate. The proposed amendments to the Caap Law aim to bolster the agency’s role in safety oversight by improving human resource development, strengthening the board, and aligning with global safety standards. The creation of the Philippine Airports Authority is intended to resolve the conflicting roles of Caap as both an airport regulator and operator, thereby improving operational efficiency. Lastly, the formation of the Philippine Transportation Safety Board would enhance the government’s capacity to investigate accidents and bolster overall transportation safety. According to the JFC, the government should prioritize these legislative reforms, citing the recent events at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia), where numerous flights were delayed due to a technical issue with the navigational air traffic management system. This incident—along with other unfortunate events at the Naia such as power interruptions, congestion, and even sanitary issues—has underscored the need for robust regulatory and operational frameworks to prevent similar occurrences in the future. The JFC, representing over 3,000 member companies and over US$100 billion in trade and $30 billion in investments in the Philippines, stressed that these reforms would significantly benefit the country’s aviation sector. The coalition includes the American, Australian-New Zealand, Canadian, European, Japanese, and Korean chambers, as well as Pamuri. “The JFC supports and promotes open international trade, increased foreign investment, and improved conditions for business to benefit both the Philippines and the countries we represent,” the JFC said.",

        "description": "The special counsel is seeking to prevent Trump from making further incendiary remarks about the FBI agents involved in the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
        "content": "Special counsel is preparing legal action if a Donald Trump-appointed judge refuses to rein in the former president's comments, a former prosecutor has said. Trump has repeatedly said that the FBI was willing to use legal force while searching his Mar-a-Lago estate for classified documents. Smith filed a motion to Judge on May 24 seeking an alteration to Trump's bail conditions, in which he would be restrained from making dangerous and untrue comments about the FBI. Smith was appointed special counsel supervising Trump's federal indictments. sought email comment from Trump's attorney on Monday. Former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance wrote in her legal blog, , on Sunday that Smith decided not to apply for a gag order because he knows that it would be easier to appeal if Cannon refuses his request to adjust Trump's bail conditions. \"Why did Smith go this route instead of asking for a gag order? That's a great question, and I think it suggests where Smith is headed,\" wrote Vance, who served as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Alabama during the Obama administration. She said the relevant federal law \"specifically authorizes the government to appeal if a district judge denies a motion to modify the conditions of release.\" \"That's what this is all about. Donald Trump isn't the only one who can take an appeal for strategic reasons. Judge Cannon has had real trouble ruling for the government in routine motions that clearly merited that treatment. If she rules against them here, they'll be prepared to take a quick appeal,\" Vance wrote. Cannon is a U.S. district judge based in Florida and was appointed by Trump in 2020. She is now presiding over the DOJ's case against the former president. He is and then obstructing the government's efforts to retrieve them. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Cannon has faced criticism and calls to recuse herself from the case for making a the former president. Vance said \"the more pressing question\" is what Smith will do if Cannon deliberately doesn't move on his request—\"if she sits on the motion, as she has on so many others in this case, without ruling or even scheduling a hearing.\" \"Smith will likely be politely persistent at first, asking her to schedule the hearing,\" she wrote. If that doesn't work, Smith will likely seek a writ of mandamus to the appeal court, Vance believes. \"Mandamus asks an appellate court to order a trial judge to do something they are obligated to do but won't or to refrain from doing something they are not permitted to do,\" she explained. The search warrant used in the 2022 raid on Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence was recently in Florida. The raid led to the seizure of hundreds of documents containing classified information, which resulted in dozens of felony counts against the former president. The former president posted on his Truth Social account, alleging that the DOJ \"AUTHORIZED THE TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE.\" In addition, a Trump campaign email that was recently sent to supporters said that FBI agents were \"authorized to shoot\" Trump, saying President was \"locked & loaded and ready to take me [Trump] out.\" However, the FBI said in a statement that the wording of the warrant was standard and the phrase \"deadly force\" was also included when agents . \"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter,\" the agency's statement said. Discussing Trump's claim about the search warrant, U.S. Attorney General said at a news conference on Thursday that the \"allegation is false and it is extremely dangerous,\" reiterating that the document in question is standard policy. Smith's filing to Cannon on Friday included 12 pages of Trump's online about the FBI deadly force claim, along with another from X account PatriotTakes, which describes itself, in part, as \"researchers monitoring and exposing right-wing extremism.\" The latter said former adviser had claimed that \"the Mar-a-Lago FBI classified document search was 'an attempted assassination' by Joen Biden on Trump and his associates.\" Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.

        "content": "OTTAWA (Reuters) -Canada said on Monday it would grant temporary visas to 5,000 Gaza residents under a special program for Canadians' relatives living in the war-torn enclave, a preparatory move in case they are able to leave in the future. That figure is an increase from the 1,000 temporary resident visas allotted under a special program for Gaza announced in December, the immigration ministry said in a statement, adding that many people had expressed interest. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time. With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves,\" Immigration Minister Marc Miller said. The minister has previously said leaving Gaza is extremely difficult and dependent on approval from Israel. In one of its latest attacks, an Israeli airstrike triggered a massive blaze killing 45 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, officials said on Monday, prompting an outcry from global leaders. Canada has been sharing the names of Gaza residents who have passed preliminary screening to local authorities to secure their exit, Miller said. Israel and Egypt are important to the program's efforts toward reuniting families in Canada, the minister said. A spokesperson for Miller said 448 Gazans had been issued a temporary visa, including 254 under a public policy, and 41 have arrived in Canada so far. Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive in Gaza, according to the local health ministry, and an estimated 1.7 million people, more than 75% of Gaza's population, have been displaced, according to the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA. Israel launched its military campaign after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Rafah strike.

        "description": "Temperatures in Pakistan's Sindh province soared above 52 degrees Celsius, the highest so far this summer and nearly breaking the national record during an ongoing heatwave, according to the meteorological office on Monday.",
        "content": "Temperatures in Pakistan's Sindh province soared above 52 degrees Celsius, the highest so far this summer and nearly breaking the national record during an ongoing heatwave, according to the meteorological office on Monday. A team of international scientists said that the extreme temperatures across Asia in the past month were likely worsened by human-caused climate change. In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh famous for ancient archaeological sites from the Indus Valley Civilization around 2500 BC, temperatures reached 52.2 C (126 F) in the last 24 hours, says Shahid Abbas from the Pakistan Meteorological Department. This is the highest temperature recorded this summer, close to the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively. Mohenjo Daro, a small town with very hot summers, mild winters, and little rainfall, usually has busy markets with bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers. However, the current heatwave has kept customers away. Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town, said, \"Customers aren't coming because of the extreme heat. I sit here with empty tables and chairs.\" He added that he takes multiple baths a day for some relief, but the lack of power makes the heat unbearable. Nearby, Abdul Khaliq, 30, who runs an electronic repair shop, also struggled with the heat, working with his shop's shutter half-closed to block the sun. Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed noted that residents have adapted to the extreme heat by staying indoors or near water. Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s climate coordinator, said at a news conference that Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to climate change. She mentioned that the government is running awareness campaigns because of the heatwaves, noting the country has experienced above-normal rains and floods. Pakistan's highest recorded temperature was 54 C (129.2 F) in Turbat, Balochistan, in 2017, making it the second hottest in Asia and the fourth highest in the world, said Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz. Although the heatwave in Mohenjo Daro is expected to subside, another is predicted to hit other parts of Sindh, including Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan.",

        "description": "Analysis: The decline in foreign capital flowing into Israel marks a critical juncture for the nation's economic future; unlike the robust recoveries in the United States and Europe, Israel's ongoing downturn highlights the urgency of addressing this issue",
        "content": "In the bustling landscape of global venture funding, Israel's diminishing share raises red flags, signaling a potential crisis for the nation's economy. As Q1 2024 figures reveal a surge in global investment, Israel is heading in the opposite direction. Even as growth equity begins to recover globally, Israeli VC investments peaked at $29 billion in 2021 but then dropped significantly to $17 billion in 2022, $7.3 billion in 2023, and are currently (in 2024) on a $5 billion run. 3 The high-tech industry faces difficult times as party ends Photo: Yuval Chen While the global economy shows significant signs of recovery, Israel's trajectory is lagging. The disparity becomes evident when comparing IPO figures. In Q1 2024, the United States witnessed IPOs soar to $5.67 billion, a 100% increase from the previous year. Similarly, Europe experienced a notable surge, with IPOs escalating from $1.3 billion to $8.1 billion (720% growth). In contrast, Israel reported zero IPOs in 2024, a decline of 100%, indicating that while other regions are recovering, Israel is not. Beneath the surface, troubling trends from the largest foreign investors tell an even more alarming tale. In 2021, Japanese investment in the Israeli tech sector surged to roughly $3 billion. SoftBank Group Corp., a Japanese multinational holding company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, engaged in a significant number of deals in Israel, with twelve in 2021, four in 2022, and three in 2023. Since October 7, SoftBank has suspended deals in Israel but has closed nine deals in the US, Europe, and Canada. Similarly, Koch Investments, based in Wichita, Kansas, has refrained entirely from engaging in deals within Israel since October 7, mirroring the Japanese trend. Despite closing four deals with Israel in 2023 (and additional deals worth billions of dollars prior to 2023), Koch has redirected its focus since October 7, closing four substantial deals outside of Israel in the United States, Europe, and Canada and zero in Israel. Rapid decline in foreign capital since October 7 Before October 7, 2023, Israel witnessed a steady increase in passenger traffic. However, the aftermath of geopolitical tensions heightened by Iran’s attack has dealt a severe blow to the nation's inflow of foreign visitors. Despite efforts to resume normalcy, airlines like United (the most important travel proxy for American businesspeople coming to Israel) continue to suspend flights to Israel. Since October 7, United maintained flights to Israel only during a brief period in March and April 2024. 3 Hamas terrorists breach the border fence on October 7 Photo: Reuters The 2023 Annual Report on the State of High-Tech highlighted that Israeli high-tech accounted for 18% of the country's GDP and nearly half of its exports. Over the past decade, the sector's growth has been exponential, cementing its pivotal role in the nation's economic landscape. Understanding the importance of the sector to the Israeli economy, the Israeli government established the \"Yozma (Initiative) Fund”. The fund aims to co-invest alongside Israeli institutional investors in local venture capital funds, expand funding, and increase local capital's influence and stability in the high-tech sector. By reducing dependence on foreign capital, the fund seeks to enhance stability, especially during crises. However, according to discussions with the CIOs of leading institutional investors, there is little if no interest in participating in the 30% free leverage program offered by the Yozma Fund. 3 Photo: Shutterstock Despite government efforts to jump-start the tech sector, there has been a rapid decline in foreign capital since October 7. According to recent estimates, there are only $200mm-$300mm of dry powder (cash) left in Israel to support the vital tech sector (out of the $2.4BN raised in the past five quarters). Nonetheless, efforts have been made by venture capital firms and foreign investors to increase capital flow into Israel. Several firms have launched their own emergency fund initiatives, offering investment opportunities to their investors (without the usual management fee structure). Varana Capital’s Chai Fund, the largest October 7 emergency fund, has raised $30mm. Another fund had raised a modest $14mm for its no-fee resilience fund (despite its relatively large database of approximately 225,000 accredited investors on its distribution platform). While commendable, the amounts raised are insufficient to sustain the current tech sector in Israel. How to avoid the impending crash We have spoken to and are in constant communication with numerous foreign and local investors. We have also been involved in discussions with the Government and Government-backed investment entity, The Israeli Innovation Authority. The situation is terribly bleak. Foreign investors have disappeared from Israel, and the Government funds dedicated to investment post-October 7th are not sufficient. We must get investors back into Israel to avoid this impending crash. We believe that there are significant opportunities, in fact, the most attractive deals we have seen anywhere since the Global Financial Crisis, where there was much more financial and business risk than today in Israel. Our opportunity fund is still open to investors and, while gaining significant traction, cannot alone fill the hole of many billions of dollars missing from the market due to the flight of other foreign investment firms. Without sufficient funding, many of Israel’s emerging technology companies may be doomed Jonathan Nesher, a US-based M&A and Corporate Finance partner with the international law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP (BCLP), also expressed his concern for Israel’s emerging companies, stating that “there has been a noticeable decline in cross-border transactions with Israeli companies. Stabilization and positive resolution of the current geopolitical issues are crucial to the survival of Israel's emerging company sector. Companies cannot survive in limbo indefinitely.” Israel's downward trajectory of incoming foreign capital highlights a critical moment for the nation's economic future. The contrast between the robust recoveries seen in the United States and Europe and Israel's continuing decline underscores the urgency of the situation. Addressing this issue requires concerted efforts from policymakers, investors, and the tech ecosystem to reinvigorate the nation's investment appeal. Without swift and strategic action, Israel risks falling further behind in the competitive global market, jeopardizing its position as a leading innovation hub.

        "content": "OTTAWA — Immigration Minister Marc Miller is increasing the number of applications that will be processed under a much-criticized program to reunite Palestinians with Canadian relatives. The move comes as he testifies about measures introduced months ago that were meant to bring relatives of Canadians from conflict zones in the Gaza Strip and Sudan to safety. The Gaza program initially had a cap of 1,000 applications that could be \"accepted into processing,\" but Miller is now increasing that number to 5,000, each of which can include multiple family members. Palestinian Canadians have complained about inconsistent messaging and onerous requirements that left people unable to leave Gaza before Israel effectively closed access to Egypt. Civil war in Sudan broke out last spring, yet family members say officials expect their relatives will not reach Canada until the end of this year, citing delays with fingerprinting and other biometric requirements Miller is providing a briefing about both programs today at the House of Commons immigration committee. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it has issued 179 temporary-resident permits through the Gaza program as of April 29, but the department doesn't know whether anyone has actually reached Canada. In a statement, Miller said that Canada has been sending the names of approved temporary residents to Israeli and Egyptian authorities, even though they can't currently exit the Gaza Strip. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time,\" Miller said. \"With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves.\" There continue to be reports of Palestinians paying thousands of dollars to cross into Egypt amid uncertainty over their resettlement status. Relatives in Canada say they were given mixed information from Ottawa about whether those who paid to cross could still access the Canadian program. The Gaza program involves temporary residency permits, while the Sudan program is for permanent residency. The NDP has accused the government of bungling both programs, and not learning from other conflict situations, such as the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 27, 2024. The Canadian Press",

Miller speaks during an announcement in the Foyer of the House of Commons, in Ottawa, Thursday, May 23, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld OTTAWA — Immigration Minister Marc Miller is increasing the number of applications that will be processed under a much-criticized program to reunite Palestinians with Canadian relatives. The move comes as he testifies about measures introduced months ago that were meant to bring relatives of Canadians from conflict zones in the Gaza Strip and Sudan to safety. The Gaza program initially had a cap of 1,000 applications that could be \"accepted into processing,\" but Miller is now increasing that number to 5,000, each of which can include multiple family members. Palestinian Canadians have complained about inconsistent messaging and onerous requirements that left people unable to leave Gaza before Israel effectively closed access to Egypt. Civil war in Sudan broke out last spring, yet family members say officials expect their relatives will not reach Canada until the end of this year, citing delays with fingerprinting and other biometric requirements Miller is providing a briefing about both programs today at the House of Commons immigration committee. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada says it has issued 179 temporary-resident permits through the Gaza program as of April 29, but the department doesn't know whether anyone has actually reached Canada. In a statement, Miller said that Canada has been sending the names of approved temporary residents to Israeli and Egyptian authorities, even though they can't currently exit the Gaza Strip. \"While movement out of Gaza is not currently possible, the situation may change at any time,\" Miller said. \"With this cap increase, we will be ready to help more people as the situation evolves.\" There continue to be reports of Palestinians paying thousands of dollars to cross into Egypt amid uncertainty over their resettlement status. Relatives in Canada say they were given mixed information from Ottawa about whether those who paid to cross could still access the Canadian program. The Gaza program involves temporary residency permits, while the Sudan program is for permanent residency. The NDP has accused the government of bungling both programs, and not learning from other conflict situations, such as the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021.

Despite the achievement, Riveiro said in his post-match press conference, that they will not be celebrating finishing second, with full understanding that finishing 23 points behind number one, Sundowns, is not good enough for the Soweto giants. \"I think we shouldn't undermine what it means to be in the Champions League but (we're) not celebrating being second, we're celebrating to be in the Champions League, we've got the right to be there and it's something very important for the club,\" Riveiro told journalists at Orlando Stadium. \"But being second, 23 points behind the first one is not a huge achievement. So that's our objective from now, how can we reduce that gap with whoever is there leading the log. It's too much distance between the second and second position. \"Even though we're fighting with the team that is not famous for dropping points frequently, the things that we can control, the things in our hands like last two games, having the possibility to consolidate the second spot and giving away the points that we gave, it's something we need to do a reflection,\" he said. \"To understand why, because it's our responsibility and like I said, celebrate the Champions League spot but obviously not celebrating that we're second, 23 points away from the first,\" the Spanish coach added. Last season Pirates also finished second, 16 points behind the Tshwane giants. The Brazilians and the Buccaneers will meet in the Nedbank Cup final on Saturday afternoon at Mbombela Stadium.",

        "content": "Daily Post Nigeria BREAKING: Military finally reopens Banex Plaza in Abuja Home News Politics Metro Entertainment Sport News BREAKING: Military finally reopens Banex Plaza in Abuja Published on May 27, 2024 By Francis Ugwu The Nigerian military has reopened the popular Banex Plaza in Wuse 2 area of Abuja for business after over a week of siege on the market. According to Daily Trust, the plaza resumed operations around 2:30pm on Monday. DAILY POST reported that the market was sealed by military authorities on May 18, following a violent clash between traders and military personnel. Trouble started when thugs allegedly beat up some soldiers who had a disagreement with a trader in the plaza. The trader had reportedly sold a bad phone to someone who invited soldiers. The police stepped in to resolve the situation, but soldiers later stormed the plaza, forcing traders to shut down immediately. Human rights activists, including Femi Falana, SAN, civil society organisations, among others had condemned the military action.

        "content": "Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner start French Open with straight-set victories PARIS (AP) — Iga Swiatek has started her bid for a third consecutive French Open title with a straightforward 6-1, 6-2 victory over Leolia Jeanjean. Monday's win stretched Swiatek's winning streak to 13 matches. She put together an overwhelming 26-2 edge in winners and had just one, brief blip at Court Philippe Chatrier: She got broken to trail 1-0 in the second set. But after nine unforced errors in the initial two games of that set, Swiatek made only two the rest of the way en route to a 15th consecutive win at Roland Garros. Jannik Sinner also won in straight sets Monday. Newgarden goes back-to-back at Indy 500 to give Roger Penske record-extending 20th win INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Josef Newgarden put his cheating scandal behind him to become the first back-to-back winner of the Indianapolis 500 since Helio Castroneves 22 years ago and give Roger Penske a record-extending 20th win in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.” The Tennessean passed Pato O’Ward on the final lap of Sunday’s rain-delayed race to become the first driver to win consecutive 500s since Castroneves did it for Penske in 2001 and 2002. And just like last year, Newgarden stopped his Chevrolet-powered car on the track and climbed through a hole in the fence to celebrate with fans in the grandstands. O’Ward slumped his head over his steering wheel in bitter disappointment. He was trying to become the first Mexican in 108 runnings to win the Indy 500. Kyle Larson's bid to run The Double ends in disappointment after bad weather intervenes CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only the single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s goal to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday and join Tony Stewart as only drivers to complete all 1,100 laps did not go nearly as planned. He finished 18th at Indianapolis after a pair of rookie mistakes. He arrived in Charlotte to run the NASCAR race but never got to turn a lap after the race was ended early because of rain. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving each score 33 points as Mavs beat Wolves for 3-0 lead in West finals DALLAS (AP) — Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving scored 33 points apiece and the Dallas Mavericks made all the big plays late again, beating the Minnesota Timberwolves 116-107 for a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference finals. The Mavericks went on a 14-3 run to finish the game, winning their fifth consecutive playoff game. No team in NBA playoff history has rallied from 3-0 down. Game 4 is Tuesday night in Dallas. Anthony Edwards had 26 points for the Wolves, but just four after scoring eight consecutive Minnesota points to get the Wolves even in the third quarter. Braves' Acuña is placed on IL after suffering a 2nd season-ending knee injury in 4 years ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Braves have placed outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. on the 10-day injured list after the reigning NL MVP suffered a season-ending torn ACL in his left knee. Acuña suffered the injury during the Braves’ 8-1 win at Pittsburgh on Sunday. The Braves announced Sunday night that an MRI showed a complete ACL tear that will require season-ending surgery. This is Acuña’s second season-ending knee injury. He tore his right ACL in July 2021. Acuña was named the NL MVP last season after hitting .337 with 41 homers, 106 RBIs and 73 stolen bases. Rafael Nadal's possible French Open farewell draws fans from all over the world PARIS (AP) — Rafael Nadal's fans have traveled from all over to be at Roland Garros for what might be his last French Open match this year. Or ever. The 14-time champion in Paris was scheduled to play Monday in Court Philippe Chatrier against No. 4 seed Alexander Zverev. And the spectators wanted to be present for what felt like a monumental occasion. They were there to see Nadal compete, of course, but also to salute him as a player and person, to congratulate him on a remarkable career and, perhaps, to catch one final glimpse of his greatness at a tournament that has helped define his legacy. Wennberg scores in OT, Rangers top Panthers 5-4 to take lead in East finals SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — Alex Wennberg deflected home a goal 5:35 into overtime, and the New York Rangers reclaimed home-ice advantage in the Eastern Conference finals with a 5-4 win over the Florida Panthers in Game 3 on Sunday. Ryan Lindgren took a shot from the left point and Wennberg — in front of the Florida net — redirected it past Sergei Bobrovsky to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the series. Igor Shesterkin made 33 stops, while Alexis Lafrenière scored two goals and Barclay Goodrow continued his surprising playoff barrage with two more scores for the Rangers. Sam Reinhart had two power-play goals, while Aleksander Barkov and Gustav Forsling also scored for the Panthers. Christopher Bell wins the rain-shortened Coca-Cola 600 for his 8th NASCAR Cup victory CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Christopher Bell won the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday at Charlotte Motor Speedway after the race was called with 151 laps remaining in a race that was halted for more than two hours because of rain. Bell led a race-high 90 laps to win his eighth career Cup Series race, and his first Coca-Cola 600. Brad Keselowski finished second, William Byron was third, Tyler Reddick was fourth and Denny Hamlin rounded out the top five. The race was red-flagged just as Kyle Larson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway from the Indianapolis 500 to take over driving the Hendrick Motorsports’ No. 5 Chevrolet. As Dallas competes for NBA and NHL crowns, the Texas Rangers are struggling with their title defense The Texas Rangers host the Arizona Diamondbacks this week in a rematch of last year’s World Series. Both teams are under .500, costing the matchup some of its luster. For the Rangers, injuries to prominent starting pitchers are just part of the problem. Jacob deGrom and Max Scherzer haven’t pitched at all this year. Nathan Eovaldi and Jon Gray are on the injured list now as well. Despite all that, Texas’ starters have an ERA of 3.65. But the bullpen has the second-worst ERA in the game at 5.09. Grayson Murray's parents say the two-time PGA Tour winner died of suicide Grayson Murray’s parents say their 30-year-old son took his own life. Murray died on Saturday, one day after he withdrew from a PGA Tour event at Colonial. Eric and Terry Murray are asking for privacy and that people honor Murray by being kind to one another. His death comes at a time when Murray appeared to be on track with his life and his golf. He has been open about his struggles with mental health and alcoholism. He said when he won the Sony Open in January that he had been sober for the last eight months.",

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average comprises 30 blue-chip stocks that most investors are familiar with. It’s an index that investors use to gauge the position of the stock market as a whole, similar to the Nasdaq and S&P 500 . The Dow has risen by 18% over this past year; earlier last week, it reached 40,000 for the first time. The Dow’s rise to 40,000 was mostly due to the stocks I mentioned below. These companies have all performed very well this year due to impressive earnings, business expansion and growing customer bases. Investors should strongly consider investing in these very solid companies. Walmart (WMT) Walmart (NYSE: WMT ) is a retail chain with domestic and international locations. It offers various goods, including consumer staples, furniture, electronics, housewares, seasonal items, appliances and office supplies. It also operates Sam’s Club, a membership-driven warehouse club. Over the past year, Walmart’s share price has increased by 33%, reaching a new all-time high following its most recent earnings report, which beat analysts’ expectations. On May 16, Walmart reported earnings for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2025 , stating that total revenue increased by 6%, and its earnings per share tripled to sixty-three cents per share compared to the previous year. Its global eCommerce sales rose by 21% year-over-year, and its advertising business increased by 24% compared to last year. Walmart raised its outlook for the second quarter of FY 2025. It expects net sales to increase between 3.5% and 4.5%. Since its most recent earnings report, WMT stock has been up 9%. Walmart has announced that it will open or convert approximately 150 store locations within the next five years. Its new customer analytics platform, Luminate , will be rolling out among various Walmart locations in Mexico and Canada. Walmart is a strong Dow stock that has helped lead the index to new heights. The company has beat earnings expectations and is planning to open new store locations, which is exciting for investors. Caterpillar (CAT) Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT ) manufactures and sells construction equipment and heavy machinery. Its products include forestry machines, excavators, backhoes, tractors, hard rock vehicles, articulated trucks and diesel-electric locomotives. Over this past year, its share price has risen by 66%, making it one of the top leaders in the Dow recently. On Apr. 25, Caterpillar reported earnings for the first quarter of 2024 , stating that total revenue remained practically unchanged compared to the previous year. Earnings per share for the first quarter increased from three dollars and seventy-four cents to five and seventy-five cents year-over-year. CAT also announced that in the first quarter of 2024, it repurchased approximately $4.5 billion in total shares. Caterpillar offers a strong dividend yield of 1.49% on an annual basis. The most recent distribution to investors was one dollar and thirty cents per share, paid out on May 20. Caterpillar is a strong Dow stock buy due to solid earnings results, an impressive number of share buybacks, and share price appreciation. Investors are overall excited about CAT’s growth trajectory as one of the Dow leaders. American Express (AXP) American Express (NYSE: AXP ) is a consumer finance company that operates an integrated payment system domestically and internationally. AXP offers businesses and customers credit cards, charge cards, and other similar financial products. On April 19, American Express reported earnings for the first quarter of 2024 , stating that total revenue increased by 11% and net income rose by 34%. The press release also mentioned that 60% of new customers are Gen Z and Millennials. Since the first quarter earnings report, in which it beat analyst expectations, AXP’s stock has risen by 10%. American Express also gained approximately 3.4 million new cards during the first quarter. It reiterated its guidance for the remainder of 2024, in which it anticipates revenue growth to be between 9% and 11%. American Express is a must-buy for investors seeking exposure to stocks within the Dow. Due to its impressive returns over this past year of 58%, AXP is one of its top performers. Being one of its top performers, AXP offers upside potential regarding earnings. AXP’s growing customer base is of a younger generation, and its growth hinges upon whether AXP can continue to bring in and retain its new customers.

        "description": "Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double.",
        "content": "CONCORD, N.C. — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson's quest was to complete — if not win — the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. ''What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I've ever experienced,'' Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson's team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane, and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That's when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. ''So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,'' Larson said. ''I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.'' Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson's focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can't participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn't been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting ''The Double'' was one of the best experiences of his life — right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. ''I can't describe how appreciative I am of everyone's support of me to live out a dream,'' Larson said. ''I hope it's not the last opportunity I have to try 'The Double' but if it is I guess it was memorable.'' ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

        "content": "“How can I leave everything behind and go? My priority is relief work. Even if I am holding a meeting here, my heart goes out to those people (affected by the cyclone),” Mamata Banerjee said at the Kolkata rally. Published: May 27, 2024 9:49 PM IST By Edited by West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Monday said she will not attend the meeting of the INDIA bloc on June 1 due to the last phase of Lok Sabha polls and ongoing relief work after cyclone ‘Remal’ hit the state’s coastal regions. According to sources, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge has convened a meeting of the INDIA bloc leaders in the afternoon of June 1, coinciding with the last round of polling. Addressing an election rally in Kolkata, Banerjee mentioned her inability to attend the INDIA bloc meeting due to the scheduled elections in the state on that day. “The INDIA bloc meeting has been fixed on June 1. But I have already said I can’t go on June 1 as there is an election in our state on that day. So far I know there are elections in Punjab, UP and Bihar. Voting will continue till 6 pm, and at times it extends beyond that (6 pm),” she said. Banerjee highlighted the dual challenges of post-cyclone relief work and ongoing elections, emphasising her priority towards relief efforts. “How can I leave everything behind and go? My priority is relief work. Even if I am holding a meeting here, my heart goes out to those people (affected by the cyclone),” she said at the Kolkata rally. The TMC had withdrawn from the INDIA bloc in West Bengal in January but affirmed its commitment to remain part of the opposition alliance at the national level. During the election campaigns in the last two months, Banerjee had expressed confidence that the INDIA bloc would win the Lok Sabha elections and affirmed her involvement in the anti-BJP alliance at the national level. Sources in the TMC revealed that voting will be conducted on nine seats, including two seats in Kolkata, in West Bengal on June 1, which are crucial for the party.

        "content": "THE Supreme Court has directed the Commission on Elections and joint venture led by South Korea’s Miru Systems Co. Ltd. to comment on the petition seeking to enjoin the implementation of their P17.9-billion Automated Election System (AES) contract for the 2025 national and local elections. The Court gave the respondents 10 days from receipt of notice to file their respective comment on the petition and application for temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction filed by former Caloocan Representative Edgar Erice last April 18, according to a statement released by the SC Public Information Office. Erice’s petition primarily seeks to stop the poll body from implementing its February 21, 2024 resolution awarding the Full Automation System with Transparency Audit/Count (FASTrAC) contract to Miru and its partners St. Timothy Construction Corp. and Centerpoint Solutions Technologies. The former solon also ultimately prayed that the contract between the Comelec and Miru be declared null and void, and that the implementation of any other contract that the poll body may have entered into with the Korean firm, in connection with the incoming elections, be nullified. The petitioner argued that the deal violated the provisions of Republic Act (RA) 7369 or the Automated Election Law, particularly on the bidding procedures and the use of prototype machines during the election process. He claimed that the contract is highly disadvantageous to the government as it stands to lose around P10 billion in taxpayers money. Erice’s petition comes on the heels of the Court’s ruling in April which reversed the Comelec’s decision to disqualify Smartmatic-TIM Corporation from participating in the bidding process for the subject contract. Despite its decision favoring Smartmatic’s petition, the SC did not nullify the P17.9-billion contract that the Comelec inked with Miru. SC spokesman, lawyer Camille Sue Mae Ting, clarified that the validity of Miru’s contract with Comelec was not the issue presented in the case before the SC. She added the Court’s ruling was not tantamount to upholding Comelec’s contract with MIRU since it was not the issue decided upon by the magistrates.",

She insisted her child wasn't being \"malicious\" by accidentally hitting the fence. The woman mockingly referred to Renee as \"lovely\" and threatened to \"start recording\" her actions. Unfazed, Renee retorted with \"go ahead\", confident that the police have \"bigger fish to fry\". And in a final act of rebellion, she admitted to deliberately kicking the ball against the fence, taunting her neighbour with: \"And lastly, here's one f**king more.\" In the comments section, opinions were divided. Some sided with the neighbour, suggesting the mum should take her child to the park instead, with one comment stating: \"I'm with your neighbour on this one, take your kids to the park.\" Trending 'Neighbours from hell turned life at my dream retirement home into a nightmare' [LATEST] 'My nightmare neighbours cost me £2k and three years of hell after fake apology' [LATEST] My neighbour got petty revenge after I made innocent mistake mowing his lawn [LATEST] Another person recommended moving the goal to avoid disturbance, saying: \"If it's disturbing her, move the goal.

It's not worth the long-term bad vibes plus it probably does upset her pets.\" Others chimed in with remarks like \"It's not hard to be a considerate neighbour\", \"Just move the goal babe\", and \"That noise would drive me mental\". There was also a suggestion that the neighbour could have been \"more polite\" in their approach, but the consensus remained that the neighbour had a point.

        "content": "An expectant mum has revealed her husband 's controversial decision ahead of the birth of their child. Making time for friends while juggling the daily curveballs of parenthood is a difficult balancing act. But would you choose a boozy trip with the lads if it meant possibly missing the birth of your child? One man has done just this, leaving his heavily pregnant wife confused. The woman took to Mumsnet to reveal her husband goes away around the same time every year with his friends. This year, he's due to go on the very last weekend of May, leaving her alone at 38 weeks pregnant with a two-and-a-half-year-old toddler. With just 14 days until her due date, she's worried her water could break at any moment – but her husband doesn't seem to care. 'I caught my wife cheating with her female best friend in a soul-crushing way' \"I'm getting more and more upset,\" she said. \"I've tried to talk to him but he's 100% adamant he's going.\" \"Part of me doesn't grudge it, as he works so hard for our family and also helps me with my own business too. But I can't help but question our marriage, as he's basically risking missing the birth to get get drunk one weekend with his pals. \"He just keeps saying 'you were late [the] first time' and to stop worrying.\" Despite her husband's attempts to reassure her, the mum can't shake the feeling something is wrong. She asked: \"Am I being unreasonable?\" The anonymous post garnered dozens of comments, with many users outraged by the husband's 'selfish' decision. One person wrote: \"He sounds like a dedicated family man. Ugh!!!!! Selfish t***! Why the f*** is this weekend away arranged when you are due?\" Another added: \"That's ridiculous! Get some help lined up just in case.\" Meanwhile some were more sympathetic to the dad's plight. \"How far away is it?\" asked one. \"If he’s able to get back quickly then I wouldn’t have an issue, but far away and drinking then no, he shouldn’t be going. It wouldn’t be fair on you so close to the due date and you have a toddler too.\" A fourth chimed in: \"If he misses the birth, he misses the birth ... that’s something he will need to live with. Please don’t make yourself stressed, ill, or worried so close to your due date. Make plans for what will happen if he is not there, and focus your energy on that.\" What do you think?

        "description": "CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double.",
        "content": "CONCORD, N.C. (AP) — Kyle Larson spent a year preparing to run the double. Instead, he got to run only a single, leaving the NASCAR star beyond disappointed. Larson’s quest was to complete — if not win — the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, joining Tony Stewart as the only drivers to do all 1,100 laps in a single day. But then rain intervened not once but twice, and a rookie mistake at the Indy 500 cost him a chance to contend in the one race he ran. “What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I’ve ever experienced,” Larson said on social media Monday, roughly 12 hours after storms in Charlotte prevented him from climbing into his No. 5 car to finish the NASCAR race. When rain pushed back the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, Larson's team made the decision to stay and run the race. He made a mistake going through gears at one point, costing him 10 spots, and his pit-road speeding penalty ended any chance of winning. He wound up finishing 18th. The 31-year-old Larson tried to make the best of a bad situation, taking two helicopters and a private jet to reach Concord with the Cup Series race just past the halfway point. The crowd cheered his arrival on pit lane , and Larson donned his race helmet and readied to get into the No. 5 Chevrolet. That's when the race went under caution, and a steady downpour forced a red flag. Two hours later, NASCAR declared race leader Christopher Bell the winner with 151 laps remaining, saying there was no way to dry the track and resume racing until after 1 a.m. because of the humidity. Larson never took a lap at Charlotte. “So much time, money and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did,” Larson said. “I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling.” Larson said he was disappointed for car owner Rick Hendrick, apologized to his race team in Indianapolis for his mistakes and expressed frustration for the documentary crew that had followed his eight-month journey but was robbed of a great story by storms in two different states. Larson's focus now returns to NASCAR and attempting to win his second Cup Series championship. NASCAR rules stipulate a driver can't participate in the postseason without running every race. That means Hendrick Motorsports will need to file a waiver on behalf of Larson, asking for special permission for the 2021 season champion to race in the playoffs. That hasn't been done yet, but given the attention Larson brought to the sport over the last few weeks, it is almost unfathomable that the governing body would not grant one. Last year, NASCAR gave Chase Elliott the opportunity to make the playoffs after he was suspended for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin in the Coca-Cola 600. Despite rain that washed out much of Indy 500 practice, Larson said attempting “The Double” was one of the best experiences of his life — right up until Sunday. And afterward, Larson expressed his desire to try it again; Hendrick Motorsports and Arrow McLaren have a two-year deal to field a car. “I can’t describe how appreciative I am of everyone’s support of me to live out a dream,” Larson said. “I hope it’s not the last opportunity I have to try ‘The Double’ but if it is I guess it was memorable.” AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing",

        "description": "Erik ten Hag remains in the dark as to whether he will be replaced at Old Trafford this summer",
        "content": "Sport | Football Manchester United have reportedly made contact with Roberto De Zerbi as they consider a managerial change, with it increasingly likely that Kieran McKenna will stay at Ipswich. A decision has not yet been made on Erik ten Hag ’s future at Old Trafford, ahead of an end-of-season review taking place this week to decide if winning the FA Cup is enough for the Dutchman to keep his job, after a campaign in which the club finished eighth in the Premier League. Initial talks have been held with the representatives of a number of managers, in case United do look to make a change this summer, and McKenna was believed to be high on the club’s wishlist, after leading Ipswich into the top-flight with back-to-back promotions. However, The Athletic report that McKenna, who was also previously in contention for the Chelsea job, is now expected to sign a new long-term contract with Ipswich, despite interest from United and Brighton. McKenna was assistant to Jose Mourinho at United and then worked under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, further strengthening suggestions that he could favour a return to Old Trafford, but that now appears to be off the cards and his former employers will have to look elsewhere if they do decide to replace Ten Hag. Discussions are understood to have already taken place with Mauricio Pochettino , available after leaving Chelsea at the end of the season, and Brentford boss Thomas Frank , who was also strongly considered to replace Pochettino at Stamford Bridge. The Blues are expected to appoint Leicester manager Enzo Maresca. According to the Daily Mail, De Zerbi has now been sounded out by United, after the Italian parted ways with Brighton. The 44-year-old received significant praise during his time in charge of the Seagulls, leading the club into Europe for the first time in their history and playing an attractive style of football. It is suggested, however, that De Zerbi’s desire for control over recruitment could prove problematic, with United putting an extensive team in place off the pitch since Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s arrival at the club. Pochettino and Frank still remain options, if Ten Hag is sacked, with Thomas Tuchel also a possibility. The German left Bayern Munich after a frustrating campaign, and is set to be replaced by Burnley’s Vincent Kompany in a surprise move.

        "description": "India is set to play five Tests at the Perth Stadium, Adelaide Oval, Gabba, Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) from November 22 to January 7.",
        "content": "Discussing the upcoming 2024-25 Border Gavaskar Trophy, Australia great Matthew Hayden here said that the Australian team is in a transition period and vulnerable at the top, with the need for a new opening batter to replace David Warner. “Well, it’s a time in Australian cricket where it’s a transition period. And so, we’re vulnerable at the top. I was very forthright in saying this, Steve Smith should never have been the opening batter for Australia. And I still believe that’s the case. “So, we are on the lookout for, I believe, another opening batter to replace the great David Warner, who’s had an exceptional career. He really, I feel, built on the legacy that JL (Justin Langer) and I created in our period. He went better. Whereas our strike rate was 65 to 70, Dave Warner was 80 and sometimes more,” he said during the panel discussion on the India-Australia cricket with the legendary Sunil Gavaskar and former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh at the launch of the Australia-India ‘Summer of Cricket,’ organised by the Australian Consulate in partnership with Cricket Australia (CA) and the Centre for Australia-India Relations. “It’s really a battle of the top order. And Australian cricket has put itself in a position where it’s kind of got no further games to really anticipate what it’s going to look like ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. So, that’s the only question mark. If I were to do a SWOT analysis on us as a group, that would be my only question mark,” he added. India is set to play five Tests at the Perth Stadium, Adelaide Oval, Gabba, Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), and Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) from November 22 to January 7. “I’ve played in three-match series and that’s not enough. Four’s an awkward number. You can’t get your teeth into it. But five has just got it all on the line. “You can get behind in the series. You can come back in the series. And that’s why the Ashes, which has now been reduced to five or six, is still a great series. Because it sways in roundabouts. And you have to be up for it because it’s a long tour,” said Hayden. Asked for his wish list for the series, Gavaskar said: “My wish list is, obviously, India should continue to be winning us three in Australia - twice they’ve won now, and so for the third time as well. “Hope it’s a good, close series with the matches going into the fifth day. A lot of Test matches finish in three-and-a-half, four days. A five-day Test would be fantastic for everybody concerned. I just hope that happens because that means that it won’t be one-sided. It will mean that the balance of power will move from day one to day two. “Test matches in the earlier days used to be like an Indian soap. So, on the first day, the mother-in-law is the boss; on the second day, the daughter-in-law is the boss, and on the third day, the mother-in-law is the boss. That’s what happens in Indian TV serials. Something like that you want to see, where Australia and India keep on dominating for four days alternately, and maybe on the fifth day the team that has really got that greater desire goes out and wins. That would be, obviously, the wish list, and all five Test matches should have a result. That would be absolutely fantastic. In the 1977 India-Australia series, Australia won 3-2. You just want that kind of a situation where you have a result in every game. “On an individual level, maybe for Virat Kohli, who’s got four centuries on four different venues, that he becomes the third overseas player who’s scored a century in all the Australian venues. I think he doesn’t have one at the Gabba. I think he’s got it everywhere else. So if he gets a century at the Gabba, that means he joins me and Alastair Cook as the third overseas batter to have got a century at all the Australian venues. That would be fantastic. Because, if he gets runs, India will get a lot of runs as well.” When asked for his prediction for the series, Hayden said: “Just to sum this up, I’ll paint out what it’s going to look like. Australia is gonna win the first Test in Perth. So, drop-in wicket, but it’s about 12 mm grass that your (Indian) top-order can look forward to; 12mm of very bright green grass. (Josh) Hazlewood, (Pat) Cummins, and (Mitchell) Starc will bother you with pace. And for (Nathan) Lyon, I guess, the ball will really bounce there as well. “Come across to Adelaide, Kuldeep will turn it. It’s a drop-in wicket as well. It also starts a little grassy, but what tends to happen is it tends to get footmarks and so you’ll win that game. “And then, you’ll come across to Brisbane and Australia will win that Test match, because it’s just one of those venues which is classically in favour of us. “So, now you’ve come to Melbourne, and India comes back hard. You saw the passion and the rivalry at that (2020) Test match. That venue is home to well over 700,000 expats. That’ll be Australia’s away game. It’s the only away game that Australia will actually play. “So, now you’re 2-all up, then you go to Sydney and that’s when eyeballs start to meet and rivalry starts to happen. Because everyone’s tight. Conditions not being drop-in, they start to then become fierce. Whoever starts that Test match really well, will find it hard to also lose the Test match because once you get into day three, day four, and in particular day five, it’s a batting graveyard. It becomes really hard to score. Sometimes, it’s tricky in the middle couple of days, but often it’s very hard to score. “So, I’m going to just leave it 2-all, and I’m going to hedge my bets into that fifth Test match because I can’t wait to see that one. That’s my favourite Test match when India tours Australia because it does turn and the wicket becomes a little tricky to bat on as well.” Comments Related Topics",
